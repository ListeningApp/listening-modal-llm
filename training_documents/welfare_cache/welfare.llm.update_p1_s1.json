Increasing efficiency through private sector methods has been a strong driver behind many N P M-type reforms, and N P G ideas are reflected in intentions to make the administration more user-friendly, holistic, and cooperative. Although the type and character of reform differ per country, an important common setting was the policy shift to 'activation' since the nineteen nineties, implying a change in focus from well-being to work, with a reduction of social expenditure and more flexibility of the labour market as important objectives. 'Activation policies' often have been associated with shared governance characteristics, such as one-stop agencies, decentralisation, quasi-markets for service provision, reduced influence of social partners, performance management, and the individualisation of social interventions. Given the common premise of 'activation', convergence in developing similarities\n0b39 | in structures and processes of welfare administrations can be expected after three decades. Nevertheless, national institutional contexts may influence reform trajectories and lead to a (re)confirmation of differences between states.\nqecd | In this paper, we examine to what extent convergence and/or divergence occurs in reform of the welfare state administration, which we broadly define as administration and delivery of employment services, social services, and the benefit system. Unlike many studies with a shorter time horizon, we take a longitudinal, comparative approach, studying reforms in two countries over three decades. The paper takes the following questions as a starting point for discussion of the reforms: What are the relationships and tensions between N P M and N P G, and how do we see these models reflected in the reforms in two welfare administrations? Is there growing convergence or divergence in the reform process and in current systems, and how can these tendencies be explained? We first discuss how such questions are more generally addressed in literature on public sector reform. Then we examine the reform trajectories and their consequences for the present welfare administrations, in particular on two key themes: the relationship between central and decentralized governance (levels), and the role and position of key stakeholders (e.g. clients, social partners). We do this by examining two of the largest public sector reforms in Norway and the Netherlands. With the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration in Norway, two thousand six, and the Structure of the Administration of Work and Income, S U W I, in the Netherlands, two thousand two, both countries chose for a major change of their institutional framework for public welfare and employment services.\n1o7p | Next, we review literature on public sector reform to develop our analytical framework. We provide an overview of the methods and dataset as the basis of our empirical analysis. Our\ncp13 | findings are presented in two steps: we analyse the reform paths in Norway and the Netherlands over the past three decades, and then compare their impact on the present welfare administrations. Finally, we draw the lessons from the reforms in the two countries, and relate our findings to theory on public sector reform.\nbgre | Theoretical context\n57lp | Literature on public sector reform distinguishes alternative, ideal-type governance models, including: the traditional model of public administration, new public management and the new public governance, also called network governance.\nukth | The traditional model has been characterized by a strict hierarchy, with permanent and neutral civil servants, who implement public policies that are determined solely by politics. Top-down planning, central regulation and control, and a high level of professional expertise are main elements of the 'traditional model' that remained the most successful management model in the public sector for more than a century. Since the early nineteen eighties, many countries have moved away from some of its principles and aimed to replace traditional public administration for a rigid bureaucracy based on procedures rather than a focus on results. In the economic crisis of the nineteen seventies and eighties and an expanding welfare state, more efficiency and manageability were sought and alternative models have emerged.\nkpvt | The well-known alternative new public management model is a doctrine for a more efficient, cheaper public sector that is more responsive to its citizens, 'customers.' New public management imported business concepts, such as management targets for performance, output measurement, and contracts as main forms of coordination rather than hierarchical relationships. It combined a central role for management with disaggregated organizational forms, such as business units and executive\njie2 | organisations, and introduced market mechanisms such as competitive tenders and performance rankings. New public management has been very influential but showed huge variation and also received much criticism. Its emphasis on private sector methods has been contested and new public management is criticized for centralized decision making by public managers, rather than supporting decentralization in public organizations as it claims.\nd0ik | New public governance, as a post-new public management model, promotes horizontal coordination between government and non-state actors to enhance broader legitimacy, support and resources for policy and implementation. New public governance is often viewed a response to new public management shortcomings, but has its roots in older collaborative and network-based approaches. In new public governance, the pursuit of shared goals is central. Important elements are a holistic view of social problems, collaborative structures and joint leadership with cross-border skills. Klenk and Reiter reveal that \"the post-new public management idea has been very influential as an 'ideational weapon' to indicate a crisis of the new public management model,\" but they question a (large) practical impact of the post-new public management ideas.\n0x0s | The origins of the three models have been situated as sequential in time, traditional public administration, new public management, new public governance, but empirical studies indicate that newer models are added to prior ones rather than replace them. The result of the subsequent reforms is then an increasing hybridization, where various governance principles are used at the same time. Studies of hybrid public organisations show that principles derived from alternative reform models are not automatically well aligned. Tensions have been identified between new public management and new public governance due to mutual incompatibility; in particular between simultaneous aims for competition and collaboration.
