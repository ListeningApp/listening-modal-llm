At this conference, entanglements between human and nonhuman death emerged, again, as a central theme. The growing COVID-nineteen pandemic inflected much of the conversation at the conference, but presenters on our panel shed light on the ways in which individuals, governments and other interest groups negotiate with non-pandemic forms of dying, including the disappearance of loved ones, the loss of a child before birth, the inability to care for oneself due to dementia, the planned eradication of an invasive plant, the successive extinction of multiple species, and the death of a river or lake. While we all must face our own inevitable deaths, we also encounter the countless deaths of others throughout our lives. By meeting the messiness of death and dying, we, as scholars, hope to stay with the complexity of loss, grief, relief, struggle and release that attend our many encounters with the demise and cessation of all lives.\nyeoh | After a successful four-S conference we were approached by a publisher other than Bristol University Press about possibly creating an edited volume around the topics explored in our panel. Having enjoyed working together, and feeling now some optimistic momentum, we were keen to explore the possibility of editing a volume together. Our call for proposals was met by over fifty submissions, indicating considerable interest in the subject matter of our call. We deliberated collectively about which press we should approach with a book proposal, and settled on Bristol University Press, to which the 'Death and Culture' series had recently moved.\nb8hf | Framing this book\nhntf | This book explores the social meanings and materialities of death and dying by attending to death as a state, an event, a process, and as a site for political, scientific, medical, environmental and ethical negotiations regarding the significance of mortality. But across all these investments, the book underscores the relationality of death, for the primary motivation behind this project is to articulate (both in the sense of stating and in the sense or establishing connections between) new forms of deathly concern that affect not only humans but the entire earth system and that necessitate new thinking and interdisciplinary exchange for situating death, and human relationships to it, in more-than-human terms.\n99fo | Death studies typically take the death of the human subject as its object of study, thereby overlooking the wider networks of relations involved in social and natural processes surrounding death. Yet, as the COVID-nineteen pandemic and the climate crisis have shown, human death intermingles with microorganisms, environmental conditions, developments in science\ny5r7 | and medicine, and more. Additionally, as a result of anthropogenic changes to the planet Earth, humans must also deal with the nonhuman deaths we cause and the complicated material, emotional and practical consequences that the loss of nonhuman creatures and entities may entail. While death as a more-than-human affair - as a category built upon human emotions and knowledge, as well as human relationships with technologies, more-than-human beings and socio-ecological environments - has existed at the margins of death studies research, we see more scholarly attention devoted to the ecological, material and queer aspects of death and dying. For instance, the recent emergence of queer death studies challenges the primacy of human death as the only kind of death of interest as well as focuses on the 'necropolitics' surrounding the dead. Scholars working in this arena explore 'queer' bonds between the living and dead as well as 'queer' this relationship. They point to the epistemological and symbolic violence that marks some deaths as more valuable than others. Additionally, scholars working in extinction studies look beyond the death of the individual human to explore how species extinctions - driven by humans - complicate and transform understandings of death, time and generations. While others working on environmental issues continue to explore the degradation of environments, the poisonous toxicities and wastes that infiltrate human and other creatures' bodies, and the political, social and cultural moves which make some lives 'killable'. In the natural sciences, additional philosophical and conceptual conversations that define life as ecosystemic rather than organismic or as flows of energy masses also present unique formulations for application by scholars researching dying and death. Each of these various strands of research dealing with the death of people, places and other beings offers fruitful ground for extending human knowledge and practices surrounding the dying and the dead.\nlrry | This collection brings these marginal matters into focus, centring discussion of the death of nonhuman others, the relational materiality of the human corpse, new narratives about the work of death caretakers, and newly emerging deathcare practices and technologies. The transdisciplinary and transnational character of this collection reveals how deeply human death is intertwined with the lives and deaths of nonhuman things, objects, places and discourses. By shedding light on deaths and dyings that exist in many unlooked-for places, this collection challenges death studies' focus on human death, as well as the norms that govern standard approaches to studying human death. Thus, this volume addresses urgent questions facing death research, including:\nhvhm | 路 What boundary work takes place to construct and maintain the categories of alive, not-alive, dead, dying and undead for places, objects and beings?\n863b | 路 How do modes of existing between life and death affect normative categorizations of the living, the non-living and the dead?\nfj24 | 路 What are the implications of reconfiguring understandings of death to a more ecological frame that accommodates more-than-human lives and deaths?\nuz3c | 路 How do such challenges alter ethical approaches and values attached to dying and death?\nd5bi | The contents of this book\nba4l | This volume draws together diverse material-discursive perspectives on socio-ecological networks of the dying and dead. In addition to gathering a wide range of international perspectives - contributors hail from North America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania - this collection showcases a range of theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of death and dying from scholars doing cutting-edge research in death studies, feminist and queer studies, new materialism and waste studies, plant and animal studies, and non-Western or indigenous studies. In so doing, this volume broadens the scope of conventional research on death and dying, and focuses the discussion towards death as a more-than-human affair. Thinking and writing along the themes of mediation, care and power, the collection further challenges normative understandings and categories of life and death.\nffx8 | The organization of edited volumes always involves choices about how best to draw out certain contents by grouping specific chapters in distinct parts, and in particular orders. Recognizing that these choices always take place among a field of possible alternative arrangements, we have organized the book's chapters into three parts, which, respectively, highlight the themes of one, ontologies and epistemologies of death and dying, two, care and remembrance, and three, troubling agencies.\n```",
