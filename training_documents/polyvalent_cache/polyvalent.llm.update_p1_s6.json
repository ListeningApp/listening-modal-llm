Various side chains of amino acids (mers in these biopolymers) enable multiple intra- and intermolecular interactions such as the Coulombic and van der Waals forces and aromatic T-T and ion-mediated salt bridges. Interactions between proteins are combinations of several attractive and repulsive forces between chemical groups of amino acids oriented properly to maximize attractive forces and minimize repulsive ones. Protein interactions often result in a conformational change in the tertiary protein structure, which regulates enzyme activity, opening channels or enabling motor activity. Understanding these interactions and their description measurably and comparably is a continuous aim of biochemistry and molecular biology.\nixcc | The reaction dissociation constant is widely used to describe the strength of interactions between biomolecules. In the biochemical convention, as opposed to in physical chemistry, Ka is presented with a unit (usually mole per liter with an appropriate prefix). Typical values of Ka of immunological complexes are usually in the nanomolar or micromolar range. Generally, Ka is determined using surface plasmon resonance. But there are also other kinetic-based methods which are applied for Ka determination, like bio-layer interferometry, fluorescence correlation microscopy, thermal shift assay, nuclear magnetic resonance, gel chromatography, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.\n8p6h | Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was initially proposed as an alternative to radioimmunosorbent test to examine antigen-antibody interactions. Later, this technique was developed and applied to the study of varied molecular interactions. In general, ELISA exhibits a low limit of detection, especially in its sandwich-like variant. There are a few variants of ELISA; the simplest are direct, indirect, sandwich, and reverse types. Nevertheless, thanks to a wide range of commercially available antibodies and kits, setting up an ELISA experiment is very flexible nowadays. In a typical ELISA, the signal (target-ligand binding) is amplified only by an enzymatic reaction. However, when M13 phages are used, the signal is amplified twice. Every five pIII-displayed ligands may interact with the target, and the binding of one phage particle via single ligand-target interaction provides about two thousand particles of pVIII protein (per virion) ready to be detected by secondary antibodies. In this way, phages provide about ten thousand fold (four orders of magnitude) amplification of the signal, enabling detection of such a low phage amount as about\npmgl | one hundred eight plaque-forming units (pfu, the corresponding molar concentration of virions is about ten to the negative thirteen M) administered into ELISA assay. ELISA may also be applied to study affinity between target and phage-displayed ligand (e.g., peptide).\n90no | Indeed, the difference between monovalent binding affinity and multivalent binding avidity is well-known in the literature. However, in the case of phage-ligand complexes, the interactions between phage and ligands were described as one-to-one stoichiometry complexes, while they should be treated as polyvalent receptor-ligand systems, as presented in these studies. Antibodies are not monovalent because IgG and IgA immunoglobulins contain two active sites (antigen-binding sites), whereas IgM contains ten active sites exposed on the pentamer of dimers. Their ability to bind antigens is called avidity as opposed to affinity, which refers to the interactions between one antigen and one antigen-binding site. Omitting polyvalency of the receptor may lead to mistakes in the determination of the dissociation constant. The formation of non-covalent immunological (and immunological-like) complexes between peptides and proteins may be discussed as a reversible reaction, and a qualitative description could be presented based on chemical equilibrium laws. To the best of our knowledge, the mathematical model presented here is the first which enables the calculation of Ka (affinity) from ELISA under the assumption of phage polyvalency. However, the proposed model does not take into account the variability of the valency of M13 phage particles. The number of pIII protein copies per virion depends on several parameters. Empirically determined pIII number varies between studies according to the applied methodology.\njt0y | As Ka is widely used to express the strength of interaction between proteins, it may be used to describe the strength of target protein binding by phage-derived peptides obtained via phage display. This technique is based on the application of genetically modified bacteriophages (like the Escherichia coli M13 bacteriophage) exposing artificial amino acids sequences on their coat proteins. A mixture of various variants of exposed peptides (called a library) may be screened for variants with desired properties like binding to a target protein. Within our studies, we have obtained a specific peptide as a selective receptor for human cardiac troponin T. We tried to measure the strength of the interaction between phage-exposed peptide and troponin T via ELISA. However, we found a gap in the literature devoted to studying the interactions between ligands and polyvalent receptors, especially discussing their mathematical and physicochemical basis. Troponin T, next to troponin C and troponin I, is part of the troponin complex that plays an essential role in muscle contraction. Even though the troponin complex is present in skeletal and cardiac muscle (but not in smooth muscle), cardiac isoforms of troponin T and troponin I are tissue-specific and may be distinguished from their skeletal isoforms. These two troponins are released into the bloodstream from myocytes for several reasons, e.g., after long-lasting ischemia of the muscle region. Increased concentration of cardiac troponins is one of the fundaments of the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction approved by several renowned cardiologist associations. Therefore, recognizing cardiac markers (troponin T or troponin I) in a highly efficient and selective manner is important for diagnosing myocardial infarction. Determination of Ka of isolated peptides enables a qualitative description of their affinity against troponin T and, thus, the possibility of application in sensing devices.\nqb7o | This paper proposes a mathematical model of interactions occurring during ELISA between a ligand (troponin T) and a non-monovalent receptor (M13 bacteriophage particle exposing TnT-specific peptides). The provided equations enable the calculation of the dissociation constant from ELISA experiments with the critical impact of polyvalency of a phage, which was not discussed in any publications previously. The applied method may also cover other systems where monovalent molecules interact with multiple active sites of receptor-like natural antibodies. In addition, the interaction between phage-displayed peptides and troponin T molecules was discussed according to their chemical structures.\noae5 | Results and Discussion\ns0fl | Mathematical Model. The reaction between troponin T and phage-displayed peptide may be treated as a reversible non-covalent complex formation. According to the induced fitting model, the interaction between the ligand and its binding site on the protein surface requires energy to deform structures and fit them in proper orientation and distance. However, if the interaction is strong enough, the energy released during the process of complex formation is higher than the energy required for complex dissociation. The reaction scheme of a reversible complex formation may be written as equation one.\n43ia | M13 plus troponin T equals M13 minus (troponin T) one",
