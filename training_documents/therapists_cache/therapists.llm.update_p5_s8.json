A client's reactions are less a function of the mode choice and more a function of the interpersonal characteristics and immediate needs of the client. The case example at the beginning of this chapter illustrates this point with respect to the instructing mode. When Kamisha explained why she was asking Margarita questions about her daily occupations and roles, Margarita's daughter reacted negatively, whereas Margarita appeared to accept the explanation as being valid. It is important to keep in mind that modes are perceived, relativistic, and subjective. As such, they are best interpreted through the mind's eye of the client. Rather than the mode itself, the client's interpretation and experience of the mode is what determines which mode is most desirable at any given time.\n9zf9 | Carrying this point a step further, it is even possible that the same mode applied to similar situations may produce vastly different reactions in the same client. For example, when Rigel used the instructing mode to educate Mr. Johnson about the assessment he was using, Mr. Johnson's nonverbal cues revealed that he was not interested. However, when Rigel used the same mode to explain the concept of brain plasticity as justification for why his early engagement in therapy is likely to facilitate functional improvement, Mr. Johnson's body language became more positive. Ultimately, he invites Rigel to return to work with him on the following day.\nclwo | Because therapists naturally select and use modes that are most consistent with their interpersonal styles in everyday life, the use of therapeutic modes is as diverse and complex as the therapists who use them. All modes have equal potential to enable a functional therapeutic relationship. However, any mode may have a negative effect on a client's attitudes and feelings toward the therapist if used:\naki1 | Too frequently or inflexibly\nvf5h | When the timing is not right for the client\nl51p | When the mode is not consistent with the client's interpersonal needs in the moment\ns9zz | When the mode is not changed so as to be more consistent with the client's interpersonal needs of the moment\nx97k | In the worst cases, overreliance on a particular mode with a client can result in negative consequences for the therapy process and for the client.\nqwix | Your therapeutic style is defined by the primary mode or set of modes that you tend to utilize most often during interactions with clients. It is important to recognize that some therapists' styles reflect the use of one primary mode or set of modes, whereas other therapists incorporate a much wider range of modes into their approach. For this reason, the therapeutic modes are presented in this section in alphabetical order to underscore that no single mode is superior to another. Key points regarding each of the modes and examples of how they are typically enacted are summarized in Table Four point One. The table contains a general description of each mode, examples of phrases a therapist might use when communicating with the mode, examples of questions a therapist might ask when communicating with the mode, recommendations for facial expressions and body language that would be consistent with the mode, and ideas for how a mode might be implemented in practice.\n6lnq | The points describing each mode are guidelines, not rules. They were included to stimulate creative thinking about a wide range of interpersonal behaviors that could potentially converge to form a therapeutic style. As you learn more about each mode, you may begin to form some of your own thoughts and ideas about interpersonal behaviors that you typically utilize that reflect a given mode but are not explicitly described in this section. This type of thinking is encouraged because it promotes critical self-awareness and greater insight into your own unique therapeutic style.\nnxb1 | Advocating Mode\nkwpw | The advocating mode is becoming more prevalent as therapists become aware of and embrace the perspective that disability is a function of environmental barriers rather than client impairments. Therapists using the advocating mode work to ensure that clients have the personal, material, and interpersonal resources they need for maximal participation in productivity, leisure, and all other daily life activities. It includes ensuring that clients have access to housing, transportation, education, equal opportunities for employment, assistive devices, personal assistants, and any other resources pertinent to their independence and well-being. Functioning in the mode of advocate often involves being a facilitator or defender of justice, rather than in the more traditional roles in which the occupational therapist guides, questions, listens, or administers a service.\nusfa |\ndnjr | Advocating\nqser |\n8gam | Eighty-six Part One Theoretical Foundations and Guidelines for Practice\nz4db | Consider your own role and responsibility for the interpersonal event that occurred.\nlw7l |\n2exi | Collaborating\n16py |\nm4ov | Make summary statements to bear witness to the event and verify your understanding of the client's perspective.\n9uqd | \"Let me stop and summarize what you just told me to make sure I understand. . . .

They are careful not to undermine their clients' autonomy, dignity, sense of personal power, and capacity to judge what is in their own best interest by functioning in an expert role. They are also careful about being misperceived by clients as someone interested in fixing or rehabilitating them. At the same time, therapists functioning as advocates can be ardent and forceful activists and promoters on behalf of their clients when the circumstances require it. Some engage in consciousness-raising with their clients about their legal rights, and some utilize their professional capacity to testify on behalf of a client in a legal situation or to broker access to services or resources to which a client is entitled. Additionally, therapists using this mode will seek opportunities to bring clients together in community with their disabled peers, and also normalize their clients' experiences and impairments as a part of the natural continuum of human experience.\nar2z | Strengths of the Advocating Mode\nyad0 | Ninety-one Chapter Four Knowing Ourselves as Therapists\n```",
