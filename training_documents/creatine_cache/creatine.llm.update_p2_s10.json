For example, resistance-trained males who received creatine at a dose of zero point three grams per kilogram lean body mass per day for seven days (approximately twenty grams per day) followed by four weeks at zero point zero seven five grams per kilogram lean body mass per day for twenty-eight days (approximately five grams per day) experienced no significant change in ICW, ECW, or TBW. Furthermore, resistance-trained males who consumed creatine supplementation (twenty grams per day for seven days followed by five grams per day for twenty-one days) had no significant increase in ICW, ECW, or TBW. Similarly, males and females ingesting creatine (zero point zero three grams per kilogram per day for six weeks) experienced no significant increase in TBW. Six weeks of creatine supplementation in non-resistance-trained males at a dosage of zero point three grams per kilogram lean body mass for five days followed by zero point zero seven five grams per kilogram lean body mass for forty-two days produced no significant changes in TBW. In contrast, when assessing TBW, ICW, and ECW content before and after twenty-eight days of creatine supplementation in healthy males and females, Powers et al. showed that creatine supplementation was effective at increasing muscle creatine content which was associated with an increase in body mass and TBW but did not alter ICW or ECW volumes. In a recent study examining the effects of creatine supplementation combined with resistance exercise for eight weeks, Ribeiro et al. found a significant increase in TBW (seven percent) and ICW (nine point two percent) volume compared to placebo (TBW: one point seven percent; ICW: one point six percent), with both groups similarly increasing ECW (CR: one point two percent vs. Placebo: zero point six percent). Importantly, the ratio of skeletal muscle mass to ICW remained similar in both groups. It is important to highlight that the ICW is an important cellular signal for protein synthesis and thus drives an increase in muscle mass over time.\n524j | In summary, while there is some evidence to suggest that creatine supplementation increases water retention, primarily attributed to increases in intracellular volume, over the short term, there are several other studies suggesting it does not alter total body water (intra or extracellular) relative to muscle mass over longer periods of time. As a result, creatine supplementation may not lead to water retention.\nxd3m | Is creatine an anabolic steroid?\n8qb6 | Anabolic steroids are a synthetic version of testosterone, an androgenic hormone which is also produced\nwkbn | endogenously within both males and females, and is used in conjunction with resistance training with the intent of enhancing muscle mass and strength due to increases in muscle protein synthesis. This increase in MPS is due to testosterone's ability to enter the muscle cell, bind with the intracellular androgen receptor, and increase the expression of various muscle-specific genes. Creatine is converted to phosphocreatine, regulated by the enzyme creatine kinase in muscle and used to create intracellular adenosine triphosphate production. Creatine supplementation, however, can increase the capacity of ATP and energy produced during heavy anaerobically-related exercise, thereby possibly increasing muscle power, repetitions and exercise volume which can subsequently contribute to muscle performance and hypertrophy over the course of a training period.\nftfg | While the physiological and performance outcomes of anabolic steroids and creatine can be similar, their mechanisms of action and legal categorization are not. Anabolic steroids are drugs, with a different chemical structure than creatine, and are Class C, Schedule Three controlled substances regulated by the Food and Drug Administration and subject to the regulatory control provisions of the Controlled Substances Act set forth by the Drug Enforcement Association. Creatine, on the other hand, like many other dietary supplements fits well within the confines of The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of nineteen ninety-four, which is a statute of United States Federal legislation which defines and regulates dietary supplements by the Federal Drug Administration for Good Manufacturing Practices. It is illegal to possess and administer anabolic steroids without a physician's prescription. However, there are no legal ramifications for the possession or ingestion of creatine.\n7xi5 | In summary, because creatine has a completely different chemical structure, it is not an anabolic steroid.\nw8r5 | Does creatine cause kidney damage or renal dysfunction? Questions and concerns involving creatine supplementation and kidney damage or renal dysfunction are common. In terms of pervasive misinformation in the sport nutrition arena, the notion that creatine supplementation leads to kidney damage or renal dysfunction is perhaps second only to the myth that protein supplementation and high habitual protein intake causes kidney damage. Today, after more than twenty years of research which demonstrates no adverse effects from recommended dosages of creatine supplements on kidney health, unfortunately, this concern persists. While the origin is unknown, the connection between creatine supplementation and kidney\nybik | damage or renal dysfunction could be traced back to two things: a poor understanding of creatine and creatinine metabolism and a case study published in nineteen ninety-eight.\ngii5 | In skeletal muscle, both creatine and phosphocreatine are degraded non-enzymatically to creatinine, which is exported to the blood and excreted in the urine. Healthy kidneys filter creatinine, which would otherwise increase in the blood. Therefore, blood creatinine levels can be used as a proxy marker of kidney function. However, the amount of creatinine in the blood is related to muscle mass (i.e. males have higher blood creatinine than females) and both dietary creatine and creatinine intake. Both blood and urinary creatinine may be increased by ingestion of creatine supplementation and creatine-containing foods, such as meat. Creatine is normally not present in urine, but can reach very high levels (greater than ten grams per day) during creatine supplementation. There appears to be an unsubstantiated perspective that if the kidneys are \"forced\" to excrete higher than normal levels of creatine or creatinine, some sort of kidney \"overload\" will take place, causing kidney damage and or renal dysfunction. In reality, transient increases in blood or urinary creatine or creatinine due to creatine supplementation are unlikely to reflect a decrease in kidney function. Additionally, one must exercise caution when using blood creatinine and estimated creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate in individuals who consume high meat intake or supplement with creatine. In a review of creatine supplementation studies, Persky and Rawson found no increase in serum creatinine in twelve studies, eight studies showed an increase that remained within the normal range, and only two studies showed an increase above normal limits (although not different from the control group in one study).\n```",
