You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

rhaz | For every fixed read count value at a particular allele, we approximated the distribution of read counts mapped to the other allele as a mixture of two Negative Binomial distributions. The model estimates the number of successes <LATEX>x</LATEX> (the number of reads mapped to the selected allele) given the number of failures <LATEX>r</LATEX> (the number of reads mapped to the second allele) in the series of Bernoulli trials with probability of success <LATEX>p</LATEX> (for the first distribution in the mixture) or <LATEX>1 \quad - \quad p</LATEX> (for the second distribution in the mixture). The following holds for scoring Ref-ASBs at

wtow | Fig. 6 Distribution of read counts at SNVs significantly depends on background allelic dosage. Each panel contains three plots: (1, left) a heatmap of allelic read counts colored by log10[number of SNVs that have the specified number of ChIP-Seq reads] supporting the reference <LATEX>\left( X - a x i s \right)</LATEX> and alternative (Y-axis) alleles; (2, middle, 3, right) barplots of observed read counts at one of the alleles and the approximating distribution plot. Two barplots correspond to the two slices of the heatmap data, either by fixing the sum of reads at two alleles (a-d, diagonal slices along the dashed lines in the bottom left corner, approximated by the binomial mixture) or by fixing the read counts at one of the alleles (e, f, vertical and horizontal slices, approximated by the negative binomial mixture). a Complete set of ADASTRA candidate ASB SNVs, no separation by BAD, the observed distribution can be interpreted as overdispersed binomial. b K562 candidate SNVs, the distribution is similar to an overdispersed mixture of binomial distributions with <LATEX>p = 1 / 3</LATEX> and <LATEX>p = 2 / 3</LATEX> as K562 are mostly triploid. c SNVs in diploid regions according to <LATEX>B A D = 1 ,</LATEX> binomial distribution with <LATEX>p = 1 / 2 .</LATEX> d SNVs in BAD-separated triploid regions <LATEX>\left( B A D = 2 \right) ,</LATEX> binomial mixture with <LATEX>p = 1 / 3</LATEX> and <LATEX>p = 2 / 3 .</LATEX> e BAD-separated diploids <LATEX>\left( B A D = 1 \right) ,</LATEX> negative binomial distribution with <LATEX>p = 1 / 1</LATEX> (fit). f BAD-separated triploids <LATEX>\left( B A D = 2 \right) ,</LATEX> negative binomial mixture with <LATEX>p = 1 / 3 \quad a n d \quad p = 2 / 3</LATEX> (fit).

Low-quality fits with RMSEA > 0.05 were discarded, fixing the parameters at <LATEX>r = m</LATEX> and <LATEX>w =</LATEX> 1, thereby penalizing the statistical significance of <LATEX>\mathrm { A S B }</LATEX> at such SNVs, as fitted r is systematically lower than <LATEX>m</LATEX> (Supplementary Fig. 12). Of note, the values of r for distribution of reference allele read counts (with fixed alt-allele read counts) were systematically higher than those for alternative allele read counts (with fixed Ref-allele read counts), thus balancing the reference mapping bias. The obtained fitted models were used for statistical evaluation of ASB for alternative and reference alleles

Individual P were excluded from aggregation, and if none were left, the aggregated P

mror | ASB effect size estimation. We define the ES separately for reference allele ASB <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { E S } _ { \mathrm { R e f } } \right)</LATEX> and alternative allele ASB <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { E S } _ { \mathrm { A l t } } \right)</LATEX> as the log ratio of the observed number of reads to the expected number. To account for BAD and mapping bias, we use fitted Negative Binomial mixture at the fixed allele read counts:
zlxc | <LATEX>\mathrm { E S } _ { \mathrm { R e f } } = \log _ { 2 } \left( \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { R e f } } / E \left( \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { R e f } } | \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { A l t } } \right) \right) ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { E S } _ { \mathrm { A l t } } = \log _ { 2 } \left( \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { A l t } } / E \left( \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { A l t } } | \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { R e f } } \right) \right)</LATEX> (2)
k0bw | In the basic case of BAD = 1, the ES can be approximated as the log ratio of read counts, taking into account that the expectation bias due to the truncation is relatively small and r is close to the read count on the fixed allele: ESRef = log2(CRef /CAlt).
aq5a | In the case of <LATEX>\mathrm { B A D } > 1</LATEX> 1, the same assumptions lead to the following estimation of the ES:
sc5y | <LATEX>\log _ { 2 } \left( C _ { R e f } \times B A D / C _ { A l t } \right) \lesssim E S _ { R e f } \lesssim \log _ { 2 } \left( C _ { R e f } / \left( B A D \times C _ { A l t } \right) \right)</LATEX> (3)
0yab | This holds due to the fact that for fixed BAD, <LATEX>C _ { \text { Ref } }</LATEX> expectation is either <LATEX>C _ { \mathrm { A l t } } \times</LATEX> BAD or <LATEX>C _ { A l t } / B A D ,</LATEX> depending on a haplotype. Therefore, the expectation of <LATEX>C _ { \text { Ref } }</LATEX> according to the Negative Binomial mixture model is approximately
w95z | <LATEX>w \times C _ { A l t } \times</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { B A D } + \left( 1 - w \right) \times \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { A l t } } / \mathrm { B A D } .</LATEX> The final ASB ES is estimated for SNVs with aggregated significance either across TFs or across cell types. The ES value is calculated as a weighted average of ES of individual SNVs in aggregation, with weights assigned as negative logarithms of individual P values. ES is not assigned in the case if all individual P values are equal to 1.

ohh7 | Sequence motif analysis of ASBs. For TF ASBs, we annotated the corresponding SNVs with sequence motif hits of the respective TFs. To this end, we used models from HOCOMOCO v11 core collection64 and SPRY-SARUS65 for motif finding. The top-scoring motif hit was taken considering both Ref and Alt alleles, and, at this fixed position, the "motif FC" was calculated as the log2-ratio of motif <LATEX>P</LATEX> values at the reference and alternative variants so that the positive FC corresponded to the preference of the alternative allele.
