You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

q1lo | Or at least that's the old definition. Now many people define a kilobyte to be 1000 bytes rather than 1024 bytes, in keeping with the usual meaning of the prefix. If you want 1024 bytes you're supposed to ask for a 'kibibyte'. When we get to a terabyte, the new definition based on powers of 10 is about 10% less than the old one based on powers of 2: <LATEX>1 0 ^ { 1 2 }</LATEX> bytes rather than <LATEX>2 ^ { 4 0 } \approx 1 . 0 9 9 5 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 2 } .</LATEX> If you want the old larger amount of information you should ask for a 'tebibyte'.
biqi | Wikipedia has an article that lists many strange units of information. Did you know that 2 bits is a 'crumb'? Did you even need to know? No, but now you do.
xl19 | Feel free to dispose of this unnecessary information! All this is just for fun-but I want you to get used to the formula
j83k | <LATEX>\mathrm { i n f o r m a t i o n } = - \log p</LATEX> 7
nle2 | THE INFORMATION IN A LICENSE PLATE NUMBER
19po | If there are N different possible license plate numbers, all equally likely, how many bits of information do you learn when you see one?
sx65 | If you think N alternatives are equally likely, when you see which one actually occurs, you gain an amount of information equal to log N. Here the choice of base b is up to you: it's a choice of units. But what is this in bits? No matter what base you use,
ilzn | log N = log2 N x log6 2.
uzp0 | Since we call log, 2 a 'bit', this means you've learned log2 N bits of information. Let's try it out!
yq4x | Puzzle 8. Suppose a license plate has 7 numbers and/or letters on it. If there are 10+26 choices of number and/or letter, there are 367 possible license plate numbers. If all license plates are equally likely, what's the information in a license plate number in bits-approximately?
i901 | But wait! Suppose I tell you that all license plate numbers have a number, then 3 letters, then 3 numbers! You have just learned a lot of information. So the remaining information content of each license plate is presumably less. Let's work it out.
n98j | Puzzle 9. How much information is there in a license plate number if they all have a number, then 3 letters, then 3 numbers? (Assume they're all equally probable and there are 10 choices of each number and 26 choices of each letter.)
xgyu | The moral: when you learn more about the possible choices, the information it takes to describe a choice drops.
ue40 | THE INFORMATION IN A LICENSE PLATE
tq0f | How much unknown information do the atoms in a license plate contain?
3z1s | Aluminum has an entropy of about 28 joules/kelvin per mole at standard temperature and pressure. A mole of aluminum weighs about 27 grams. A typical license plate might weigh 150 grams, and thus have
une6 | 150 g × 27 g/mole 28 J/K · mole ~ 160 J/K
eroy | of entropy. But a joule/kelvin of entropy is about 1023 bits of un- known information. Thus, the atoms in such a license plate contain about
b09g | 160 x 1023 bits ~ 1.6 . 1025 bits of unknown information.
psuf | Last time we talked about the information in a license plate number. A license plate number made of 7 numbers and/or letters contains
ojfh | log2(367) ~ 36.189
qri0 | bits of information if all combinations are equally likely. How does this compare to the information in the actual metal of the license plate?
hbbb | These days most license plates are made of aluminum, and they weigh roughly between 100 and 200 grams. Let's say 150 grams. If we work out the entropy of this much aluminum, and express it in bits of unknown information, we get an enormous number: roughly
uy56 | 16, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000 bits!
sy3k | Here is the point. While the information on the license plate and the information in the license plate can be studied using similar mathematics, the latter dwarfs the former. Thus, when we are doing chemistry and want to know, for example, how much the entropy of the license plate increases when we dissolve it in hydrochloric acid, the information in the writing on the license plate is irrelevant for all practical purposes.
ido2 | Some people get fooled by this, in my opinion, and claim that "information" and "entropy" are fundamentally unrelated. I disagree.
uq3f | JUSTIFYING THE FORMULA FOR INFORMATION
c006 | Why do we say the information of an event of probability p is
yatc | I(p) =- logo P
ny4k | for some base b > 1? Here's why:
gqd8 | Theorem. Suppose I : (0, 1] -> R is a function that is:
etr7 | 1. Decreasing: p < q implies I (p) > I(q). This says less probable events have more information.
3m6c | 2. Additive: I(pq) = I(p) +I(q). This says the information of the combination of two independent events is the sum of their separate informations.
h1un | Then for some b > 1 we have I (p) = - logo P.
nljo | The information of an event of probability p is - log p, where you get to choose the base of the logarithm. But why? This is the only option if we want less probable events to have more information, and information to add for independent events.
ookx | Proving this will take some math-but don't worry, you won't need to know this stuff for the rest of this 'course'.
0h9f | Since we're trying to prove I (p) is a logarithm function, let's write
a5nf | and prove f has to be linear:
htog | f(x) = cx.
d9zz | As we'll see, this gets the job done.
eovv | x < y implies f(x) > f(y) for all x, y ≤ 0.
f6vi | Similarly, we can check that Condition 2 is equivalent to
qt9q | f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y) for all x, y ≤ 0.
fkn1 | Now what functions f have
xqgo | f(x+y) =f(x) +f(y)
ztv3 | for all x, y ≤ 0?
d6tt | If we define f(-x) = - f(x), f will become a function from the whole real line to the real numbers, and it will still obey f (x+y) = f(x) +f(y). So what functions obey this equation? The obvious solutions are
ow58 | f(x) =cx
rhnw | for any real constant c. But are there any other solutions?
78ub | Yes, if you use the axiom of choice! Treat the reals as a vector space over the rationals. Using the axiom of choice, pick a basis. To get f : R -> R that's linear over the rational numbers, just let f send each basis element to whatever real number you want and extend it to a linear function defined on all of R. This gives a function f that obeys f(x+y) =f(x)+f(y).
49qz | However, no solutions of f (x +y) = f(x) + f(y) meet our other condition
vw2p | x < y implies f (x) > f(y) for all x, y ≤ 0
jkfz | except for the familiar ones f(x) = cx. For a proof see Wikipedia: they show all solutions except the familiar ones are so discontinuous their graphs are dense in the plane!
1jrv | I(p)=clnp
urci | but this equals - log, p if we take b = exp(-1/c). And this number b can be any number > 1. QED.
