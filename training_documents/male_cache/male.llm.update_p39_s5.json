        "content": "gi7n | d) Retrograde Ejaculation. Retrograde ejaculation results from incomplete bladder neck closure, often from a dysfunctional internal sphincter, during ejaculation. This often causes the semen to be ejaculated into the bladder instead of out of the penis. Patients who have a history of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection will often have retrograde ejaculation. This condition is asymptomatic, although patients may complain of a \"dry ejaculation\" due to severe hypospermia. Semen analysis in these patients will often display severe hypospermia. A postejaculation urine analysis will show a marked increase in the presence of sperm. These patients can be treated by collecting a postejaculation urine sample into buffer, isolating, and washing the sperm by centrifugation, with subsequent artificial insemination of the prepared sperm.\n3pn1 | e) Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism is also called Kallmann syndrome. Patients will have decreased serum testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone. Patients may also complain of anosmia, or decreased sense of smell. Patients will display marked oligozoospermia or azoospermia. These patients can be treated with human chorionic gonadotropin to stimulate androgen production and gonadotropins to provide follicle-stimulating hormone for spermatogenesis. Although\nwjuz | low sperm counts result from treatment, these patients often are capable of causing a pregnancy without the need for an assisted reproductive technology.\n3yxv | f) Spermatogenic Failure, Cryptozoospermia, Hypospermatogenesis, Early or Late Maturation or Meiotic Arrest, Sertoli Cell-Only Syndrome: In this condition, Sertoli cells are present, but the germinal epithelium is absent, and sperm are rarely present. Microdissection testicular sperm extraction, where the urologist dissects open the entire testis and searches tubule by tubule for rare foci of spermatogenesis, results in improved sperm retrieval for intracytoplasmic sperm injection in vitro fertilization. Damage to the seminiferous epithelium in this condition will result in a loss of inhibin, which results in a removal of the negative feedback on follicle-stimulating hormone, causing elevated serum follicle-stimulating hormone. However, since the Leydig cells are unaffected, serum luteinizing hormone will be normal.\nd8zj | g) Congenital Bilateral Absence of the Vas Deferens results in obstructive azoospermia. This is associated with a congenital absence of the seminal vesicles as well. Therefore, fructose will be absent in the semen of these men. Congenital Bilateral Absence of the Vas Deferens is observed in men with cystic fibrosis.\nywxn | Twelve. References",
