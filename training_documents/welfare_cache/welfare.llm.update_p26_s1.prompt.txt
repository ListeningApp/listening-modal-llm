You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

These are important arguments for longitudinal studies to draw more balanced conclusions about public sector reform.
0bqy | Our study also raises some further questions for future research. For example, in 2015, well after the crisis of 2008, a reform followed in both countries with a 'revival' of NPG ideas and a focus on decentralization. This raises the question of whether NPG-type reforms are contingent on relatively favourable economic conditions? Another fundamental issue is how different NPG reforms actually are from TPA and NPM? As Lapuente and Van der Walle (2020) argued: "Post-NPM represents a reassertion of old public administration values as well an attempt to remedy some of the disintegrating tendencies associated with NPM, and not an abandonment of NPM reforms." (p.463). Other scholars have theoretically questioned if the models are internally consistent: NPM has at least two faces: market and management (Pollitt and Dan 2011; Mongkol, 2011); and also NPG would have many meanings (Reiter and Klenk 2019; Lapuente and Van der Walle 2020). However, we have shown in this paper that despite internal variety, the NPM and NPG models can be used to uncover convergence and divergence in reform characteristics and their impact on welfare administrations over time.
b780 | A final issue for further study is about radical - versus incremental reform. Pollitt and Dan (2011, p.47) argued that "The structure of political system may be facilitating or inhibiting for rapid or large-scale reform. The incremental decision-making process in, say, Norway or the Netherlands is more likely to inhibit such reform whereas the centralized, majoritarian system in the UK and a more consensual one is more likely to facilitate reform" (see also, Pollitt and Bouckaert 2017). We found the opposite effect in Norway and the Netherlands, where large- scale reform took place despite the incremental process. Or should we say that radical, large-
ccmb | scale reform follows up on incremental decision-making that did not lead to consensus? Then it is the stalemate that facilitates a quite sudden, large-scale reform, especially when a political majority wants to leave behind the previous system (see also, Van Gestel and Hillebrand 2011).
ma93 | To foster understanding of public sector reform, these issues need more attention in future comparative research.
