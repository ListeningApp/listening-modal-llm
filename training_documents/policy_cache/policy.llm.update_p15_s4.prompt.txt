You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0yab | And it was just bypassed [by the managers] like, 'don't use it, then as long as you do something'. Or that you don't need to use it. Or just try ... this was the conversation. And of course, if you give your employees the possibility that they can do something difficult if they want to, then obviously they won't do that and will use the easier way, Perhaps in some units the managers have stated more clearly that this is how we do things, everyone does like this, and there are no other options. And when people start doing it, that is when you learn, and it becomes a routine. (H5)
w95z | Importantly, the street-level workers lacked understanding about the IS' usage for statistical and reporting purposes, and they felt that it was the managers' responsibility to ensure that these requirements were sufficiently met. Thus, managerial support and vision about how to implement the new technology in practice was lacking and called after.
0i1k | Implementation happened individually (during the everyday work practices)
dqlg | The implementation was done during the street-level workers' everyday work with the clients. Due to their busy schedules, learning to use the new IS along with the everyday work felt difficult. The street-level workers felt that there was no time for them to focus on really understanding how the IS operates. Instead of fully understanding the operational logic, the time restrictions limited the use of the IS only to the crucial features necessary for everyday work practices.
p6pq | I have to say that the more work I have and the busier and more clients I get, the less I will ... Like then you just use the IS the way you have learnt to use it and you think that, well, this is the way I have done things so far, I will just try to learn the new things later. (H1)
zse6 | Evidently, the street-level workers needed sufficient time and motivation for the implementation, that is, learning to use the IS' logic and features that were needed to ensure the continuation of work practices. The learning process was time-consuming, and sometimes, caused delays in everyday work. When the street-level workers had no time to learn and concentrate on the use of the new IS, or when the IS' features seemed too complicated and untrustworthy, the workers simply bypassed the IS and continued practice-as-usual.
p2n3 | Due to the organization of their work, the street-level workers often worked alone. That being, they also were mostly by themselves when learning to use the IS during the implementation. Yet, support from colleagues was one of the most crucial aspects the street-level workers needed when learning to use the IS in practice. When encountering problems with the IS or when one did not know how to use the system, the street-level workers turned to their colleagues for support and advice.
ohh7 | But then, due to the nature of our work, after the first few weeks when people more actively returned to do their own work, travelling and stuff, we quite quickly were in a situation in which we did not necessarily meet our colleagues so often. And after that it was like you first tried to figure it out on your own and then tried to seek help ... And always someone helps and ponders things with you. But when you do not have that colleague nearby, then you try to figure it out by yourself [ ... ] Or at least I think that we have all started to enact many things in our own way. (H2)
vbni | Evidently, the street-level workers did not often have either the possibility or time to reach out for help from their colleagues during their everyday work. In practice, the street-level workers made choices of what features of the IS they used individually, resulting to a situation where they had learned individualized ways of using the IS: "everyone just uses the system in their own way, despite of what the instructions say or what has been talked about in the trainings, everyone have just started to interpret and make their own choices." (H10)
dgcw | Perhaps there was this uncertainty because we did not have any shared practices or understanding of how to do things [use the new IS], within the city or within the units, like how we will do the recordings, or how, if we meet our clients, how we will record the meeting to the system [ ... ] Previously, it was just that people did whatever they wanted to do [laughs], everyone just did how they know how to. And perhaps that also created resistance, we did not have shared practices, one did this and other did that. (H1)
gvwz | Amid the everyday work, the features which seemed the most suitable for the work practices were taken to use, and others that seemed too complicated, difficult or time- consuming were left out. The street-level workers also put a blame on the busy schedule when explaining that they did not even have time to check out the IS' instructions, and when they did, the instructions were interpreted from the individual's perspective, only strengthening the individualized ways of using the IS: "I think that during the everyday work, people just don't remember nor have time to check the instructions, and they will just do something [laughs]." (H8)
sk5m | Partially the individualized way of using the IS were caused by the system itself, which enables different ways of conducting the same procedures. Eventually, when the co-workers had already learned the different ways of using the IS, confusion and uncertainty about the need for shared practices emerged. Over an year after the implementation the street-level workers emphasized a need to develop and learn shared practices and ways of using the IS. They felt that standardizing the ways of using the IS and mutual understanding about why the IS was used in a particular way were crucial to unleash its potential. However, it was stated that it is difficult to change the ways of using the IS when the individualized ways had already been learnt. Again, time was needed to ensure the learning and unlearning.
qws8 | Ensuring the interaction and engaging with the clients (guided the ways the IS was used in practice)
877u | The street-level workers emphasized that their work at the social services was not as urgent as the work in healthcare services, and the characteristics of social services enhanced the street-level workers to choose how to use the IS in practice. Indeed, the extensive criticism towards the IS in the news media derived its source from healthcare service sector to where the IS was first developed. Paradoxically, it seemed that the operational logic of the new IS was more suitable for the social service sector: the street- level workers pointed out that the everyday work done in social services was not dependent on IS, or whether it was functioning properly. For example, it was possible to first use Word - or paper and pen - to document the necessary information about the clients and their situations instead of using the IS.
rzhj | In the everyday work, it was more important to focus on engaging with the clients, not using the IS. The street-level workers felt that especially in the meetings with clients the issues dealt with were sensitive and required them to be present in the situation for their clients: "I don't do registrations during the phone calls, there are so strong emotions, agony and needs that I find it silly to start typing, then, in my work, one must concentrate on the client." (H8). They choose, for example, not to use the IS for real-time registration. Instead, the street-level workers relied on their capability to remember the necessary information to ensure that their focus remained on clients, and used the IS only after the meetings. From the street-level workers' point of view, even using any technology - that is, having their laptops at the meetings - would interfere with the interaction with their clients, especially when the work was done alone.
