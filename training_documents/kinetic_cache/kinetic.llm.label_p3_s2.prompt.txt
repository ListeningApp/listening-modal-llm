You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

Moreover, the reactions in Figure 1 form a complete thermodynamic cycle, and therefore the standard potentials <LATEX>E _ { i } ^ { \circ }</LATEX> are related to each other through the same equilibrium constants. Under the equilibrium approximation, we can show that for any two channels i,

For the sequential-only case, when pH < pKa,Ox Eapp = EET1; at intermediate pH, Eapp decreases linearly as pH increases with a slope of 59 mV per pH unit; when pH > pKa,Red) Eapp = EET2. For the concerted- only case, Eapp has the same behavior, but the upper and lower bounds become EgPT1 and EgPT2, and the transition points become -pK1 and pK2 + pKw respectively. The slope at intermediate pH is still 59 mV per pH unit. When both mechanisms are considered, the resulting curve can be seen as connecting pieces of the two black curves. The plateau value at low pH is the lower potential of ELT1 versus ELPTI with a turning point at the larger value of -pK1 versus pKa,Ox. The plateau value at high pH is the higher potential of ELT2 versus EPT2 with a turning point at the lower value of pK2 + pKw versus pKa,Red.
5esx | Next, we move on to the derivation of the apparent rate constants. Here, we assume that each form of the reduced or oxidized species is not distinguished in kinetics experiments, and only the total reduction or oxidation rate is measured. Although some forms may be distinguishable because they have distinct spectra, formulating the equations in this manner provides a general approach for kinetic analysis.
m5ka | For an electrochemical reaction, ET occurs between the main redox species undergoing PCET and the electrode. In this case, the total reduction and oxidation rates of all forms of the redox species are

otkr | These total reaction rates can be written as the product of an apparent rate constant, kRed or kox, Kapp, and the total concentration of the redox species [Oxtot] or [Redtot]. The resulting apparent rate constants are the weighted averages of the rate constants of each redox channel, where the weights are the mole fractions of the corresponding reactants

The BV model assumes a linear free energy relationship, where the ET free energy barrier is proportional to the ET driving force,24 and can be generalized to concerted PCET reactions by replacing the redox potential with the proton-coupled redox potential in the expressions. Moreover, we have shown that the MG theory can be extended to describe concerted PCET reactions within the framework of our vibronically nonadiabatic PCET theory19,36 by including the transitions between all reactant and product vibronic states. Figure 2b shows the potential-dependent kad and kopp as functions of pH at a given electrode potential. The oxidation apparent rate constant has a slope of 90%." = 1, whereas the reduction apparent rate constant has a slope of 0.63, which is less than unity, indicating that the reduction reaction has a weaker pH dependence. In general, both reduction and oxidation reactions can exhibit weak pH dependence in this model. A detailed analysis of this figure is provided in the SI.
5z6q | There are also multiple ways to define a potential- independent rate constant. The standard rate constant ks is defined as the rate constant when E = Eº.24,25 At this potential, the reaction free energy AG = F(E - Eº) = 0 so kRed = kox= ks. Alternatively, if the reaction rate constant saturates at very negative or positive potentials, maximum rate constants kmax for reduction and oxidation can be defined at E -> ± 00 24, 32-35 Similarly, we can define the potential-independent apparent standard rate constant and apparent maximum rate constants as
yeoh | Ks,app = kapp (Eapp) = k, .Ox Px(Eapp) (11a)
b8hf | = k Red( Kapp (E -> -0) (11b)
hntf | (11c)
99fo | Here, Eapp is the apparent standard potential defined in eq 4. In practice, kmax,app can also be defined at the experimental potential limits. The apparent standard or maximum rate constants can then be obtained by substituting the expressions for kRed(E) and ko (E) into Equations 9a and 9b and setting E = Eapp or ±00. The general expressions for ks,app and Kmax,app provided in the Supporting Information. For the BV and MG kinetic models, the results are presented in Table 1. Representative illustrations of these cases are shown in Figure 2c,d, and detailed analyses are provided in the SI.
y5r7 | To conclude this section, we summarize the expressions for the apparent rate constants for both homogeneous and electrochemical PCET reactions in Table 1. Note that these equations are not limited to the four-channel case shown in Figure 1. Certain channels can be shut down by excluding the corresponding form of Ox; and Red; or setting certain k; = 0. For example, if we exclude all concerted pathways in Figure 1 and apply the equation for BV kinetics ksapp? s,app, this model is reduced to Laviron's model, and we obtain the same expression for the apparent standard rate constant (see the SI). More generally, other channels could be added, such as concerted pathways with buffer as the proton donor or acceptor, and the assumption of equilibrium for PT and complex formation could be removed, leading to more complex kinetic equations.

fj24 | ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
uz3c | We applied our model to an electrochemical PCET reaction, namely, PCET to a Ru-based water oxidation catalyst37-44 attached to an ITO surface. As discussed above, the apparent rate constant of an electrochemical PCET reaction is not only pH-dependent but also potential-dependent. Kessinger et al. studied the interfacial ET and PCET reactions in a Ru-based water oxidation catalyst, <LATEX>\left[ \mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I } } \left( \mathrm { t p y } \right) \left( b p \mathrm { y } \right) \left( \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } O \right) \right] ^ { 2 + } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I } }</LATEX> -OH2, <LATEX>\left( t p y = 2 , 2 ^ { \prime } : 6 ^ { \prime } , 2 ^ { \prime \prime } \right. ,</LATEX> bpy= 2,2'-bipyridine), attached to ITO.19 Photoexcitation of <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathrm { R u } } ^ { \mathrm { I I } } - \mathrm { O H } _ { 2 }</LATEX> results in rapid electron transfer to the ITO electrode, producing <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } }</LATEX> -OH2/OH with a protonation state that is dependent on the solution pH. The resulting back electron transfer reaction from ITO to <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } } - O \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \widetilde { O H } ^ { - }</LATEX> that regenerates <LATEX>R u ^ { I I } - O H _ { 2 }</LATEX> therefore occurs via an ET and/or a PCET pathway. This reduction reaction was monitored using transient absorption spectroscopy by measuring the recovery of the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) absorption peak of
