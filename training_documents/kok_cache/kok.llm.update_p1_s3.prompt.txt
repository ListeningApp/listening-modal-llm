You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

s2v1 | The Kok effect revisited
jkp9 | Summary
z8tt | . The Kok effect refers to the abrupt decrease around the light compensation point in the slope of net photosynthetic rate vs irradiance. Arguably, this switch arises from light inhibition of respiration, allowing the Kok method to estimate day respiration <LATEX>\left( R _ { d } \right) .</LATEX> Recent analysis sug- gests that increasing proportions of photorespiration (quantified as <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { c } } ,</LATEX> the ratio of <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> compensation point <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * }</LATEX> to chloroplast <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> concentration, <LATEX>C _ { c }</LATEX> with irradiance explain much of the Kok effect. Also, the Kok method has been modified to account for the decrease in PSII photochemical efficiency (@2) with irradiance.
9g22 | . Using a model that illustrates how varying <LATEX>R _ { d } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { c } } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> and proportions of alternative electron transport could engender the Kok effect, we quantified the contribution of these parameters to the Kok effect measured in sunflower across various <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> concentra- tions and various temperatures.
41fx | . Overall, the decreasing <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> with irradiance explained <LATEX>c .</LATEX> 12%, and the varying <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> explained <LATEX>c .</LATEX> 25%, of the Kok effect. Maximum real light inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { d }</LATEX> was much lower than the inhibition derived from the Kok method, but still increased with photorespiration.

uow2 | <LATEX>R _ { d }</LATEX> Introduction
iat7 | The Kok effect refers to the abrupt change in the slope of the lin- ear relationship between net photosynthetic rate and irradiance that occurs at very low irradiances, as observed initially in unicellu- lar algae (Kok, 1948, 1949; Healey & Myers, 1971). The switch is reported later in leaves of many higher plant species (e.g. Ishii & Schmid, 1981; Sharp et al., 1984; Villar et al., 1994; Buckley et al., 2017). The slope decreases from the initial higher value to a lower value, mostly at an irradiance value around the light com- pensation point. This switch has been interpreted as a consequence of light inhibition of respiration, allowing the so-called Kok method to estimate respiration in the light, or day respiration <LATEX>\left( R _ { \mathrm { d } } \right) ,</LATEX> and quantum yield of CO2 assimilation <LATEX>\left( \Phi _ { \mathrm { C O 2 } } \right)</LATEX> (see Supporting Information Table S1 for all symbol definitions), using the part of the relationship with the lower slope. The absolute value of the estimated <LATEX>R _ { 4 }</LATEX> is lower than the respiration in the dark <LATEX>\left( R _ { \mathrm { d k } } \right)</LATEX> (Fig. 1). The cost of total respiratory activities accounts for c. 40% of gross photosynthetic productivity of whole plants (Gifford, 1995; Amthor, 2010). Light inhibition of respiratory activities also occurs at a stand scale (Gong et al., 2017), suggesting that it is a general phenomenon, and thus would have a significant impact on projecting the net ecosystem carbon fluxes in biomes across the globe (Heskel et al., 2013). For this reason, understanding the Kok effect and its related light inhibition of respiration has contin- uously received attention (Tcherkez et al., 2017a,b).
ywwr | The lower estimates of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> by the Kok method, relative to <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d k } }</LATEX> have been confirmed by other gas exchange-based methods such as the popular Laisk method (Laisk, 1977). By applying the Laisk
0i6j | method to different light intensities, it has been shown that <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } } \mathrm { w a s }</LATEX> progressively inhibited by increasing irradiance (Brooks & Far- quhar, 1985; Villar et al., 1995). However, this light inhibition has been challenged by the direct measurement of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } } ,</LATEX> which exploits the differences in the time course of labelling by carbon isotopes of photosynthetic, photorespiratory and respiratory pathways. For example, using such techniques, Pinelli & Loreto (2003) suggested a significant refixation of respired and photorespired <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> and Loreto et al. (2001) calculated that there would be no significant difference between <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> and <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d k } }</LATEX> if the refixation of <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> released from respiration during illumination were taken into account. Similarly, a recent report using a direct method based on isotopic disequilibrium (Gong et al., 2018) showed that <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> was underesti- mated by the Laisk method. Owing to inconsistent reports of this kind, whether the Kok effect was a result of light inhibition of leaf respiration has been under debate over years.
87cq | In fact, according to an extended form of the widely used model of Farquhar et al. (1980) for describing the electron trans- port-limited photosynthesis, several other mechanisms could also explain the Kok effect. The extended model expresses the net CO2 assimilation rate <LATEX>\left( A \right)</LATEX> as a function <LATEX>o f \quad t h e</LATEX> photosynthetically absorbed irradiance <LATEX>\left( I _ { \mathrm { a b s } } \right)</LATEX> as (Yin et al., 2004, 2006):
0qs3 | <LATEX>A = \frac { 1 - \Gamma _ { * } / C _ { _ { \mathrm { c } } } } { 4 \left( 1 + 2 \Gamma _ { * } / C _ { _ { \mathrm { c } } } \right) } f _ { \mathrm { a c t } } \left( \Phi _ { 2 } \rho _ { _ { 2 } } I _ { \mathrm { a b s } } \right) - R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> Eqn 1
