You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

erre | Onsager-Machlup form of the generating functional. To turn the functional integro-differential equation (1) into a mathematically more tractable form we employ two commonly used approximations for the effective action Tk: the Local Potential Approximation (LPA) as well as the LPA augmented by Wavefunction Renormalisation (WFR). In the LPA, the effect of fluctuations is progres- sively taken into account during the flow by the effective potential Vk (x) experienced by the particle, which is al- tered compared to the bare, fundamental potential V (x). Wavefunction Renormalisation (WFR) involves a second function Zk(x) which can be interpreted as a redefini- tion of position x -> Z(x). These are also known as the first two (leading and subleading) orders in a gradient expansion of T.
835g | In Sec. IV we derive the effective equations of motion (EEOM) through variational derivatives of the effective action T. We do this first for the one point function, or average position x, whose equation of motion simply reduces to an over-damped equation in an effective poten- tial with no noise i.e. purely classical. We then obtain an equation for the evolution of the two point function; this Green's function equation allows us to solve for the Vari- ance and Covariance of the stochastic process. Solutions to these deterministic equations with appropriate initial conditions can then approximate the relaxation towards equilibrium.
x3l9 | In Sec. V we present numerical solutions to the flow equations for three types of potential: a simple polyno- mial one, an unequal LJ type potential and a "rugged" potential consisting of an underlying harmonic x2 poten- tial with the addition of six Gaussian bumps and dips. We also consider different temperatures, effectively con- trolling the strength of thermal fluctuations compared to the classical force. Naturally, we find that the end results of the flow equations differ, with higher tempera- tures resulting in potentials that carry less memory of the bare potentials' morphology. In section VI the numerical solution of the LPA flow equation accurately reproduces static equilibrium quantities, as it should. We also exam- ine the characteristic decay behaviour of the connected 2-point function (x(0)x(t)) or covariance at equilibrium by utilizing both the effective potential Vk->0 and the WFR function Zk-10 and find good agreement with exact results down to relatively low temperatures when devia- tions start becoming pronounced.
d2fj | In Sec. VII we examine how well the LPA + WFR approximation to the effective action can handle relax- ation towards equilibrium in our potentials starting from a fixed initial condition (Pini (x) = 8(x - Xini)). Numer- ical solutions to the EEOM for the one- and two-point functions are compared to direct numerical simulation of equation (4) and/or numerical solutions to the Fokker Planck equation. We find that under the LPA + WFR approximations, the fRG solutions give a good descrip- tion of the relaxational evolution and are able to capture overshoots of the variance in the potentials we exam- ine. Similarly to equilibrium, the approximations fare
geyi | worse as the temperature is decreased and the classical force determined by the potential's slope becomes dom- inant. We suggest that this behaviour is correlated to the spectral decomposition of the relaxation in terms of eigenvalues of the relevant Fokker-Planck operator: the more the spectral decomposition of <LATEX>\langle x \left( t \right) \rangle ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\langle x \left( t _ { \mathrm { i n i } } \right) x \left( t \right) \rangle</LATEX> and <LATEX>\langle x ^ { 2 } \left( t \right) \rangle</LATEX> is shifted towards lower eigenvalues, the bet- ter the <LATEX>\mathrm { L P A + W F R }</LATEX> approximation performs.
2181 | We conclude in Sec. VIII. Appendix A derives the zero- dimensional analogue of the Wetterich equation (1) for the effective potential corresponding to the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution while in Appendix B we include a derivation of the solution of (113) that provides the two- point function. In Appendix <LATEX>\mathrm { C }</LATEX> we explicitly show that the determinant appearing in the path integral directly follows from the boundary conditions imposed in II A.
9ubl | II. BROWNIAN MOTION AS SUPERSYMMETRIC QUANTUM MECHANICS
o8pj | This section reviews Brownian motion and its path in- tegral formulation in terms of the action functional of Su- persymmetric Quantum Mechanics. In the next section we will exploit this link to derive the RG flow equations.
27b9 | Brownian motion for a single particle of mass <LATEX>m</LATEX> mov- ing in a potential <LATEX>\bar { V } \left( x \right) ,</LATEX> coupled to an external heat bath with temperature <LATEX>T ,</LATEX> can be described by the Langevin equation:

yi97 | <LATEX>\langle f \left( t \right) f \left( t ^ { \prime } \right) \rangle = 2 D \gamma ^ { 2 } \delta \left( t - t ^ { \prime } \right)</LATEX> (3)
4zj7 | where <LATEX>\gamma</LATEX> is a frictional coefficient, <LATEX>f \left( t \right)</LATEX> is a gaussian "noise" term and <LATEX>V \left( x \right)</LATEX> is the potential in which the par- ticle moves. <LATEX>D = k _ { b } T / \gamma</LATEX> is the diffusion constant, given so as to match <LATEX>t h e</LATEX> Boltzmann equilibrium distribution (should an equilibrium state exists). Hereafter, we will be concerned with the overdamped limit:

uvo3 | to which the system settles over a timescale <LATEX>\varepsilon \equiv m / \gamma</LATEX> which we assume to be short. Note that the overdamped equations are a consistent approximation to the full dy- namics as long as
yjbv | <LATEX>\varepsilon ^ { 2 } V ^ { \prime \prime } \ll 1 .</LATEX> We will be examining the impact of changing the tem- perature, and hence changing the strength of the fluctu- ating force n, on the coarse-grained effective theory. Let us therefore introduce a reference temperature <LATEX>T _ { 0 }</LATEX> and a dimensionless parameter <LATEX>\Upsilon</LATEX> which allows us to dial the temperature around <LATEX>T _ { 0 } .</LATEX> Writing <LATEX>D = D _ { 0 } \Upsilon ,</LATEX> we further define dimensionless variables
