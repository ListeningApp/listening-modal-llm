        "content": "ba4l | Because the two sets of leadership skills in a duality comprise opposite approaches, managers can experience tension between them or even see them as contradictory or incompatible. The challenge for the versatile leader is thus to meet what F. Scott Fitzgerald called \"the test of a first-rate intelligence\": to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function. That challenge is all the greater, given that most leaders will have to overcome their bias in favor of one of the ideas and against the other. This notion of versatility is not to be mistaken as moderation in all things. It simply denotes a wide and flexible range of behaviors, which can indeed include immoderate behavior when extreme circumstances require it.\nffx8 | Versatility pays off. Our research found a close association between versatility, as measured by our three hundred sixty-degree questionnaire, and overall effectiveness. In every sample of senior managers we have studied, we found substantial correlations between ratings of effectiveness and versatility on both the forceful-enabling and strategic-operational dualities. These strong statistical relationships reflect the fact that versatile managers are consistently regarded as the most effective leaders in their organizations.\ns6su | Our data also revealed that, in addition to versatile and lopsided, there is a third, less prevalent leadership pattern: what might be called the \"disengaged leader,\" one who underdoes both sides of a duality. Disengaged leadership is associated with the lowest ratings of effectiveness.\ny219 | The Root Causes of Imbalance\n06ht | The fact that so many managers are lopsided on one or another duality raises the question: What throws off their behavior?\nv3r2 | Uneven Skill Development Imbalance can be a function of something as straightforward as overdeveloping one side (hypertrophy) and neglecting to develop the other (atrophy). For example, when a manager is repeatedly given the same type of assignment because of his or her obvious strengths in that area, it can deprive that manager of the opportunity to round out his or her repertoire. Also, the skills most critical to success on the lower levels of an organization - forceful and operational leadership - tend to be well developed in managers and are consequently overused as those managers rise to more senior levels. Similarly, the strategic and enabling skills that can be crucial at in upper management tend to be underdeveloped in freshly minted senior managers.\nnv42 | Skewed Mental Models All managers operate on the basis of assumptions, beliefs, values and attitudes. When these notions are uninformed, untrue or otherwise distorted, they in turn distort the leader's behavior. The least problematic case occurs\nxags | when an executive fails to realize that the skills that earned her a senior-level position are not the same as those required in that position - that she is, for example, no longer responsible for actually doing research and development or marketing but for orchestrating the efforts of those who are.\njc47 | Overgeneralizations also tilt leaders toward imbalance. For instance, a manager who interprets his employees' need for autonomy as a mandate to be completely hands-off will often give his staff plenty of latitude to do their jobs but not make himself sufficiently available to provide technical assistance or emotional support; an executive with a core belief in \"putting others first\" may listen extraordinarily well but have a difficult time articulating her own views with the conviction that his staff is looking for; a manager with an exaggerated fear of overstepping bounds can be accommodating to his peers but inhibited from fighting for the resources that his or her unit needs.\nko3c | One-Sided Values An executive will tend to underemphasize certain skills and approaches that he simply does not deem important or part of his job. We have seen many executives give short shrift to the operational aspects of their jobs because they characterize such attentiveness as being \"consumed with details,\" whereas they envision that their mandate is dealing with strategic considerations. They believe they no longer need to follow up or follow through, and they have yet to discover that those functions simply take on a different character in higher-level positions.\nxek3 | Executives also tend to overdo those things on which they place a premium. Those who are goal-oriented and focused sharply on hitting their targets see all too clearly how important it is to get things done, but they may overlook the strategic question of whether the right things are getting done. It is difficult for them to see how something they believe in deeply can be taken too far. It is only when they are asked to consider what goals and functions are being neglected because of their extreme behaviors that the problem begins to come into focus.\nbbpr | Fear of Inadequacy A good deal of out-of-balance leadership results from the fear of being inadequate or incompetent even though, in our experience, most executives tend to underestimate their true abilities. Managers will avoid things they believe they are not good at, such as public speaking or dealing with technical issues such as information systems or even e-mail. We have seen executives isolate themselves because they are insecure about their ability to relate to other people, or they shy away from strategy because they fear they are intellectually inadequate. Of course, this sets up a self-fulfilling prophecy: Managers who avoid certain approaches because of self-perceived deficiencies forgo the opportunity to improve.\n5zyf | Ironically, underestimating oneself can also lead to overdoing certain behaviors. Managers who privately underrate their\n9own | Leadership Models and Measures as an Organizational Intervention\nbqfb | Organizations regularly adopt leadership models to reinforce or change their leadership culture. If such a model is to send a message, it must be compact and clear, which the oft-used long lists of competencies - however worthy - are not. A list ought to be short enough to be remembered, and the desired leadership qualities should be significant enough to make an impression on managers. It also helps if the list is integrated. The unifying principle that we favor is versatility, the capacity to strike balances between opposite types of leadership. This has the added advantage of reflecting the real tensions and trade-offs that make the job of management a balancing act. What organization doesn't, for example, need to strike a balance between strategic leadership and operational leadership - between positioning the organization for the future and executing its short-term objectives? How many organizations are trying to be more customer-oriented and less internally oriented?\nwwdt | In any of these or similarly paired objectives, imbalance, by definition, is doing too much of one of them. Competency models, which are predicated on\nmn1r | own competence, for instance, are liable to put pressure on themselves to demonstrate their value at every opportunity, depriving their staff of the chance to answer their own questions or solve their own problems. Others who believe they are not well liked may ignore subordinates' performance problems. Indeed, many of the excesses in managerial behavior are compensatory.\n5vqw | The tendency to do too much is often linked to a concern about doing too little. Driven people, for example, lack objectivity about what is reasonable to expect of themselves and others. The literature on perfectionism is replete with insights into this phenomenon. Managers who take too much responsibility are privately afraid that they will not take enough. Those who take too much power may harbor a mistaken sense of themselves as relatively powerless. Individuals who intimidate others intellectually are surprised to hear that said about themselves, because they actually feel intellectually inadequate.\nmeyw | the idea of leveraging strengths but have no way of assessing overleveraging, simply cannot detect when a leadership strength is being corrupted through indiscriminate application. Yet organizations and individuals regularly fall prey to this problem. To determine how balanced (or out of balance) individual managers or an organization's management team may be requires a measure that can capture and express overdoing.",
