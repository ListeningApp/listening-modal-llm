Combining these results we obtain\nuvvk | Forty-two\nmdnj | F of x sub K plus one minus F of x sub K is less than negative C sub one two epsilon sub G to the three halves, where\nmwy0 | C sub one two is defined as rho over two times the minimum of one, the minimum of one and sigma, and the minimum of two times one minus rho over L sub G and one.\nhg8q | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimization with Nonnegativity Constraints\nrcyg | Type Two Step: For K in script K sub two one, we can apply the norm of G sub K plus one superscript script I sub K plus one is greater than epsilon sub G to further refine the bound for the SOL case. Note that because delta sub K equals delta sub K plus one equals epsilon sub G to the one half, and a Type Two step is taken, script N script I of x sub K plus one, epsilon sub G to the one half is a subset of script I of x sub K, epsilon sub G to the one half. Indeed, if\nbj8l | I is in script A of x sub K, epsilon sub G to the one half, we have P sub K superscript I equals zero and hence x sub K plus one superscript I equals x sub K superscript I is less than or equal to epsilon sub G to the one half, and script A of x sub K, epsilon sub G to the one half is a subset of script A of x sub K plus one, epsilon sub G to the one half. Together these results imply that\ncygk | Epsilon sub G is less than the norm of G sub K plus one superscript script I sub K plus one is less than or equal to the norm of G sub K plus one superscript script I sub K.
