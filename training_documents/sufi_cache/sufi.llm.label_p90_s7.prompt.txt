You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

37xs | 20. If you are lazy, count yourself lucky if someone points this out, giving you a chance to improve. Laziness is always your fault. It is the sign that a man has persevered in uselessness for too long.
hoi0 | These points are in fact exercises in outwitting the false self, which thrives on smaller satisfactions. The Sufi aims at Tana (passing away-of the False Self) and Baga (remaining - of the Real). Behind the supposed 'I', which is impermanent, lies the real one, which is characterised by the awareness of truth, of reality.
tffb | And listen to the words of Junaid of Baghdad, when he said: 'A good-natured sensualist is better than a bad-tempered so-called Sufi.'

2tj1 | Things of the World
nbhq | An Eastern Sage and the Newspapers
w251 | LETTER TO A SAGE
1vgx | A WESTERN student of the spiritual wrote a fierce and reproving letter to a certain Eastern sage, when he saw his name in a news- paper. "You should be completely unconcerned with the things of this world!' he said - and much else.
yjnk | When I visited the sage, I asked him what he had thought of the letter, as I wanted to report his reaction to the writer of it
9zmh | 'I do get letters, it is true,' he murmured, 'but I am afraid I do not read them, because, you see, they are things of this world, and I am not concerned with them.'
mi3g | 'Things of this world' include, according to the Sufis, anything other than Truth.
ntjg | CONDUCT OF THE SUFIS
86at | The conduct of Sufis does not necessarily show their degree of detachment. It more often shows what the observer imagines it to show. Shaikh Yahia Munir, in common with many authorities, states that the behaviour of the realised Sufis (the Auliyya) are not all the same in appearance. Some eat well and sleep; others fast and stay awake at night; some are clothed in rags, others in excellent clothes. Some accept gifts, others do not. Those who judge others by such appearances are called, by the Sufis, 'people of externals'.
bpd2 | Such judgments are made by people whose emotional life has expanded at the expense of their humanity, their logical capacities and certainly their spiritual perceptions.
hkd8 | TAKING THE NAME OF GOD ...
sptg | The dilemma of people who only use words, and not full under- standing, for their religious conceptions, is well illustrated in this story - the one of the fruit - from Rumi's Fihi ma Fihi:
2k40 | 95
krk7 | Someone took some fruit from a tree and ate it. The lord of the property said to him: 'Why do you do such an unlawful thing? Do you not fear God?'
4tyc | The fruit-eater replied: "Why should I? the tree is God's, and I am God's servant, eating from God's tree.'
2mjl | The owner said: * Wait, and I will give you your answer.'
6d9q | He had the other man tied to the tree and beaten.
wsc1 | The man cried out: 'Do you not fear God [that you do this to me]?'
or3l | The landlord said: 'Why should I fear? You are the servant of God, and this, this stick which is God's is being used to strike God's servant!'
fbyc | Just as intellectual and systematised religious argument fails when brought into a broader context, so do even wider religious concepts fail when compared with the extradimensional perception of Truth which the Sufis bring to human experience. That is the message of all the Sufi sages.
vceo | 96
kd78 | Basis for Peoples Interest
896u | SOMEONE wants to know how it is that it is difficult to get to see me. He also wants to publicise my 'spiritual attainments'.
o0si | I'll tell you, about both.
1fx8 | It is not either easy or difficult, it is more likely to be a matter of figures. Just as it would be with anyone.
tfms | Taking an eight-hour day and seven-day week, we find that in a year if one sees one person each hour; in daily session and doing nothing else, giving one-hour interviews, I could see just under three thousand people a year, and each one only once.
pfv5 | But something between three and ten times that number of people express a desire to 'see me'. And, if every year you saw each person only twice, you would only be able to see around one and a half thousand people.
8gxa | Although the subject is always supposed to be important, I note that the urgency drops off, mysteriously, on holidays and during Summer vacations ...
fsvi | Mind you, if I were doing nothing else but seeing all comers for an hour a day, the procedure would carry the makings of its own solution. This is because I would become so boring, so worn out, so useless, that people would want to see me less and less, and so I would eventually retrieve my freedom.
068d | So, rather than have to go through this, why should I not carry on and remain at the position where I am anyway?
ysz7 | Especially since there are adequate supplies of other people who are delighted to be surrounded by troops and groups of people imbibing their wisdom from morning to night.
k5db | I have been criticised for saying this. It is said that such people always create dissatisfaction among the majority of their followers, who soon switch to the next guru. Exactly what I mean: if I were to behave in this way, I would also create dissatisfaction, when people had had enough of my ritual of sitting about being the great guru.
7jzh | 97
vm00 | I have neither the inclination nor the training to enrol myself in the guru circuit.
62qe | The foregoing, of course, looks upon the 'seeing people' activity as a socio-psychological activity, already adequately observed by sociologists but entirely ignored by the occult-minded: except when they confuse it with a 'spiritual activity', which it most certainly is not.
ypz9 | In my own experience, amply confirming that of the tradi- tional Sufi authors, this clustering around will have to be justified by the clusterers as a 'spiritual activity'. The onus is on them to do so; or else to seek out their natural affinities: the seekers of adulation whose main other characteristic so often seems to be that they cannot bear to be alone for very long.
mpml | In my youth a teacher said to me: 'If collecting together were the way to greater enlightenment, grains of sand would all have become saints, flocks of birds would break up and each one would become a spiritual teacher, sheep would exercise the functions of the enlightened. Similarly, the characteristic which we see in the least enlightened to crowd around things and people deemed to be strange, valuable or exciting would not be gatherings of gapers but, rather, assemblies of the elect. . . '
imnm | SHEIKH ABU-ISHAQ'S FRIENDS
8na8 | As to 'spiritual attainments', I am reminded of the words which Sheikh Abu-Ishaq of the Green Island, near Algeciras in Spain, spoke to Ibn Arabi and reported in his twelfth-century Durrat al-Fakhira:
ul2a | 'I regard people as of two types. First there is the friend who has a good opinion of me and speaks well of me. He is a friend. Then there is the person who speaks badly of me, who tells of my "spiritual condition".'
4eaf | Thinking in Terms of Supplj-and-Demand
4b6k | Q: If people interested in spiritual things are asking what are in fact 'commercial' questions, is that the fault of the people or of the systems? How does your range of questioners compare with those received by others working in the spiritual field?
hxiu | A: This is several questions in one. First, people have been trained to think in crude supply-and-demand terms about almost everything. This is due to the culture and social outlook, so it is hard to call it the fault of the people or of the systems which they are approaching with questions.
1ylw | Second, if you read published literature by people working in the spiritual field from the supply-and-demand analysis point of view, you might be amazed to find that in general neither the questioner nor the spiritual man seems to be aware that they are engaged upon 'commercial type' transactions.
waqw | Third, discussions with professional people, such as doctors and lawyers, shows that they get the same kind of questions, structur- ally supply-and-demand questions, from their clients; and, indeed, the whole range of annoyances and subjectivities of which I have been speaking. This is so well understood by real teachers in the East that it is summed up in the joke: 'So-and-so went to a certain teacher for conversation, but all he got was illumination!'
nf6a | Q: Are your books designed, then, to 'fill in' gaps in possible behaviour-patterns in people approaching Sufism?
5g96 | A: On the general level, they all carry this design, and the result of asking interested people to read them carefully has been to establish and maintain, successfully, a basis of holding a view- point which would otherwise need monastic circumstances to reveal and develop.
d1y5 | 99
rl20 | Q: What other activities do you employ, in addition to your books?
t91r | A: An enormous range. But these activities, many of which, though traditional among Sufis, would be unrecognisable as spiri- tual by narrowly conditioned people, are experienced following the grouping of the books, and in specific measure: 'prescribed', as it were, for the needs of the people. Thus they are not susceptible to descriptions like listing them, or writing about them.
7s4b | KNOWLEDGE AS ACTION
ehif | People who deal with spiritual matters as if they were commercial questions, people who seek behaviour-patterns as in the second question, the query about activities, are all, I think, due to en- quiries based on the desire for action. To the degree to which this is true, we should note what Sheikh Ibrahim Gazur-i-Ilahi says about the matter of knowledge and action: how action cannot take place without knowledge.
buv0 | He stresses that 'People argue about whether knowledge or action should come first. But they are the same. [Worthwhile] action is in fact knowledge in operation. Right action stems from right knowledge. Right knowledge is acquired through the teacher.'
wqqa | AN INFURIATING BOOK
www8 | One of the few instances where we can quote the operation of a non-book as an instrument, yet bridge the area of literature, is in the case of The Book of the Book. This tale, which I published in the form of a book, tells how people become disappointed by books, and how they can learn from them what is and is not in them. Critics were furious because the story was so short, as they assumed that a book must be of a certain length. This fury over- took them before they had read the contents, which described their behaviour and showed how inadequate it was. This gave us-and many other people as well - published evidence of the mentality of literary people and literal thinkers which they would never have admitted to if directly challenged. We let them do it for us. This shows how a book can be used to create a situation.
zhvt | The Effect of Tales and Narratives
yv1q | Q: You have published several hundred tales and narratives, mostly from the Middle East, illustrative of situations which often show strengths and weaknesses in people. Why do you export this material from other cultures, instead of producing it in current terms, and what effect is it having on the Western world, if it is not simply promoting 'Eastern Wisdom'?
u7jx | A: This material is well developed as an instructional medium in the East; so it would not be good sense to attempt to improve on or substitute for something which is tested and effective. Take it the other way around: people in the East do not usually try to invent radio for themselves just because it was invented in, and imported from, the West
03u9 | The effect which our material is having in the Western world is already extensively written about by people in the West who say that they find it useful, and I must refer you on this point to these people.
8sqd | Another reason why we have not been using material from the West is that until recendy we have not had a home-grown product, sufficient material of this kind, to recycle.
vlyz | Even if we had been able to collect it, its reception, due to established patterns of disdain for narrative instruction, would not have given it a fair chance. Only after indicating its usage, vitility and durability in certain cultures which have found it useful could we induce people elsewhere to look for the local product and- above all - make use of it.
5034 | We have had to re-open the question of the possible value of tales, stories, jokes and narrative, and hold this door open in the face of a long-standing Western convention that such material is only of entertainment value. What has happened is that the equivalent of a technological infra-structure, or a basic literacy in this field, is being established in the West
9lvu | But you should not assume, merely because you are living and
uy7a | IOI
lqs6 | studying in the West, that (a) this material is intended only for the West: because it has also had a phenomenal success in the East; or that (b) people in the East have not had to go through a similar retrieval and refamiliarisauon process to enable them to reclaim the non-entertainment content in these artefacts of their own cultures.
ri4s | Indeed, in the East as in the West there are still many people who are unable to adjust to the restoration of extra and educa- tional dimensions in the material. It is fair to say that whereas in general the West has only recently acquired the time, energy, flexibility and variety of curiosity to examine the materials in the manner intended by its original producers, so - again in general - the East has tended to have forgotten the attributions, depth, content and structures in which it was traditionally presented.
2j8o | Sections of both communities have been coming to a fresh understanding of the materials; sections of each remain, largely for reasons of personal insecurity and attachment to over-simplified ideologies, uninterested or hostile.
qrl1 | It is further worth noting that much of Western religion and tradition is thoroughly saturated with Eastern tales and stories, many of them, according to Sufis, originally tales of inner mean- ing, now taken as literal truth or only analogy. And tales and stories are almost the only cultural phenomenon which are found as the property of all peoples of the world, not belonging, strictly speaking, to anyone.
uvvk | OPPOSITION TO ARABI
mdnj | Ibn Arabi taught through what was apparently love-poetry, and people became bitterly hostile towards him. This behaviour of theirs was due to their inability to understand the projection which he was using, not to the reality of their imaginings. But their suppositions about him and his work were firmly believed by them to represent the truth, to be factual in nature. In his case, he was able to teach them further by providing a commentary which satisfied them and caused them to hail him as a great mystic. But in so doing, since they had not arrived at this understanding through inward and personal perception, they were cut off from
mwy0 | 102
hg8q | the benefits of the material's actual use within themselves. They were only intellectually and emotionally satisfied. Their perception of him was limited to a reassurance that his ideas did not conflict with their own ingrained beliefs.
rcyg | It is this mentality of what is in fact superficial assessment which causes the poverty of potential understanding in people who seek only explanation and not perceptions.
bj8l | 103
cygk | Stories of the Miraculous
rtk7 | Q: Are the 'miraculous' stories of the doings of Sufis literally true, or are they designed to illustrate structures equivalent to what may happen, or are they intended to make people credulous or to 'think in a new way?'
1wc3 | A: The answer is the same as the answer to such a question as 'Is a carrot yellow, is it intended to give nourishment, or to propagate itself, or to make up stories about?' The truth is that, under the right circumstances all of the factors may be true, according to what use is made of them.
