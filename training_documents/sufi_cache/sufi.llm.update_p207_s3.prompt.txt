You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

zpgh | A: Greed is the cause of loss and of the inability to profit from apparent gain. This is as true in metaphysics as in ordinary life. But one individual's greed may benefit others - though this effect does not concern him, and does not give him anything.
jged | An ancient tale, still current, puts all this into a more memorable form:
4ql4 | TALE OF THE VILLAGER
nd7r | There was once a brave villager who had not overcome his attachment to non-essentials. One day he was riding his donkey past a magical cave at the precise moment when it made one of its periodical appearances to humanity. Boldly entering, he found piles of treasure, which he took outside and stuffed into his saddle- bags. When the donkey was fully loaded, the man remembered that he had left his stick behind, and he ran back into the cave to retrieve it. But the time for the cave to vanish again had arrived. No sooner was he within than it disappeared, with him inside.
lc23 | The man was never seen again, and his donkey wandered back to the village. After waiting for him to return, the people sold the donkey and its burden and enriched themselves ...
97qm | Sufis and Scholars
m0gn | Q. What is the traditional Sufi objection to certain types of scholars, academic pedants as you have called them, based upon?
ei3g | A: These scholars may often be regarded as decorative and useful people. Their decorative and utilitarian aspects, however, should be clearly perceived, in accordance with the principle that misunderstandings and distortions always occur when something is not defined which could be defined.
prvf | They frequently desire attention, and do all they can to get it. They do not seek to propagate their ideas so much as to require that people think that they are being scholars. I am constantly approached by eminent ones begging me to cite their works, because citations mean importance. This activity is part of their desire to be seen, the self-display aspect. Again, some of them are jealous of special clothes and other appurtenances, and rituals of all kinds, which contribute towards their visibility. This charac- teristic is observed also in other human groups, in certain animals and birds and is not in itself to be considered undesirable, even if only because we gain some pleasure from such displays.
x9zu | Like containers, and permutation, accumulation and analysis agents of various kinds, they are able for the most part, to hold, to preserve, even to pass on - but not to effect any real change in - the materials with which they are concerned. A limited scholar who translates a book, for instance, may be giving its contents to someone who can absorb it, like a jug which contains water which will ultimately be drunk by others.
sc74 | Scholars of the lesser sort, however, being human and not animal or inanimate, sometimes tend to confuse their own desires with their real effect and possible functions. This is only because they may have an image of themselves which has been fostered without being investigated. As one of them said in this very room to some of us the other day, 'We just can't help it!'
ag3w | Investigated it may not be, but it is observed. It is from Oxford, not the Sufis, that the joke comes: 'I am the Master of Balliol College: and what I don't know can't be knowledge!'
8rx3 | Scholars cannot readily be studied by other scholars, who are by virtue of their involvement unlikely to be able to attain sufficient objectivity.
vigw | Scholars, however, can be studied by Sufis. There are in- numerable Sufis who have once been scholars: but there is no single Sufi known to us, perhaps to all history, who has subse- quently become a scholar. Scholarship, therefore, may be regarded as a stage after which one may become a Sufi.
2yjn | Sufis never have followed scholars, though they have frequently equalled or excelled scholars in scholarship.
twai | Sufis can do this because they do not regard scholarship as an end but as something useful: with the advantages and limitations corresponding to this function. Scholars, quite often, do not show signs of understanding that there is anything beyond scholarship, and therefore they are incapacitated - while they remain at this stage - from being able to have a higher objective. One must always have an aspiration higher than one's actual status in order to rise, even in an existing field.
x182 | Such scholars, because they cannot move beyond their concep- tion of scholarship, are driven to believe and to practise two things:
8ive | 1. They tend to make themselves believe that scholarship is of the highest nature among things and that scholars are a high, even special, product with some kind of property-interest in truth or even a peculiar, perhaps unique, capacity to perceive it. The historical records of scholars in this respect, not to mention their individual experiences in being refuted by events, do not daunt them.
viy0 | 2. Because they know inwardly that this posture of theirs is not true, those of them in the appropriate field are compelled to resort to the study of the work of their opponents (the Sufis). This is why scholars study the works of Sufis, but Sufis do not have to study the works of scholars, as one Sufi has cogently remarked.
rbpd | This tendency of the lower attempting to emulate the higher in
t47e | spjte of disabling limitations is evidenced in the behaviour of children, animals and other less-developed or insecure individuals. Small boys pretend that they are adults, or else study what they imagine adults to be doing or saying. In the process they quite naturally refrain from allowing themselves to register the adults' assertion that boys are still only boys.
uh5v | It is appropriate to stress here that, whereas a child may grow up, a man does not become an immature boy again. The scholar is too naive (in knowledge, if not in contentiousness) for any Sufi to become one of the type we are describing. This stage the Sufi has already passed, if he needed to pass through it.
d1ju | When a child does not properly grow up, he will either be an unformed, infantile man, or else he may die. The alternatives to progress are these two. What he imagines about himself, or what he manages to convince others about himself, do not affect the reality of the situation, though they may affect opinions as to the nature of the reality. Few people will disagree that there is a difference between the reality, the observed fact, and the supposed facts created by opinion and maintained by constant repetition.
m5zf | Any careful study of academic work will show how surprisingly often there is an unawareness, for instance, of the difference be- tween polemic and informational communication.
hh2k | The Sufi's opposition to the scholar is not any opposition to scholarship. It is an opposition to regarding scholarship as some- thing which it is not. If, for instance, one were to believe that bread and milk were the only true and valuable forms of food, it could mean that those who ate bread and milk might imagine that they had perceived and were operating at the apogee of nutrition. On the other hand, where there are other nutritions available, and when these are superior in some or many respects to those which are only supposed to be the solitary or best ones, a critical situation exists.
oa8c | The other objection which the Sufi traditionally makes is in the best interests of the scholar and his followers. It is widely known that an erroneous belief about oneself, particularly a fantasy that one is more important than one really is, can have an un- pleasant and destructive effect upon an individual and on those who may rely upon him. To ignore such scholastic imaginings

twxo | when in a position to comment upon them in a salutary manner is tantamount to allowing a person to damage himself and others- whether this damage arises through ignorance or malice. All social requirements of virtually all communities are unanimous in disallowing such a situation as this to pass unremarked, once it has been observed.
