You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

5vqw | "I'm sorry sir, our underwriting team-"

2e62 | "Sir, it's not up to me it's just our pol-"
75y3 | "What am I gonna tell my salesman, who has a baby and another on the way? Are you going to tell him he's not going to be able to buy his pregnant wife and newborn food? Are you going to pay his mortgage for him?" I was seething.
s2g2 | "Sir-" he began again, with unphased apathy, just trying to deliver the news.
q1q2 | "It's not yours to take." My aggression was quickly turning into desperation. "Shit, just send me half so I can pay my employees," I pleaded "It's Christmas Eve for fuck's sake."
cb7r | "Sir, we're going to be holding onto the entirety of your funds for the next six months per your agreement . . . " The voice faded into the distance.
68xu | Fuck.
hd35 | I hung up and checked my accounts. $23,036.
2zpk | I owed my salesman a $22,000 commission check for $120,000 in sales I never got. Without wanting to give myself the opportunity to think about it, I wired it to him.

k78w | I screenshotted this image of my bank account because I knew I would tell this story some day.
g9du | The sunlight blinded me as we emerged from the matinee. Families shuffled in and out through the revolving doors, making their happy memories. I was in a daze. Leila led me to the car, her hand wrapped firmly around mine.
f682 | "What's wrong? What happened?" she asked.
li1k | "The money isn't coming."
pbea | "What do you mean?" she asked. "It's delayed?"
ccpt | I exhaled in defeat. "They are keeping it all."
0fpw | "Can they do that !? "
dqn8 | "Apparently," I said stoically, trying to maintain my composure in front of her parents.
cop0 | "What are you gonna do about the commissions?"
lhkq | "I already paid him. Everything." I said it without looking at her.
82ju | Leila's concern turned to dread.
y2qo | We sat in silence the whole way home. I stared out the window. She held my hand in hers. It was more comforting than I anticipated. We'll get through this.
1piq | 30 days earlier . . .
7fqw | I had decided to go all in on this new business I called "Gym Launch." Here was the idea: I would fly around the country to gyms and fill them up to full capacity using this new methodology that hinged on an offer I had perfected when I owned my chain of gyms.
rhaz | Leading up to this moment, I had sold five of my six gyms. The funds from selling them, my life's work, I had put into an account I had with a new partner. This money was supposed to be the seed money for our new company.
wak1 | I was finally going to realize some level of success.
wtfz | My alarm went off. I groggily swung my arm over blindly clawing at the bedside table. I switched off the alarm, while Leila managed to sleep through the commotion.
qy1i | I laid there silently, pulling up the bank accounts - a daily ritual. The balance said $300.
1k9e | Wait. That couldn't be right. There was $46,000 in here yesterday.
5bjs | My adrenaline surged. Looking closer I saw "-$45,700 Payment Successful." I was frantic.
uodj | The money from selling all of my gyms was gone. I checked where the money went. To my "partner." He had taken all the money out.
k16v | Fuck.
b2lm | The last four years of my life had vanished that fast. I officially had nothing, and even less to show for it. No gyms. No equipment. No employees. Nothing.
ti7f | I felt dead inside.
oksu | Adding insult to injury, in that same 30-day period, my mother was in critical condition because of a near fatal accident (and was still under 24-hour supervision), and I had totalled my car in a head on collision at 60 miles per hour and earned a DUI as my consolation prize.
wtow | This was the cherry on top. My one saving grace during this time was selling a new "challenge offer" at a gym and collecting all the cash up front as my "fee" for turning their business around.
o22k | So I did the only thing I knew. I sold. My salesman had done $120,000 in a single month, and I owed him a $22,000 commission check.
nwfz | The problem was the $120,000 never came.
nvfy | "We need to talk," I said as Leila and I went into the other room. I worked up the courage to speak but stared at the floor, embarrassed.
mror | "I've got nothing," I said to her. "I'm a sinking ship, and you don't have to stay with me."
zlxc | She grabbed my chin and pulled my face towards hers so she could look into my eyes: "I would sleep with you under a bridge if it came to that." I would have cried tears of joy, but I was so emotionally exhausted my response appeared apathetic.
k0bw | I wouldn't stay with me.
aq5a | "Are we still gonna do these launches starting tomorrow?" She asked. "All my friends quit their jobs to do this." She was being matter of fact, but it still stung. I felt defeated. "Listen, this could go horribly wrong, "
sc5y | "I trust you. We'll figure it out."
0yab | I had two things left at that point: a grand slam offer and an old business credit card with a $100,000 limit from when I had my gyms.
w95z | On the day after Christmas (two days after the gut-wrenching call with the payment processor) we were scheduled to launch six new gyms . . . at the same time. Between airfare, hotels, rental cars, gas, and ad spend (all multiplied by six), I was going to be spending $3,300 per day of money I didn't have. My last dollar had gone to paying my salesman. I still remember my hand shaking as the advertisements went live: Off-> ON.
0i1k | Just like that, I was going into debt at a rate of $412 dollars per working hour. Just like that, $3,300 per day began getting deducted from my account.
dqlg | -$3,300 . . . I now officially have nothing
p6pq | -$3,300 . . . I now have officially less than nothing
zse6 | -$3,300 . . . I have $10,000 less than nothing
p2n3 | -$3,300 . . . This one decision is going to ruin my future forever.
ohh7 | But things started shaping up. Here's what happened that month (January 2017), as documented by my old processing records I dug up. You can see the month along the left column and the revenue collected that month along the right.

0b39 | We made $100,117! It was just enough to cover the $3,300/day that had been coming off the credit card. It was actually working. I could hardly believe it. I threw the hail mary, and the universe caught it. I went from looking up bankruptcy lawyers to figuring out what to do with $3,000,000 in profits, accrued within the first twelve months. It felt surreal. And in hindsight, it still kind of does.
qecd | By the end of the year we were doing $1,500,000+/mo. Twelve months from then, $4,400,000/mo. Per. Month. Twenty-four months after that, we crossed $120,000,000 in sales, donated $2,000,000 to help fund equal opportunity in low income areas. We met and befriended Arnold Swarzenegger (lifelong hero) and were asked to be board members of his charity After School All Stars.

ukth | Twelve months after that, we now have a portfolio of seven eight-figure, and multi-eight-figure companies across a variety of industries (photography, publishing, fitness, business consulting, beauty) and business types (brick & mortar chains, software, service, e-commerce, training & education). Our portfolio companies now do about $1,600,000 per week (and growing).
kpvt | I say this because I honestly can't believe it. All of this was because of a girl who believed in me, a credit card, and a Grand Slam Offer.
jie2 | I know I teleported you from rags to riches. And the natural question is how? That's what I'm going to use the rest of this book (and remaining books & free courses in this Acquisition.com series) to break down.
d0ik | The skill of making offers saved me from bankruptcy and likely saved my life. I have made so many mistakes in my life. I've made so many bad life decisions. I've hurt people knowingly and mistakenly. I've done bad things with good intentions. I say this because I am human. I don't pretend to have the answers. I have my own demons that I battle everyday. But, despite my many shortcomings, I've still managed to get really good at this one thing . .. and I'd like to share it with you. I can teach you how to build great offers.
0x0s | I don't know who you are (yes, you, the one reading this). But thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for allowing me to do work I find meaningful. Thank you for giving me your most valuable asset - your attention. I promise to do my best to give you a positive return on it.
4exe | Here is your first piece of good news: if you are reading this, then you are already in the top 10 percent. Most people buy stuff and then promptly ignore it. I can also throw out a spoiler: the further you get in the book, the bigger the nuggets become. Just watch.
0myz | This book delivers.
xh3i | The world needs more entrepreneurs. It needs more fighters. It needs more magic. And that's what I'm sharing with you - magic.

kg3t | "Make people an offer so good they would feel stupid saying no."
lvae | TRAVIS JONES
o9sc | I was 23 years old and, to quote Ruth from Ozark, I didn't know "shit about fuck." But there I was, in a Las Vegas penthouse hotel room along with ten business owners learning about marketing and sales ... in my most-fashionable "beast mode" t- shirt (a shirt I had gotten for free, and one of the five shirts I owned at the time).
121u | Truthfully, I was anxious, self-conscious, and thought I was making a huge mistake. I had paid $3,000 of money I didn't have to get a seat at the table. I knew I needed to learn. Everyone there had a business ... except me. I was planning on starting one, a gym.
zh03 | TJ, the organizer, had multiple successful businesses. While going over the agenda, I remember he made an off-hand comment about making $1,000,000 that year.
1mvw | One. Million. Dollars. I was spellbound. I wanna be like this guy. I'll do anything. The problem was, I didn't know what any of them were talking about. KPIs? CPLs? Conversion rates? My head was spinning as I pretended like I knew what they were talking about. But I didn't, and I'm bad at pretending.
6d4s | Between "sessions," TJ found me. He could tell I was in way over my head. TJ was kind, curious, and caring. After a little bit of small talk, he asked me a simple question that changed my life forever . . .
mqah | "Do you want to know the secret to sales?"
xxr8 | I had never sold anything in my life. I had never even read a book on it. I had just recently learned what the term meant (seriously). I leaned forward, intent to download every syllable he spoke right into my brain.
rl4j | I opened my notepad and stared at him with intent. I was ready for the secret.
vz32 | He looked at me soberly and said: "Make people an offer so good they would feel stupid saying no."
ncb0 | I nodded, wrote it down, underlined it, and circled it. And with that, my entire worldview of selling was transformed.
8mp0 | MAKE PEOPLE AN OFFER SO GOOD THEY WOULD FEEL STUPID SAYING NO.
xjyk | My mind began racing. I didn't have to be skilled ... or even any good. I just had to come up with things that anyone would say yes to. The greatest game of my life had begun.
mt0f | What This Book Is About
awab | At some point, every successful business owner was a wantrepreneur. A person full of ideas and frustrated at having potential to spare. Something clicks when they realize the horrible trade they (and so many people) make - trading their freedom for (falsely) perceived security.
ixcc | Their discomfort compounds. And once the discomfort of staying the same surpasses the discomfort of change, they take the leap. I'm going to be an entrepreneur so I can be free. Free to do whatever I want, whenever I want, with whomever I want. Some learned about entrepreneurship through personal development.
8p6h | Others got into it through a franchise.
pmgl | Others bought courses.
90no | And some just said, "F*CK IT. I'm doing it. I'll make it work." And made it work they did.
jt0y | Most of us open up shop with the intention of helping people in some way. Many times, this assistance is in some way related to something that's affected us personally. We set out to "give back" by providing value to others by helping them solve a problem that once plagued us. Then again, sometimes this isn't our way in. In either case, we cling to the dream of making more and being freer than we are now.
qb7o | Many of us thought, naively, that owning a business would be our crowning accomplishment - a final destination - when in reality, it was just the beginning.
oae5 | Somehow, in the transition between "passionate to help others" and "owning my first business," we gradually realized that we don't even know the first thing about business, let alone turning a profit.
s0fl | We may know a lot about our passion, about why we started the business, but that doesn't mean we know anything about succeeding in business. Much to the disappointment of the idealists on the sidelines, succeeding in business means getting prospective customers to trade us money for our services. Our passion for their hard-earned coins. That's the agreement. The only way to facilitate that exchange, to transact, to literally carry out business as a business is by making the prospect an offer.
43ia | What's An Offer Anyways?
3g2y | The only way to conduct business is through a value exchange, a trade of dollars for value. The offer is what initiates this trade. In a nutshell, the offer is the goods and services you agree to give or provide, how you accept payment, and the terms of the agreement. It is what begins the process of getting customers and making money. It is the first thing any new customer will interact with in your business. Since the offer is what attracts new customers, it is the lifeblood of your business.
gc7v | No offer? No business. No life.
wqfv | Bad offer? Negative profit. No business. Miserable life.
j30a | Decent offer? No profit. Stagnating business. Stagnating life.
7bdk | Good offer? Some profit. Okay business. Okay life.
fim0 | Grand Slam Offer? Fantastic profit. Insane business. Freedom.
