You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

c6hh | Therapeutic Hyperthermia Is Associated
y7ea | With Improved Survival in Afebrile Critically
nav4 | Patients With Sepsis: A Pilot Randomized Trial
gem8 | OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that forced-air warming of critically ill afe- brile sepsis patients improves immune function compared to standard tempera- ture management.
e8nr | DESIGN: Single-center, prospective, open-label, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: One thousand two hundred-bed academic medical center.
k78w | PATIENTS: Eligible patients were mechanically ventilated septic adults with: 1) a diagnosis of sepsis within 48 hours of enrollment; 2) anticipated need for mechan- ical ventilation of greater than 48 hours; and 3) a maximum temperature less than 38.3℃ within the 24 hours prior to enrollment. Primary exclusion criteria included: immunologic diseases, immune-suppressing medications, and any existing condi- tion sensitive to therapeutic hyperthermia (e.g., brain injury). The primary outcome was monocyte human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression, with secondary outcomes of CD3/CD28-induced interferon gamma (IFN-y) production, mortality, and 28-day hospital-free days.
g9du | INTERVENTIONS: External warming using a forced-air warming blanket for 48 hours, with a goal temperature 1.5℃ above the lowest temperature documented in the previous 24 hours.
f682 | MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We enrolled 56 participants in the study. No differences were observed between the groups in HLA-DR expression (692 vs 2,002; <LATEX>\left. p = 0 . 3 9 6 \right)</LATEX> or IFN-y production (31 vs 69; <LATEX>\left. p = 0 . 6 7 8 \right) .</LATEX> Participants allocated to external warming had lower 28-day mortality (18% vs 43%; absolute risk reduction, 25%; 95% CI, 2-48%) and more 28-day hospital-free days (differ- ence, 2.6 d; 95% CI, 0-11.6).
li1k | CONCLUSIONS: Participants randomized to external forced-air warming did not have a difference in HLA-DR expression or IFN-y production. In this pilot study, however, 28-day mortality was lower in the intervention group. Future research should seek to better elucidate the impact of temperature modulation on immune and nonimmune organ failure pathways in sepsis.
pbea | F ever is a key feature of infection, yet fewer than half of critically ill patients with sepsis have a fever at the time of diagnosis (1-4). Afebrile sepsis patients have up to twice the mortality and are more likely to develop secondary infections than patients with fever, but the reason for these observa- tions is unknown (2-9). Fever may be an adaptive response to infection that is critical for survival. Animal and in vitro studies have shown elevated tem- perature to have beneficial effects on adaptive and innate immunity, including increased antibody production, T-cell activation, macrophage function, and heat shock protein response (10-14).
ccpt | Sepsis is associated with pro- and anti-inflamma- tory mechanisms that can lead to prolonged periods of immunosuppression (15-22). Several biomarkers have been implicated in sepsis-induced immunosuppres- sion, including reduced expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, decreased lipopolysaccharide- induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) pro- duction, decreased anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated interferon gamma (IFN-y) production, and persistent lymphopenia (23). Patients exhibiting persistently de- pressed levels of these immune markers suffer from higher mortality and increased secondary infections compared to patients with intact immunity (24-32). While fever has been associated with immunocompe- tence, the role of temperature itself has not been rigor- ously evaluated.
0fpw | Therapeutic hyperthermia, artificially raising body temperature through external warming, has been used for immunomodulation to treat several types of cancer (33, 34). This strategy is thought to improve function of natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and T cells (33). In addition, perioperative warming has consistently been shown to decrease postoperative infections (35-37). As a whole, these data provide compelling biologic ra- tionale that therapeutic hyperthermia may be an effec- tive treatment for sepsis.
dqn8 | The objective of this trial was to determine whether forced-air warming of critically ill afebrile sepsis patients improves immune function compared to standard temperature management. We hypothesized that warmed patients would exhibit higher levels of HLA-DR expression and CD3/CD28-stimulated IFN-Y production and a reduced prevalence of persistent lymphopenia. We also aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of raising body temperature in critically ill sepsis patients and to evaluate the impact of warming on clinical outcomes.

1piq | Participants
7fqw | This study was conducted in the medical and surgical ICUs of a 1,200-bed tertiary care academic medical center between March 2016 and April 2019. Adult patients admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of se- vere sepsis were screened daily by a study coordinator for inclusion. Severe sepsis was defined according to the 2001 Sepsis Taskforce consensus statement (39), and a post hoc review verified that all included patients met Sepsis-3 criteria (40). Enrollment crite- ria also required participants to be enrolled within 48 hours of sepsis diagnosis (defined as the date/time of the first order for antibiotics), mechanically venti- lated with an expected duration of mechanical ven- tilation greater than 48 hours, receiving continuous pharmacologic sedation with a Richmond Agitation- Sedation Scale less than 0, and having a maximum temperature less than 38.3℃ within the 24 hours prior to enrollment. Exclusion criteria included: his- tory of immunological disease; treatment with im- munosuppressive medications within the previous 6 months; treatment with corticosteroids at a dose of greater than 300 mg/d hydrocortisone or equivalent at the time of enrollment; history of chronic infec- tion with hepatitis B or C virus; contraindications to hyperthermia (e.g., sudden cardiac arrest, acute ischemic stroke, acute coronary syndrome, trau- matic brain injury or spinal cord injury, sickle cell disease, or multiple sclerosis); pregnancy; comfort care treatment status; contraindications to forced-air warming devices per manufacture instructions (i.e., ischemic limbs); or enrollment in another clinical trial. These inclusion/exclusion criteria were selected to maximize participant safety and tolerance of the intervention and to exclude participants in whom immune biomarkers were unreliable or who might be harmed by artificially elevated body temperature. Patients admitted to the ICUs were screened daily and eligible patients were consecutively approached for enrollment.
