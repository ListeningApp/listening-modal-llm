        "content": "svcp | How do modes of existing between life and death affect normative categorizations of the living, the non-living and the dead?\n1k6p | What are the implications of reconfiguring understandings of death to a more ecological frame that accommodates more-than-human lives and deaths?\n949v | How do such challenges alter ethical approaches and values attached to dying and death?\ni5a5 | The contents of this book\n0kul | This volume draws together diverse material-discursive perspectives on socio-ecological networks of the dying and dead. In addition to gathering a wide range of international perspectives - contributors hail from North America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania - this collection showcases a range of theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of death and dying from scholars doing cutting-edge research in death studies, feminist and queer studies, new materialism and waste studies, plant and animal studies, and non-Western or indigenous studies. In so doing, this volume broadens the scope of conventional research on death and dying, and focuses the discussion towards death as a more-than-human affair. Thinking and writing along the themes of mediation, care and power, the collection further challenges normative understandings and categories of life and death.\nrj31 | The organization of edited volumes always involves choices about how best to draw out certain contents by grouping specific chapters in distinct parts, and in particular orders. Recognizing that these choices always take place among a field of possible alternative arrangements, we have organized the book's chapters into three parts, which, respectively, highlight the themes of (One) ontologies and epistemologies of death and dying, (Two) care and remembrance, and (Three) troubling agencies.\nnnf7 | Part One explores how scientific, technological and discursive practices mediate ontologies and epistemologies of death in human bodies, microbial soil communities, waterbodies, and at large scales. These chapters challenge normative understandings of death by exposing the complexity of material and creaturely forms of death and dying, and by critically examining relationships between individual and collective death. The chapters collected in this section also highlight new perspectives occasioned by new medical and funerary technologies, growing concerns about the harmful effects of anthropogenic climate change, and the interests of nonhuman organisms.\ni0m7 | Grounded in fieldwork conducted in a Swiss forensic medicine department that is on the cutting-edge of new postmortem imaging technologies, Céline Schnegg, Séverine Rey and Alejandro Dominguez\nrf6v | INTRODUCTION\ncz3m | explore ontological and epistemological negotiations between conventional autopsy techniques (in situ) and emerging radiological technologies (including MRI and CT scans). Their opening chapter reveals how new imaging technologies are taken up by radiologists and pathologists who are generating and responding to new forms of evidence - even new, onto-epistemic 'realities' of the dead body - as well as new forms of expertise in the morally and legally charged field of forensic investigation. While some postmortem imaging enthusiasts have proposed that new imaging techniques could one day replace conventional autopsy practices, Schnegg et al point out that, in practice, postmortem imaging tends to serve as a compliment to in situ examination, which, for the time being, retains its ascendancy in forensic investigation. In Chapter Two, Philip Olson, too, examines how the development and use of new technologies has challenged normative practices, and how those norms have pushed back against technology-backed challenges. Using discourse analysis to examine long-standing proscriptions against the 'commingling' of human remains, Olson argues that thinking about and designing for death at large scales has provoked a moral dialectic that moves between individual and collective death, and between anthropocentric and ecocentric perspectives on death's meaning and materiality. Reconciliation across constructed scales of death and disposition calls for an alignment of human purposes and natural processes, Olson argues; and achieving this alignment, he concludes, may require explicit attention to collective deathcare policy. Collective death emerges as a point of interest in Serena Zanzu's Chapter Three as well. Interrogating the exploitative instrumentalism that has dominated human-microbe relations in bioremediation practices, Zanzu evokes the 'microbial turn' as a means by which to 'problematize the human understanding of individuated death', and to make space for appreciating the (sometimes engineered) death of whole microbial communities. In bioremediation practices, the termination of invisible, microbial life is understood as 'destruction', but not 'authentic death', because microbes are reduced to tools or potential threats. Zanzu concludes that a microbiopolitics of the invisible may generate new narratives of life and death that enrich microbial being with non-instrumental value. In Chapter Four, Jesse Peterson rounds out Part One of the volume by drawing explicit attention to the question of what sorts of beings or entities can live or die. Provoked by characterizations of the Baltic Sea as 'dead' or 'dying', Peterson illustrates how cultural and scientific representations of the sea contribute to an environmental imaginary of a dying Baltic Sea. Valuations of specific characteristics of the sea's water shape ideas about the sea's 'natural' state, and about 'unnatural' threats to those valued characteristics. Guided by an onto-epistemic pluralism that resonates with Schnegg et al's Chapter One, Peterson notes that a dying Baltic Sea is one among many possible Baltic Seas, each of which consists of a different set of value-laden claims about its\nbqqd | water, and each of which could 'die' if that definitive set of characteristics undergoes substantial changes.\n2ave | Part Two (care and remembrance) focuses on the sociality of caring for, and disposing of deceased bodies, and the prominence of the body in processes of grief and remembrance. From banners that materialize the deceased in absence of the body (Bredenbröker, Chapter Six) and ambiguous relations between spirit and body (Sicilia, Chapter Eight), to COVID-nineteen protocols for treatment of 'contagious' bodies (Yépez and Johnson, Chapter Five) and fears of mass burial (Holleran, Chapter Seven), the chapters in this section provide insight into the cultural significance of deceased bodies. They show how the discursive and physical spaces occupied by the dead may transform relationships with the dead and among the living, in so doing probing into issues of affect, memory and responsibility. In different ways, all of the chapters deal with questions of containment and separation of dead bodies. Moreover, the chapters consider what happens when ethical obligations towards the dead cannot be fulfilled due to cultural, biological, institutional or temporal constraints. This exposes some of the values and expectations that underpin memorialization and notions of a good death, as expressed in funerary practices and postmortem care relations.",
