        "content": "ohpj | As the equilibrium variance is also easily computed from the Boltzmann distribution, equation one two one gives us a second test to verify that the effective potential has been computed correctly, at least around the minimum.\nry5f | In the LPA approximation the variance and the decay rate of the autocorrelation function are both directly given by the curvature of the effective potential at its minimum. The inclusion of WFR however alters the decay rate without changing the equilibrium variance. This is as it should be since the latter is fixed by the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution. As we will see, WFR improves the decay rate which is indeed not exactly determined by the effective potential's curvature alone.\n31wg | V. SOLUTIONS TO THE FLOW EQUATIONS\ncelk | In this section we obtain the resulting effective potential and wave function renormalisation for three types of potential. The first we consider is a simple polynomial in line with:\n3mf9 | V of x equals one plus x plus x squared over two plus two x cubed over three plus x to the power of four over four\nz2rd | We will also consider a double-well made by two L J potentials back to back:\nvqld | V of x equals four epsilon sub one times sigma to the power of twelve over x plus three to the power of twelve minus sigma to the power of six over x plus three to the power of six plus four epsilon sub two times sigma to the power of twelve over x minus three to the power of twelve minus sigma to the power of six over x minus three to the power of six\nljmz | where sigma will be taken to be one from here on in and epsilon sub one and epsilon sub two represent the depth of each well. We will choose epsilon sub one equals one, epsilon sub two equals ten meaning the left well is one unit deep and the right units deep (in two D sub zero over varepsilon units) and the potential is asymmetric. Clearly here the domain of interest is x in negative three to three as the potential diverges at x equals plus or minus three. Finally we also consider a \"bumpy\" bare potential consisting of a simple x squared underlying potential with additional gaussian bumps (or dips):\nen1l | V of x equals x squared plus the sum from i equals one to n alpha sub i times the exponential of negative quantity x minus beta sub i squared over mu\n45gx | where there are n bumps or dips with the prefactor alpha sub i being positive or negative respectively. We will focus on an x squared plus three bumps and three dips in an asymmetrical setup. This potential could represent a rudimentary toy model for motion over a \"potential energy landscape\" with a series of local energy minima. This serves to clearly demonstrate the effect of local extrema on the final shape of the effective potential since the underlying x squared potential does not alter its shape under the RG flow. We chose the parameters to be for x squared plus six bumps/dips:\nxgur | alpha sub one equals alpha sub four equals alpha sub five equals negative one point five, alpha sub two equals alpha sub three equals alpha sub six equals one point five, mu equals zero point zero six, beta sub one equals negative beta sub two equals zero point seven, beta sub three equals negative beta sub four equals one point four, beta sub five equals negative beta sub six equals two point one\niz66 | chi FIG. one: The flow of the polynomial Langevin potential V in the LPA for (a) Upsilon equals ten (High temperature/strong fluctuations) and (b) Upsilon equals one (Low temperature/Weak fluctuations). The dotted blue curve indicates the bare potential which is progressively changed, through dot-dashed green and dashed yellow, into the solid red, effective potential, as fluctuations are integrated out.\ndndq | expressed in dimensionless units (we have set wide-hat x to x to avoid notational clutter).\nxzce | We solve the LPA flow equation eighty-eight on a grid in the chi direction and using an adaptive step size Runge-Kutta ODE solver to evolve in the k direction. A similar approach was used for including ninety-six. The numerical derivatives in the chi direction were based on a finite difference scheme using the Fornberg method with a stencil size of five for the potentials under study. While increasing the grid size improves the accuracy of the numerical derivative it also increases the number of coupled ODEs to be solved, making the integration much more computationally expensive. A balance must be drawn depending on the potential in question. For our cases we considered thousand-one points and x in negative three to three for the unequal L-J potential and x in negative five to five for the other two. Figs. one, two, four, three and five, display the results.\nw4vd | Figs. one and two show the flow from the bare to the ef-",
