        "content": "kwkp | Chinchilla significantly outperforms Gopher on all evaluation subsets of The Pile, as shown in Figure five. Compared to Jurassic-one, one seventy-eight B, Chinchilla is more performant on all but two subsets-dm_mathematics and ubuntu_irc- see Table A five for a raw bits-per-byte comparison. On Wikitext one hundred three, Chinchilla achieves a perplexity of seven point one six compared to seven point seven five for Gopher. Some caution is needed when comparing Chinchilla with Gopher on these language modelling benchmarks as Chinchilla is trained on four times more data than Gopher and thus train/test set leakage may artificially enhance the results. We thus place more emphasis on other \nyj0m | tasks for which leakage is less of a concern, such as MMLU and BIG-bench along with various closed-book question answering and common sense analyses.\newfp | Four point two point two. MMLU\noczy | The Massive Multitask Language Understanding benchmark consists of a range of exam-like questions on academic subjects. In Table six, we report Chinchilla's average five-shot performance on MMLU (the full breakdown of results is shown in Table A six). On this benchmark, Chinchilla significantly outperforms Gopher despite being much smaller, with an average accuracy of sixty-seven point six percent (improving upon Gopher by seven point six percent). Remarkably, Chinchilla even outperforms the expert forecast for June twenty twenty-three of sixty-three point four percent accuracy. Furthermore, Chinchilla achieves greater than ninety percent accuracy on four different individual tasks- high_school_gov_and_politics, international_law, sociology, and us_foreign_policy. To our knowledge, no other model has achieved greater than ninety percent accuracy on a subset.\n2ttg | In Figure six, we show a comparison to Gopher broken down by task. Overall, we find that Chinchilla improves performance on the vast majority of tasks. On four tasks (college_mathematics, econometrics, moral_scenarios, and formal_logic) Chinchilla underperforms Gopher, and there is no change in performance on two tasks.\nhis3 | Four point two point three. Reading comprehension\nm50z | On the final word prediction dataset LAMBADA, Chinchilla achieves seventy-seven point four percent accuracy, compared to seventy-four point five percent accuracy from Gopher and seventy-six point six percent from MT-NLG five hundred thirty B (see Table seven). On RACE-h and RACE-m, Chinchilla greatly outperforms Gopher, improving accuracy by more than ten percent in both cases-see Table seven.\nme84 | Four point two point four. BIG-bench\no56m | We analysed Chinchilla on the same set of BIG-bench tasks reported. Similar to what we observed in MMLU, Chinchilla outperforms Gopher on the vast majority of tasks (see Figure seven). We find that Chinchilla improves the average performance by ten point seven percent, reaching an accuracy of sixty-five point one percent versus fifty-four point four percent for Gopher. Of the sixty-two tasks we consider, Chinchilla performs worse than Gopher on only four-crash_blossom, dark_humor_detection,\nslz6 | two out of fifty-seven, and worse on only four out of fifty-seven tasks.\n90k5 | mathematical_induction and logical_args. Full accuracy results for Chinchilla can be found, Chinchilla outperforms both Gopher and MT-NLG five hundred thirty B. improves performance over Gopher. Note that GPT-three and MT-NLG five hundred thirty B use a different prompt format than we do on RACE-h/m, so results are not comparable to Gopher and Chinchilla. On LAMBADA eighty-two point three seventy-one point six forty-seven point nine - Table seven | Reading comprehension. On RACE-h and RACE-m, Chinchilla considerably \n9m8s | in Table A seven.\n893y | Four point two point five. Common sense\nfavz | We evaluate Chinchilla on various common sense benchmarks: PIQA, SIQA,\n7szx | Winogrande, HellaSwag, and BoolQ.\nhx9e | We find that Chinchilla outperforms both Gopher and GPT-three on all tasks and\nywn2 | outperforms MT-NLG five hundred thirty B on all but one task-see Table eight.\na63r | On TruthfulQA, Chinchilla reaches forty-three point six percent, fifty-eight point five percent, and sixty-six point seven percent accuracy with zero-shot, five-shot, and ten-shot respectively. In comparison, Gopher achieved only twenty-nine point five percent zero-shot and forty-three point seven percent ten-shot accuracy. In stark contrast with the findings, the large improvements (fourteen point one percent in zero-shot accuracy) achieved by Chinchilla suggest that better modelling of the pre-training\ndqvj | data alone can lead to substantial improvements on this benchmark.\nr17u | BIG-bench tasks considered. Full results are in Table A seven.\n3c47 | Four point two point six. Closed-book question answering\ng345 | Results on closed-book question answering benchmarks are reported in Table nine. On the Natural\nsvhz | Questions dataset, Chinchilla achieves new closed-book SOTA accuracies:\noaen | thirty-one point five percent five-shot and thirty-five point five percent sixty-four-shot, compared to twenty-one percent and twenty-eight percent respectively, for Gopher. On TriviaQA\n5u67 | we show results for both the filtered (previously used in retrieval and open-book\ndvms | work) and unfiltered set (previously used in large language model evaluations). In both cases, Chinchilla substantially outperforms Gopher. On the filtered version, Chinchilla lags behind the open book SOTA by only seven point nine percent. On the unfiltered set, Chinchilla outperforms\nqrd3 | GPT-three-see Table nine.\nrxrg | Four point two point seven. Gender bias and toxicity\ntf43 | Large Language Models carry potential risks such as outputting offensive language, propagating social biases, and leaking private information. We\nfcco | expect Chinchilla to carry risks similar to Gopher because Chinchilla is trained on the same data,\n8uji | Chinchilla, Gopher, and MT-NLG five hundred thirty B on various Common Sense benchmarks. We see that Chinchilla BoolQ sixty point five percent seventy-eight point two percent ninety-one point four percent - Table eight | Zero-shot comparison on Common Sense benchmarks. We show a comparison between\ndf3e | matches or outperforms Gopher and GPT-three on all tasks. On all but one Chinchilla outperforms the\n53eu | much larger MT-NLG five hundred thirty B model.\na5u1 | albeit with slightly different relative weights, and because it has a similar architecture. Here, we examine gender bias (particularly gender and occupation bias) and generation of toxic language. We select a few common evaluations to highlight potential issues, but stress that our evaluations are not comprehensive and much work remains to understand, evaluate, and mitigate risks in Large Language Models.",
