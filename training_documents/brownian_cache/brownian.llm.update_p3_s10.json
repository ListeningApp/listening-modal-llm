Note that the overdamped equations are a consistent approximation to the full dynamics as long as\n6qtq | epsilon squared V double prime is much less than one. We will be examining the impact of changing the temperature, and hence changing the strength of the fluctuating force n, on the coarse-grained effective theory. Let us therefore introduce a reference temperature T sub zero and a dimensionless parameter Upsilon which allows us to dial the temperature around T sub zero. Writing D equals D sub zero Upsilon, we further define dimensionless variables\nwm3n | X equals square root of two D sub zero epsilon widehat X, quad T equals epsilon widehat T.

The Brownian Motion Path Integral\nxhc7 | In order to bring the tools of Quantum Field Theory to bear, we will need to reformulate the stochastic differential equation eight in terms of a path integral. In this subsection we will outline one known way to obtain this path integral, aiming to link this to Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics. Our final expression, and the starting point of our subsequent analysis, is the Brownian Motion transition probability twenty-four, expressed in terms of an integral over possible histories weighted by the action twenty-five, to which the busy reader may progress if uninterested in the details of the derivation. We will be using a condensed functional notation of infinite dimensional functional integrals but all expressions can be considered as limits of finite, high dimensional ordinary integrals. This derivation is based on the path integral reformulation by De Dominicis, Peliti and Janssen of the well known Martin-Siggia-Rose approach for stochastic dynamics, first developed in. More details on these path integrals, including the corresponding finite discretisation of the stochastic process can be found in- see also for a pedagogical exposition.\n6a60 | The dynamics of the dimensionless Langevin equa- tion eight can be captured in terms of the Probability Distribution Function PDF script P of observing the particle X sub F T equals T sub F given that initially, at T equals T sub I, the particle was at X sub I.

Put another way, X of T sub F is the position at T sub F for a given noise history eta of T and the brackets indicate averaging over all possible noise histories, or stochastic paths, which start at X sub I and end up at X of T sub F equals X sub F at T sub F. To express this in a path integral form, we can rewrite the PDF using a Gaussian measure for the nois e five and express the average as\nqjlj | script P of X sub F given X sub I equals integral script D eta of T delta of X of T sub F minus X sub F exp open bracket negative integral D T eta squared of T over two Upsilon close bracket.
