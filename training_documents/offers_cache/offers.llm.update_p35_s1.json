        "content": "sban | Business Terms\nhy6w | Before going any further, and to better flesh out the concepts that follow, we should take a second to define and better understand some key business concepts. When I stood in that Las Vegas penthouse in my \"beast mode\" t-shirt I was clueless about such terms. Let me help you be better than, well, me.\nwlk5 | Gross Profit: The revenue minus the direct cost of servicing an additional customer. If I sell lotion for ten dollars and it costs me two dollars, my gross profit is eight dollars or eighty percent. If I sell agency services for one thousand dollars per month and it costs me one hundred dollars per month in labor to run that client's advertising, then my gross profit is nine hundred dollars or ninety percent. Note: This is not net profit. Net profit is what's left over after all expenses are paid, not just the direct costs of fulfillment.\nais9 | Lifetime Value: The gross profit accrued over the entire lifetime of a customer. This is gross profit multiplied by the number of purchases an average customer will make over their lifetime. Using the example above, if the average customer stays five months, and they pay one thousand dollars per month while it costs me one hundred dollars per month to fulfill, then their lifetime value is four thousand five hundred dollars.\ncdkq | Here's the breakdown:\najvs | Revenue: One thousand dollars per month multiplied by ninety percent gross margin multiplied by five months equals four thousand five hundred dollars Lifetime Value.\nmwef | Note that the indirect costs, like admin, software, rent, etc., are not included in Lifetime Value.\nk8pl | Note: You will find different definitions for lifetime value depending on the source. The biggest difference is that some sources only count total revenue, while others focus on gross profit over the lifespan. I focus on gross profit. You may also see me refer to this as Lifetime Gross Profit in other texts for clarity's sake.\n04f6 | Value-Driven vs. Price-Driven Purchases\n3nhr | This book was intended to be a textbook for any business that wants to grow. I've spent (and continue to spend) hundreds of hours on calls and in-person meetings consulting entrepreneurs on crafting their offers. I have seen the ones that take off into the stratosphere and those that fizzle.\n4hg2 | Having a Grand Slam offer makes it almost impossible to lose. But why? What gives it such an impact? In short, having a Grand Slam Offer helps with all three of the requirements for growth: getting more customers, getting them to pay more, and getting them to do so more times.\nv0rl | How? It allows you to differentiate yourself from the marketplace. In other words, it allows you to sell your product based on value not on price.\n8iyl | Commoditized equals Price Driven Purchases (race to the bottom)\nasz3 | Differentiated equals Value Driven Purchases (sell in a category of one with no comparison. Yes, market matters, which I will expound on in the next chapter)\nsalu | A commodity, as I define it, is a product available from many places. For that reason, it's prone to purchases based on \"price\" instead of \"value.\" If all products are \"equal,\" then the cheapest one is the most valuable by default. In other words, if a prospect compares your product to another and thinks \"these are pretty much the same, I'll buy the cheaper one,\" then they commoditized you. How embarrassing! But really . . . it's one of the worst experiences a value-driven entrepreneur can have.\nv78z | This is a massive problem for the entrepreneur because commodities are valued at the point of market efficiency. This means that the marketplace drives the price down through competition until the margins are just enough to keep the lights on: \"just enough\" to become a slave to their business. The business makes \"just enough\" to justify the owner waiting anxiously for things to \"turn around,\" and by the time that lie is realized . . . they are in too deep to pivot (at least, until now).\nf0em | A Grand Slam Offer solves this problem.\nc3sz | But What Does A Grand Slam Offer Do?\nbghr | Alright, let's start by defining a Grand Slam Offer.\nfdud | It's an offer you present to the marketplace that cannot be compared to any other product or service available, combining an attractive promotion, an unmatchable value proposition, a premium price, and an unbeatable guarantee with a money model (payment terms) that allows you to get paid to get new customers ... forever removing the cash constraint on business growth.\n8191 | In other words, it allows you to sell in a \"category of one,\" or, to apply another great phrase, to \"sell in a vacuum.\" The resulting purchasing decision for the prospect is now between your product and nothing. So you can sell at whatever price you get the prospect to perceive, not in comparison to anything else. As a result, it gets you more customers, at higher ticket prices, for less money. If you like fancy marketing terms, it breaks down like this:\nk3he | One. Increased Response Rates (think clicks)\nlze6 | Two. Increased Conversion (think sales)\nc1ys | Three. Premium Prices (think charging a lot of money).\n1tyf | Having a Grand Slam Offer increases your response rates to advertisements (a.k.a. more people will click or take an action on an advertisement they see containing a Grand Slam Offer).\nktwv | If you pay the same amount for eyeballs but one, more people respond, two, more of those responses buy, and three, they buy for higher prices, your business grows.\n0yl7 | I've \"struck gold\" on my share of offers. Not because I've got some superpower, but because I've just done this a lot of times (and failed even more). I sorted through the crap that chronically fails and pocketed all the stuff that reproducibly succeeds (and put it in this book).\n8kqn | Here's the key takeaway from all this: a business does the same work in both cases (with a commoditized or a Grand Slam Offer). The fulfillment is the same. But if one business uses a Grand Slam Offer and another uses a \"commodity\" offer, the Grand Slam Offer makes that business appear as if it has a totally different product - and that means a value-driven, versus price-driven, purchase.\nct3i | If you have a \"commodity\" offer, you will compete on price (having a price-driven purchase versus a value-driven purchase). Your Grand Slam Offer, however, forces a prospect to stop and think differently to assess the value of your differentiated product. Doing this establishes you as your own category, which means it's too difficult to compare prices, which means you recalibrate the prospect's value-meter.\ntvep | Real Life Grand Slam Offer Money Math: Before and After\ndmvx | Quick backstory . . . one of our companies is a software that advertising agencies use to work leads for their customers. Using this software, agencies transform their offer from a commoditized offer of lead generation services to a Grand Slam Offer of \"pay for performance.\" Let me show you the multiplicative effect it has on the revenue of the business.\n9z6z | Old Commoditized Way (Price-Driven) - Race to the bottom\n4qhr | Commoditized Offer: One thousand dollars down, then one thousand dollars per month retainer for agency services\n3qb9 | Breakdown: At point five to one return on advertising spend, you lose money getting customers. But in thirty days, those five customers will pay another one thousand dollars each, bringing you to ten thousand dollars in total and break even. The next month, the five thousand dollars that comes in would be your first profitable month, and each month thereafter would be profitable (assuming they all stay).\naksw | This is an example of a commoditized service - normal agency work. There's a million of them, and they all look the same. Commoditized businesses and offers have a harder time getting responses from ads because all their marketing looks the same as everyone else's.\np87k | Note: It all looks the same because they are all making the same offer. You pay us to work. We do work. Maybe you get results from that work. Maybe you don't.\ninmq | It's reasonable, but it's easily duplicated (and subject to commoditization). This commoditization creates a price-driven purchase...",
