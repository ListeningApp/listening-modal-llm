You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

We guarded against the possibility that subjects briefly pressed both buttons inadvertently by excluding those episodes that lasted less than 1 s. As shown in Figure 4, subjects rarely reported mixed emotions during either clip; the incidence of mixed emotions never exceeded 40% in either clip. This is not surprising because even the ESM contends that mixed emotions are rare and because the bittersweet clip contains many unambiguously pleasant or unpleas-
n1wo | ant scenes that were intended to set the stage for bittersweet scenes. Nevertheless, Figure 4 suggests that subjects may have reported more mixed emotions during the bittersweet clip than during the control clip.
5bq3 | MIXED EMOTIONS
ezla | To quantify the amount of mixed emotions reported by each subject, we computed how much time each subject pressed both buttons at the same time. These distributions are shown in Figure 5. The overall distribution was J-shaped with a mode of zero and could not be transformed into a normal distribution. Thus, we analyzed the data with the Mann-Whitney test, which is a non- parametric equivalent of a t test and compares distributions of ranked values obtained from two independent samples. The Mann- Whitney test revealed that subjects who watched the bittersweet clip reported more mixed emotions (Mdn = 0.41 min, MRank = 28.2) than those who watched the control clip (Mdn = 0.00 min, MRank = 16.1; U = 101.0, z = 3.52, PSest = . 22, p < . 001). This finding provides evidence from online continuous measures against the vacillation hypothesis and for the contention that peo- ple can feel happy and sad at the same time.
rsbu | Study 1b: The Continuous Evaluative Space Grid
magd | The goals of Study 1b were to provide a second test of the vacillation hypothesis and extend Study 1a by measuring happi-
tb74 | ness and sadness with the continuous evaluative space grid (ESG; J. T. Larsen, Norris, McGraw, Hawkley, & Cacioppo, 2009), which provides continuous online measures of positivity and neg- ativity that are graded, as opposed to dichotomous (cf. the button press measures). With the continuous ESG, subjects move the cursor left and right along a computerized grid's x-axis to report changes in their positivity and up and down along its y-axis to report changes in their negativity. The edges of the grid represent the experience of positivity or negativity in isolation; the interior represents coactivation of positivity and negativity.
8l69 | Duncan, Barrett, and Russell (2006) had subjects complete the continuous ESG as they simultaneously viewed emotionally evoc- ative pictures and listened to evocative music. Subjects rarely moved the cursor into the grid's interior when presented with music and pictures of opposite valence, which Duncan et al. interpreted as evidence against the possibility that people can feel mixed emotions of happiness and sadness. If Duncan et al.'s results constitute evidence against mixed emotions, the finding that subjects spend more time in the grid's interior during the bitter- sweet clip from Life Is Beautiful than during the control clip would constitute evidence for mixed emotions. We examined this possi- bility in Study 1b.
1jyv | Method. Subjects were 39 University of Colorado, Boulder, undergraduates (20 women; 51%).
olce | Subjects were seated in separate cubicles and randomly assigned to watch the bittersweet clip <LATEX>\left( n = 1 7 \right)</LATEX> or the control clip <LATEX>\left( n = 2 2 \right) .</LATEX> Computerized instructions provided the cover story and informed subjects how to indicate how happy and how sad they felt by moving the mouse along the x- and <LATEX>y</LATEX> y-axes of a <LATEX>5 \times 5</LATEX> continuous ESG, respectively (for detailed instructions, see J. T. Larsen et al., 2009). The left (top), middle (middle), and bottom (right) cells on the x-axis (y-axis) were labeled "not at all," "moderately," and "extremely," respectively. Happiness and sadness ratings ranging from 0 to 4 were collected every 500 ms.
erx1 | Results. To quantify the degree to which each subject expe- rienced mixed emotions, we computed the minimum of each subject's happiness and sadness ratings during each sample of the clip (i.e., MIN[Happy, Sad]).5 MIN scores provide a graded index of mixed emotions by taking on values of zero when subjects indicate feeling exclusively happy, exclusively sad, or neutral but higher values when subjects indicate feeling both happy and sad (Schimmack, 2001). To guard against the possibility that subjects briefly crossed through the interior in transit between the exclu- sively happy and exclusively sad portions of the grid, we set MIN values to zero if the excursion into the interior lasted less than 1.5 s. As in Study 1a, a Mann-Whitney test revealed that subjects who watched the bittersweet clip reported more intense mixed emotions <LATEX>\left( M d n = 0 . 3 6 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>M _ { R a n k } = 2 6 . 6</LATEX> than those who watched the control clip
