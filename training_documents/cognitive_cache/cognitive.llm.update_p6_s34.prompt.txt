You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

c6hh | A more interpretable metric for fit is Mean Absolute Deviance (MAD) -- the average of the absolute values of the differences between observed values and predicted values. We do not use it as a heuristic because it leads to over fitting. <LATEX>\mathrm { W } e</LATEX> include it as a measure of the improvement in the model fit.
y7ea | Figure 4 illustrates <LATEX>A ^ { * }</LATEX> search with AIC as the heuristic. The original model is evaluated and <LATEX>\mathrm { A I C }</LATEX> is computed. The model is then split into a few new models by incorporating the factors. AICs are computed from each of the new model. A* selects the best one (the shaded node with value 5301) for the next model generation. <LATEX>A ^ { * }</LATEX> does not always go down. It may go up to select a model (the shaded node with value 5312) to expand if all the new models have worse heuristic scores than a previous model has. After several expansions, it finds a best node with the lowest AIC value.
nav4 | 5 Experiments and Results
gem8 | 5.1 Experiment 1
e8nr | This experiment addresses the question -- How can we describe learning behavior in terms of an existing cognitive model? Specifically, we want to find out the learning rate and initial difficulty level of each rule, and the initial performance of students, given the data. The question is answered by fitting the logistic regression model in equation 2 and getting the coefficients. The coefficient estimates for the skills and students, and the overall model statistics are summarized in table 4.
k78w | The higher the intercept of the each skill, the lower the initial difficulty the skill has. The higher the slope of the each skill, the faster students learned the skill. Pentagon-area is the hardest skill with the intercept of -2.16. Parallelogram-area is the easiest skill with the intercept of 2.14. Three skills have small slopes close to

f682 | zero -- Compose-by-addition ( -. 04) and Parallelogram-area ( -. 01), Triangle-area (.03). Parallelogram-area was already mastered with an initial success probability .95. It appears that more practice on those skills does not lead to much learning gain. Interestingly, although PENTAGON-AREA is the hardest skill among all, it has the highest learning rate .45, leading to bigger improvement with more practice.
li1k | The coefficients for students measure each student's overall performance. The higher the number, the better the student performed. The AIC, BIC and MAD statistics provide a baseline for evaluating alternative models discussed below.
pbea | 5.2 Experiment 2
ccpt | This experiment addresses the question -- How can we improve a cognitive model? The question is answered by running LFA on the data including the factors, and searching through the model space. The improved models by LFA with BIC are summarized in table 5. The improved models by LFA with AIC is summarized in the interpretation.
0fpw | LFA suggests better models, which make finer distinctions on some skills in the original model and identify which difficulty factors the subject experts thought would turn out to be psychologically important. All the better models found by AIC and BIC have better (i.e. lower) statistical scores than those of the original. For the best BIC model, its BIC is reduced by 37, and AIC by 62. The fit of the new model, as measured by MAD, is reduced by .012. The best AIC model reduces AIC by an even larger amount of 83, and increases BIC by 18. Its MAD is reduced by .02.
dqn8 | The improved skills common to most of the better models are Compose-by- multiplication, Compose-by-addition, Circle-area, and Triangle-area. We will discuss a few examples here.
cop0 | All the new models suggest splitting Compose-by-multiplication into two skills - Cmarea and CMsegment, making a distinction of the geometric quantity being
lhkq | multiplied. By examining the positions of these problems in the curriculum, CMarea at the 43rd step and CMsegement at the 90th. As seen in table 6, although the final probability of CMarea is high .96, the initial probability of CMsegment is low .32. This sudden drop in the success probability at later steps corresponds to a significant blip in the learning curve as illustrated in figure 2. The distinction between different geometric quantities suggests treating the original skill differently. LFA successfully identified the blip without the need of visually inspecting learning curves.
82ju | The subject experts thought embedding a shape into another shape would increase the difficulty of a skill and identified a factor "Embed", hoping LFA could make a distinction on it. LFA split these two skills by Embed in all the top AIC models. The three probabilities of CAalone and CAembed are shown in table 7. Does Embed make find the circle area harder? Note that problems with CAembed are introduced later in the curriculum after students have had significant practice with CAalone, about the time CAalone has reached the average probability of .81. At this point, CAembed has an initial probability of .71, indicating an increase in difficulty.
y2qo | 5.3 Experiment 3
1piq | In experiment 2, LFA improved the original model by splitting skills. Experiment 3 addresses model improvement even further -- Will some skills be better merged than if they are separate skills? Can LFA recover some elements of truth if we search from a merged model, given difficulty factors?
7fqw | We merged some skills in the original model to remove some of the distinctions, which are represented as the difficulty factors. Circle-area and Circle-radius are merged into one skill Circle; Circle-circumference and Circle-diameter into Circle- CD; Parallelogram-area and Parallelogram-side into Parallelogram; Pentagon-area, and Pentagon-side into Pentagon; Trapezoid-area, Trapezoid-base, Trapezoid-height into Trapezoid. The new merged model has 8 skills -- Circle, Crcle-CD, Compose-by- addition, Compose-by-multiplication, Parallelogram, Pentagon, Trapezoid, Triangle.
rhaz | Then we substituted the original skill names with the new skill name in the data, ran LFA including the factors, and had the A* algorithm search through the model space. The improved models by LFA with BIC are summarized in table 8. The improved models by LFA with AIC are summarized in the interpretation.
wak1 | Learning Factors Analysis - A General Method for Cognitive Model Evaluation
wtfz | LFA fully recovered three skills (Circle, Parallelogram, Triangle), suggesting the distinctions made in the original model are necessary. LFA partially recovered two skills (Triangle, Trapezoid), suggesting the some original distinctions are necessary and some are not. LFA did not recover one skill (Circle-CD), suggesting that the original distinctions might not be necessary. LFA recovered one skill (Pentagon) in a different way, suggesting the original distinction may not be as significant as the distinction caused by another factor. We discuss a few examples here.
qy1i | In BIC model 1, Circle is split into Circle*area, and Circle*radius. The other two BIC models and all the AIC models split it into Circle*backward, and Circle*forward, which are equivalent to Circle-AR *area, and Circle-AR*radius because of the one-to- one relationship between forward and area and between backward and radius. Thus, LFA fully recovers the Circle skills.
1k9e | None of the models recovered Circle-CD. This suggests that it may not be necessary to have two separate skills for Circle-circumference and Circle-Diameter. It appears that once students learn the formula circumference = n*diameter, they can fairly easily apply it in the forward or backward direction.
