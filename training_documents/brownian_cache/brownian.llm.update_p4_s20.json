(twenty-five)\no7zd | Computing this path integral, which henceforth shall be called the Brownian Path Integral, without resorting to some approximation is in general impossible analytically. Instead, we will be using numerical solutions to the FRG flow equations to compute it in the L P A plus WFR approximations.\nthxo | Redefining our fields as:\nb67w | x(t) equals Vr six(t) V(x) equals TW(y)\nhoze | õ equals Vr one (phi-F) čc equals ipp\nhd71 | (twenty-six)\neix9 | S subscript BM[y, F, p,p] equals left bracket W(Pf) minus W(Pi) right bracket plus S subscript susY (twenty-seven) where\nh4p4 | S subscript susY [p, È, p, p] equals the integral of d t sixty-two plus F two plus iFW, left brace six (six) minus i p left parenthesis O t plus W, forty-four ( y) right parenthesis p.

The same action also describes Brownian motion and the BM action is equivalent to the SUSY QM one up to a factor depending on the initial and final positions xi and xf; these terms can be simply taken outside the path integral as an exponential prefactor.\n8d1n | Variation of S subscript susY with respect to F yields its \"equation of motion\" F equals negative iW, which when substituted back into S subscript susY yields the \"on mass-shell\" action\n559s | S O M (comma P, P) equals the integral of d t two sixty-two plus left brace W,. two minus i p left parenthesis O t plus W, p p right parenthesis p\nrhb6 | (twenty-nine)\ndpdb | We will keep working with the auxiliary field F and twenty-eight as it allows for the symmetry transformations to take on a simpler form, linear in all fields.\nlek9 | It is illuminating to express the above action in terms of the original dimensional variables and perform the integration over p and p, leading to the alternative form of the term stemming from the determinant:\ni22c | S O M [x] equals the integral of d t two D m small a squared plus two m V, two minus D m E V, E T L.

Unlike h of course, it can be varied by changing the temperature, therefore controlling the strength of fluctuations.\nezbr | B.
