        "content": "c2iz | Ibn Arabi taught through what was apparently love-poetry, and people became bitterly hostile towards him. This behaviour of theirs was due to their inability to understand the projection which he was using, not to the reality of their imaginings. But their suppositions about him and his work were firmly believed by them to represent the truth, to be factual in nature. In his case, he was able to teach them further by providing a commentary which satisfied them and caused them to hail him as a great mystic. But in so doing, since they had not arrived at this understanding through inward and personal perception, they were cut off from\nya41 | the benefits of the material's actual use within themselves. They were only intellectually and emotionally satisfied. Their perception of him was limited to a reassurance that his ideas did not conflict with their own ingrained beliefs.\naa56 | It is this mentality of what is in fact superficial assessment which causes the poverty of potential understanding in people who seek only explanation and not perceptions.\nqfgp | Stories of the Miraculous\nyu1c | Q: Are the 'miraculous' stories of the doings of Sufis literally true, or are they designed to illustrate structures equivalent to what may happen, or are they intended to make people credulous or to 'think in a new way?'\n1j33 | A: The answer is the same as the answer to such a question as 'Is a carrot yellow, is it intended to give nourishment, or to propagate itself, or to make up stories about?' The truth is that, under the right circumstances all of the factors may be true, according to what use is made of them.\nk3a8 | You can use dervish tales to impress people, if they want to be impressed or if you gain anything from such deception, and many people do actually do so.\n2s31 | Again, the hearers can misuse them if they insist upon being impressed, or upon being cynical about them. They almost always, too, contain structures and immediate values which may be analogical; and they may be again and again repeated in actual events, which makes them literally true when they recur in their cyclical fashion.\notwe | Q: Can I have an example of one which you can remember as actually having happened, as well as being traditional and as representing a pattern?\n4cb7 | THE KING AND THE WOODCUTTER\n9wka | A: Here is one, very well known among the Afghans, and attributed nowadays to Ahmad Shah the first king of modern Afghanistan:\n9gxs | Ahmad Shah was crowned King with a wreath by a certain dervish, respected by all. From that time on, he often wore the dervish mande, and roamed among his subjects, seeking to improve the quality of his rule.\ne8ks | One day he visited, in this disguise, a woodcutter, living in a forest shack. 'What would you do if you could not sell your wood?' he asked. 'Respected Dervish,' said the woodcutter, I would trust in God and find something.'\n072r | The next day the king had it proclaimed that no woodcutters were to be allowed into the city, and a day or two later visited the man again, in his disguise.\ntqrj | 'How are you living, now that the King has taken such a strange attitude towards woodcutters?' he asked.\nmjm3 | Well, now I make leather belts and sell them to the shops. Trusting in God, I have enough to eat.'\nlji8 | The king left him and some time later issued an edict that no item of leather was to be sold in the shops.\ncser | When Ahmad Shah visited his poor woodcutter-leather-belt-maker again, he said: 'How are you getting on, now that Fate seems to be pursuing you and has stopped your new career?'\nhjvn | 'Sir,' said the other man, 'I trust in God and work as a market porter. All is well, and I have enough to eat.'\ndm7r | Ahmad Shah now caused all market porters to be conscripted into the Palace Guard, without any pay, and not even to be given anywhere to sleep.\n4j98 | That night the king went in his dervish cloak to see his friend, and found him in his hut, eating some food and whittling wood.\n98sg | \"What are you doing?' asked the king. 'I have been taken into the Royal Guard, but without food or anywhere to sleep,' said the man; 'so I have pawned the sword they issued me, bought the necessary food, and I am making a dummy sword until my future shall further be known.'\n9c31 | The king went back to his palace.\nc399 | The following morning the Commander of the Guard called the woodcutter and ordered him to behead a prisoner. They walked together to the place of execution, where the king, as was the custom, was waiting. The woodcutter did not recognise the king in his crown and royal robes, but saying 'Trusting in God', he drew his wooden sword and awaited the order to strike. The prisoner said: 'In the Name of God, may this sword refuse to cut-for I am innocent!' The woodcutter dropped his sword on the ground. After an investigation the condemned man was\nzqx9 | found to be innocent after all. Ahmad Shah was so impressed that he made this man his Grand Vizier. From that time the Afghan kings always used before their names 'Al Mutawakkil ala Allah' - he who trusts in God.\n87zy | EMOTIONAL CRAVING\ng2ke | People who are interested in the miraculous will either 'consume' wonder-tales from emotional craving, or may allow them to operate as alternative ways of thinking about things, to exercise the part of the mind which says: 'stereotyped reactions are constricting'.\nek4d | The automatic and emotional reactions alike are part of the secondary self and do not represent perception of truth.\nodgr | Sirri al-Saqati, who died in eight hundred sixty-seven of the Christian Era, said:\nvbm1 | 'True wisdom is: non-attachment to self and devotion to Truth.'\nsmtx | Continuous versus Effective Activity\n7euw | CONTINUOUS activity, labels, a conditioned sense of importance or progress, the attainment of lesser goals on a shallow plane, these tend to be the body and bone of many a human system whose members expect much more of it than it can deliver.\nysjg | Since it supplies social needs, keeps people occupied and relieves strains, it is believed to be-not just that, but something of a higher order.\n8zjq | On the other hand the teaching method and the study which is discontinuous, which does not use the reward-and-punishment motif, which works with whom it can and when and where it can - the Sufi way - is regarded by the children of automatism as less fulfilling, less interesting, less attractive.\nr9c6 | It would be less important, and should be less interesting, if there were an alternative. That is to say, if it were possible to achieve insight, fulfillment, illumination, know yourself, higher consciousness, and so on, through the mechanical organisation. In such a case there would be no need for the Sufi system: it would be irrelevant and ineffective.\nh1z1 | But these are not the alternatives. It is only when this is understood that people can approach the Sufi study and can profit from it. Until then they are always hankering after either:\nea3z | A system which will be revealed to them if only they will endure the confusions of the Sufis;\nu37t | Themselves being able to force order out of what they unconsciously imagine to be the chaotic state of the Sufi projection;\n989u | or something to which they can transfer which may resemble the Sufi one to them, but which offers the kind of stimuli which they crave.\nbfwg | This is no new problem. But it must be stated constantly. If it is learned, real learning outside of the strait-jacket and blinkers of shallower activity can begin.\no74e | But how is this done, where do we start?",
