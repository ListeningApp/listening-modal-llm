The optimal solution consisting of the second lowest number of local geometric constraints for the U_O four H_D four O fourteen is the layer-by-layer structure of cubics and octahedra with the P one symmetry as shown in Figure 5(d).\n5rcb | The cubic coordination can also be realized by the cation E_O. E_O six O twelve has the optimal solution corresponding to the zirconia structure shown in Figure 5(e). The cation E_O can also make the coordination polyhedra of \n524j | square antiprism as shown in Figure 5(f).\nxd3m | O_P four H_T four O twelve has the optimal solution corresponding to the crystal structure of Y_F_E_O three which is composed of coordination polyhedra of capped trigonal prisms as shown in Figure 6(a). Y_F_E_O three and the optimal solution shown in Figure 6(b) have the same symmetry, but the latter structure is composed of five local geometric constraints, and capped trigonal prisms in the structure share the faces. The manner of atomic distribution in Y_F_E_O three is the same as L_A_M_G_Ta one minus two O one plus three x N two minus three x which can be employed for overall water splitting at wavelengths of up to six hundred nanometers. The correspondence implies the applicability of our method to mixed anion compounds. On the other hand, we could not find the optimal solution corresponding to the crystal structure of S_R two P_D_O four in the optimal solutions of O_P four H_D O sixteen. However, the optimal solution, which has four local geometric constraints and the Pbam symmetry shown in Figure 6(c), is similar to the crystal structure of S_R two P_D_O four; they have the same symmetry, and the difference only comes from the kind of linking between octahedra and capped trigonal prisms. In the optimal solution, octahedra and capped trigonal prisms share the faces, while in the crystal structure of S_R two P_D_O four, they share edges. In general, our algorithm tends to generate polyhedra sharing as many common bridging atoms as possible.\n8qb6 | Finally, P_E two S_H one O four has the optimal solution corresponding to the crystal structure of InGaZnO four. However, it may be difficult to form trigonal bipyramidal coordination polyhedra using the cation P_E, which possesses a hard cationic radius of C_five. Note that in the hexagonal closest packing of oxygen ions, the center of trigonal bipyramid is identical with the interstice between three atoms in the hexagonal layer, and accordingly, the axial atoms of the bipyramid are forty-one percent more distant than the equatorial atoms from the central atoms. Also, note that C five is the same as C six.\nwkbn | In summary, we propose a novel method to enumerate crystal structure prototypes using the paired mathematical programming, subject to a set of constraints on atomic distances, and demonstrate its applicability to find a broad range of crystal structures of oxides. The method consists of two optimization problems. The first is the minimization problem of the volume of the unit cell under the geometrical constraints that are the minimum and maximum distances between every pair of atoms, while the second is the maximization problem of the number of chemical bonds. The constraints of the two problems make every optimal solution satisfy a series of empirical rules systematized in inorganic structural chemistry. The two optimization problems are solved alternately to find a proper structure where every cation satisfies its bonding needs by transpositions of geometrical constraints as silicate approach for amorphous silicons. We find that the linear relaxations of inequality constraints are effective, and accordingly, the small computational cost enables the exhaustive search for the optimal solutions of large-scale systems. We apply the mathematical programming to cases with eighteen compositions, find the optimal solutions for each case successfully, and identify the corresponding real crystal structures. Our result strongly implies that the number of optimal solutions in the mathematical programming seems to be much smaller than the number of local minima in the total energy by ab-initio simulations. A small number of optimal solutions, identified through the mathematical programming, can be easily validated using ab-initio simulations to assess their stability. We anticipate that these optimal solutions may lead to the discovery of novel materials. The successful reproduction of a broad range of oxide crystal structures may suggest the emergence of a universal rule, potentially resulting from the precise refinement of the Pauling rules as demonstrated in this study. Given the proven success with oxide cases, it is anticipated that this method could be extended to other cases such as chalcogenides, mixed anionic compounds, intermetallic compounds, and borides, provided that effective principles are established.\n7xi5 | I. METHODS\nw8r5 | Our mathematical programming formulation is based on inorganic structural chemistry that describes crystal structures. As references for our basic idea, see the textbooks.\nybik | A. Geometrical constraints\ngii5 | Figure S1(a) shows the optimal solution of H_D four O_g corresponding to the rutile structure. Every oxygen makes three chemical bonds with H_D, while every H_D makes six chemical bonds with oxygens. Parallel linear strands of edge-sharing octahedra are joined by common octahedron vertices. Oxygen ions constitute the hexagonal closest-packings, and the structure is reproduced by the anionic constraints between every pair of oxygen ions. Figure S1(b) shows the optimal solution of H_D four O_g corresponding to the alpha-PbO two structure. The zigzag chains of edge-sharing octahedra are also joined by common vertices. If a pair of oxygen and H_D is not connected by a chemical bond, a non-bonding constraint connects them. Every H_D makes ten polyhedral constraints, and two of them correspond to edge-sharing. These two optimal solutions, which correspond to the rutile structure and the alpha-PbO two structure, respectively, have the same structural fingerprint, because the two structures have the same number of local geometric constraints of the same type, where a fingerprint of a local geometric constraint enumerates the element symbols of the adjacent atoms linked by chemical bonds, polyhedral constraints, and anionic constraints in dictionary order, respectively. Figures S1(c) shows the optimal solution H_T four O six corresponding to the corundum structure. There are pairs of face-sharing octahedra, and every octahedron shares three edges within a layer and three vertices with octahedra from the adjacent layer to which it has no face-sharing connection.\nq5eu | To share edges or faces of coordination polyhedra, the minimum distance between two cations is shortened compared to that of the cationic constraints. Suppose D_i is the minimum bonding distance given by\na7ao | D_i equals r_i plus r_j.\n29a3 | (S1)\nsb1e | and then the minimum distance D(shared) from the cation\nw2yn | i to the shared common edge or face is given by\nap6l | V equals C three N_i_j (CBA) equals two.\niest | D(shared) equals\ncox8 | N(CBA) equals three.
