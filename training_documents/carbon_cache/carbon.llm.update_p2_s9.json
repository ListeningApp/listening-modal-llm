        "content": "rhaz | Authors show different effects of inequality on pollution related to different shapes of environmental Kuznets curve like inverted U-shape, U-shape, and linearity. They proposed that when the EKC curve was depicted as an \"inverted U,\" the redistribution from the rich individuals to the poor contributes to the emission rise in connection with the decrease of the income inequality level. Conversely, in the case of a \"U\" shape, the enlargement of income inequality would contribute to the growth of emissions. When EKC relationship is linear, inequality has insignificant effect on environmental pollution. However, economic development is connected not only to environmental quality but also to income inequality level. Kuznets curve was applied for both variables. Hence, if countries trace the same trajectory of Kuznets curve, and the turn point is rather similar, then the positive relationship between inequality and carbon dioxide emissions is observed. In this case, pollution related to climate change is compatible with income inequality, and a process of economic development can resolve these issues, reduction of inequality and pollution, at the same time.\nwak1 | Yet, in the case of economic growth, the environmental impact can decrease or, put in other words, match the right side of the EKC. Alternatively, when the economic development level stays the same, income inequality does not reach the turn point and remains on the left side of Kuznets curve and vice versa. In these circumstances, according to\nwtfz | the proposed model, the negative correlation between inequality level and carbon dioxide emissions is observed. The negative relationship between inequality and carbon dioxide emissions can occur when a U-shaped trajectory of one variable income inequality level or carbon dioxide emissions is observed instead of the inverted U-shape. The relationship is insignificant when pollution or inequality level of the countries correspond to the turn point. Therefore, different correlations between the income inequality level and carbon dioxide emissions with regard to the economic development level could be observed due to the different Kuznets curve trajectories. In addition, when analyzing links between income inequality and environmental impact, the channels through which economic development affects inequality and environmental pollution should be considered.\nqy1i | The channels through which the economic growth affects carbon dioxide emissions and income inequality\n1k9e | A large number of authors have analyzed the EKC and identified that the relationship between air pollution or other type environmental degradation and economic level depends on three channels: one, scale, two, composition and three, technique. Besides, the same channels pertain to the influence of economic development on income inequality level. However, the effects of these channels are different.\n5bjs | Factors that are assigned to the scale effect as economic development level gross domestic product contribute to the increase of environmental impact. Neagu and Teodoru found that economic complexity improved capabilities of a country in the production process has a statistically significant impact on carbon dioxide emissions. Meanwhile, Barro argued that income inequality decreases due to economic growth in early stage of development level. Labor market is also related to the economic growth. Economic development can lessen inequality by allowing workers, who earn the least, to move from the informal employment sector to the formal. He and Feng pointed out that employment could improve income distribution. Castells-Quintana also noted that in the European Union, inequality is higher in regions with higher unemployment.\nuodj | Considering the composition effect or the changes in economic structure with regard to the EKC, the reduction of environmental impact is observed when sectors which are not very polluting i.e. services sector increase faster than the most polluting ones i.e. manufacturing, industry. Transfer from agriculture to manufacturing at first increases and then\nk16v | decreases income inequality. Moreover, Castells-Quintana indicated that the inequality level is higher where the employment in agriculture or trade sectors is higher. A higher employment in the construction sector is also positively related to the higher-income inequality level. He and Feng revealed that industrialization could improve income distribution, which is not very favorable for the environment. However, the impact that a shift to the service sector makes on income inequality has still not been analyzed. In this paper, it is suggested that a faster growth of the service sector can also contribute to the reduction of inequality level because the wage gap in this sector is not very big. Furthermore, the less qualified work can also be included in the service sector.\nb2lm | The technique channel is related to the development of technologies and innovations in the countries. With regard to the EKC, the development of technologies has led to the reduction of environmental pollution. Meanwhile, regarding the income inequality, the development of the technologies may benefit the relatively richer population and contribute to the increase of income inequality. If technological development benefits the qualified labor or richer individuals more than the unqualified labor, the skill premium will\nti7f | increase, which should raise the income inequality level.\noksu | Globalization, via trade and foreign direct investments, can also be attributed to an additional channel through which economic development affects environmental impact and income inequality. When discussing carbon dioxide emissions, the reviewed authors provide different results. Some authors found that foreign direct investment and trade contribute to economic growth and to the degradation of environment at the same time. Other authors showed that foreign direct investment and trade contribute to economic development due to technology development, productivity and efficiency gains, and promotion of new and more innovative processes and managerial skills resulting in the reduction of environmental impact in host countries. As far as income inequality is concerned, the mechanisms of foreign direct investment and trade openness differ, and the results of the estimations are different as well.",
