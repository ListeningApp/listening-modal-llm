What's our intention here? What's the deeper purpose (the big \"why\") that is really worthy of our best effort?\n1jyv | What opportunities can you see in (your specific situation)?\nolce | What do we know so far/still need to learn about (your specific situation)?\nerx1 | What are the dilemmas/opportunities in (your specific situation)?\nb3bt | What assumptions do we need to test or challenge here in thinking about (your specific situation)?\n0w8m | What would someone who had a very different set of beliefs than we do say about (your specific situation)?\nvcu3 | Questions for Connecting Ideas and Finding Deeper Insight\nhjzj | What's taking shape? What are you hearing underneath the variety of opinions being expressed? What's in the center of the table?\nj79f | What's emerging here for you? What new connections are you making?\n6tbv | What had real meaning for you from what you've heard? What surprised you? What challenged you?\nxb13 | Incorporate time for systemwide reflection in order to enable members to share insights and emerging questions. Collective reflection provides opportunities for the shared meaning-making that is essential in times of turbulence and change.\ncxqi | Nurturing Communities of Practice. Many of the most provocative questions that are vital to an organization's future are first discovered on the front lines, in the middle of the action of everyday life. But\nqfmx | What's missing from this picture so far? What is it we're not seeing? What do we need more clarity about?\nrut3 | What's been your/our major learning, insight, or discovery so far?\nm3cp | What's the next level of thinking we need to do?\nmq4s | If there was one thing that hasn't yet been said in order to reach a deeper level of understanding or clarity, what would that be?\n95el | Questions That Create Forward Movement\na0a5 | What would it take to create change on this issue?\ngocl | What could happen that would enable you or us to feel fully engaged and energized about (your specific situation)?\nob1z | What's possible here and who cares? (rather than \"What's wrong here and who's responsible?\")\nm4cb | What needs our immediate attention going forward?\nm61y | If our success was completely guaranteed, what bold steps might we choose?\nu2ob | How can we support each other in taking the next steps? What unique contribution can we each make?\n2gnm | What challenges might come our way and how might we meet them?\nemgw | What conversation, if begun today, could ripple out in a way that created new possibilities for the future of (your situation)?\nxaqt | What seed might we plant together today that could make the most difference to the future of (your situation)?\n5rcb | These key strategic questions are often lost because few of today's leaders have been trained to notice, honor, and utilize the social fabric of learning that occurs through informal \"communities of practice\" that exist throughout the organization. A community of practice is made of up people who share a common interest and who work together to expand their individual and collective capacity to solve problems over time.\n524j | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS\nxd3m | Nurturing these learning networks and honoring the questions they care about is another core aspect of the leader's new work. It is important to understand how these communities deal with the questions and learning needs that arise in the course of the daily life of the organization. These understandings can provide clues about how the knowledge that resides in such communities might be engaged in the service of critical strategic questions. Leaders who take communities of practice into account as important strategic assets help assure that new work processes or organizational structures do not destroy the fabric of collective knowledge that is woven into these informal groups.\n8qb6 | Using Collaborative Technologies. Intranet and groupware technologies are now making it possible for widely dispersed work groups to participate in learning conversations and team projects across time and space. As these tools become even more widely available, the notion of \"network leadership\" will expand to include supporting widespread online conversations where members throughout the organization can contribute their own questions and best thinking to critical strategic issues. The HP case shows how important enabling technology infrastructures are for strategic innovation. Several forward-looking companies, including Hallmark, Kodak, Discover Card, and General Motors, are now using an innovative online conversational technology, Communispace, to listen to their customers' concerns and questions at a deep level and generate insights about new products at a faster rate than was previously possible.\nwkbn | Such collaborative tools will be a critical factor in how well strategic questions can travel both within the organization and among customers and other stakeholders who are key to success. These technologies of engagement create possibilities for individuals and groups to connect with each other and to the larger whole in ways that were previously unimaginable. Leaders who are not skilled in their use or who do not recognize their strategic importance and support their use throughout their organizations will be at a significant disadvantage.\nftfg | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS\n7xi5 | Co-Evolving the Future\nw8r5 | It is quite easy to learn the basics of crafting powerful questions. However, once you understand the importance of inquiry, it's hard to turn back. As your questions become broader and deeper than before, so does your experience of life. There is no telling where a powerful question might lead you. Transformative conversations can result from posing a simple question such as, \"What questions are we not asking ourselves about the situation in the Middle East?\" Tantalizing possibilities emerge from the simple act of changing an article from \"in\" to \"for,\" as in the HP example. Profound systemic change can emerge from creating a process discipline such as the Game Plan for discovering and acting on the \"big questions\" within a business setting.\nybik | For organizations that need collaborative learning and breakthrough thinking in order to create a sustainable future, asking \"questions that matter\" and engaging diverse constituencies in learning conversations are a core process for value creation. Because questions are inherently related to action, they are at the heart of an organization's capacity to mobilize the resources required to create a positive future. Seeing the organization as a dynamic network of conversations through which the enterprise develops encourages members at every level to search for questions related to real work that can catalyze collective energy and momentum. For all of us, thoughtful participation in discovering and exploring powerful questions can make a difference to our team, to our organization, and to the larger communities of which we are a part.\ngii5 | Living systems evolve by developing a coherent identity, creating connections in complex webs of relationships, and distributing information widely throughout the organization. At the same time, human systems naturally evolve toward the questions that they ask. Seeing the ways in which the art and architecture of powerful questions can help an organization create its path into the future, and utilizing process principles, tools, and technologies that support this evolution, is everyone's job. For it is only in this way that organizations are able to cultivate both the knowledge required to thrive economically today as well as the wisdom needed to ensure a sustainable future.\nq5eu | For Further Exploration\na7ao | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS\n29a3 | About the Authors\n```",
