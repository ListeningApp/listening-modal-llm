        "content": "syiw | Seven. Before dealing with problem one, let us first review some previous results. We limit ourselves to mentioning a handful of references concerning existence and we refer to the survey for a more detailed bibliographical account. The general framework although without nonlocal damping, that is, the case zeta equals zero has been established in earlier papers using Faedo-Galerkin/Penalization method. This method gives an approximated sequence of solutions converging to a global solution of the problem. Next results concern systems with further dissipation terms. For example, the modification considered consists in adding to the standard dissipation term in the LLG equation another higher-order term of the type Delta squared M. The Faedo-Galerkin method is also used to solve the problem. In a model with dry-friction dissipation, which is accounted by adding a dry-friction-like term to the standard Gilbert damping,\nkg3t | Journal of Applied Mathematics\nlvae | is studied. Let us mention that a model of ferromagnetic material with hysteresis effects is studied. In this model, the magnetic moment behavior is described by the nonlinear Landau-Lifshitz equation with an additional term modeling the hysteresis. This term takes the form of a maximal monotone operator acting on the time derivative of the magnetic moment. For this relaxed model, local existence of regular solutions is proved. Note that in the framework of current-induced magnetization dynamics, the work addresses global existence of weak solutions to a LLG equation where a transport term is added to effective field taking into account the effect of the injected current. A model of magnetization switching with inertial effects modeled by means of a second-order time derivative term in the effective field is considered where existence of weak solutions and their long time behavior was established. All these proofs are based on some penalization and using various kinds of regularizations.\no9sc | To state the existence result, we start with the definition of weak solutions to problem one.\n121u | Definition two. Given that M sub zero belongs to the space H one of Omega such that absolute value M sub zero equals one almost everywhere over Omega, we call M of t, x a weak solution to LLG equation\nzh03 | one for all T greater than zero, M belongs to the space L infinity over the interval zero to T in H one of Omega, partial t M belongs to L two over the interval zero to T in L two of Omega intersecting L infinity over the interval zero to T in L two of Omega, and M satisfies the saturation constraint absolute value M of t, x equals one for almost everywhere in\n1mvw | R plus cross Omega two M of zero equals M sub zero in the trace sense;\n6d4s | three for all G in the space H one of Q intersecting C zero of Q, there holds\nmqah | one over one plus alpha squared integral over Q of the quantity partial t M minus alpha M cross partial t M dotted with G dx dt equals D integral over Q of M cross partial i M dotted with partial i G dx dt plus zeta integral over O of M cross partial i partial t M dotted with partial i G dx dt\nxxr8 | four for all t greater than or equal to zero we have\nrl4j | eight of t plus two zeta integral from zero to t integral over Omega of the absolute value of gradient partial t M squared dx plus two alpha over one plus alpha squared integral from zero to t integral over Omega of the absolute value of partial t M squared dx dt is less than or equal to eight of zero,\nvz32 | where ampersand of t is given by six. We have the following global existence result.\nncb0 | Theorem three. Let M sub zero belong to the space H one of Omega be such that absolute value M sub zero of x squared equals one almost everywhere. Then there exists a global weak solution M of problem one in the sense of Definition two.\n8mp0 | Proof. The proof follows a standard scheme Faedo-Galerkin method with a penalization of the saturation constraint as usual in general Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation.\nxjyk | Journal of Applied Mathematics\nmt0f | The rest of the paper is divided as follows. In the next section we investigate the long time behavior of the solutions. Section Three discusses the sensitivity of the obtained solutions with respect to nonlocal damping factor zeta. More precisely we characterize the limit problem for both high and small zeta. We conclude the paper in Section Four by giving some comments.\nawab | Two. The Limit as t Goes to Plus Infinity\nixcc | We investigate the long time behavior of the solutions. More precisely, we study the w-limit set of the trajectories and characterize the at-limit points as solutions of a suitable stationary problem. We proceed as in Carbou-Fabrie.\n8p6h | Let M be a weak solution of one. We call w-limit set of the trajectory M the following set:",
