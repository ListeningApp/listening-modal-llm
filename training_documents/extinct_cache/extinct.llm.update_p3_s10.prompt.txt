You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

4jmz | He asked whether species or nature more broadly are valuable beyond their potential usefulness for humans. What Sylvan's fam- ous case suggests is that the permissibility of extinguishing species - as he argued, allowed by traditional Western ethical systems that conceive of nature as something to be used by humans as they please - is an example of what he called 'human chauvinism', now
b7cq | better known as 'anthropocentrism' (for a critical discussion of the 'last person' argument, see Peterson and Sandin, 2013). Sylvan's thought experiment has successively been modified and discussed by many other philosophers such as Mary Ann Warren (1983) and Robin Attfield (1981, 1983). The latter engaged in this type of argument to scrutinise the possibility of human extinction in the context of nuclear armament and 'ecocatastrophe'. He aimed to show that non-sentient living nature such as trees has morally relevant interests and that causing their extinction by the 'last man' would be morally wrong, even if it would not affect any other humans.
0b39 | Writing at the same time as Sylvan, Joel Feinberg (1974) addressed the ethics of species protection from a different argumen- tative angle. Because he argued that only (human and nonhuman) individuals with interests can have rights, he rejected the idea that species have a right to exist (for an opposing view, see Staples and Cafaro, 2012). Therefore, he claimed that humans have a duty to protect endangered species, but the ultimate addressees of this duty are future humans, not the species themselves (see also Elliot, 1980). Likewise, Nicholas Rescher (1980) depicted species conservation 'as a quintessential humanitarian task' and John Passmore (1974) con- sidered wanton eradication of species to be acts of vandalism.
qecd | In brief, very early on, there were opposing opinions about why human-caused extinctions are morally wrong, while there was largely agreement on the issue that anthropogenic extinctions are wrong (with exceptions such as the smallpox virus). The similarity between these different views was that they regard extinction as a loss of value, either for humanity or for the universe as considered from a human- independent perspective. Independently of whether one endorses an anthropocentric (i.e. human-focused) or non-anthropocentric rationale for species conservation, both give rise to a range of result- ing questions that were formulated in the literature of environmental ethics early on, such as: Are species individual entities or life processes that come to an end with extinction (Rolston, 1985, 1995) (section "Defining extinction")? What are acceptable costs for pro- tection efforts (Norton, 1987; Naess, 1989), and relatedly, should all species, even the most harmful ones, be conserved (Rolston, 1985; Johnson, 1991) (section "Future generations")? Are species as col- lectives more valuable than nonhuman individuals (Russow, 1981; Johnson, 1991) and does that therefore justify the culling of individ- uals that threaten the existence of native populations (Warren, 1997; Varner, 1998)?
1o7p | Defining extinction
cp13 | What constitutes an extinction is a complex subject matter. How- ever, for the purpose of ordinary concerns about extinction and for how moral philosophers discuss its moral relevance, most theorists' primary concern lies with anthropogenic species extinctions - while treating 'extinctions' and 'species extinctions' synonymously. Moreover, while many theorists put an emphasis on extinctions on a mass scale (such as Bendik-Keymer, 2014; Cafaro, 2015; Panagiotarakou, 2016; Baquedano Jer, 2019), some theorists are also explicitly concerned with the extinction of individual species (such as Rolston, 1995).2 Accordingly, there are four conceptual components found in many accounts of the ethics of extinction.
bgre | Firstly, there are different ontological positions on the meaning of'species', that is what a species is (see Delord, 2007; Maclaurin and Sterelny, 2008; Ereshefsky, 2022), which then also have different
57lp | ethical implications (such as in Hull, 1978; Gruen, 2011; Smith, 2016). Moreover, because different kinds of species conservation practices change the genetic makeup of the target species (via conventional breeding programmes or synthetic biology) and/or influence their behaviour, it is also necessary to consider (1) whether the resulting population still belongs to the same species (which in turn influences whether we consider it extinct or not) and (2) whether that matters morally (see Preston, 2021). Thus, there are different conceptions of species and these impact how extinc- tion is defined (see Maclaurin and Sterelny, 2008; Godfrey-Smith, 2014; Korsgaard, 2018a).
ukth | Secondly, the term 'extinction' can also be understood in differ- ent ways (see Delord, 2007; Tanswell, 2022), which is of ethical relevance because (1) it frames what falls within the ethics of extinction and, in turn, (2) the way extinction is constructed in controversial cases is in itself subject to ethical scrutiny. When speaking about extinctions as something morally problematic, many (not all) authors will refer to 'final' extinctions, if not specified further in works of practical ethics. Thus, an emphasis is put on 'global' (all individuals of a species are gone) as opposed to 'local' (loss of a population) extinctions. However, because a species can be extinct in several senses of the term, some authors also specif- ically problematise, for example cases where there still exist some (or even many) living individuals belonging to the species of concern. That is, it is not finally extinct, but it may be 'functionally' extinct. Drawing on the example of the whitebark pine as a case of a functional extinction, Christopher Preston (2021, 4, italics in ori- ginal) argues in this regard that '[t]he concern with this type of extinction is not that you will never see individuals of the taxon again. The concern centres on the anthropogenic reordering of relationships. Not a loss of life, but a loss of arrangement'. That is, regarding this type of extinction an emphasis is put on changing ecological relationships rather than on the circumstance whether some individual members of the species are still alive.
