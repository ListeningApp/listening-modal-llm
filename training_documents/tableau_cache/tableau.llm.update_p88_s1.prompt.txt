You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

iws8 | Highlight tables are often thought of as heat maps to the industry, as they use color gradient depth, saturation, or hue to highlight a quantity measure (such as highs and lows). The difference between a highlight table and a heat map is the lack of shape and size marks and the ability to see the underlying details in the highlight table. The following screenshot is an example of a highlight table. Note that the darker the color hue, the greater the percentage of spending to the total. The SUM(% of Total Spending) is duplicated in the Marks card for both the Color shelf and the Text shelf. This allows the color hue to be affected in proportion to the numeric value and also lets the value itself be shown in the rows and columns.
n452 | The colors used, and the other borders and elements, are completely customizable in the tables described in this section. The colors of this chart can be easily customized for each graph by double-clicking on the gradient color bar titled (in this case) SUM(% of Total Spending). The filters that have been created are identical to the first table named the Text table in this chapter section:

enir | Bar charts
e4d4 | Bar charts are used to compare values and are perhaps the most useful of the chart types. Bar charts allow you to compare values across categorical dimensions (such as age groups, sex, race, cities, states, expense categories, departments, and so on; the list is endless), but they do not display the underlying data details as can be done in a table. Bar charts are used to compare values across dimensions. As we discussed in an earlier section in this chapter, length can be easily and naturally interpreted by readers. Therefore, bar charts are one of the more commonly used and appreciated charts used today.
d8ta | The global population data used in the following section was downloaded from the World Bank by visiting http: //data. worldbank. org/data-catalog/Population-ranking- table.
c9cw | There are several types of bar charts in Tableau - horizontal bars, stacked bars (they compare parts to a whole and are the same as pie charts), side-by-side bars (they compare two categories), Gantt charts, histograms (they measure the frequency of events and plot distribution diagrams), and bullet graphs (a relatively new compact chart invented by Stephen Few, a visualization expert; you should become familiar with his work). In this section, we will only talk about a couple of these bar charts, but I invite you to experiment on your own and learn about these other chart types if you find them appealing.
b93o | The following screenshot shows a horizontal bar chart that depicts the top 10 countries by population. The chart reveals that China and India are the two largest countries by population (with over 1 billion citizens each), followed by the USA, Indonesia, and other countries with a much lower population:
tjqy | Chapter 4
58xg | Some key design elements that should be pointed out in the previous horizontal bar chart are we used Country as the dimension and SUM(Population) as the measure. To limit the graph to the top 10 countries in terms of population, we added the Country field to the Filters shelf and chose to filter the top 10 countries by population in the descending order, as shown in the following screenshot:
70zf | After filtering the data to get information about the top 10 countries in the year 2010, we sorted the bars by clicking on the quick-sort button on the x axis to sort the countries in descending order by total population.
xnbe | Visualization - Tips and Types
uv86 | The chart shown in the following screenshot is a stacked bar chart. In this chart, we have pivoted several fields in the previous two exercises to show, by region, the 10 most populous countries in the world. The stacked bar chart is a part-to-whole comparison chart that often works better than a pie chart because it relies on the bar's lengths rather than an interpretation of the angles:
gksi | Stacked bar charts are best used when there are just a few different dimensions, because too many dimensions and corresponding colors are difficult to interpret. We created this stacked bar chart by performing the following steps:
oh7q | 1. Drag the Region field from the Dimensions pane to the Columns shelf.
6gn8 | 2. Drag Population: Total(count) from the Measures pane to the Rows shelf.
yun5 | 3. Maintain the filters on Year for 2010 and the top 10 countries according to the total population.
vdx2 | 4. Drag Country from the Dimensions pane to the Color shelf.
4k9e | 5. Click on the Color shelf on the Marks card and add a black border, which separates the bars more definitively.
keds | 6. Clicked on the ABC icon in the toolbar to see the mark labels.

yhw8 | Geographic maps
o7zq | Geographic maps are a useful chart type that can answer various questions related to locations. Before you select this chart type, consider the fact that having geographic data elements such as longitude, latitude, state, county, city names, or addresses does not mean that you have to use them in every case. Sometimes, a bar chart or another chart type can express a data story as well as a geographic map in, case map data does not actually add value. For example, sometimes it is better to group states, counties, or cities into regions and treat those as categories by using bar charts.
hqd5 | Tableau Public has a powerful geocoding function that is built-in and requires no additional programming (though many third-party providers exist for more robust maps with street and topographic map support). Geocoding is the process of recognizing geographic data, such as addresses, cities, counties, state country names, latitude, longitude, and so on, with the help of software and automatically encoding text strings and numeric values as geographic dimensions.
su3f | We built the following map to show the maximum life expectancy by country in the World Bank Indicators data set by performing the following steps:
s1l7 | 1. Multi-select Country in the Dimensions pane and Life Expectancy at Birth (total) in the Measures pane.
12yz | 2. Click on the Show Me card.
0xfx | 3. Select the filled map.
bg91 | 4. On the Marks card, click on the context menu for Life Expectancy at Birth (Total) and change it to a maximum, which means that it shows the maximum value for each country within the data set.

xjy8 | From this map, we learned that the countries of central Africa have relatively worst life expectancies in the world.
6746 | When the data is loaded in Tableau Public, the software automatically encodes geographic fields with their average latitude and longitude. When you select one of these newly encoded fields, a small globe icon will be associated with the data element. You can click on one of the map icons on the Show Me dialog box, or you can double-click on any of those fields to add it to the visualization pane. The filled map icon is the most commonly used one for data visualizations.
r5zg | Scatter plots
hk56 | Scatter plots are a type of chart that show relationships between two measures to establish correlations and comparisons, find trends in data, and expose outliers. Scatter plots are one of the most effective forms of communicating mathematical relationships, and they are one of the seven basic tools of quality control.
29ac | Chapter 4
no4d | You can build a scatter plot by adding a measure to the Rows shelf and a measure to the Columns shelf, or double-clicking on each of the measures in succession- the first measure will be placed on the Rows shelf and the second one on the Columns shelf. You can swap the measures (rows swapped with columns) by pressing the Ctrl key and clicking on the measures and select the Swap menu command icon. Alternatively, you can right-click and click on Swap on the shortcut context menu. Then, add one or more dimensions to the Marks card, dragging various dimensions to the various shelves, such as Color, Size, or Shape. This will put the scattered measures in context with the dimensions and allow for an analysis of the relationships.
