        "content": "7bdk | Several interesting and important findings emerge from Figures four and five. First, the histograms show quite clearly that lots sold by Blas Chapa were much cheaper than those sold by Elías López; indeed, they were under\nfim0 | two thousand dollars per lot (in one thousand nine hundred eighty-three prices) compared with three thousand five hundred dollars (see Figure four histograms and the overall means). Quite how Elías López managed to sell lots at much higher prices is hard to\nojro | explain, but the fact that he did offer formal Contracts for Deed (unlike Blas' preference for more informal receipts) and the fact that he had overall control of the development process in two distant settlements quite remote from Las Lomas where Blas Chapa had his base, may have been two key factors. Overall, it looks as though Elías López was the more business-oriented and profit-seeking of the two developers and this concurs with the fact that, unlike for Blas Chapa, the residents never held him in much affection. His recent death-if not celebrated-went relatively unmourned by most, as the focus group discussions revealed.\n1ujy | Another feature suggesting that it is the development process more than location that shapes colonia prices is the fact that the trimmed mean purchase price of lots varies significantly by period. Lots sold during the early nineteen nineties were considerably more expensive than those sold during the nineteen eighties and were even higher than those that have come on line since nineteen ninety-five. This also suggests some differential price setting by certain actors-the developers, in this case. While both men were actively selling lots throughout the two decades, the bulk of Elias Lopez' developments were in the late nineteen eighties to mid nineteen nineties, so to the extent that he\nqzor | and others were charging higher rates at this time, so the overall curve of land price changes could also be expected to rise in those years. As Figure five shows, Blas Chapa regularly 'undersold' lots during that period (his price curve actually declines), apparently only catching on to the opportunity of charging higher and more competitive prices in nineteen ninety-four. Interestingly, Blas must have known that he could have charged more for lots in the developments that he controlled, since the joint sales that he and Elías undertook together were usually at the higher rate (with some notable peaks and troughs, see Figure five). Thus, to the extent that different developers are engaging in differential price-setting procedures at different periods, the overall price curve will also reflect their operations. In part, therefore, the upward price trends that we have observed, especially in the nineteen ninety to ninety-five period, at least in part reflects the impact that Elías López and others had in driving-up prices, rather than signifying an overall market change. Had it not been for Blas Chapa's continued activity of selling lots at lower prices, the increase would probably have been even more significant.\na0by | These findings are important since they tend to confirm other research for low-income (irregular) settlements that land prices are often 'socially determined', rather than being shaped primarily by more orthodox and conventional factors such as location, scarcity, amenity, etc. Future studies of land price changes in Texas colonias should analyse carefully the role that developers play in setting prices and, in those cities where there are several different developers, it will be important to disaggregate the extent to which they work individually or in concert with one another. In Rio Grande City, Blas Chapa's somewhat aberrant (non-market) behaviour had a significant impact in offering lots at sharply different (lower) prices from those of his competitor developers. However, now that the developers' influence has been removed, we may expect other land market factors such as location, level of services, and physical characteristics to come more to the foreground and the pricing of lots in colonias will more closely reflect orthodox market factors, displacing the 'aberrations' borne of personal relations between developer and clients that we have described here.\nhtm9 | Colonia Property: a Good Investment?\n8hul | As well as asking people how much they paid for their lots, we also asked them to estimate the value of their lots-either their own, or those derived from recent sales that they knew about. Table three shows the residents' estimated lot values in two thousand two. Looking over the data in Table three, we see that a median lot cost was four thousand seventy dollars or zero point seven-eight cents per square foot of land in two thousand two prices. Inflating the one thousand nine hundred eighty-three values and trimmed mean of zero point fifty cents to two thousand three values gives us a lot cost today of around four thousand two hundred fifty dollars, which is the figure we use as our comparator to estimated current values in Table three. Interestingly, however, estimates made locally by the residents themselves are considerably higher-a median of six thousand dollars as estimated by fifty-one valid case respondents. While this varies somewhat between settlements, the six thousand dollar lot sale value is not unreasonable or inflated.\n87vz | Adopting a six thousand dollar estimated lot value as\nym66 | the comparator, then the total gain in two thousand two values would come out at between one thousand five hundred and two thousand dollars per lot, although this return on the investment will depend heavily on the period in which the householder bought the lot. Taking the data in Table four above, an individual buying a regular-sized lot at thirty-six cents per square foot would, in real terms, have made around one thousand three hundred fifty dollars on the investment assuming that upon resale the vendor was able to get the average increased value recorded across the settlements-four thousand two hundred fifty dollars in two thousand two. That same householder would earn a considerably higher gain of two thousand eight hundred fifty dollars if, as respondents suggested, lots were selling for six thousand dollars. Calculating these capital gains in terms of percentage annual yield of these two estimates over a seventeen-year period (for someone buying in nineteen eighty-five) comes out at two point one percent and five point three percent respectively. If we extrapolate the average purchase price of the next cohort of buyers (nineteen ninety to ninety-four) at fifty-four cents per square foot and similarly compare the net return in real terms, then someone buying in nineteen ninety-three would have experienced an overall loss of one percent (on a four thousand two hundred fifty dollar valuation) and a gain of two point seven percent per annum on a contemporary six thousand dollar resale.\nl0a3 | What this tells us is that, unless lots are selling today for six thousand dollars or more, people would not be making any significant gains on their investment and some would even be losing value in real-price terms. However, if a six thousand dollar resale price was realised in the market in two thousand two, then those lot vendors would have made a profit of something in the order of one thousand two hundred fifty to two thousand dollars-a sizeable equity gain for most people. But whether they can actually get that amount in the market-place is another matter. Assuming that they can, and depending upon when they bought, the gains range from twenty-five to one hundred percent in equity value.\nu8nw | We also asked respondents to estimate the value of their properties (i.e. the lot and dwelling combined). Measured against what people now self-assess their property's worth, we see a substantial development of equity in Rio Grande City colonias. Some eighty-two respondents were able to estimate their own property's worth, with a median value of",
