You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

y8m6 | Any careful study of academic work will show how surprisingly often there is an unawareness, for instance, of the difference be- tween polemic and informational communication.
4595 | The Sufi's opposition to the scholar is not any opposition to scholarship. It is an opposition to regarding scholarship as some- thing which it is not. If, for instance, one were to believe that bread and milk were the only true and valuable forms of food, it could mean that those who ate bread and milk might imagine that they had perceived and were operating at the apogee of nutrition. On the other hand, where there are other nutritions available, and when these are superior in some or many respects to those which are only supposed to be the solitary or best ones, a critical situation exists.
zjlt | The other objection which the Sufi traditionally makes is in the best interests of the scholar and his followers. It is widely known that an erroneous belief about oneself, particularly a fantasy that one is more important than one really is, can have an un- pleasant and destructive effect upon an individual and on those who may rely upon him. To ignore such scholastic imaginings
sxhf | when in a position to comment upon them in a salutary manner is tantamount to allowing a person to damage himself and others- whether this damage arises through ignorance or malice. All social requirements of virtually all communities are unanimous in disallowing such a situation as this to pass unremarked, once it has been observed.
qnrk | If the means to deter people from this course of irresponsibility do not exist (or cannot be made use of) the role of the Sufi is to make available the information upon the basis of which others may be able to preserve themselves from the spread of the disability. Or he might otherwise contribute towards redressing the imbalance.
nps9 | Protection and guidance is a function of the Sufi which takes precedence over any psychotherapeutic role. Yet it is easier for the Sufi to do his own job than it is for the afflicted to see his own situation, because the victim can sustain and maintain his disease only by dogmatic activity and constant effort, propaganda and so on. He continues to fuel his own morbid condition because he has lost touch with the fact that the ailment is not really a part of himself at all. He therefore fears to lose it, since he now imagines that such a loss would mean a loss of himself or a part of what he takes to be himself.
t0gb | When the malaise is further linked with the desire to maintain social or other prestige, or to secure his bread and butter, the inadequate academic's position is tragic indeed.
fep0 | This is the condition described by ancient authors in their own language, when they tell of people who are infested by demons and imagine that the demons are themselves.
mjuh | The opposition of Sufis and scholars, like that of literalists and experientialists throughout the human community at all times, also has another face, one which is extremely interesting.
7go1 | Many-perhaps the majority-of the scholars who initially opposed our books on traditional psychology, have become warm supporters of the concept of extra dimensions in learning, and I count many of them among my personal friends. In the past ten years there have been several books and numerous monographs in which scholars have shown this change of heart. How does this come about?
clrl | You should note that it is a matter of sociological evidence that
ulg7 | people who make the best friends are not those who are attracted to one another, or to each others' ideas, at first. On the contrary, it has been shown that the person who opposes you is likely to become a firmer friend than one who becomes your friend immediately. This may seem odd: it is certainly something which has been known for centuries to thinkers and experientialists, as I shall illustrate in a moment.
ai6n | On the perceptual, as distinct from the superficial, level, there is a communication which leads to harmony between nominally opposed people or attitudes. Were this not so, we would never get agreement following disagreement. But there is a stronger indica- tion than that.
r85f | The first illustration we can use, in order to offer this phenom- enon in terms somewhat familiar to our present audience, is the saying of Jalaluddin Rumi to the effect that 'things which are apparently opposed may in reality be working together'. The reason why people do not ordinarily link this with the essential harmony of opposites is that they are using only the secondary self to assess the saying. Since they do not perceive this co- operation of opposites when it starts, they think that the opposi- tion which they feel is the central factor.
809c | Secondly, if you cast your mind back to the New Testament, where Jesus is credited with saying that you should 'love your enemy', you will see that, from this point of view, you might as well harmonise with someone who opposes you, because this opposition is quite possibly the beginning of friendship, however it may appear on the surface. 'Love your enemy', therefore, is not to be regarded as a noble sentiment which makes you a better person, especially: but as an injunction which actually describes the deeper dimensions already existing in the relationship.
88wb | Although hard to illustrate for those who have not experienced > this parallelism between paradoxical homilies and essential fact is encountered in conditions of deeper understanding. Difficult to illustrate in personal terms, especially where individual disputes are concerned, it can be determined as existing in social contexts, where the superficial self is not operating. Reconciliation, familiar to all of us in personal and community terms, is not so much the unification of opposites as the uncovering of the basic truth of the
cos6 | situation, masked by subjectivities.
d7mf | Sufis and scholars seem to oppose one another. But when they know one another's approaches and knowledge, this 'opposition' disappears.
swxw | THE SHARPSHOOTING SCHOLARS
21z8 | Scholars themselves know a great deal about the besetting sin of their profession, that of over-specialisation and blinkered dogma- tism. Here is a story about the whole matter, told me by a scholar who himself admitted, unlike many others, that he knew that be was like one of the characters in the tale: but that there was nothing, he believed, that he could do about it:
joel | A number of academics, it appears, were enrolled in time of war into the infantry. After training they all proved to be crack shots, capable of hitting the bullseye far more often than any other recruits.
ikdv | The time came for them to be sent into battle. As the enemy advanced, the order was given to fire. Nobody moved. 'For good- ness' sake', shouted the commanding officer, 'why don't you shoot?'
msiy | 'How can we, you fool?' roared back one of the scholars, 'When we haven't been trained to fire at people?'
y8pn | An Enterprise is measured by Intention, not by Appearance
brx4 | Q. Can you comment on the statement: 'The Success of an Enterprise is measured by its intention, not its appearance'?
6o0i | A: This statement is simpler than it looks, although it conceals some of the misunderstandings of the past.
9i2l | If someone is trying to dig a hole, the intention is to dig a hole. The success of the digging of the hole will be whether the hole is actually dug. But, in appearance, the man may be trying to find gold. If the observer thinks that the intention is to find gold, he will call the hole 'a failure'.
jkgo | It is the same with teachings, institutions, theories and so on. Many have been successful which appeared to be failures. Many failures have appeared to be successes, because the intention be- hind them was not widely known.
keob | The danger in this situation is twofold :-
6xew | 1. That self-appointed observers may completely misunderstand intentions.
hmbg | 2. That people, originally intending success in one range, may yield to the temptation to produce what can easily be called 'a success' in some other range.
