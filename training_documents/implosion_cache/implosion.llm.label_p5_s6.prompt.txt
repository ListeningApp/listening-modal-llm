You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

a8ge | The relations of democracy and knowledge are up for materialized refiguring at every level of the onion of doing technoscience, not just after all the serious epistemological action is over. I believe that last statement is a fact; I know it is my hope and commitment. This position is not relativism; it is a principled refusal of the stacked deck that forces choice between loaded dualities such as realism and relativism.
h27a | TAKE A WALK ON THE WILY SIDE . . .
pdjh | When my students read Haraway, they are often struck by the density of descriptions that span centuries and cultures, corporations and identities, without ever being nonspecific. Her stories of the bomb, gene, brain, mouse, vampire, and the like are not generic stories of mice, for instance, but of OncoMouse™ and even of particular OncoMice™ at specific labs. Students complain sometimes

bd9h | about the too much information that inhabit them, and worry that the stories are biased. They often voice as criticism what Haraway (1997, 68) takes as a principle of research: "Stories and facts do not naturally keep a respectable distance; indeed, they promiscuously cohabit the same very material places." The actual liveliness, the wiliness of nature and culture as natureculture is what I wish to point to and respond with. But often this does not convince them. Instead I have found that the best way to get my students to appreciate Haraway's necessary work is to give them an assignment. I call it the "Implosion Project," after her most pro- ductive methodological image. Implosion is a concept whose first dictionary def- inition is "a violent collapse inward," as when a star collapses on its own gravity to form a black hole. Analogously, world histories are not just found inside objects, and objects do not "point" to them; in important ways each object is made of imploded histories: "Any interesting being in technoscience, like a text- book, molecule, equation, mouse, pipette, bomb, fungus, technician, agitator, or scientist can-and often should be teased open to show the sticky economic, technical, political, organic, historical, mythic, and textual threads that make up its tissues" (Haraway 1997, 68).
m047 | Haraway's lists are always important constructions. Here, facts, media, things, people are equally all implosions, all material-semiotic actors, all unpack- able, all full of different threads that "can-and often should" be teased out. The list of threads-"economic, technical, political, organic, historical, mythic, and textual"-appears in more or less similar forms, with economic, labor, episte- mological, and other dimensions appearing. Haraway (1997, 68) also defines implosion as a force bringing multiple dimensions together, connecting them, and as "a claim for heterogeneous and continual construction through historically lo- cated practice, where the actors are not all human." So the first part of the assignment is to see how many dimensions of a particular object one knows about, to explore the vastly different stories that one can tell about it.
gy8c | The multiple dimensions that make up objects also make up ourselves, as well as our categories. Telling the stories of an object therefore begins unpacking our own clichés, our certainties, our affects. Writes Haraway (1997, 68): "The point is simple: the technical, textual, organic, historical, formal, mythic, eco- nomic, and political dimensions of entities, actions, and worlds implode in the gravity well of technoscience or perhaps of any world massive enough to bend our attention, warp our certainties, and sustain our lives."
y4mj | Following connections is thus the only way to proceed, no matter how worrisome the result. The physics here is serious: the world itself is warped and

m4ju | the straight lines we see between categories may be twisted, but those twists must be carefully followed. Only in this manner can we confront the histories and the intolerable not just in objects but in ourselves, in our identities as partial, in our senses, our worries, and our common sense. As does Deleuze, though in an implosive, grounded register, Haraway seeks other ways of thinking, writing, and doing politics. "We do not seek partiality for its own sake, but for the sake of the connections and unexpected openings situated knowledges make possible" (Haraway 1988, 196).
a0mb | The Implosion Project is designed to guide one through the arduous home- work required to write an implosion with awareness and commitment. It consists of a series of questions, organized by dimensions to explore the tissues of an object. Following these is a set of analytic twists, each one turning the implosion on oneself, one's common sense, and on the world. The project originated while I was a teaching assistant for Haraway's "Science and Politics" class at the Uni- versity of California, Santa Cruz. I came to see that it helped generate more interesting projects, ones that mattered to the writer, and at the same time helped explicate some aspects of Haraway's unique style and power. I have continued to experiment with it and assign it in almost all my classes. I will explain how after I outline the process.
ki8m | IMPLOSION PROJECT: The Assignment
km8w | Implosion Projects are attempts to teach and learn about the embeddedness of objects, facts, actions, and people in the world and the world in them. The emphasis is on details and nonobvious connections, as well as on the many di- mensions with which we can analyze them: labor, professional, material, tech- nological, political, economic, symbolic, textual, bodily, historical, educational.
wzno | Pick an artifact, a fact, a process as "it." Make sure it is as specific as possible (not just fluoxetine, but one of those colored, branded Prozac pills that is in your medicine cabinet; not just the fact that a monkey can use sign language, but the materialized, stated claim in a 1999 journal article). How can it be conceptualized? What is it to different groups of people and individuals? How is it situated in the world and how is the world situated in it? Following is a hastily put-together, quite incomplete, yet apparently excessive list of possibly relevant aspects of any artifact (whether it be a social movement, a name, a grouping, a set of actions, or a process in the form of a thing, a grain of rice, a mouse, a mouse pad, an ad about a mouse, you, a fact of life, a book, a statistic, an event, a story . . . ).

iwn5 | With your specific artifact, fact, object, or process in front of you, brain- storm: Go through the list slowly and try to answer each question as best you can. Diagram or make a chart if you need to. It may seem hard to know where to put different answers, as the questions are indiscrete. "Potent categories col- lapse into each other. Analytically and provisionally we may want to move what counts as the political to the background and to foreground elements called tech- nical, formal, or quantitative, or to highlight the textual and semiotic while muting the economic or mythic" (Haraway 1997, 68).
uooz | Note your form of certainty as well: whether you feel you know the answer in detail, have a good idea about it, a guess, or no idea. Take your time. It may take more than one session. Don't do any extra research at this point. Type it in so you can add more later. If there are more dimensions that strike you as needing inclusions, add them and iterate questions for them as well.
pxbq | These questions are only hints, but remember that almost any answer pro- vides a cluster of new artifacts (try not to go more than three levels down). The object of this project is to explore the real complexity of specificity and situat- edness. These words only mean something in the context of specific knowledges and matter, and in contests over what matters. In these contexts they allow us to get at the world in an effective and affective way; they help show us how the world matters and how it might be otherwise. Following this is a set of analytic twists, each one turning the implosion on oneself, <LATEX>\mathrm { o n e } ^ { \prime } s</LATEX> common sense, and on the world.
