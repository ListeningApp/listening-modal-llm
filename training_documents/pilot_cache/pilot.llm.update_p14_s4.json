        "content": "0fpw | Philosophically, some respondents viewed the term emerging practice as a misnomer. Emerging practice was perceived as a resurgence of previous roles and practice settings or a natural evolution in the profession rather than a new phenomenon within the profession. Among the divergent views about emerging practice, participants questioned whether emerging practice is potentially detrimental to the profession and its future. While some respondents thought it to be a critical element of the profession's transformation from the medical model to community-based practices and alternative models of service delivery, others suggested it serves to further confuse occupational therapy practitioners, other professionals, and the public about the profession's identity and scope of practice. This dichotomy of opinions appears to characterize Bruhn's description of the \"boundary dilemma\" within the profession regarding the expansion of practice beyond the medical and rehabilitation environments. The study results indicate there is a degree of uncertainty about whether the profession's domain of practice should include the delivery of services outside the health care arena.\ndqn8 | Are the views of emerging practice and its role within the profession held by the study participants significant and representative of the profession at large? One possible answer may be found in the theory of paradigm shifts. According to Kuhn, paradigm shifts follow a predictable process within a profession. During the preparadigm stage, proposed changes to the common values and practices of a profession are discussed among its members. As a new paradigm emerges, unsettlement and change often leads to a period of crisis until the new paradigm is adopted. If the profession of occupational therapy is indeed undergoing a paradigm shift to its third paradigm with a return to a focus on the occupational nature of humans and occupation-based practice, then perhaps the perceptions, opinions, and questions about emerging practice are inherent within the transition of paradigms. As Kielhofner observed, a paradigm shift represents a crises within a profession because its \"members find it unsettling to abandon the way of thinking and doing that the paradigm provides. In everyday language, we might say that a paradigm shift represents a change of both mind and heart.\" Emerging practice, as described by the small sample in this study, could be viewed as a component of the paradigm shift within the profession.\ncop0 | Second, emerging practice presents opportunities for professional growth and satisfaction as well as significant barriers to its advancement.\nlhkq | The many rewards and challenges of emerging practice are both intrinsic and extrinsic in nature. Respondents provided multiple examples of the opportunities emerging practice offers for professional growth and satisfaction including demonstrating the value of the profession and seeing the positive results of their work with clients. As well, for many practitioners, being on the forefront of a practice area provided welcome opportunities for creativity, independence, and collaboration with other professionals, service providers, and community members.\n82ju | At the same time, the challenges experienced in emerging practice appear to be formidable. The results indicate a common barrier is obtaining funding for services in settings in which third-party reimbursement is unavailable. Additionally, occupational therapy practitioners often need to acquire skills in marketing, business management, and program development, which necessitate a commitment of time and financial resources. Participants also identified the issues of professional regulation, scope of practice, professional isolation, and a lack of sufficient evidence-based research as significant challenges to establishing and maintaining a successful emerging practice. Similar obstacles have been noted by other occupational therapy practitioners seeking to provide services in new areas of practice. While acknowledging the challenges associated with developing innovative services in community settings, Loukas offered five models to guide therapists in establishing opportunities for clients to improve occupational performance in \"real-life environments\" based on successful examples within the profession across a variety of settings. The diversity of these service delivery models present opportunities for therapists to identify one that best matches the need of the clients to be served with the knowledge and skills of the practitioner.\ny2qo | Implications\n1piq | Continuing professional dialogue and the development of a position paper on emerging practice by AOTA may assist practitioners and academicians alike in reaching consensus about the fundamental issues related to the role of emerging practice within the profession, its required competencies, and future course. Ultimately, the continuance and growth of emerging practice will depend on thoughtful decisions and the ongoing support of the profession's members.\n7fqw | While the participants in the current study addressed the value found in mentoring occupational therapy students in emerging practices, the limited\nrhaz | number of occupational therapists in emerging practice settings has implications for preparing occupational therapy graduates for future practice. In a recent study of Level One fieldwork, Johnson, Koenig, Piersol, Santalucia, and Wachter-Schultz linked the increasing frequency of supervision by nonoccupational therapy personnel to an increasing number of emerging practice settings. Among the health professions, a shared concern for the preparation and support of clinical or fieldwork educators or preceptors who supervise students in clinical and community settings is contributing to the development of new program and curricular models. As well, a variety of models for student supervision in practice settings are being implemented and evaluated. Collaborative (more than one student per supervisor), interdisciplinary (supervision provided by a professional outside of a student's discipline), and multiple mentoring (two or more students mentored by two or more clinicians) are three models applied to fieldwork experiences. Continued development of supervision models and strategies will be necessary to educate and support occupational therapy and nonoccupational therapy personnel alike to meet the supervisory and mentoring needs of occupational therapy students for emerging practice.\nwak1 | Greater information dissemination about emerging practice activities and outcomes through electronic and other media could address the sense of isolation voiced by practitioners in this study. More frequent topic-specific articles in the professional literature could assist the profession in further understanding the new directions in practice and models of service delivery. While the AOTA SISs and associated quarterly newsletters address a breadth of practice areas, a specific SIS for emerging or community-based practices may allow therapists to more easily network and collaborate about issues specific to developing and delivering services in those practice settings.\nwtfz | Regulatory bodies and policy makers are in the position to facilitate or impede emerging practice and its future development through state practice acts that define and regulate the scope of occupational therapy practice. As such, members of regulatory boards, state professional associations, and agencies should be key participants in the decisions that will shape the future role of emerging practice.\nqy1i | Finally, the study results clearly articulated the need for the profession and its members to support and conduct timely research to document the efficacy of occupational therapy services in emerging practice. The research findings would add to the body of evidence\n1k9e | supporting the value and effectiveness of occupational therapy practice and services.\n5bjs | STUDY LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS",
