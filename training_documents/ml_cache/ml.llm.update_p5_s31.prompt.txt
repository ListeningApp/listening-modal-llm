You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

his3 | different keyword and searching across all databases2. Although the use of ML in medical science can be dated back to the 1970s (Davenport and Kalakota, 2019), more rapid growth is evident in the past 10 years. Moreover, publications based on 'multi-omics integration' and 'multi- omics and machine learning' have started to emerge in the last 5 years and have gained popularity in the precision and computational medicine domain. Although deep learning is widely popular in other related do- mains (such as medical imaging (Erickson et al., 2017) and clinical natural language processing (Wu et al., 2020)), the interest has been more limited for multi-omics analysis (Tan et al., 2020b). This is because multi-omics studies are challenging to deploy as they require specialised high-throughput omic infrastructure (as highlighted earlier in section 2). This fact is reinforced by the evidence that most of the current literature employs deep learning on large-scale multi-omics datasets from open sources such as TCGA3, CCLE4 and GDSC5 for cancer prog- nosis (Poirion et al., 2018; Seal et al., 2020; Tong et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) and anti-cancer drug response (Sharifi-Noghabi et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2020).
m50z | 3. Challenges in multi-omics analysis using machine learning
me84 | The use of ML to analyse high-throughput generated multi-omic data poses key unique challenges. They can be summarised as follows.
o56m | 3.1. Heterogeneity, sparsity and outliers
slz6 | Multi-omic data from different high-throughput sources are usually
90k5 | heterogeneous (Bersanelli et al., 2016). For example, transcriptomics and proteomics use different normalisation and scaling techniques before omics analysis. This leads to different dynamic ranges and data distribution. Also, some omics are more prone to generating sparse data (e.g. in the case of metabolomics, some values might be below the limit of detection and hence assigned null value (Antonelli et al., 2019)) than others. Therefore, imputation (Liew et al., 2011) and outlier detection (Vivian et al., 2020) should be considered for each omic separately, before planning their integration.
9m8s | 3.2. Class imbalance and overfitting
893y | In disease classification, certain disease classes are rarer than others which can cause a class imbalance in the multi-omics dataset (Haas et al., 2017). For example, primary hypertension is the most common form of hypertension with 95% prevalence while endocrine hyperten- sion occurs in only 5% (Rimoldi et al., 2014). The ML model trained using an imbalanced dataset may be overfitted i.e. high accuracy for training data but underperformance for unseen test data. Therefore, to classify these two types of hypertension one of the following approaches can be used: 1) Collect more data if possible, or 2) consider using weighted or normalised metrics to measure the ML performance (such as F1-Score or Kappa (Jeni et al., 2013)), or 3) consider over or under- sampling the under or over-represented class respectively, or 4) consider synthetic sample generation (such as SMOTE (Chawla et al., 2002) or ADASYN (Haibo He et al., 2008)) for the under-represented class. Similarly, techniques such as regularisation, bagging, hyper- parameter tuning and cross-validation can be used to balance bias- variance trade-off (Lee, 2010). Any of the above approaches can be used, depending on data and problem, to overcome the class imbalance and overfitting problems.
favz | 3.3. More features than data (p >> n)
7szx | Most multi-omics datasets suffer from the classical 'curse of dimen- sionality' problem, i.e. having much fewer observation samples (n) than
hx9e | multi-omics features (p) (Misra et al., 2019). The resulting high- dimensional space often contains correlated features which are redun- dant and can mislead the algorithm training (James et al., 2017). The dimensional space of the data can be reduced by employing dimen- sionality reduction techniques such as feature extraction and feature se- lection. Feature extraction refers here to techniques computing a subset of representative features which summarise the original dataset and its dimensions6. These features are functions of the original ones, for instance, PCA (principal component analysis) (Jolliffe, 2002), LDA (linear discriminant analysis) (Martinez and Kak, 2001) and MDS (multidi- mensional scaling) (Young and Hamer, 1987). On the other hand, feature selection finds a subset of the original features that maximise the accuracy of a predictive model (Guyon and Elisseeff, 2003). It can be based on prior knowledge i.e. evident from known literature or based on a database such as a Biofilter (Bush et al., 2009). Formally, feature se- lection methods can be classed as filter (Information gain (Roobaert et al., 2006), ReliefF (Beretta and Santaniello, 2011), Chi-square sta- tistics (Lee et al., 2011)), wrapper (Recursive feature elimination (Guyon et al., 2002), Sequential feature selection (Pudil et al., 1994)) and embedded (such as LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) (Zou, 2006)) techniques. Xu et al.(Xu et al., 2019b) and Stańczyk (Stańczyk and Jain, 2015) provide an excellent resource for understanding and exploring the use of different dimensionality reduc- tion techniques in the generic ML domain. Meng (Meng et al., 2016b) offers a review of these methods from the perspective of multi-omics data analysis.
ywn2 | 3.4. Computation and storage cost
a63r | The use of ML for multi-omics analysis comes with computational and data storage cost (Herrmann et al., 2020). Most ML algorithms require high computation power and large volumes of storage capacity to save the logs, results and analysis. In recent years, ML models can be deployed on dedicated graphics processing units (Schmidhuber, 2015) and cloud computing platforms (Armbrust et al., 2010) such as Amazon EC2 ("Amazon EC2,", 2021), Microsoft Azure ("Cloud Computing Ser- vices | Microsoft Azure,", 2021a) and Google Cloud Platform ("Cloud Computing Services,", 2021b). The related costs should be considered well in advance before planning an ML-based multi-omics workflow.
