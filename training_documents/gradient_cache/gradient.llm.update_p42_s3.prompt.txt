You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

4khi | Gradient-based learning algorithms can use one of two classes of methods to update the parameters. The first method, dubbed "batch gradient," is the classical one: the gradients are accumulated over the entire training set, and the parameters are updated after the exact gradient has been so computed. In the second method, called "stochastic gradient," a partial, or noisy, gradient is evaluated on the basis of one single training sample (or a small number of samples), and the parameters are updated using this approximate gradient. The training samples can be selected randomly or according to a properly randomized sequence. In the stochastic version the gradient estimates are noisy, but the parameters are updated much more often than with the batch version. An empirical result of considerable practical importance is that on tasks with large, redundant data sets, the stochastic version is considerably faster than the batch version, sometimes by orders of magnitude [117]. Although the reasons for this are not totally understood theoretically, an intuitive explanation can be found in the following extreme example. Let us take an example where the training database is composed of two copies of the same subset. Then accumulating the gradient over the whole set would cause redundant computations to be performed. On the other hand, running Stochastic Gradient once on this training set would amount to performing two complete learning iterations over the small subset. This idea can be generalized to training sets where there exist no precise repetition of the same pattern but where some redundancy is present. In fact stochastic update must be better when there is redundancy, i.e., when a certain level of generalization is expected.
7fh2 | Many authors have claimed that second-order methods should be used in lieu of gradient descent for NN training. The literature abounds with recommendations [118] for classical second-order methods such as the Gauss-Newton or Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms for quasi-Newton methods such as Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno, limited-storage Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno, or for various versions of the conjugate gradients method. Unfortunately, all of the above methods are unsuit- able for training large NN's on large data sets. The Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt methods require O(N3) operations per update, where N is the number of parameters, which makes them impractical for even moderate size networks. Quasi-Newton methods require "only" O(N2) operations per update, but that still makes them impractical for large networks. Limited-storage Broy- den-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno's and conjugate gradients require only O(N) operations per update so they would appear appropriate. Unfortunately, their convergence speed relies on an accurate evaluation of successive "conjugate descent directions" which only makes sense in "batch" mode. For large data sets, the speed-up brought by these methods over regular batch gradient descent cannot match the enormous speed up brought by the use of
5isn | stochastic gradient. Several authors have attempted to use conjugate gradient with small batches or batches of increasing sizes [119], [120], but those attempts have not yet been demonstrated to surpass a carefully tuned stochastic gradient. Our experiments were performed with a stochastic method that scales the parameter axes so as to minimize the eccentricity of the error surface.
5vry | Owing to the reasons given in Appendix B, we prefer to update the weights after each presentation of a single pattern in accordance with stochastic update methods. The patterns are presented in a constant random order, and the training set is typically repeated 20 times.
9w33 | Our update algorithm is dubbed the stochastic diagonal Levenberg-Marquardt method where an individual learning rate (step size) is computed for each parameter (weight) before each pass through the training set [20], [34], [121]. These learning rates are computed using the diagonal terms of an estimate of the Gauss-Newton approximation to the Hessian (second derivative) matrix. This algorithm is not believed to bring a tremendous increase in learning speed but it converges reliably without requiring extensive adjustments of the learning parameters. It corrects major ill-conditioning of the loss function that are due to the peculiarities of the network architecture and the training data. The additional cost of using this procedure over standard stochastic gradient descent is negligible.

dqwn | Unfortunately, using those derivatives leads to well-known problems associated with every Newton-like algorithm: these terms can be negative and can cause the gradient algorithm to move uphill instead of downhill. Therefore, our second approximation is a well-known trick called the Gauss-Newton approximation, which guarantees that the second derivative estimates are nonnegative. The Gauss-Newton approximation essentially ignores the nonlinearity of the estimated function (the NN, in our case), but not that of the loss function.
