You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

y4mj | Introduction
vpgq | ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO, a man I'd never met sent me a book I'd never heard of by a man who'd been dead nearly 90 years.
ousl | That little book changed my entire life. As I put into practice the principles you'll learn about in this book, the results were astonishing - and they began almost instantly and continue to this day.
m4ju | When The Science of Getting Rich arrived in the mail that afternoon I immediately ripped open the package, sat down, and read it with an open mind - mostly because the title was just so intriguing. And even though I must admit I found some of the old-fashioned language and some of the ideas in the first part a bit confusing, there was something about it that compelled me to reread those little confus- ing bits two or three times until I got it!
a0mb | Once I did that, I couldn't stop reading until I'd read the whole thing!
ki8m | Right away I began to put into practice what the book outlines ... and everything began to change. "Coincidences" happened - happy ones that led to connections with people ... that led to more con- nections ... that led to money beginning to flow toward me in increasingly larger amounts and from several sources, including new and unexpected ones.
km8w | And even though changing your habitual thinking is difficult and I'm still not as good at it as I intend to be, my businesses began to "click," my income doubled , then tripled, and continues to rise ... my cramped city apartment has given way to a spacious waterfront house ... I've established reward- ing new relationships with many generous, successful, wealthy people ... and opportunities to be, do, have, and give more continue to show up at my doorstep almost daily.
wzno | It's amazing - and wonderful.
xagm | Until this book arrived, nothing I had ever read or heard before had explained to me so clearly that there are universal laws at work regarding wealth and success and that if we'll just work with those laws - go with the tide instead of trying to swim against it (usually unknowingly) - the results we want will begin to come to us. That if we will scientifically reproduce the causes of wealth, we will invariably reproduce the results.
iwn5 | Now, right off the bat author Wallace D. Wattles says that instead of questioning how these prin- ciples work, you'll need simply to accept them and begin to practice them. So I did that, even though as I read I did find myself resisting from time to time and thinking, "Well, I don't know if I can agree with that." But I'd already decided just to accept (at least temporarily) each premise as if I did thoroughly believ it.
uooz | By the time I finished the book I understood why he had included that warning. You see, some of what you'll read or hear will most likely challenge some of your previous thinking. That seems to be the case for most people. But keep on, and you'll soon see how Mr. Wattles beautifully builds each chapter on what he presents in the preceding ones. I think you'll find yourself saying - as I and many others have - "Oh, now I see why he said that. Now I see how it all fits together."
pxbq | I believe, also, that you'll find it absolutely refreshing to know that to get rich by the method outlined here, it is essential that you embrace and practice what we all know as the Golden Rule ... that the daily practice of gratitude is one of the conduits by which your wealth will come to you ... and that

lq35 | by accomplishing your financial dreams through this method, everyone with whom you come into contact will also have more.
3g9w | A far cry from the dog-eat-dog, claw your way to the top, anything for a buck mentality so many believe to be the only way to wealth.

ylhz | You WILL see results!
a3td | You already have within you everything you need to turn your dreams into reality. You are a person of infinite worth and unique possibility. Even if you don't think of yourself as a creative person, and even if you've failed before, and even if you think you've tried everything, open your mind to this book.
ex5k | You've probably heard the saying, "When the student is ready, the teacher appears." That has certainly held true for me and many, many others, and perhaps you're ready, too - right now. If you're not yet where you want to be in terms of income and your own personal success, the problem may not be what you're doing so much as how you're doing it. And that begins with how you think.
9d4o | If you want to change your life, you may just need to change your mind!

5esx | Editor's Note
m5ka | I've lightly edited the 90-year-old manuscript to accomodate modern readers. Unfortu- nately, though, there is as yet no graceful way in English to avoid completely the use of the masculine gender to represent all people, especially in working with such an old book.
byu8 | Luckily for us women, we have vast experience in reading ourselves back in - just as we have learned to dance backward! Where it does not interfere with the gracefulness of the writing, I have changed man to person, men to people, and mankind to humankind.
76b0 | To Mr. Wattles' credit, although writing just after the turn of the 20th century, he makes it clear that The Science of Getting Rich applies equally to men and women alike.

vafm | Preface
2zmw | THIS BOOK IS PRAGMATICAL, NOT PHILOSOPHICAL - a practical manual, not a treatise upon theories. It is intended for the men and women whose most pressing need is for money, who wish to get rich first, and philosophize afterward. It is for those who want results and who are willing to take the conclusions of science as a basis for action, without going into all the processes by which those conclusions were reached.
bf9k | It is expected that the reader will take the fundamental statements upon faith, just as he would take statements concerning a law of electrical action if they were promulgated by a Marconi or an Edison, and, taking the statements upon faith, that he will prove their truth by acting upon them without fear or hesitation. Every man or woman who does this will certainly get rich, for the science herein applied is an exact science and failure is impossible.
otkr | In writing this book I have sacrificed all other considerations to plainness and simplicity of style, so that all might understand. The plan of action laid down herein was deduced from the conclusions of philosophy. It has been thoroughly tested, and bears the supreme test of practical experiment: It works.

9mrz | The Right To Be Rich
pk06 | WHATEVER MAY BE SAID IN PRAISE OF POVERTY, the fact remains that it is not possible to live a really complete or successful life unless one is rich. No one can rise to his greatest possible height in talent or soul development unless he has plenty of money, for to unfold the soul and to de-velop talent he must have many things to use, and he cannot have these things unless he has money to buy them with.
7wn9 | A person develops in mind, soul, and body by making use of things, and society is so organized that man must have money in order to become the possessor of things. Therefore, the basis of all advancement must be the science of getting rich.
wcd0 | The object of all life is development, and everything that lives has an inalienable right to all the development it is capable of attaining.
caos | A person's right to life means his right to have the free and unrestricted use of all the things which may be necessary to his fullest mental, spiritual, and physical unfoldment; or, in other words, his right to be rich.
qrvy | In this book, I shall not speak of riches in a figurative way. To be really rich does not mean to be satisfied or contented with a little. No one ought to be satisfied with a little if he is capable of using and enjoying more. The purpose of nature is the advancement and unfoldment of life, and everyone should have all that can contribute to the power, elegance, beauty, and richness of life. To be content with less is sinful.
pn9j | The person who owns all he wants for the living of all the life he is capable of living is rich, and no person who has not plenty of money can have all he wants. Life has advanced so far and become so complex that even the most ordinary man or woman requires a great amount of wealth in order to live in a manner that even approaches completeness. Every person naturally wants to become all that they are capable of becoming. This desire to realize innate possibilities is inherent in human nature; we cannot help wanting to be all that we can be. Success in life is becoming what you want to be. You can become what you want to be only by making use of things, and you can have the free use of things only as you become rich enough to buy them. To understand the science of getting rich is therefore the most essential of all knowledge.
1pmc | There is nothing wrong in wanting to get rich. The desire for riches is really the desire for a richer, fuller, and more abundant life - and that desire is praiseworthy. The person who does not desire to live more abundantly is abnormal, and so the person who does not desire to have money enough to buy all he wants is abnormal.
5z6q | There are three motives for which we live: We live for the body, we live for the mind, we live for the soul. No one of these is better or holier than the other; all are alike desirable, and no one of the three - body, mind, or soul - can live fully if either of the others is cut short of full life and expression. It is not right or noble to live only for the soul and deny mind or body, and it is wrong to live for the intellect and deny body or soul.
yeoh | The Science of Getting Rich
b8hf | We are all acquainted with the loathsome consequences of living for the body and denying both mind and soul, and we see that real life means the complete expression of all that a person can give forth through body, mind, and soul. Whatever he can say, no one can be really happy or satisfied unless his body is living fully in its every function, and unless the same is true of his mind and his soul. Wherever there is unexpressed possibility or function not performed, there is unsatisfied desire. Desire is possibil- ity seeking expression or function seeking performance.
hntf | A person cannot live fully in body without good food, comfortable clothing, and warm shelter, and without freedom from excessive toil. Rest and recreation are also necessary to his physical life.
99fo | One cannot live fully in mind without books and time to study them, without opportunity for travel and observation, or without intellectual companionship.
y5r7 | To live fully in mind a person must have intellectual recreations, and must surround himself with all the objects of art and beauty he is capable of using and appreciating.
lrry | To live fully in soul, a person must have love, and love is denied fullest expression by poverty.
hvhm | A person's highest happiness is found in the bestowal of benefits on those he loves; love finds its most natural and spontaneous expression in giving. The individual who has nothing to give cannot fill his place as a spouse or parent, as a citizen, or as a human being. It is in the use of material things that a person finds full life for his body, develops his mind, and unfolds his soul. It is therefore of supreme importance to each individual to be rich.
863b | It is perfectly right that you should desire to be rich. If you are a normal man or woman you cannot help doing so. It is perfectly right that you should give your best attention to the science of getting rich, for it is the noblest and most necessary of all studies. If you neglect this study, you are derelict in your duty to yourself, to God and humanity, for you can render to God and humanity no greater service than to make the most of yourself.

d5bi | There Is A Science of Getting Rich
ba4l | THERE IS A SCIENCE OF GETTING RICH, and it is an exact science, like algebra or arithmetic. There are certain laws which govern the process of acquiring riches, and once these laws are learned and obeyed by anyone, that person will get rich with mathematical certainty.
ffx8 | The ownership of money and property comes as a result of doing things in a certain way, and those who do things in this certain way - whether on purpose or accidentally - get rich, while those who do not do things in this certain way - no matter how hard they work or how able they are - remain poor.
s6su | It is a natural law that like causes always produce like effects, and, therefore, any man or woman who learns to do things in this certain way will infallibly get rich.
y219 | That the above statement is true is shown by the following facts:
