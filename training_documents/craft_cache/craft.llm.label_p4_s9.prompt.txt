You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

vpgq | One common feature of the articles with multiple formal propositions is that in all of them the propositions are labeled as such (Pl, P2, etc.) in the relevant figure. This is im- mensely helpful for guiding the reader through the propositions and for linking the text to the figure. Even in articles without propositions, figures and tables are well inte- grated with the text. As one is constructing a paper, it is important to visualize the final published piece, with the tables and figures embedded adjacent to the ideas being ex-

This requires conscious effort, since when we prepare manuscripts for submission, we append the figures and tables to the end of the document, which may make it more likely that they are treated as afterthoughts (i.e., out of sight, out of mind). Effective authors not only use figures and tables that correspond to the text (e.g., same construct labels) but also actively integrate them (e.g., by giving an overview or by referring to them periodically in the text). While it is true, as Sutton and Staw noted, that "diagrams are not theory" (1995: 376), these accessories can be powerful tools for clarifying and enhancing the theoretical ideas in a paper.
a0mb | CONCLUSION
ki8m | The purpose of this exercise is not to provide an exhaustive review on the subject, nor is it to recommend a particular template for theoretical articles for AMR. Indeed, as the ten Best Articles illustrate, there is no single, most-preferred way to write a paper for AMR. Just as good theoreti- cal contributions can emerge from a range of disciplinary and epistemological camps, good manuscript craftsmanship emerges from con- scious attention to a variety of structural ele- ments. The point is to illustrate that with rela- tively little effort invested (e.g., downloading and studying a handful of papers), one can learn a lot about how successful authors leverage the structure of a manuscript to aid in effectively communicating their theoretical contribution. Aspiring authors may also want to examine the structure of other AMR articles that they espe- cially like or often cite, which "means looking at-rather than through-our more persuasive writings" (Van Maanen, 1995: 135).
km8w | In a theoretical paper the author is faced with a mixed blessing: greater freedom and page length within which to develop theory but also more editorial rope with which to hang him/ herself. Consequently, structure and writing are arguably even more critical for the success of this type of work than for an empirical paper. As we have seen from this selective review of award-winning articles published in AMR, there is no "one best way" to structure a theory paper. What these pieces do share in common is the thoughtful and careful matching of manuscript form and structure to the theoretical purpose of the paper, which enables the reader to see
