o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

0bqy | Other more sophisticated elements have been developed for modeling steel members with dominant shear yielding behavior, that are also applicable to EBF links. On the basis of the method proposed by Ricles and Popov [105, 106], Kazemi and Erfani [119, 120] developed a model with a combined shear-flexural inner hinge and two rigid beams on its sides. Numerical results were compared to the test data reported by Kasai and Popov [10] to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach. An improved version of this model with an axial-shear-flexural hinge was recently developed by Kazemi and Hoseinzadeh Asl [121]. A mixed-formulation (or force-based) element was proposed by Saritas and Filippou [122] with independent displacement, stress, and strain fields, where the displacement field was based on Timoshenko's beam theory. As a result, shear locking was avoided and mesh refinement was deemed unnecessary. Since the axial-shear-flexural interaction was
b780 | captured using material data only, the model did not need further calibration for different loading and boundary conditions, unlike most of the methods with concentrated hinges. Comparison between numerical and experimental results revealed the accuracy and robustness of the method. Papachristidis et al. [123] have also proposed a force-based element; however, considering a three- dimensional state of stress and taking into account the interaction of axial, shear, flexural, and torsional actions. The kinematics of the model were obtained through the natural-mode method. Fairly accurate results were reported using this element when compared with the results of previous tests and also accurate FE analyses.
ccmb | 5. EBF Systems
ma93 | 5.1. Characteristics and Capacity Design Approach
c6hh | This section provides general insight into the behavior and design philosophy of EBF systems, while the subsequent section is devoted to more in-depth discussion about the research on the seismic performance of these structures. As mentioned by Popov and Engelhardt [78], the use of eccentric bracing for resisting wind loads was well recognized even in the 1930s [124]; however, the use of this system for seismic applications was proposed in the 1970s in Japan [1, 2]. The studies of Roeder and Popov [4, 5, 125] in the late 1970s pioneered the research on EBFs in the United States. The cyclic loading tests of Roeder and Popov [4, 125] and Manheim [86] on a reduced-scale three-story one-bay EBF, the pseudo-dynamic tests on a full-scale six-story two-bay EBF as a part of the U.S .- Japan Cooperative Program in Earthquake Engineering reported by Roeder et al. [89] and Foutch [90], the shaking table tests of Whittaker et al. [16, 126, 127] on a scaled replica of the same six-story EBF, and the pseudo-dynamic tests of Balendra et al. [128] as well as the early analytical studies of Hjelmstad and Popov [129], Ricles and Popov [105], and Popov et al. [130] on EBF systems, all confirmed that this system could be effectively used for seismic applications. The EBF system was utilized in several major applications (e.g. [131-133]) shortly after these studies. Short links in EBF systems are preferred since they will provide higher stiffness, strength, and ductility over intermediate and long links [78, 130]. Nevertheless, Popov and Engelhardt [78] demonstrated that using links that are too short will
y7ea | impose unmanageably high rotation demands on links. It was also noted by these researchers that the stiffness and consequently the fundamental period (T) of EBF systems can be adjusted simply by altering the link length.
nav4 | The capacity design approach [78, 130] is utilized in the EBF design to ensure concentration of yielding in links while keeping other members essentially elastic. First, the links are sized and then, other members are designed to resist the loads generated by the yielded and strain hardened links. Plastic design methods for EBF systems were initially proposed by Roeder and Popov [4], Manheim [86], and Kasai and Popov [15] in the 1970s and 1980s. An allowable stress design method was also developed by Teal [134] in the late 1970s. In the current practice, an elastic analysis is typically conducted during the design of EBF systems. Design examples for EBF systems can be found, for instance, in Bruneau et al. [50], the AISC Seismic Design Manual [135], Popov et al. [130] and Becker and Ishler [136].
gem8 | The overstrength of links (2) must be considered in the design of members other than the links to estimate the maximum loads that might be imposed on these members by the fully yielded and strain hardened links. Design specifications (e.g. [3, 137]) provide overstrength values which may be different for beams, braces, and columns. The AISC Seismic Provisions [3] suggest a value of $2 = 1.25 for I-shaped links during the capacity design of EBF braces, which is lower than the traditional value of 1.5 (Section 2.1), mainly for considerations of economy. It is worth noting that a recent numerical study by Yiğitsoy et al. [103] demonstrated the adequacy of the current overstrength provisions for braces.
e8nr | The design of a beam in an EBF system is often problematic since it is generally under high axial force and high bending moment. Increasing the size of the beam will not benefit the design, since the link-induced forces will also increase. Several methods such as using short links and braces with moment connections possessing inclination angles above 40° can reduce the demand on beams [50, 78, 88, 130, 138]. In addition, an EBF configuration proposed by Engelhardt and Popov [88] (Figure 1e) can minimize the beam axial force at the cost of using larger links and reducing the system redundancy. A similar EBF configuration was tested by Yang [104] in the early 1980s. In order to aid this design difficulty, a lower overstrength factor is used in AISC 341-10 [3] for the capacity design of
k78w | beams when compared to that of braces. This is justified by considering the positive effect of the composite floor on beam performance as well as the fact that limited yielding of a beam will not negatively affect the behavior of an EBF system, as long as the stability of the beam is assured [11, 64, 139]. Based on extensive FE analyses on EBF sub-assemblages, Yiğitsoy et al. [103] suggested that the overstrength value recommended in AISC 341-10 [3] could be reduced even further in the design of an EBF beam with I-shaped links, provided that the demand-to-capacity ratio of the beam is kept below unity. For other cases a maximum unbraced length recommendation was developed. The FE analyses demonstrated that the probable yielding of the beam due to the above relaxation would not be detrimental and would only affect the brace end moment.
g9du | Early analytical and experimental studies [16, 105] demonstrated that all of the links above the level of the column under consideration would not develop their maximum shear forces simultaneously. Based on this observation a lower overstrength factor was suggested by AISC 341-10 [3] for the capacity design of columns in EBFs of three or more stories of bracing, when compared with the Q2 value used in the design of brace members. Columns also need to be checked for the amplified seismic axial force of Q20PEQ, where 20 is the structural overstrength factor taken as 2.0 per ASCE 7-10 [140] and PEQ is the column axial force generated by the code-specified earthquake loads. It is important to note that drift-induced flexural forces are generally neglected in the design of columns as permitted by AISC 341-10 [3].
f682 | During the design process, it is necessary to estimate link end moments in order to determine the internal force distribution after formation of the expected plastic mechanism. For links located in the middle portion of floor beams (internal links) the end moments will almost be equal throughout a seismic loading. On the other hand, for links connected to columns (external links) the end moments will not be identical in the elastic range. However, early studies of Kasai and Popov [10, 15] proved that for most cases these moments would equalize as the link goes through large plastic rotations. Thus, in both cases, the link end moments can be readily estimated using equilibrium. The only exception reported by Kasai and Popov [10, 15] was the case of external links with p ≤ 1.3, for which the end moments did not equalize at the ultimate state. For such cases, recommendations for moment distribution were developed by these researchers. Kasai and Popov [15] also demonstrated that it is
li1k | advantageous to avoid EBF configurations with inactive links (e.g. Figure 1f) in which only one of the links located at one end of a brace would dissipate most of the energy (and thus become active) while the other would not contribute notably to the energy dissipation of the system (and thus remain inactive).
pbea | It is worth mentioning that early multi-story tests [16, 89, 90] demonstrated that, in some cases, the plastic behavior could be concentrated in the first story links leading to the development of a soft story mechanism. Popov et al. [141] attributed this issue to the incorrect proportioning of the links along the height of the EBFs in the above-mentioned tests. The static pushover and dynamic time- history analyses of Kasai and Popov [15], Ricles and Popov [105], Ricles and Bolin [142, 143], and Popov et al. [141] revealed that in order to achieve a reasonable distribution of link inelastic action throughout an EBF height, all of the links need to have uniform capacity-to-demand ratios.
ccpt | 5.2. Research on Seismic Performance
0fpw | An enormous amount of research on the seismic performance and design of EBF systems has been conducted in the past decades and important aspects of this research are briefly discussed in this section.
dqn8 | In a series of studies by Koboevic and her colleagues [56, 57, 138, 144] in late 1990s and 2010s the seismic behavior of low-, mid-, and high-rise EBF systems was investigated under several earthquake records via nonlinear time-history analysis. Similar to previous findings [11, 64, 139], limited yielding in EBF beams was found acceptable provided that braces were capable of resisting the additional moments. The use of a higher overstrength factor in the capacity design of upper tier columns was recommended, which is the approach used in CSA S16-14 [17]. The importance of drift- induced column flexural forces was also demonstrated in the above studies. The last observation was reported previously by Kasai and Han [145] as well. An iterative design methodology based on selecting appropriate earthquake records and performing time-history analyses was also outlined by these researchers [138, 144]. Although all of the links in the studied EBFs had similar capacity-to-
cop0 | demand ratios, the numerical results [56, 57] revealed that the energy dissipation might be non- uniform along the EBF height and more concentrated in the first and last story links.
lhkq | The seismic behavior of six-story one-bay EBFs with long links under several earthquake records was studied by Tirca and Gioncu [146] in 1999. It was concluded that long links should be used with caution and avoided as much as possible due to their poor performance as observed in some of the studied cases.
82ju | The effect of shear-moment interaction in the plastic design of EBFs was studied by Mastrandrea et al. [147, 148], where a procedure for determining the ultimate link shear force and link end moments was proposed for a given collapse mechanism. In companion studies [149, 150], a design methodology for EBFs was developed which ensures formation of a global mechanism and prevents partial or local collapse mechanisms. The behavior of EBFs designed with this method was compared to that of EBFs designed using a simplified method proposed by Kasai and Han [145] and satisfactory results were reported [149]. Further nonlinear static and dynamic analyses were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in distributing the inelastic link action through an EBF height while preventing the occurrence of undesirable failure modes [150]. The method was also verified via incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) in a study by Mastrandrea et al. [151] in 2013. The above-mentioned plastic mechanism control theory was recently implemented in the design of dual EBFs (i.e. systems composed of EBFs and MRFs) by Montuori et al. [152].
y2qo | In 2006, Köber and Stefanescu [153] compared the seismic behavior of EBFs designed on the basis of four different specifications including AISC 341-02 [68] and Eurocode 8-2002 [154] using nonlinear time-history analysis. It was reported that AISC 341-02 [68] required heavier sections for columns, beams, and braces. In a companion study by these researchers [155] the positive and negative aspects of placing webs of I-shaped braces normal or parallel to the plane of EBFs were investigated. Recommendations regarding each configuration were given considering seismic performance and required amounts of steel. In 2009, Köber and Ștefanescu [156] investigated the effects of using different structural details at the plastic hinge locations near the bottom of the first story columns in EBFs. Numerical results pointed to the advantages of utilizing a detail with reduced column flanges at these locations.
1piq | The effects of frame geometry on the seismic behavior and weight of chevron EBFs were investigated in 2008 by Özhendekci and Özhendekci [157]. It was concluded that EBFs with shear links performed better than those with intermediate and moment links. Furthermore, the use of longer shear links and shorter intermediate links was found to be advantageous in terms of seismic performance. However, it was demonstrated that for shear links, the frame weight would also increase along with the link length.
7fqw | A novel performance-based plastic design (PBPD) methodology for EBFs was proposed by Chao and Goel [158, 159] in 2005. The method, which uses an energy-balance criterion and provides a design base shear for a given hazard level, global yield pattern, and target drift, is a direct method in the sense that it does not require any assessment after the initial design. A procedure for the height- wise distribution of this lateral force was also proposed based on the results of extensive nonlinear dynamic analyses. The results revealed that the EBFs designed using the new approach can satisfy expected performance objectives and perform better than those designed using conventional methods, without any notable increase in material usage. It is worth noting that an application of a performance- based approach for the design of a 97.6m tall EBF system located in the United States was reported by Sabol and Nishi [160] in 2011.
