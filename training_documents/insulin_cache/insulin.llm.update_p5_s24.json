        "content": "51vd | In the NAc, DA projections target GABAergic MSN, which form several subpopulations depending on the expression of D one or D two receptors. The activity of MSNs is modulated by inputs from cholinergic and GABAergic interneurons as well as glial cells. All of these different cell types within the NAc express insulin receptors. Hence, insulin can activate a complex signalling pathway in downstream DA target areas independent of its action in the VTA.\nbaj1 | Two point three point one. Insulin increases DA release and reuptake",
