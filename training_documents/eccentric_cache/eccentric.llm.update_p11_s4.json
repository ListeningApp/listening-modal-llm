        "content": "onum | Two point five. Effect of Loading History\n3iir | Popov and his colleagues noticed that the applied loading history or protocol during an experimental study has a major effect on the observed plastic rotation capacity of EBF links. A comprehensive study on this effect was, however, conducted recently by Richards and Uang.\n7a0a | Okazaki et al. reported unexpected link web fractures for a number of tested short links prior to reaching the code-specified zero point zero eight rad rotation limit. Richards and Uang attributed this issue\no1qp | mainly to the utilized loading history and stated that the loading protocol used by Okazaki et al. was significantly more severe than the loading sequences used in the nineteen eighties tests on short links. Nonlinear time-history analyses were conducted by Richards and Uang on three prototype EBF structures subjected to twenty large-magnitude-small-distance Los Angeles ground motions. The obtained cumulative rotation demands were used to come up with a new protocol which was adopted by AISC three forty-one zero five for the cyclic testing of link-to-column connections. The proposed protocol has fewer cycles with large rotations compared to the old protocol.\njrik | Okazaki et al. retested the specimens which failed to reach the code-specified plastic rotation limit under the AISC three forty-one zero two old protocol using the new revised loading protocol. All of the newly tested specimens exhibited rotation capacities higher than the code-specified limit, with an average increase of fifty-two percent in Y-max. Further studies by Okazaki and his colleagues also confirmed the conclusion that the old protocol is overly demanding compared to the revised protocol for shear links. It is worth noting that other loading protocols, for instance, random loading protocols, loading protocols available in specifications other than the U.S. standards, or more severe loading histories than the AISC three forty-one zero two old protocol have also been used in some studies to demonstrate the sensitivity of the rotation capacity of shear links to the applied loading sequences.\nxv78 | As explained by Richards, if the revised protocol is used for testing intermediate or long links, a modest increase in Y-max for intermediate links and a modest decrease in Y-max for long links might be observed. Okazaki et al. also noted that the cyclic demand imposed on flexural links by both protocols is somewhat similar. The revised protocol was used in a number of experimental and numerical studies on intermediate and long links. Daneshmand and Hashemi demonstrated the sensitivity of the rotation capacity of intermediate links to the employed loading protocol. The value of Y-max obtained via nonlinear FE analysis for an intermediate link reduced by eighteen percent when the link was loaded based on the old protocol instead of the revised protocol.\nsdks | Three. Detailing of Links\ny8fb | Three point one. Flange and Web Compactness\n521q | The link flange slenderness limit is needed to prevent severe strength degradation due to flange local buckling during intense loadings. Kasai and Popov calculated the link flange stress at the ultimate shear of one point five V sub P and its associated moment for one hundred fifty-six links with four different yield stresses and two length ratios, rho equals one point six short and P equals two intermediate, with and without axial force. The obtained maximum flange stresses were compared to a conservative critical plastic buckling stress determined based on Haaijer's method. Kasai and Popov did not detect flange buckling for the links with rho equals one point six with no axial force when the flange slenderness that is B sub F over two T sub F was limited to zero point three eight square root of E over F sub Y, where B sub F and T sub F are the flange width and thickness respectively and E is the elastic modulus of the steel material. However, if these links were subjected to axial force, the stringent flange slenderness limit of zero point three square root of E over F sub Y was suggested to prevent flange buckling. On the other hand, some of the intermediate links with rho equals two, especially if subjected to axial force, were prone to flange buckling even if the flange slenderness was kept below the more stringent limit of zero point three square root of E over F sub Y. Based on these, it was recommended to limit the flange slenderness of links to zero point three square root of E over F sub Y. This limit was adopted by the early EBF specifications and was in use prior to the two thousand five edition of AISC three forty-one.\nyogo | Adhering to the flange slenderness limit of zero point three square root of E over F sub Y disqualified several efficient wide-flange rolled sections constructed from A nine ninety-two steel from being used as links. A nine ninety-two steel has become the most widely used steel material in the U.S. and has replaced A thirty-six steel after the nineteen ninety-four Northridge earthquake. Using heavier sections to satisfy this requirement would be the common approach in practice, but this is not fruitful from the capacity design point of view. Richards and Uang conducted a comprehensive numerical study to further investigate this issue. After verifying the FE modeling procedure using the experimental data reported by Arce, a total of one hundred twelve isolated I-shaped link models were analyzed considering different flange slenderness values. The numerical results demonstrated that the flange slenderness limit can be relaxed from zero point three square root of E over F sub Y to zero point three eight square root of E over F sub Y. Although some of the intermediate links could not achieve the code-specified rotation limit, this issue was related to the stiffener requirements and not the flange slenderness limit.
