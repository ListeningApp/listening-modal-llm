You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

b0xd | "why?" I ask this to gain deeper understanding and in order to provide meaningful support, because as Simon Sinek advises, 48 it is through knowing our why for doing something-not just what we are doing and how we do it-that leads to suc- cess in our endeavors. My experience with nonmonogamous clients has shown me that the people who articulate their deeper purpose-that is, their why for being nonmonogamous-are then better able to navigate the ups and downs that lie ahead. When the waters of CNM begin to pick up and the emotional rapids of open- ing up your relationship begin, having your why to remember and return to can serve as the needed life jacket that keeps you and your relationship afloat. How- ever, although two or more people want to practice CNM together-even two peo- ple in the same marriage-they may not have the same reasons for being non- monogamous. Knowing why you want to practice nonmonogamy and how that might be similar to or different from your partners' reasons can better inform ex- actly what your version of nonmonogamy looks like together, including the agree- ments you make with different partners, and how you go about enacting CNM for yourself.
e106 | Moors, Matsick and Schechinger explored the different relationship motiva- tions and perceived benefits for people who engaged in CNM compared to people in monogamous relationships.49 Both groups had the relationship benefits of fam- ily, trust, love, sex, commitment and communication, regardless of whether they were in a monogamous or nonmonogamous relationship. However, people in CNM relationships additionally expressed having the distinct relationship benefits of in- creased need fulfillment, variety of nonsexual activities and personal growth. In- stead of expecting one partner to meet all of their needs, people engaged in CNM felt that a major advantage of being nonmonogamous was the ability to have their different needs met by more than one person, as well as being able to experience a variety of nonsexual activities that one relationship may not fulfill. The other no- table relationship benefit unique to people in CNM relationships was personal growth-people reported feeling that being nonmonogamous afforded them in- creased freedom from restriction, self and sexual expression and the ability to grow
mh8r | and develop. The authors of this research state that people in monogamous rela- tionships may also experience such benefits, but these three benefits were mostly highlighted by people in CNM relationships, offering some potentially interesting insight into their motivations for participating in CNM.
ud3i | When I ask my own clients why they are either considering CNM or already prac- ticing nonmonogamy, most, if not all of them, respond in a way that agrees with these findings. They declare that they seek to have greater need fulfillment, want greater expression of themselves through the experiences and activities that will come from having multiple partners and say that they are interested in the personal growth and development that nonmonogamy inevitably catalyzes. Many people want to give and receive the additional love and support that come with having multiple partners. In addition to these reasons, I also see people consistently offer three other reasons for being nonmonogamous: sexual diversity, philosophical views and because CNM is a more authentic expression of who they are.
8qfv | Let's explore these three reasons, starting with the sexual. It's not uncommon to hear someone who is trying to describe nonmonogamy to their family or friends, or speak about it in a professional or public setting, emphasize that CNM not just about the sex, but rather about the increased love, support and connection that come from having multiple partners. While this may very well be true, for many people, nonmonogamy is at least partly about the sex. And there's nothing wrong with thatl I think that it's both well-intended and understandable that people say it isn't about sex, since research has shown that people tend to be significantly more uncomfortable with the idea of CNM relationships that emphasize sex over love than they are with CNM relationships that are based more on romantic and emo- tional connections.50 We also intuitively know that telling our friends, parents or colleagues that we are in it for the love will probably fare better than telling them that we are in it for the sex. To me, this is an unfortunate symptomatic expression of our sex-negative culture that shames us for our basic human needs, desires and sexuality. There are people who genuinely need and want sexual diversity and it is not because they are sexually deviant, avoidantly attached, addicted to sex or
iers | noncommittal. Instead, they are people who embrace their sexuality and the diverse desires and expressions that it may encompass and require. There are also many couples who love each other deeply and have a wonderful partnership, but may have very different sexual needs. Perhaps they have different sexual styles, one part- ner being kinkier or more into BDSM than the other, or divergent sex drives or anatomical incompatibility. Some people find themselves in one of these situations and conclude that there is no reason to dismantle their entire life and give up their meaningful relationship because they want or need different things than their part- ner in the bedroom.
z6h3 | For people whose reason for engaging in nonmonogamy is philosophical, often this outlook arises from their readings or inquiries into the history of monogamy and its connection with patriarchal control over women's sexuality. These people feel that participating in such a relationship structure would be out of integrity with their values. Similarly, there are people who critically question traditional marriage and the imbalanced societal and cultural privileges it provides. They also report disliking the ever-increasing and impossible expectations that are placed on a life partner and that set many couples up for failure. Like the group of CNM people in the Moors et al. study who questioned if it is possible for one person to meet all of their needs, people are also questioning whether the institution of marriage is real- istic and sustainable for them, with nonmonogamy stepping in as a preferable alternative.
qe1n | The final motivation I see in my nonmonogamous clients is that people prac- tice CNM because it just feels like this is who they are. For these people, non- monogamy is not so much a lifestyle choice, as it is for some people, but rather an expression of their fundamental self. This group is more nonmonogamous as orien- tation than nonmonogamous as lifestyle. People who identify as nonmonogamous by lifestyle step into nonmonogamy as an intentional choice. They are often proud of and committed to this choice, but nonmonogamy in their case might be something that comes and goes depending on the partner or partners they are with, the phase of life they are in or their overall life circumstances. People who identify as
uaiu | nonmonogamous as orientation describe their nonmonogamy not as a choice, but as who they essentially are and how they are fundamentally wired. I often hear these people say that they feel most themselves when they are with multiple peo- ple, be it sexually or romantically. Some people who identify as nonmonogamous by orientation are fortunate enough to have been nonmonogamous from the time they started dating or being sexual. But many people come into their non- monogamy orientation a bit later, often after having suffered from the belief that they are broken or defective in some way after struggling to be faithful to their part- ners or feeling that monogamy was never fully right for them.
