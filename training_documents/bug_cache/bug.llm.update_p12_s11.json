        "content": "6zah | Research on the related behavior of whistle-blowing also suggests that demographics might be important in predicting voice. Whistle-blowers tend to be older, male, more tenured, more educated, and hold supervisory or professional jobs. Thus, in sum, there is certainly empirical support for the linkage be- tween demographics and voice behavior. Future research, however, needs to focus on developing an understanding of the nature of these relationships. The explanations for the demographic relationships outlined in the two previ- ous paragraphs suggest at least two crucial mediating vari- ables-ability to engage in voice and efficacy to engage in voice. That is, before individuals engage in voice they must have the ability to generate suggestions for improve- ment and the confidence that they can get their message across. As suggested above, factors such as education,\n4v5o | VOICE IN WORK GROUPS\nha9e | tenure, and job-status should promote this type of ability and efficacy. However, it is also likely that contextual variables influence individuals' ability and efficacy to en- gage in voice. Organizations that are supportive of whis- tle-blowing, for example, have higher levels of this behav- ior.\nxrnt | Practical Implications\nc8ra | We believe the findings reported in this study are im- portant because they expand our understanding of the an- tecedents of voice. This knowledge should be especially relevant to managers in organizations with dynamic envi- ronments where change and new ideas are essential for organizational adaptation, innovation, survival, and suc- cess. For instance, the relationships be- tween the person-centered characteristics and voice sug- gest staffing interventions. When an organization wants to increase voice, group members could be selected on traits known to be associated with satisfaction. Alternatively, other literature links group composition with members' cohesion and cohesion with members' satisfaction with their group. Thus, it may be possible to staff groups to promote cohesion, and in turn, promote voice. Group composition may also promote voice through group members' reactions to one another. For example, research suggests that group members may be less willing to suggest ways to overcome a weak mem- ber's performance deficiency if the weak member is low on conscientiousness. In addition to staffing interventions, our re- sults for the situational antecedents also suggest group- design interventions that will enhance voice. For instance, it may be possible to increase voice by structuring groups such that they are smaller and self-managed.\np1l0 | The significant Person X Situation interactions suggest that it may be worthwhile to consider the benefits of con- tingent staffing and group-design interventions. That is, either fit people to certain types of groups or structure groups to fit certain types of people. For instance, if an organization has members with low global self-esteem, it may be beneficial (in terms of promoting voice) to struc- ture groups so they are smaller, self-managed, or both (see Figures one and two). Likewise, if an organization has small, self-managed, or both types of groups, it may be beneficial to select people who are somewhat predisposed to be being satisfied (see Figures three and four).\n1i8b | Overall, we believe that it may be possible to promote voice in work group settings. However, additional re- search needs to investigate the validity of our suggestions. Research should also examine additional variables that might influence voice in organizational settings.\n5sfj | Limitations\nvk4h | Although our study had several strengths (longitudinal design, data collected from multiple sources, fairly large and diverse sample), it had several limitations that we note here. As alluded to above, we examined a limited subset of the many possible theoretically-based personal and situational antecedents, and thus, our predictive model explained a relatively small amount of variance in voice. Assessing models of voice with other theoretically rele- vant antecedents should be a goal of future research. Re- searchers could begin by assessing other antecedents sug- gested by Van Dyne et al. such as psychological ownership, career-professional involvement, justice per- ceptions, need for achievement, and environmental dynamism.\nnsm3 | A second limitation of our study was that we did not examine the processes associated with our predictions. For example, we did not manipulate management style and observe changes in member affect, cognition, and behavior. As another example, although we originally as- sumed that group performance is an outcome of voice, one reviewer suggested that it may play an indirect role as an antecedent. High levels of group performance may increase member satisfaction and the amount of autonomy given to a group to manage its own affairs. As a final example of the need to consider process issues in the future, certain types of groups may attract and retain cer- tain types of people, and thus, it is possible that manage- ment style and group size are really capturing some indi- vidual difference variable.\njdfw | A third limitation is that we did not sample randomly within some population of firms. Accordingly, it is diffi- cult to specify where our results might or might not gener- alize. Although no single study is likely to address this question adequately, research with theory-based predictions as to the generalizability of our findings should be conducted.\nuc9r | Finally, although our sampling strategy was designed to rule out situations where peers could not directly observe group members' behavior, we did not directly ask group members how much day-to-day interaction they had. Al- though our measure of voice did demonstrate acceptable levels of interrater agreement, we nevertheless suggest that researchers ask about frequency of peer interaction when using peer rating scales in the future.\nl0ap | Conclusion\nx815 | Innovation is critical for the long-term survival of orga- nizations. Innovation begins with recognition and generation of novel ideas or solu- tions that challenge past practices and standard operating procedures. However, if individu- als generate ideas and solutions but are unwilling to speak\nepbj | up and share them with others, the innovation process stops. Our model explained a moderate amount of vari- ance in voice. However, it is problematic to equate vari- ance explained with practical significance. The research reported in this study has important implications for managers be- cause it suggests levers (i.e., staffing and group-design interventions ) that managers can use to influence the ex- tent to which employees speak up with constructive sug- gestions for change. Given the importance of innovation in today's competitive environment, we recommend future research that continues to enhance our understanding of voice. We suggest that researchers broaden their focus and examine additional variables as well as the underlying processes that lead to voice.",
