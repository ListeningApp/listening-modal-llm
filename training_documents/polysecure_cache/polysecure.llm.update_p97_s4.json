What makes you tick, what are your dreams, talents, callings and purposes? Exploring personality tests like the enneagram or Myers-Briggs as well as knowing your love languages can also support this process.\nq8bx | Boundaries, boundaries, boundaries! The anxious style tends to have more porous boundaries regarding input where other people are defining you, as well as on the output where you are inserting yourself too far into another person's emotional, physical or mental space. Creating more distinct, but not rigid, boundaries is important for learning how to stay in your own skin while being connected to others, rather than leaving yourself behind to be with others. Also, be aware of not letting other people occupy more of your internal\nlftq | space than you are.\nhyaf | Recognize when you are abandoning yourself and learn techniques to come back into your own body and your own internal world. Body-based meditations and awareness practices can support you being better able to inhabit your own body.\n9etn | When co-regulating with partners, make sure that it is reciprocal and that you are not either over-caretaking at the expense of yourself or asking them to take care of you without regard for themselves.\n2bic | Work on being able to receive love. Even though someone with a preoccupied attachment style is more likely to complain that they are not getting enough love or attention, when it is given, they often struggle with how to really let it in and receive it. What obstacles or defensive mechanisms arise when love, connection or nourishment is actually being offered?\njras | Learn techniques to ground and work with your anxiety instead of projecting it onto others or directing your anxiety into the relational space.\ndwvf | Dismissive\nic87 | Needing support does not mean that you are weak, needy or less than. People with this style can carry a lot of toxic shame about needing others or having any needs at all. Can you begin to accept that wanting support or attention from others is alright, even healthy, and not a negative reflection on your abilities, competence or independence? I invite you to allow the fullness of your humanness.\nbxpw | With people who are safe, begin to take the risk of revealing and sharing more of yourself so that people can get a glimpse into your internal world. This could take the form of relaxing some of your more rigid boundaries and letting more of yourself out.\n4g09 | Also work on letting people in more. Let people have an impact on how you feel or allow their experiences, needs, opinions or feedback to impact your\ntxr8 | perspective.\nrsup | Work with transforming your self-reliant parts through relying more on or leaning into your partners for support, nourishment and connection. It's OK to start with small requests. I almost had a panic attack the first time I asked my partner to pick up a yogurt for me on the way over to my house. To me, this seemed like an unreasonable ask, even though he was the one who asked me if I needed anything from the store that he was already stopping at.\nhk1c | Wake up your body. Often people with the dismissive style exist primarily in their heads, being cut off from the neck down. Exploring movement practices, body-based meditations and awareness practices can help you wake up your body and begin to allow and tolerate a whole range of sensations and feelings.\nna8b | Learn how to articulate your feelings and needs. This is easier said than done, since this is a developmental capacity that you have to learn and grow, not just an easy behavioral shift or a switch that you can turn on. Please be patient with yourself.\na4wk | Fearful-Avoidant\nbi02 | People with this style either experience alternating aspects of the dismissive and preoccupied styles, or both can occur simultaneously, so try some or all of the above suggestions for both the preoccupied and the dismissive styles that feel relevant to you. In addition to the above suggestions you can also:\nyc23 | Focus on building an internal sense of safety where you have a bodily felt sense that you are safe and that you can relax, even if it is just with yourself at first. When there has been trauma, this usually requires the support of a professional.\nki0m | Build an inner sense of protection. Doing inner work can support you in identifying the parts of you that can protect you that are not harmful to you or others. It can also be helpful to invite these protective parts to become more central to your daily experience. Remembering a person or a time when you\n6wrx | felt protected and allowing that memory to come alive in your body can support you in having a tangible somatic experience of protection that you can access when you need it. Even when people have had parents who were harmful or not protective, there is usually someone we can identify as having felt a sense of protection with, whether it was another relative, a teacher or someone in our community. If you are truly unable to access any memories, people or times when you felt protected, explore the mythical, fictional or spiritual realms, where there might be a character that you resonate with or a spiritual and archetypal energy that you can associate protection with.\nu4q7 | Learn about the signs of being in an abusive relationship as well as the signs and signals that someone is gaslighting, manipulating or acting in narcissistic ways. People functioning in this style can unintentionally normalize what is abusive and unhealthy and so need help in being able to explicitly distinguish what is healthy and unhealthy, what is abusive or caring and what is addictive or genuine.\njd7m | Surround yourself with people who truly mean well, are more securely attached and who want to be a support for you in your healing process.\nsknv | Questions to Consider\nusuw | What does self-attunement look like for you?\nd4hr | In what ways do you autoregulate or try to use others to regulate, so that you don't have to self-regulate?\nph8j | What would self-regulation look like for you?\nbemf | How would you like to increase your self-attunement and self-regulation?\ns9l9 | What is your relationship with your inner nurturer like and how can this part of you become more front and center in your relationship with yourself?\nbs07 | Things to Try and to Experiment With\ny6eq | Spend quiet time by yourself.\n0tl4 | Practice mindfulness or breath-based exercises that help you tune into your body, heart and mind.\nvbq2 | Try self-compassion meditations.\npfrt | Experiment with journaling.\niws8 | Try self-hypnosis techniques.\nn452 | Learn self-empathy practices that help you to identify your feelings and needs and give yourself what you need as best you can.\nztct | Figure out what different kinds of sensory input, such as sights, smells, sounds, touches or tastes, are calming or irritating to you and have certain smells or types of music available for when you are needing some self-support.\nenir | Develop a relationship with your inner nurturer and, if needed, work with a practitioner to support you in this process.\ne4d4 | Rituals and routines for a secure self\nd8ta | Any secure relationship with yourself will include the rituals and routines that support you in your self-care and sanity. If we refer back to early childhood, it is easy to see how children thrive when there is enough structure and predictable routine for the different needs of their bodies and the various transitions within a day. As adults, this does not change. There are natural rhythms to our cycles of sleeping, eating, resting and having sex that suffer when ignored. Both men and women have hormonal cycles that fluctuate, impacting our mood, mental acuity, how sensitive we feel and how short or long our fuse for anger and frustration will be. Secure attachment with self includes knowing your inner rhythms (biological, emotional and mental) and figuring out what routines and daily rituals best support you to be in alignment with your own needs and pacing.\n```",
