        "content": "9mrz | To find out, she created three comparable groups of Harvard undergraduates. They were all females and Asian Americans, were majors in mathematically oriented fields, and wanted to attend graduate school in their discipline. In other words, she had fairly reliable evidence that if she gave the advanced portion of the Graduate Record Examination in math to everyone in her sample, the group performances would be statistically indistinguishable. But that's not what happened. Shih's intervention changed the outcome. It was her experiment.\npk06 | She asked each woman in her three groups to fill out a questionnaire before taking the test. It looked fairly innocent: name, telephone number, and so forth, about a dozen items of seemingly innocuous questions. But the first group had an inquiry designed to trigger a subconscious reminder of their gender. The second group didn't have that question but had another one meant to prompt a reminder of ethnicity. Psychologists call this process making something salient. The third group had neither of the subconscious triggers. You now have the data you need to predict how the three groups did. The group that had the reminder about ethnicity performed better than the other two; the one with the prompt about gender came in last. Little things a teacher does can have a huge influence on students' learning, lives, and academic performance. So much for the genius theory so popular at places like the Courant Institute!",
