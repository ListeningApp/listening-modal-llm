You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

8qb6 | Willoughby's record as an estimator, which is more relevant for our subject, was less bright. By Campbell's analysis, he "made nine badly flawed estimates in the Pacific War, which he later tried to cover up, whereas he was correct in only four key estimates."2" No wonder then that Willoughby's colleagues thought that he had "the best hindsight of any intelligence officer in the army," or that he was "a better historian than an intelligence officer."260
wkbn | While Willoughby's record as an intelligence estimator in WWII was dubious, three tendencies that he exhibited during his service are relevant to understand his mistakes in November 1950. The first was his tendency toward centralism, as evidenced by his attempts to gain organizational monopoly over the intelligence process and his practice of personally handling the process of making intelligence estimates. Shortly after becoming MacArthur's G-2, he dismissed Australian intelligence summaries (which proved to
ftfg | be correct), and throughout the war he prevented the OSS from operating in his theater of operations. After the war, he boasted that this was a major achievement. On the eve of the Korean War, he dismissed South Korean warnings that the KPA was preparing an attack. After war began, he lessened his tight centralistic policy, allowing the CIA 4 limited freedom of action, but he later prevented its agents from interrogating Chinese POWs for fear that they would produce estimates different from his own. His centralistic tendencies were also exposed in the way he estimated intelligence. Earlier in Bataan, he did the estimate while Akin was in charge of Sigint, and Sutherland, MacArthur's chief of staff, decided which intelligence would be passed on to MacArthur.205 After that, with the exception of MacArthur, there is no record of any collective intelligence estimation process under Willoughby's command. Almond testified that Willoughby "was not receptive to alternative analysis or ideas." Personal monopolization explained his personal involvement in producing the Daily Intelligence Summary.204 Sometimes, when MacArthur rejected his estimates, he took it as a personal insult.265

w8r5 | In November 1950, Willoughby's tendency toward centralism led him to exclude any organization or person -apart for MacArthur himself-from interfering with the intelligence process. As a result, MacArthur, either because of wishful thinking or because of Willoughby's influence or both, underestimated the magnitude of the Chinese threat.
ybik | Willoughby's second tendency was toward mirror imaging, that is, the inclination to estimate the opponent's policy through the prism of one's own culture, logic, and prejudice. Drea, who claimed that Willoughby often made mirror-imaging estimates, regarded it as one of his "cardinal sin."200 In April 1942, Willoughby reached the conclusion that the rational target for the coming Japanese attack would be northern Australia. His naval counterpart, Edwin T. Layton assessed, on the basis of the same intelligence information, that it would be Port Moresby in New Guinea. The May 1942 battle of the Coral Sea, the first major naval engagement since the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor, showed that Willoughby "rationale" was mistaken and Layton was right.Similarly, during the Battle of Hollandia in the summer of 1944, Willoughby misjudged, despite the excellent available intelligence information, the target and the timing of the Japanese counterattack. As he later admitted, the enemy had carried out the attack "regardless of the odds against him."26 Then, during the invasion of the island of Leyte in the Philippines in October 1944, he
gii5 | p. 182 "assessed Japanese 4 intentions according to what he would do" and concluded that they would avoid reinforcing their army due to American air-superiority." 269
q5eu | Willoughby learned nothing from these mistakes. His persistent estimates, despite intelligence evidence to the contrary, that the PRC would avoid a massive intervention in Korea were based on a military logic that asserted that the best time to intervene was prior to the Inchon landing. This way of thinking did not take into account the possibility that the Chinese strategy was based on other factors-such as the reluctance to intervene at too early a stage, when the UN forces were still far from Manchuria and did not constitute a viable threat to Chinese territory. Willoughby's refusal to accept that massive Chinese forces had crossed the Yalu also reflected a belief that such a move could not take place without significant Sigint indications. He did not take into account that, unlike the American army, the CPVF was poorly equipped with wireless sets, that it was well-trained in maintaining radio silence, and that it used primitive but efficient means of communication, such as runners or dispatch riders.
a7ao | Willoughby's third relevant tendency involved his need for cognitive closure. While most descriptions portray him as an authoritarian type and, hence, a person with a high need for closure, this was not always the case. Very much like Stalin during the battle for Moscow in late 1941, Willoughby was consumed by fear of invalidity at the beginning of his career as MacArthur's G-2. This was mainly the product of his lack of intelligence experience, the humiliating defeat MacArthur suffered in the Philippines, and the high cost of being mistaken at this critical stage of the war. These pressures led him, especially in 1942, to avoid fast and persistent freezing. Sometimes he even went to the other extreme, reversing major interpretations

sb1e | overnight without apparent reason." 270 In addition, when he presented his assessments to MacArthur, he used to include in them all possible courses of action available to the enemy.2(1
w2yn | This was not the situation in the fall of 1950. By then, Willoughby was an experienced (though not necessarily appreciated) intelligence officer. He effectively supported his chief in the conduct of the brilliant Inchon landing, which was carried out against the opinion of many others. And now his admired boss wanted to reach the Yalu as soon as possible in order to end the war by Christmas. By this stage, Willoughby exhibited the main symptoms of a person with a high need for closure""": his thesis that the Chinese 4 lost their opportunity to intervene and therefore would avoid such a move was clear, orderly, and coherent. His intelligence-making process, which lacked any form of brainstorming, reflected a highly authoritarian leadership style, reluctance to listen to different perspectives, and no tolerance for any pluralism of opinion. His high level of confidence was exhibited by his "knowledge" (rather than estimate) that the Chinese would not intervene. It was enhanced by a similar confidence on the part of MacArthur. Willoughby, moreover, refused to consider novel information that was inconsistent with his thesis, and denied undisputed facts, as seen for example in his claim that the captured Chinese soldiers were North Koreans. As one officer had put it, "None of this [evidence for a possible large-scale Chinese intervention] was going to affect Willoughby. The Chinese were not going to come in. He knew it. And he was never wrong."273

iest | The combination of an intelligence officer who monopolized the intelligence process, estimated the enemy according to his own logic, and exhibited the symptoms of a high need for closure and an unshakable faith that MacArthur could not be wrong provides, then, another explanation for one of the worst American intelligence fiascos in the post-WWII era.
