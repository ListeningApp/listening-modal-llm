You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

In other words, carbon materials with higher graphitization degree exhibit superior Faraday capacitance. In detail, according to the GCD profiles,

The capacitance value of FC-1-8 outperforms most reported Fe-based carbon materials in Table 2.
ko3c | The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was carried out to inspect the kinetic properties of these four samples in the range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz, the results were delivered in Fig. 5c. It was found that low frequency part of the region was almost straight, implying the low diffusion resis- tance.35 <LATEX>{ } ^ { 3 5 } \mathrm { I n }</LATEX> the high frequency part of the EIS plot, FC-1-8 and FC-1- 8-HCl display lower <LATEX>R _ { c }</LATEX> values than FC-0-8. It is reasonable that the improved electrochemical performance is related to the higher graphitic degree. The <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { c t } }</LATEX> values of 0.21 and 0.22 92 for FC-1-8 and FC-1-8-HCl were much lower than that of FC-0-8, 0.41 92, implying the faster charge transfer at the electrode and electrolyte interface.
xek3 | As consistent with the CV analysis, the graphitic electrodes of FC-1-8 and FC-1-8-HCl showed a much longer discharge time than the other counterpart demonstrating higher specific capacitance (Fig. S3+). The higher values in specific capacitance can be contributed to the improved conductivity of graphitic carbon, the larger SSA and the porous structure. The CV curves of FC-1-8 at multiple scan rates were accessed in Fig. 5d. CV curves displayed similar shape with the scan rate decreasing from 100 to 5 mV <LATEX>\mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> (Fig. 5d). The reduction and oxidation peaks moved outwards as the increase of scan rates due to the polarization of the electrode. The details of galvanostatic charge/discharge curves were exhibited in Fig. 5e. Likewise, the galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) curves showing voltage platforms are believed to the nature of pseudocapacitance. FC- 0-8 and FC-1-8-HCl exhibited typical rectangular shape of <LATEX>\mathrm { C V }</LATEX> curves and triangular GCD curves, demonstrating a double layer electric capacitive behavior (Fig. S4+). The cycle stability was carried out by performing 10 000 times <LATEX>\mathrm { a t } 5 A g ^ { - 1 } \left( F i g . 5 f \right) . F C - 1</LATEX> 8 retained a moderate rate of 51.7% compared with the initial capacitance and the inferior cycle stability of FC-1-8 was prob- ably due to the irreversibly oxidized of Fe3C/Fe to Fe3O4 in KOH electrolyte.21 The morphology of FC-1-8 and FC-1-8-HCl samples after electrochemical activation were conducted to uncover the mechanism of electrochemical performance (Fig. S5+). It was found that both samples presented spherical structure as before, while FC-1-8 sample showed a relatively smooth surface compared with the initial one. The absence of Fe3C/Fe species resulted in the inferior cycling performance.
bbpr | 4. Conclusions
5zyf | In conclusion, we achieved the transformation from amorphous carbon spheres to graphitic carbon through hydrothermal carbonization, chemical activation and graphitization using <LATEX>\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e O } _ { 4 } .</LATEX> The obtained FC-1-8 with graphitic carbon and Fe3C/Fe structure are believed to be the promising electrode material. On the one hand, the embedded Fe3C/Fe NPs are contributed to the pseudocapacitance performance with a high specific capaci- tance of 428.0 <LATEX>F g ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> at a discharge current density of <LATEX>1 \mathrm { A } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 } .</LATEX> On the other hand, the graphitic carbon could improve the conduc- tivity. When removing Fe3C/Fe NPs, the graphitic carbon of FC-1-8-
