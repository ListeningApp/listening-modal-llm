The cable consists of an aluminum conductor, a triple extruded XLPE insulation system, a semiconductive paper tape to provide a thermal expansion layer, a longitudinally formed copolymer coated aluminum that acts as both moisture barrier and shield, and a jacket of cross-linked polyethylene. The aluminum is zero point three zero millimeters (zero point zero one two inches) thick. The coating on the aluminum is bonded to the cable jacket. It has been reported that more than three thousand kilometers of this cable has been in use since nineteen seventy-four with no failures attributed to water treeing.\nuodj | A medium voltage cable with synthetic insulation and an aluminum moisture barrier was developed by EdF and introduced into their power system in nineteen seventy-eight. The cable meets EdF standard HN thirty-three-S-twenty-three. It has an oversheath of relatively thick two millimeters (zero point one two inches) polyvinyl chloride jacket to facilitate direct burial. Radial water tightness is achieved via an aluminum screen which is bonded to the PVC oversheath. The sealing of the overlap is facilitated with a hot melt adhesive. Longitudinal water tightness is provided by hydroscopic powder. Thermal expansion is handled by grooves in the strippable extruded semiconducting screen. The field experience with this cable has been excellent. At the end of nineteen eighty-six a total of thirty-one thousand kilometers of HN thirty-three-S-twenty-three cable had been installed. As shown in Table three the mean national fault rate for all causes and all cables types combined has steadily decreased as more and more moisture barrier cable has been installed. The technology is fully developed and includes connectors for the moisture barrier which do not require the jacket to be stripped, accessories, terminations, joints and installation practices.\nk16v | The use of aluminum as a radial moisture barrier on high voltage able is increasing. Recently a cable of this type was installed in Bavaria. The construction has been altered due to the fact that water ingress can impair the dielectric strength of the cross-linked polyethylene insulation. The screen still consists of copper wires. A material capable of swelling is included in the zone of the screen to limit the axial penetration of water. The sheath\nb2lm | is a laminated construction. A relatively thin aluminum tape is used as a barrier to the radial diffusion of water. The aluminum tape is adhered to a\nti7f | polyethylene jacket. Polyethylene was chosen because of its better mechanical properties over PVC.\noksu | Over four thousand kilometers (two thousand five hundred miles) of on-core moisture barrier cable has been installed in the United States by a large, east coast utility. Much of this cable is one thousand kcmil aluminum, thirty-five kV with XLPE insulation. Recently, a test program was initiated to check the condition and performance of this cable. Cable manufactured near the start of the program was obtained and its AC breakdown and lighting impulse breakdown strength was compared to field aged samples and newly manufactured cable samples. The data indicate that there was no significant deterioration of the cable electrical properties after seven years of service. A thorough microscopic wafer examination of the field samples showed no electrochemical treeing.\nwtow | CONCLUSIONS\no22k | The common sense approach to treeing is to keep moisture away from the cable dielectric. Moisture impervious cable is designed to do this. The use of such cable makes good economic sense as well. Cables are capital goods and their value as an investment must be optimized. The use of moisture impervious designs is justified when the life cycle costs associated with installation, outages, repairs, and premature replacement of cable are considered.\nnwfz | The concept of moisture impervious cable is emerging. Moisture impervious cable is defined as cable designed to block both the longitudinal and radial ingress of moisture into the cable. A plastic coated metallic tape provides the radial moisture barrier. In the case of under-jacket designs, the longitudinal transmission of moisture is blocked by one, bonding the tape to the jacket and sealing the overlap, two, using water swellable tape or powders in the interface between the moisture barrier and core, and three, strand filling the conductor.\nnvfy | materials have become available\nmror | A variety of to facilitate development and commercialization of under-jacket moisture barrier sheaths for medium voltage power cables. Water-swellable, non-woven tapes are functional as cushion layers and longitudinal water blocks. Plastic coated aluminum and copper tapes meet the needs for a radial metallic moisture barrier having excellent adhesion to polyethylene, chlorinated polyethylene or polyvinyl chloride jackets and excellent bond stability during thermal loading, temperature cycling, water aging, and exposure to elevated temperatures. Hot melt adhesives have been developed which are effective in sealing the overlap of the metallic moisture barrier and which meet all needs for adhesion and bond stability.\nzlxc | Two designs for under-jacket moisture impervious cable are in use or under development. One under-jacket design retains the wire neutrals while the other design uses the moisture barrier as both a radial water block and shield. Plastic coated aluminum is recommended when wire neutrals are required. The coated aluminum can be applied smooth and is longitudinally folded over the neutrals.\nk0bw | It is then bonded to the cable jacket and sealed at the overlap to form the moisture barrier. A plastic coated copper is recommended for the combination moisture barrier and shield. The copper can be applied smooth or corrugated. The use of corrugated shields is on the increase especially for larger diameter cable.\naq5a | Standardization activities for moisture impervious cable are in progress globally. The International Electrotechnical Commission is defining water blocking tests. CIGRE is preparing recommendations for high voltage cables with laminated coverings. The Insulated Conductors Committee of the IEEE is preparing a guide on medium voltage cable using metal and plastic laminates as moisture barriers. The Insulated Conductors Engineers Association has issued a guide for\nsc5y | testing water penetration for sealed conductors and is currently developing a guide for compatibility of the sealing compound with adjacent cable materials. A full complement of standards and tests have been developed by Electricite De France for use in their system. Those standardization activities are taking place during development of the technology for moisture impervious cable. The users are able to participate in the development of this technology and use the guides and standards to prepare their own specifications. The most widespread use of medium voltage watertight cable has been by Electricite De France with over thirty-one thousand kilometers (twenty-one thousand miles) of three phase network installed between nineteen seventy-six and nineteen eighty-six. Experience has been excellent. The mean national fault rate has steadily decreased as more and more watertight cable is placed in service.\n```",
