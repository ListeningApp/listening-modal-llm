        "content": "pbea | One of the more heated Led Zeppelin debates stems from their lyrical and visual representations of male and female identities. The term cock rock emerged out of the feminist movement in the nineteen seventies, as progressive and newly politicized women (and men) began to question the traditional gender roles portrayed everywhere from classic novels and paintings to television and pop music. During the Rolling Stones' nineteen seventy two North American tour, handmade flyers decrying the Stones' swaggering masculinity were distributed among concertgoers, as covered by writer Terry Southern: \"If you are male,\" the broadsheets read, \"this concert is yours. . . . The Stones are tough men-hard and powerful. They're the kind of men we're sup- posed to imitate, never crying, always strong, keeping women in their place (under our thumbs). In Vietnam, to save honor (which means preserving our manhood), our brothers have killed and raped millions of people in\nccpt | But in the Long Run\n0fpw | the name of this ideal. . . . We resent the image the Stones present to males as examples we should imitate. .. . \" In nineteen seventy eight, British critics Simon Frith and Angela McRobbie's article \"Rock and Sexuality\" was published in the book On Record: Rock, Pop and the Written Word, where they named Mick Jagger, the Who's Roger Daltrey, and Zeppelin's Robert Plant as prime exponents of the style: \"Cock rock performers are aggressive, dominating, and boastful, and they constantly seek to remind the audience of their prowess, their con- trol. .. . In these performances mikes and guitars are phallic symbols; the music is loud, rhythmically insistent, built around techniques of arousal and climax; the lyrics are assertive and arrogant, though the exact words are less significant than the vocal styles involved, the shouting and the screaming.\"\ndqn8 | As much as they embodied personas as long-haired, dope-smoking out- laws, male rock stars of the nineteen sixties and nineteen seventies were no advocates of Women's Liberation, and the cock rock charge was an important corrective to their supposedly \"revolutionary\" values. Many Led Zeppelin songs-\"Dazed and Confused,\" \"Your Time Is Gonna Come,\" \"How Many More Times,\" \"Heartbreaker,\" \"Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman),\" \"The Lemon Song,\" \"Since I've Been Loving You,\" \"Black Dog,\" \"Custard Pie,\" \"Trampled Underfoot,\" and others-depict women as crudely and as chauvinistically as any leering hard-hat or patronizing business executive of the same time. Likewise, the sexual or martial boasting of \"Good Times Bad Times,\" \"Whole Lotta Love,\" \"Ramble On,\" \"Immigrant Song,\" and \"No Quarter\" cast the singer and his ensemble as conquering, untamable bad boys never to be tied down by any domestic conventions. Add to these the live perfor- mances of the band, their amplifiers cranked, their shirts open, and their pants bulging, and Led Zeppelin does seem like a prime example of cock rock at its hardest, loudest, and most offensive.\ncop0 | There are several reasons, if not excuses, for Zeppelin's macho exaggera- tions. Given that the band was an all-male act of individuals in their early to mid-twenties, of course there was bound to be a surfeit of testosterone flowing around onstage and in the studio. Many of their songs were taken directly or indirectly from blues or blues-rock antecedents, and the blues was rife with blaring declamations of male dominance and sexual power, Bo Diddley's \"I'm a Man,\" Howlin' Wolf's \"Back Door Man,\" B. B. King's \"Ain't Nobody Home,\" Jimi Hendrix's \"Stone Free,\" and Robert Johnson's \"Traveling Riverside Blues\" being only the most memorable examples. This posture itself was something of a fa√ßade, a way for otherwise poor and disenfranchised men to assert their authority over anyone at all, their wives and lovers often being the closest people they could turn to for validation. Blues-based music could reverse the received structures of male-female relationships, as it became the men who could sing of being done wrong by\nlhkq | Led Zeppelin FAQ\n82ju | a cheating partner (e.g., \"Your Time Is Gonna Come,\" \"Black Dog\"), or of being hopelessly, romantically in love with a woman who rejects their affec- tion (\"Dazed and Confused,\" \"The Lemon Song\"), an appealing pretense for rock stars who were themselves usually doing the cheating and rejecting. In time the bluesy brag would degenerate into the bathroom-wall dreck of Bon Jovi's \"You Give Love a Bad Name,\" Motley Crue's \"Looks That Kill,\" and AC/DC's \"Let Me Put My Love into You.\"\ny2qo | The stark truth is that Led Zeppelin's cock rock-and that of most other rock 'n' roll bands of the period-was borne of the musicians' experiences in the real world of touring and giving shows. Male entertainers have always held special attractiveness to female followers, and the uninhibited years of the sexual revolution allowed them to take Dionysian advantage of this. Nubile young women came to their concerts, worked their way backstage, and convened at their hotels and barrooms; by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant especially, their attentions were taken for granted. Lyrics like those of \"Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman),\" though not deeply thought out, were accurate reflections of the players' feelings toward their most devoted admirers-the girls were at best disposable and at worst nuisances. Page's much-repeated remarks to journalist Ellen Sander in nineteen sixty-nine (\"Girls come around and pose like starlets, teasing and acting haughty. . . . I haven't got time to deal with it\") were, for better or worse, his summary of casual sex as an occupational hazard rather than an emotional commitment or personal responsibility. His approving reference to Aleister Crowley (\"Crowley didn't have a very high opinion of women and I don't think he was wrong\") is scarcely more sensitive. Writer and Zeppelin supporter Cameron Crowe, describing the real-life milieu that inspired his two thousand film Almost Famous, remembered how the nineteen seventies rock 'n' rollers he covered regarded their female followers as \"trinkets,\" and Bebe Buell, who had a fling with Page in nineteen seventy-four, overheard the guitarist say of her to Plant and Peter Grant, \"She's not a coke whore,\" which other women around them presumably were. With such disdainful if not misogynistic impressions, it was inevitable that a jaded, imperial arrogance would seep into Led Zeppelin's music.\n1piq | What the cock rock indictment significantly overlooks is that many women were Zeppelin fans, found the male musicians attractive, and responded to the sexual overtones of the songs as much as any boy or man buying the records or attending the concerts. Though Led Zeppelin had never been a teenybopper act of winsome youngsters like their contempo- raries the Osmonds or the Bay City Rollers, teenyboppers had older sisters and in time grew up themselves, and chaste fantasies of doe-eyed Donny or Woody evolved into more explicit ones of sweaty Robert or mysterious\n7fqw | But in the Long Run\nrhaz | Jimmy. Cock rock worked both ways: the performers expressed it (Mick Jagger rode an inflatable oversize phallus during the Rolling Stones' nineteen seventy five US tour), and both sexes in the audience encouraged it. Though there were probably many women put off by Led Zeppelin's overt machismo and crushing rhythms, preferring the sensitive tones of a James Taylor or a Van Morrison, or instead identifying with the lyrics of a Joni Mitchell or a Carole King, there were still plenty happy to find in Zeppelin a larger-than-life eroticism the musicians could not help but convey. For a term intended as a rebuke, Zeppelin's \"cock rock\" was sometimes exactly what listeners wanted to see and hear.",
