You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

uow2 | Where inquiry is focused upon the creative nature of the judiciary, except in very clear cases, the debate often turns to emotive, rather than substantive, questions. Mabo is a very clear example of this. The essential complaint is not about the legal veracity of the Mabo decision. Pace Mr Connolly, few would argue that six of the seven Justices of the High Court
iat7 | In Defence of Mabo
ywwr | simply got the law wrong. The essential complaint, as I understand it, is that the court ought not have done what it did in this case. Yet Mabo, reduced to fundamentals, says only that: (a) our system of real property law accommodates native title; (b) native title may be extinguished; (c) it may be extinguished in a number of ways by either the Crown or by the indigenous people themselves; and (d) where it has been extinguished there may (or may not) be a right to compensation.
0i6j | Whether the High Court ought to have ventured upon this rather modest restatement of the law, so explained, invites conflicting opinions about the proper limits of judicial creativity. In my own respectful opin- ion, the High Court acted appropriately in overturning a doctrine which was inherently discriminatory and which no longer conformed (if it ever did) to modern notions about the rights of indigenous societies and their legitimate claims upon settler societies. In acting as it did, the High Court undoubtedly overturned and restated important and fundamental aspects of the common law of Australia. But in so acting, it was not effecting a usurpation of the legislative function. It was merely performing one as- pect - the creative aspect - of the court's own judicial function and its duty to the Australian community. Let no one doubt that judges of the common law have been making up law for centuries. That is the very nature of the system. That is the reason why its highly practical tech- niques of problem solving have outlasted the British Empire and are in operation in the busy courts of the four corners of the world, serving about one-third of humanity.
87cq | THE HIGH COURT AND THE COMMON LAW
0qs3 | The Mabo decision made clear the circumstances in which the common law of Australia may be overruled as it advances to a higher principle. In so doing, it provided invaluable guidance for future courts faced with like problems in completely different areas of the law.
z8f7 | That the courts of Australia have a duty to state the common law is made clear by Mabo. Brennan J stated the relevant principles of this duty in the following manner:121
7w7j | In discharging its duty to declare the common law of Australia, this Court is not free to adopt rules that accord with contemporary notions of justice and human rights if their adoption would fracture the skeleton of principle which gives the body of our law its shape and internal consistency. Australian law is not only the historical successor of, but is an organic development from, the law of England. Although our law is the prisoner of its history, it is not now bound by decisions of courts in the hierarchy of an Empire then concerned with the development of its colonies. It is not immaterial to the resolution of
51vd | the present problem that, since the Australia Act 1986 (Cth) came into opera- tion, the law of this country is entirely free of Imperial control. The law which governs Australia is Australian Law. The Privy Council itself held that the common law of this country might legitimately develop independently of English precedent.122 Increasingly since 1968,123 the common law of Australia has been substantially in the hands of this Court. Here rests the ultimate re- sponsibility of declaring the law of the nation. Although this court is free to depart from English precedent which was earlier followed as stating the com- mon law of this country,124 it cannot not do so where the departure would fracture what I have called the skeleton of principle. The Court is even more reluctant to depart from earlier decisions of its own. 125 The peace and order of Australian society is built on the legal system. It can be modified to bring it into conformity with contemporary notions of justice and human rights, but it cannot be destroyed. It is not possible, a priori, to distinguish between cases that express a skeletal principle and those which do not, but no case can com- mand unquestioning adherence if the rule it expresses seriously offends the values of justice and human rights (especially equality before the law) which are aspirations of the contemporary Australian legal system. If a postulated rule of the common law expressed in earlier cases seriously offends those con- temporary values, the question arises whether the rule should be maintained and applied. Whenever such a question arises, it is necessary to assess whether the particular rule is an essential doctrine of our legal system and whether, if the rule were to be overturned, the disturbance to be apprehended would be disproportionate to the benefit flowing from the overturning.
baj1 | One may restate this principle in the following form. A rule of com- mon law may be overturned by the appellate court if the postulated rule 'seriously offends the values of justice and human rights'. However, such a rule may not be overturned if 'the disturbance to be apprehended would be disproportionate to the benefit flowing from the overturning'. Thus, a balancing exercise is required involving judgment in each case. The com- peting interests at work are the modification of the legal system 'to bring it into conformity with contemporary notions of justice and human rights' and the peril of destroying the 'skeleton of principle which gives the body of our law its shape and internal consistency'. Where the challenged rule of law is so entrenched and fundamental to our common law system that change cannot be accommodated, the change will not be permissible. Then to change the law would be destructive of our very system of common law. Any such changes must be left to Parliament which, it can be as- sumed, would act with care and justice to most of the interests involved.
n1wo | In Defence of Mabo
5bq3 | According to the High Court in Mabo, the concept of terra nullius was merely a categorisation of the Australian continent's land established by earlier cases. Such a categorisation represented an element of the com- mon law susceptible to change without dire consequence for the totality of our common law. Similarly, and as a consequence, the common law governing real property, properly interpreted, drew a distinction between the Crown, as sovereign, having title to Australia and owning benefi- cially all of the land in Australia. That is, the common law applicable accommodated the Crown's sovereignty to Australia's land subject only to the indigenous native title. In fact, the common law itself (not to say statute law) provides perfectly effective means for that indigenous native title to be extinguished. Thus, according to the principles explained by Brennan J, the recognition of indigenous native title did nothing to frac- ture the skeleton of the common law.
ezla | The inherently discriminatory nature of the application of the doc- trine of terra nullius meant that it no longer accorded with what Brennan J described as 'values of justice and human rights'. Similarly, the concept of terra nullius being applied to inhabited lands (such as the Murray Is- lands) was itself questionable. Brennan J focused upon the inappropri- ateness of the doctrine of terra nullius in a modern society. His Honour said:126
