        "content": "5rcb | Subjects completed the study individually. Because few nonendorsers were available and we thought it unlikely that they would report mixed emotions after watching the control clip, all nonendorsers watched the bittersweet clip. Endorsers watched either the bittersweet Life is Beautiful clip or the control clip by random assignment. After providing the cover story, the experimenter left and subjects watched the clip. After the clip, the experimenter told subjects that she needed to ask a few questions about their emotional reactions to the film because emotions can affect language comprehension. She first asked, \"How do you feel right now?\" Throughout, whenever subjects mentioned an emotion, the experimenter asked them to explain why they felt that way if they had not spontaneously done so. If they mentioned positive or negative emotions only in response to the first question, she asked, \"Do you feel anything else?\" At this point, the experimenter confirmed any reports of mixed emotions by asking, \"So you feel happy and sad?\" (When applicable, the experimenter replaced \"happy\" and \"sad\" with the positive and negative emotions mentioned by the subject.) No subjects who initially reported mixed emotions subsequently denied them.\n524j | Results and discussion. We distinguished between subjects who reported mixed emotions spontaneously after being asked \"How do you feel right now?\" and those who reported mixed emotions only after being asked \"Do you feel anything else?\" The percentage of subjects in each group who reported mixed emotions, reported mixed emotions spontaneously, and reported simultaneously mixed emotions is shown in Table Five. Chi-square tests revealed effects of condition on all three measures, Chi squared, comma, N equals ninety, equals fourteen point six nine, seven point eight five, and seven point eight six, Cram√©r's V equals point four five, point three three, and point three three, respectively, all P's less than point zero three. Follow-up Fisher's exact tests indicated that endorsers who watched the bittersweet clip were more likely than endorsers who watched the control clip to report mixed emotions and report simultaneously mixed emotions, after correcting for familywise error rate. Endorsers who watched the bittersweet clip were also marginally more likely to spontaneously report mixed emotions. Nonendorsers, all of whom watched the bittersweet clip, were more likely than endorsers who watched the control clip to report mixed emotions, spontaneously report mixed emotions, and report simultaneously mixed emotions.\nxd3m | Thus, whether or not they initially endorsed the notion that people could feel happy and sad at the same time, individuals who watched the bittersweet clip were more likely to report mixed emotions than those who watched the control clip. These results provide further evidence against the contention that people report mixed emotions in bittersweet situations only because they think that people can feel happy and sad at the same time. More generally, Study Six's results, like those of Studies Four and Five, provide evidence against the reactive measurement hypothesis and for the contention that happiness and sadness can co-occur.\n8qb6 | General Discussion\nwkbn | When it comes to the experience of emotion, is valence irreducible or are positivity and negativity separable? We addressed this question with six studies designed to test whether people can feel happy and sad at the same time. Subjects reported their emotions during (Studies One to Three) or after clips (Studies Four to Six) from a tragicomic film containing bittersweet scenes or a combination of unambiguously pleasant and unpleasant scenes. At first glance, the results of all six studies indicate that the incidence of mixed emotions is low. In Studies One B and Three, for instance, the majority of subjects never reported mixed emotions for so much as a second over the course of a nearly twenty-minute film clip. In Studies Four to Six, eighty-four percent did not report experiencing simultaneously mixed emotions after the clips. Thus, our data may provide the strongest evidence to date that people cannot feel happy and sad at the same time.\nftfg | A closer look at the data, however, provides even stronger evidence for a more nuanced conclusion. Compared with those who watched the control clip, people who watched the bittersweet clip spent more time pressing the happy and sad buttons simultaneously in Studies One A and Three, moved further into the interior of the continuous ESG in Studies One B and Two, were more likely to list mixed emotions in Study Four, were more likely to describe feeling mixed emotions in Study Five, and were more likely to tell an interviewer\n7xi5 | that they felt mixed emotions in Study Six. Thus, the data indicate that people do not often feel happy and sad at the same time but can do so in bittersweet situations.\nw8r5 | Taken together, the data extend prior evidence against the contention of Bain, Wundt, and Titchener that valence is an irreducible aspect of the experience of emotion. In contrast, the findings provide evidence for the contention of Socrates, Hume, and Ebbinghaus that positivity and negativity are separable in experience. In terms of their implications for contemporary models of the structure of affect, the data are inconsistent with Russell's valence-arousal model but consistent with Cacioppo and Berntson's ESM.\nybik | A Lingering Alternative Interpretation",
