        "content": "0i1k | J is less than zero. Beyond a critical system diameter of L approximately eight A, we find values of D and B for which the ground state of the Hamiltonian H hosts skyrmion-like spin textures confined in the interior (bulk) of the lattice, which we display in Fig. two. We checked that these skyrmion wave functions correspond to approximate eigenstates of the Hamiltonian by computing the energy variance E and performed a linear extrapolation toward results without numerical errors (see Appendix A for a discussion).\ndqlg | We compute the components of the spin magnetization, which are local expectation values M sub R equals the expectation value of S sub R. Since M sub Z R is parallel to the external field, we call this magnetization component the polarization. For B approximately J equals negative D divided by two, the local spin profiles yield magnetization textures similar to those obtained for classical skyrmion configurations of the NÃ©el hedgehog type: the central spin is polarized opposite to the applied magnetic field, and the spins wind radially from the center toward the periphery. In Fig. two, we depict the polarization along the field M sub Z R using a color scale and the in-plane magnetization M sub chi divided by Y R by arrows. More detailed radial and angular distributions of panel Fig. two e are depicted in Fig. three. In Fig. four, we show that the average polarization M bar Z equals one divided by N sum over R M sub Z R, as a function of the external field, yields three disconnected regions uniquely associated with the three phases of Eq. one.\np6pq | We estimate the size of an individual quantum skyrmion as the number of lattice sites over which the polarization changes its orientation once and the components orthogonal to the external field vanish. The radius can then be read out from Figs. two and three and results in R sub zero approximately three A for J equals negative zero point five D and K equals zero. These quantum skyrmion S K ground states occur not only for the fine-tuned parameters presented in Fig. two but in a wide range of intermediate values of the magnetic field. Furthermore, the emergence of individual skyrmions for small lattices is largely independent of the lattice geometry. While the effect of boundaries cannot be neglected for the small systems considered here, we verified that the size of an individual skyrmion is neither affected by the boundary conditions (see Fig. two) nor the system diameter (see Fig. eight).\nzse6 | As we show in Fig. two, for small magnetic fields, the system's ground state is a helical spin spiral H S state. This is characterized by a degenerate ground state, in which each possible ground state features oscillations of the magnetization along a symmetry axis of the lattice. The large ground-state degeneracy makes the spin spiral phase notoriously difficult to simulate for tensor network states. In contrast, for large magnetic fields, the system reaches a ferromagnetic state, where all spins are polarized parallel to the external magnetic field. The bulk of the field-polarized ferromagnet is devoid of entan-\np2n3 | glement and can thus be most efficiently approximated by an M P S. For parameters that result in S K ground states, D M R G reliably converges within a few dozen sweeps and yields excellent M P S approximations with maximum truncation error Delta rho approximately ten to the negative six, even for small bond dimensions\nohh7 | M equals thirty-two left twenty-six. We want to stress that the fine-tuned regime J equals negative zero point five D is not necessary to enter the skyrmion lattice phase. By increasing the ferromagnetic exchange coupling to a value J equals negative two D, we obtain qualitatively similar results, which we present in Fig. four. Note, however, that the corresponding system diameter for J equals negative two D is dramatically increased compared to J equals negative zero point five D. We attribute this to the fact that the skyrmion radius is determined by the ratio\nvbni | Four. Entanglement\ndgcw | To probe whether the spins of a skyrmion are entangled, a genuine quantum feature of many-body systems, we compute the entanglement entropy of a suitable bipartition of the system. The latter is defined as S sub v N equals negative trace of rho sub A ln rho sub A, which can be understood as the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix rho sub A equals trace sub B of rho sub A B, obtained by splitting the set of lattice sites N into two disjoint sets A and B, and performing the partial trace over subsystem B. For our purposes, it is sufficient to fix A and B as two patches that are symmetric about the central site (see Appendix B). We denote the entropy associated with this symmetric center-site partition choice as S, which is plotted in color in Fig. four and Fig. nine, panels c and d.",
