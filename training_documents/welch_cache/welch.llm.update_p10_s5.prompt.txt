You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

syiw | G.W .: It's surprising to me, thinking about this very thing. More than ever I feel part of a musical continuum. I really feel the people who inspired and came before us. I was thinking about our song "Hashtag," which is at least partly about Guy Clark dying.
kg3t | D.R .: I think about John Hartford, and what it was like when we spent time with him when we first got to town. Thinking, I just want to live up to these people, and their contributions, and how they were as human beings when they were around the age I am now.
lvae | G.W .: There was a particular and beautiful kind of reciprocity to it, too. Let's take Guy, for instance, or Hartford. I felt this joy from them. We were almost like their musical children. They could see their music moving forward in us, and they were so happy. They were so relieved. They were so grateful!
o9sc | David, I remember reading an interview with you in Rolling Stone, where you were talking about how folk music picks up a little bit of the DNA of everybody who has ever performed it. And, because of that, playing those tunes, it feels
121u | like there's a hundred people in the room-it makes a person feel less lonely. It's a pliable form, and you can always see the fingerprints.
zh03 | G.W .: A pebble in the river that's just been rolled and tossed and turned.
1mvw | D.R .: But also, because it's folk music, you're allowed to take a piece of slate and knock half of it out and go, "Y'know, that rock's pretty nice as a triangle, too!" If people like your triangle-
6d4s | G.w .: They add! We've twisted every folk song that we sing.
mqah | I wanted to come back to "Hashtag" for a moment. When I first saw the tracklist for "Woodland," I was really surprised to see a song with that title. Somehow, the world of Gillian Welch and David Rawlings felt incompatible, to me, with the very idea of a hashtag. I love this line, though it's quite dark: "You laughed and said the news would be bad / If I ever saw your name with a hashtag / Singers like you and I are only news when we die." That idea of reducing an entire life or an entire legacy to a hashtag. Brutal!
xxr8 | G.W .: I remember feeling really jarred because, like us, Guy was just not one of those people who engaged with modern technology.
rl4j | D.R .: He was so committed to word and craft.
vz32 | G.w .: And so to get the news that way, and to know instantly, it was just, it was just, Oh . . . I gasped, and felt sick. And I knew. I remember how awful and darkly humorous that moment was. How strange.
ncb0 | D.R .: When I think about our relationship with art-getting a little older, having done this a little longer-I think about these gigs we did with him when we went to Texas for the first time. We were opening for him at a place called the Mucky Duck, a little club in Houston. We had played our set and we were watching Guy's set, and he got to the end of his show, left the stage, and got called back for
8mp0 | an encore. Came back, did an encore. He had put on such a beautiful show, and he had such a beautiful self-possessed way about him. There was such gravity when Guy stood onstage. He played this song, and then he walked off again, and the crowd just wasn't havin' it. They were not going to leave. And I can't remember what he played-"Let Him Roll"? I don't remember what the last song was, but he just waved them off. He said, "Go home!"
xjyk | G.W .: He just leaned out of the dressing room. He wouldn't even go back out. He kind of hung on the door trim, and leaned out: "Go home!"
mt0f | D.R .: He knew his art better than they knew his art.
awab | G.W .: He'd done it.
ixcc | D.R .: Yes. And he truly had.
8p6h | G.W .: The show was done!
pmgl | D.R .: I learned something about understanding what you do, and also the value of not doing it. You're gonna do the best job you can, and when you have done it, stand firm. I thought, Wow, I don't know if I'll ever get to that place. We were young. It was long before our first record. It was the first we'd really seen of how musicians are on the road. I remember sitting in a Motel 6 in Guy's room. We had left the venue and we had taken this giant tinfoil pan of barbecue with us back to his room, and I just remember Guy and I standing there over the bed eating ribs and just laughing. I don't know what we were making, maybe a hundred dollars a night? Who knows. But he was willing to give of himself to us, to teach us. To tell us where the best pimento-cheese sandwich was.
90no | G.W .: He'd tell us which exit between each town. He'd say, "Now, when you're going between Houston and Dallas, you're gonna wanna stop here. If you're going between Dallas and Austin, you're gonna wanna stop here."This is way before cell phones and G.P.S. You needed this information! You've got a Rand McNally at
jt0y | that point. If we were in Texas, in kind of unknown territory, we would call Guy. I'd say, "Guy, we're down around San Antonio and we need dinner." And he'd say, "O.K." He'd think for a minute. "All right, there's a barbecue place . . . "
qb7o | For each of you, do you have a clear sense of which version-performed or recorded-feels like the truest version of a song?
oae5 | G.W .: I'm really happy with some songs that we caught very early. Something like "Elvis Presley Blues." We finished the song and recorded it the same night. Maybe we became more accomplished at performing it, but, in the recording, I hear that very short distance between the inspiration and the writing of it. I hear us still in our writers' brains. "I Dream a Highway"-same thing. The version on tape is the first time I sang it through. I can hear that in it. I'd never sung it stem to stern.
s0fl | D.R .: When Gill is singing something for the very first time, there's more variation and melisma on even the simplest melodies. I want every bit of that. Because by the time she's sung it five times, they're gonna become more formalized. But the flip side of what you're saying is, sometimes being in front of people and feeling energy come back as you're singing something, you can take things to a place where they get emotionally re-amplified a little bit. Maybe it becomes a little bigger in a way that can be fun.
43ia | G.W .: Some songs just are more suited to the quiet, interior space of the studio. Some are more suited to have their more perfect performance happen in public. "Red Clay Halo," or something like that. We probably bested the studio recording any number of times.
3g2y | D.R .: This makes me think of one time we played this song that ended up being called "The Way It Will Be," but this was before it had a title. We were in a trailer at Bonnaroo for a radio thing. There were a couple of mikes and maybe twelve or fifteen people sitting in that trailer. We started it, and the guitars hit the note, and it just created a space in that room, and we sang our unison note, and it was just as
gc7v | Performing for just a dozen people sounds terrifying.
wqfv | D.R .: Especially when two of them are on their phones!
