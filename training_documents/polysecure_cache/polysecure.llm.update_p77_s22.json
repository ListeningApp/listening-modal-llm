Partners being a safe haven and a secure base for each other is key for being polysecure.\n8k3d | Being a Safe Haven For Each Other\nagug | John Bowlby and his contemporaries believed that for a partner to become an attachment figure, the relationship would serve as both a safe haven and a secure base. The bedrock of being polysecure in our relationships is feeling that we have a safe haven to turn to. This happens when our partners care about our safety, seek to respond to our distress, help us to co-regulate and soothe and are a source of emotional and physical support and comfort. Similarly, when our partners are struggling or in need, we can be a safe haven by being there for them in warm, caring and receptive ways. When we can't physically be there for our partners, we do as best we can to support them from a distance until we can be in physical proximity.\nmkb4 | In search of relationship safety, our attachment system is primed to seek the answers to certain questions regarding our partners. Both consciously and unconsciously we are looking to know:\n06qs | If I turn towards you, will you be there for me?\ncdth | Will you receive and accept me instead of attack, criticize, dismiss or judge\nevax | me?\ngen4 | Will you comfort me?\n2wtm | Will you respond in a way that calms my nervous system?\nib53 | Do I matter to you?\n0kr1 | Do I make a difference in your life?\n58mo | Can we lean into and rely on each other?\n1ghh | Interestingly, research consistently shows that people who have safe haven relationships in their life, whether through romantic partnership or through their family, are more resilient in the face of life stressors and trauma. Attachment research has looked at many different populations including orphans, people who have experienced natural disasters, assault victims, veterans who were in combat, refugees, people who were in New York City during September eleventh, people in concentration camps in World War Two, as well as people who have had heart attacks or are recovering from surgery in the hospital. The research has found that when people in all of these difficult situations have their safe haven attachment figures around them, either during or quickly after the event, they recover faster, experience less physical and emotional pain, and are less likely to have escalating symptoms of PTSD.\n643d | Examples of things that you and your partners can do to be safe havens for each other are:\n58a9 | Give emotional support and comfort.\nhjlr | Listen to each other with full attention.\n0k3o | Inquire and share about feelings and needs.\na1r1 | Track what is going on in each other's lives and make sure to follow up and inquire about those things.\nbou6 | Help in practical ways when a partner is tired or sick.\ns7uq | Discuss or debrief events of the day or things that are important to each of you.\nl11a | Let your partners know how and why they matter to you.\nllit | Safe Haven Reflection Questions\nmf1f | In each of your relationships that are attachment-based or for the relationships that you would like to become more attachment-based, ask yourself:\nm61m | How does this partner already act as a safe haven for me?\npnz9 | In what ways do they show up for me that feel supportive and comforting?\n1abn | How can this partner help me feel even more safe with them?\n8un4 | How can this partner help me feel even more supported or comforted by them, in general or in specific situations?\ns0ti | In what ways can I show up more as a safe haven for this partner?\nyhew | Being a Secure Base for Each Other\naqjo | When safety is established with our attachment figures and we have an internalized felt sense that we can turn towards them and lean on them when needed, we are freed up to securely turn away from them and engage in the world, whether with them by our side or on our own. A secure base provides the platform from which we can move out in the larger world, explore and take risks. This exploration facilitates our sense of personal competence and healthy autonomy. Similar to how children want to show their parents their latest drawings, tricks, accomplishments or discoveries, as adults we need to share the new things we've learned, the things we've achieved and the things we're excited about. Being and having a secure base in our partnerships means supporting each other's personal growth and exploration, independent activities and other relationships, even when these actions require time apart from each other. Secure base partners will not only support our explorations, but will also offer guidance when solicited and lovingly call us on our shit. They function as a compassionate mirror for our blind spots and all the ways we may be fooling ourselves, whether through self-aggrandizement or self-limitation.\nopdt | While being a secure base may appear to be easier or more fun than being a safe haven, do not underestimate how intimately personal and deeply vulnerable it can be for a person to share their visions, hopes, curiosities and dreams. It also requires faith to be able to turn away from a partner and then trust that you can safely\nj6d4 | turn back. In simple terms, I see being a safe haven as serving the role of accepting and being with me as I am, and a secure base as supporting me to grow beyond who I am.\nwmtt | Examples of things that you and your partners can do to be secure bases for each other:\nu5uc | Encourage each other's personal growth and development.\n0d2r | Support each other's work and/or interests.\ngly4 | Listen to each other's hopes, dreams and visions.\nw1gv | Listen when your partners share about their experiences in other relationships (assuming that the information shared is appropriate and consensual).\nf69a | Have conversations about things that are intellectually or emotionally stimulating to each other.\nycgz | Acknowledge each other's capabilities and possibilities for growth.\njb3e | Compassionately bring light to your partner's limitations and blind spots.\ne580 | Offer words of encouragement when your partners take on new responsibilities, go on dates with others, take a risk or learn something new.\nkwv3 | Secure Base Reflection Questions\nwxdu | In each of your relationships that are attachment-based, or for the relationships that you would like to become more attachment-based, ask yourself:\nzdfh | How is this partner already acting as a secure base for me?\ni1dq | What does growth look like for me? Is it usually a shared or a personal experience, or both?\nhwux | Are there other ways that I want encouragement or support in my individual growth or with my visions and dreams?\n9opd | How could my partners support me in regard to my other relationships?\nsco5 | How could I better support or encourage my partners' dreams or aspirations to grow and develop?\n8wy0 | How could I better show genuine interest or curiosity in things that are important to my partners?\na505 | How could I better support my partners in their other relationships?\ntv1d | A benefit of nonmonogamy is that you don't have to provide or expect to receive all of this from one partner. Different partners can be more of a safe haven, a secure base or both, offering different facets of each. We all have different strengths and it can be wonderfully satisfying to have some partners that support you in safe haven ways, while others offer more of a secure base.\n```",
