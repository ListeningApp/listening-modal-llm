You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

u2ob | Tableau Public Interface Features
2gnm | The user interface for Tableau Public was created to be simple and intuitive. It comes with three primary features (as discussed in Chapter 1, Getting Started with Tableau Public), namely connecting to data, opening your work, and discovering Tableau Public. Since Tableau Public is a tool for data discovery as well as data visualization, the interface is designed to encourage discovery through the drag-and-drop features for data. The user interface for Tableau Public is segmented into separate areas, namely data elements, cards, shelves, and the canvas. The data is also divided into two general categories- dimensions and measures. By understanding how data interacts with the user interface, you can design, configure, and polish chart objects that will be built into worksheets. These worksheets can then be assembled into one or more dashboards.
emgw | In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
xaqt | . The Tableau Public user interface
5rcb | . The side bar, including the Data window and the Analytics pane
524j | · The toolbars and menus
xd3m | . The Columns, Rows, and Filters shelves

gii5 | . In the previous chapter, we discussed how to download and install Tableau Public. We also saw what the start screen looks like and how you can use it to connect to data, explore your own work or that of others, or discover how to use the tool. On opening either a data file or an existing workbook with Tableau Public, you will see the worksheet view.

a7ao | There can be one or more worksheets in a workbook. Tableau Public extends this further by allowing you to place one or more worksheets in a dashboard, with all of this contained within the workbook.
29a3 | The starting point that appears when opening a new Tableau workbook is the worksheet view. This is the working area where you can build your dashboard. Let's take a quick look at it.

me84 | Chapter 2
o56m | Tableau Public scans the contents of your data source, groups fields into Dimensions, and Measures according to their field type. Before you start working with your data, you should look through the fields in the Dimensions and Measures panes to make sure that each field is in the proper place.
slz6 | L
90k5 | The Data pane has the following five different sections:
9m8s | 1. The data source name (1): When you load data, you should provide the data source with a name that identifies the contents, because that is what you and your consumers will see when they download your workbook from Tableau Public. Once you have added several data sources, you can condense their window in order to save space and then select different sources from the drop-down menu.
893y | 2. The Dimensions pane (2): This includes categorical fields with qualitative data. The Dimensions pane typically consists of a string field, a date field, and a field that has geographical attributes, as well as unique identifiers, such as ID fields.
favz | 3. The Measures pane (3): This usually includes quantitative fields with numerical data that can be aggregated. Tableau Public will automatically group numerical fields, except the ones with the ID string in the name as measures.
7szx | 4. The Sets pane (4): This includes user-defined, custom fields that interact just like dimensions and measures do. Sets pane can also create subsets of data that you can use just like dimensions.
hx9e | 5. The Parameters pane (5): This includes dynamic placeholders that can replace constant values in calculated fields and filters. Parameters are unique to a workbook and not a data source. You'll see the parameters available in your workbook no matter which data source you are viewing.
ywn2 | From the Data pane, you can can create fields for the Data window, as follows:
a63r | 1. Right-click on the data source to edit it.
dqvj | 2. Click on the View Data icon to see a sample of your data set.
r17u | 3. Click on the search icon (the little magnifying glass) to search for fields.
3c47 | 4. Click on the arrow that points downwards, which is the Context menu, to create calculated fields, parameters, and change the sort/view options for the Data window.

5u67 | Visual cues
dvms | Within the Data pane, each field name is displayed, but there is also a visual cue that tells you what type of field it is. Field types determine the function and capability of joining data sources. In addition to showing the field type, Tableau Public allows you to change a field's type by right-clicking on it and selecting the Change Data Type option. The following list shows the fields and their descriptions:
qrd3 | . The Abc field: This indicates that the field is a string field, which means that the contents of the field may include letters, special characters, or numbers
rxrg | · The calendar icon: This indicates a date, datetime, or time field
tf43 | . The # sign: This indicates a numeric field that can have any type of native numeric format, from bigint to decimal
fcco | · The globe icon: This icon indicates that the field has geographic attributes
