        "content": "q1q2 | A unique, pan-ecosystemic sampling strategy\ncb7r | The Pacific Ocean covers approximately one-third of the earth's surface, with nearly twenty-five thousand islands, most of which harbor coral reefs. Tara Pacific equipped the schooner Tara to explore thirty-two islands across the entire Pacific over a period of negative two point five years. The route of the Tara schooner was chosen to maximize the number of visited remote islands and atolls and to perform the widest possible comparative survey, from the equator to the temperate and more acidic regions, encompassing most of the environmental range where scleractinian coral species can live. It also covers a biodiversity gradient, from the low diversity present in the eastern Pacific reefs to the highly diverse western Pacific \"warm pool.\" This sampling strategy also encompasses a wide variety of environments, from high temperature/low seasonality to low temperature/high seasonality, and also a full range of trophic status and physicochemical environmental parameters that affect coral reef ecosystems (sea surface temperature, pH, nutrients, lights, pollutants, etc.).\n68xu | Across its entire route, the Tara Pacific expedition targeted two species of scleractinian corals (Cnidaria, Anthozoa: Pocillopora meandrina and Porites lobata), one species of hydrocoral\nhd35 | (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa: Millepora platyphylla), and two species of reef fish (Acanthurus triostegus and Zanclus cornutus). The chosen taxa are among the few species that occur across most of the Pacific Ocean and are usually abundant on reefs. Around each of the thirty-two islands, three sites were sampled, collecting ten colonies of each coral species and five to ten individuals of each fish species, as well as water samples. Coral fragments and fish samples were preserved immediately on board, using specific buffers (e.g., DNA/RNA shield for genomics, glutaraldehyde for microscopy, etc.), and/or flash frozen for subsequent laboratory analyses (e.g., metabolomics, biomarkers, etc.).\n2zpk | In addition, seawater biogeochemistry and plankton microbiomes (viruses to zooplankton) were assessed in oceanic waters upstream and downstream of each island, as well as from water above each site (i.e., \"surface water\") and surrounding two colonies of sampled P. meandrina corals at each site (i.e., \"coral-surrounding water\"). Underwater propeller-driven plankton nets (for surface water) and water pumping systems (for coral-surrounding water) were developed to collect plankton on reef sites, whereas the preparation of plankton samples into different size classes \"less than zero point two, zero point two to three, three to twenty, twenty to two thousand micrometers\" and their preservation followed the Tara Oceans protocols in order to maximize comparability and integration of data. Samples will be analyzed using high-throughput imaging and genomic techniques.\nepu7 | Finally, key physical, chemical, and biological parameters were measured continuously from surface water and from aerosols using specific instruments installed on board (e.g., thermosalinograph, mass- and spectrophotometers), as well as samples for imaging and genetic analysis of aerosol particles. Environmental context will also be obtained from satellite images and operational oceanographic products from the European Copernicus Marine Service and Mercator Ocean.\n7od1 | Tara Pacific samples and data resources for the immediate and long-term future\n0bqy | Tara Pacific endorses the findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (FAIR) principles for scientific data management as well as ethical and responsible use of data. With a few exceptions, all physical samples of coral, plankton, fish, and sediments were preserved on board Tara and sent back to partner laboratories for subsequent analyses. Controlled vocabularies describing sampling devices and sample preparation protocols were used throughout the expedition to capture provenance metadata on customized log sheets, and samples were assigned unique identifiers to facilitate their traceability. Legal documents regulating the collection, export, and import of samples, as well as links to the Convention on Biological Diversity's access and benefit-sharing clearing house are in the process of being provided for each sample as a first step toward ethical and responsible use of the Tara Pacific data. The detailed registry of all samples, including their provenance and environmental and legal context, is curated manually using simple semantics that enable machine- and human-readable data discovery services. Sequencing data will be deposited at the free, open-access European Nucleotides Archive; environmental data are deposited at the free, open-access PANGAEA database; and both archives will be interlinked via the sample registry available online at BioSamples. Metabolomic data (mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance) and their annotations will also be accessible through the Metabolights portal. The submission of data in a relational, open-access, updated, and cured database is critical and necessary for our aim to establish a reference of the biological state of coral reefs in the Anthropocene for the broader research community.\nb780 | Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to explore the diversity and physiology of coral reef holobionts\nccmb | Building upon expertise gained in the previous Tara Oceans project, we are applying Illumina HiSeq technology to sequence a series of barcodes designed recently to explore the diversity of bacteria and archaea (V4-V5 region of the nuclear sixteen S rRNA gene), eukaryotes (V9 region of nuclear eighteen S rRNA gene), Symbiodiniaceae (ITS2 region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA), and metazoan species (mitochondrial COX1 gene), as well as metagenome assembly-defined viral populations. Barcode-specific PCRs are performed on DNA from coral tissues, coral-surrounding water, fish tissues, and surface water above the reef in order to assess interkingdom diversity associated with the holobiont at different degrees of proximity from the coral animal host, from endosymbiotic to drifting in coral-surrounding and surface waters. Biogeographic gradients will also be investigated between the studied island systems. The sequence reads are assembled into operational taxonomic units for bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes and into ITS2-type profiles (using the SymPortal framework at symportal.org) for Symbiodiniaceae and taxonomically annotated by comparison to reference databases. Classical numerical ecology methods are applied to employ OTU richness and abundance data to (one) assess and compare the total diversity of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes associated with various compartments of the different coral",
