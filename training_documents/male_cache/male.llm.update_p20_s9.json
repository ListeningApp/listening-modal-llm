The secondary spermatocytes then undergo the second or equational division to form two spermatids with a haploid chromosome complement. At the prophase these\nk5r6 | cells are forty-six C (forty-four plus XY or X) with four N of DNA. This division serves to reduce the number of chromosomes in half (twenty-two plus X or twenty-two plus Y), and the DNA per cell is reduced from four N to two N. These cells are rarely identified in a section because they promptly undergo a second meiotic division to reduce the DNA in half again (two N to one N) with twenty-three chromosomes forming haploid spermatids. There is no S phase (DNA synthesis) between the first and second meiotic divisions.\nz9v9 | iii) Second Meiotic Division: After prolonged meiotic prophase, pairs of sister chromatids progress through metaphase, anaphase, and telophase and separate into daughter cells known as the secondary spermatocytes (two C DNA content).\ngpu9 | iv) Consequences of Meiosis\nu5ws | One. Haploid chromosomal complement\nonkh | Two. Homologous recombination or random mixing of the paternal and maternal chromosomes\n8t55 | Three. Crossing over increases genetic variation\n7imw | b) Spermatids are the haploid germ cells within the seminiferous epithelium. This is the last phase of spermatogenesis. Spermiogenesis is the process of differentiation of the haploid spermatid into a mature spermatozoon. The process of spermiogenesis involves the differentiation of the spermatids. The spermatids are generated from the second meiotic division of the secondary spermatocytes. These cells are haploid with one N DNA content. They are small in size (seven to eight micrometers in diameter), with areas of condensed chromatin and juxtaluminal location within the seminiferous epithelium. The three phases of spermiogenesis are:\nlf1t | i) Development of the Acrosome: The acrosomal sac or cap is required for fertilization and consists of a storage area for hydrolytic enzymes. The development of the acrosome progresses through a Golgi stage, cap phase, acrosomal phase, and maturation phase.\ntze7 | ii) Golgi Phase: The cytoplasm contains a prominent Golgi complex, as well as mitochondria, a pair of centrioles, free ribosomes, and smooth endoplasmic reticulum. A small periodic acid-Schiff positive granule forms in the Golgi complex near the nucleus. These granules come together to form an acrosomal granule within an acrosomal vesicle. The centrioles move near the cell surface and opposite from the acrosome.\nryvv | iii) Acrosomal Phase: The acrosomal vesicle spreads to cover the top half of the condensing nucleus to form the acrosome. This vesicle contains hydrolytic enzymes (hyaluronidase, neuraminidase, acid phosphatase, and a trypsin-like protease). These enzymes are needed by the mature sperm to traverse the cumulus complex and zona pellucida of the ova. The cell reverses orientation, and the acrosome is now juxtaposed to the basal region of the tubule. The nucleus undergoes extensive remodeling and condenses markedly. One of the centrioles differentiates to form the flagellum. The middle piece of the tail is a thickened region of the flagellum where sperm movement is generated. The mitochondria migrate along the developing axoneme.\nzdrh | iv) Development of the Flagellum: The flagellum consists of an axoneme (nine plus two microtubule doublets in a concentric arrangement) surrounded by a fibrous sheath and keratin-containing dense outer fibers. Mitochondria are in the mid-piece of the tail and provide energy.\nosmo | v) The Maturation Phase: The spermatids continue to differentiate, condense, and elongate their nucleus; the residual cytoplasm is phagocytized by the Sertoli cell; and the spermatozoa are released into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule. The cytoplasmic bridges formed between the spermatogonia have been maintained and permit the exchange of information between cohorts of cells. Prior to spermiation, these bridges are lost with the residual cytoplasm that is extruded.\n0b8v | vi) Condensation of the Nucleus: The somatic chromatin histones are replaced by highly basic arginine and lysine rich protamines. The chromatin fibers associate and condense the nuclear material into a highly and tightly packaged structure. Transcriptional activity ceases (RNA synthesis).\nfucs | vii) Final Steps of Spermiogenesis: The flagellum structure is key to future motility (nine plus two microtubules surrounded by the outer dense fibers). The mitochondria align along the developing flagellum, and the manchette migrates caudally. The tail now has two segments: the mid piece (mitochondria are present) and the principal piece (tail is surrounded by the dense sheath). The residual body, excess cytoplasm extruded during spermiogenesis, is phagocytized by the Sertoli cell at the time of spermiation (release of the spermatozoa). At this time, nuclear condensation is complete, and histones are fully replaced by the protamines. The head of the sperm is covered by an intact acrosome, and these enzymes are released at the time of fertilization. The connecting piece links the head to the tail and contains the two centrioles. The distal centriole gives rise to the axoneme of the sperm tail. The mid-piece, principal piece, and end piece describe the tail.\nyply | Four) Spermatogenesis: Although the cell types were described above, the process of spermatogenesis will be the focus of the next section.\n75n5 | a) Spermatogenesis, the process by which a spermatogonial stem cell gives rise to a spermatozoon, can be divided into three distinct phases (Figure eleven):\nec91 | i) Spermatogonia proliferate to give rise to spermatocytes and simultaneously maintain their number by renewal.\nwul6 | ii) Spermatocytes prepare for and undergo the complex maturation divisions of meiosis that reduce the chromosome number of the germ cells by half.\n4rhy | iii) Spermatids, the product of the maturation divisions, undergo a remarkable metamorphosis, called spermiogenesis, which leads to the production of spermatozoa.\n092d | a) Proliferative Phase: Unlike the situation in the female, in which a full complement of oocytes is present in the ovary at birth, the production of generation after generation of meiotic spermatocytes in the male requires a means to replace the spermatogonia or stem cells.\n94ul | i) Several spermatogonial types have been described in man: Spermatogonial stem cells type Ad (dark) and type Ap (pale), and Type B spermatogonia. According to Clermont, one member of a pair of type Ad spermatogonia divides to give rise to a pair of new type Ad cells, while the other member of the original pair of Ad divides to yield a pair of more differentiated type Ap spermatogonia. Thus, it is thought that the type Ad spermatogonia not only serve as a precursor for type Ap, but also eventually serve as the ancestor (i.e., stem cell) of a later generation of sperm.\n```",
