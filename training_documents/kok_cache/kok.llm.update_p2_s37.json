        "content": "xh3i | the decrease of Phi sub two with increasing irradiance has resulted in a modified method to estimate R sub d. The analysis using the modified method, now known as the Yin method, indicates that the inhibition of R sub d by light is less than the original Kok method suggests.\nsyiw | Less information is available on the change in f sub act or in rho sub two with I sub abs that could partly explain the Kok effect. Peltier and Sarrey indicated that the inhibition of chlororespiration, a process in chloroplasts that involves a respiratory electron transport chain within the thylakoid membrane, might be responsible for the Kok effect. Data of Zhang et al. and Ver Sagun et al. suggested that cyclic electron transport around PSI increased with increasing I sub abs. If this also applies to the limiting light conditions, an increase in f sub cyc with increasing I sub abs would predict a part of the Kok effect. According to equations two and three, f sub cyc has a dual effect on the expression of the Kok effect, that is, via both terms f sub act and rho sub two. Equation three suggests that parameter rho sub two, related to state transition, could be affected not only by f sub cyc but also by the Phi sub two over Phi sub one ratio. Tcherkez et al. speculated the possible role of state transition in the Kok effect. The model of equations one to three predicts that an increase in f sub cyc or in Phi sub two over Phi sub one with increasing I sub abs leads to the state transition in favor of PSI with increasing irradiance, and this could engender part of the Kok effect.\nkg3t | The Kok effect is not ubiquitous. Early reports found little Kok effect at low oxygen conditions and in C sub four plants. These observations have led to suggestions that photorespiration might be involved in the Kok effect, as confirmed by other studies where photorespiration was manipulated by changing measurement temperatures or by lowering leaf water potential. Again, the model analyses of Farquhar and Busch demonstrated that the change in Gamma star over C sub c therefore, in relative amounts of photorespiration, with increasing I sub abs can explain much of the diminution of the Kok effect in C sub four plants and at low oxygen or high carbon dioxide concentrations or low temperatures. They also showed that the change in Gamma star over C sub c can generate the apparent inhibition of R sub d as inferred by the Laisk method, which is based on A minus C sub i curves at two or more irradiances, where C sub i is the intercellular carbon dioxide concentration. The decrease in C sub i with increasing I sub abs is the result of stomatal regulation, and its influence on estimates of R sub d by the Kok method was noted by Kirschbaum and Farquhar, who proposed a method to correct for this decrease in C sub i . The further drawdown in C sub c, relative to C sub i, is regulated by g sub m. The Kok method would underestimate R sub d if light-dependent changes in C sub i or in C sub c are not corrected for. Simple g sub s and g sub m models when coupled with photosynthesis models like equations one to three can account for the refixation of carbon dioxide released from respiration and photorespiration, and in fact, the refixation fractions of photorespired carbon dioxide can be calculated analytically from stomatal, mesophyll and carboxylation resistances. As such, the light inhibition of R sub d predicted for photorespiratory conditions by Farquhar and Busch and the need to correct\nlvae | for light-dependent changes in C sub i and C sub c are basically analogous to the statement of Loreto et al that the lower R sub d than R sub dl resulted from the failure of the original Kok or Laisk methods in accounting for the refixation of respired carbon dioxide in the light.",
