You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

awvu | This literature not only synthesized current school leadership practices, but also pointed out the direction of future inquiry and capacity development for leader- ship culturally diversity, responsiveness, and social justice. And while we appreciate extant attempts to define culture as part of the context for empirical study, we see the need to extend and enhance this work theoretically and empirically in light of the contemporary situation of increasing cultural diversity among students. For this, we draw primarily on the work of Pierre Bourdieu (1977a) as well as Lingard and Christie (2003), two scholars who have applied Bourdieu's theories to educational leadership.
on9b | 4.1 Leadership Approaches from Social Theories
a8ge | Beyond ISLDN, a growing number of educational leadership scholars have proposed leadership approaches in schools aimed at societal transformation, most often using various critical theory lenses that expand functionalist organizational theory and the role of leadership (Theoharis 2007; Shields 2010). Here scholars seek to explain and promote individual school leaders and social justice work in schools. Drawing on empirical findings and other scholarly models or approaches (Burns 1978; Freire 1970; Foster 1986; Leithwood 2010), Shields (2010) highlighted the differences among the three approaches that have dominated the educational leadership field for three decades, transactional, transformational, and transformative leadership. According to Shields (2010), transactional leadership involves a reciprocal trans- action; transformational leadership focuses on improving organizational qualities, dimensions, and effectiveness; and transformative leadership begins by challenging inappropriate uses of power and privilege by challenging inappropriate uses of power and privilege that create or perpetuate inequity and injustice. In Shields' (2010) approach to transformative leadership, the fundamental task is to ask questions, for example, about the purposes of schooling, about which ideas should be taught

xmgs | and about who is successful. Her critique lays the groundwork for the promise of schooling that is more inclusive, democratic, and equitable for more students.
bd9h | Transformative leadership, therefore, recognizes the need to begin with critical reflection and analysis and to move through enlightened understanding to action-action to redress wrongs and to ensure that all members of the organization are provided with as level a playing field as possible-not only with respect to access but also with regard to academic, social and civic outcomes. (Shields 2010, p. 572).
m047 | Shields (2010) argues for a careful and consistent deconstruction of old knowledge frameworks that perpetuated deficit thinking and inequity, creating new frameworks of inclusion and equity that undergirded the continuous improvement mentality. Although, Shields (2010) enhances leadership approaches to include aims toward social transformation, we still do not see the educational leadership literature as complete in terms of understanding leadership practice in a cultural context.
gy8c | Other scholars have proposed transformative leadership approaches (e.g. Dantley and Tillman 2006; Fuhrman and Gruenewald 2004;) to shed light on how the school social and cultural context influences the operation of effectiveness in elemen- tary schools. In our view, the significance of their findings is limited in terms of explicit explanations of students' social and cultural capital in instructional improve- ment programs and leadership as it emerged from the effective schools' literature. Besides focus on the development of curriculum, the following studies indicate the characteristics of transformative leaders.
y4mj | Transformative principals develop a clear school mission, monitor student progress, protect instructional time from interruptions, and maintain high standards for teachers and students (Bossert et al. 1981; Brookover and Lezotte 1979; Murphy et.al. 1985; Stallings and Mohlman 1981; Wellisch et al. 1978). Dimmock and Walker (2004) aligned school leadership with reflection of strategic intents, values, and connectivity, emphasizing the importance social-cultural context in contempo- rary multiethnic communities. Research (e.g. Hallinger 2016) regarding knowledge- based educational leadership and management drew on the way school context (community, socio-cultural, political, and economic) influences leadership practice, thus illustrating the nature of successful leadership practice. Khalifa et al., (2016) also discusses culturally responsive school leadership and argues that culture plays a significant role in shaping the thinking, behaviors, and practices of school leaders and other school stakeholders. Theoharis (2007) concept of social justice leadership illustrates how principals develop and sustain their social justice work in order to lead their schools to transform and to benefit the marginalized students. Hallinger's (2017) systematic review of research on educational leadership and management in Africa shows the increasing need to diversify the corpus of studies beyond the traditional Anglo-American centers of knowledge production. We see Bourdieu's theories and thinking tools as a way to diversify the corpus of studies beyond the Anglo-American centers of knowledge production as we shall discuss below.

ousl | 5 Bourdieu's 'Thinking Tools'
m4ju | Many education researchers know Pierre Bourdieu for his work on social and cultural reproduction. For example, Bourdieu (1990a, 2008, 1974, 1977a, 1986) describes how schools are not agents of social mobility but rather perpetuate existing societal inequalities. According to Bourdieu, the concepts of habitus, capital, and field are integral in understanding practice. Bourdieu (1977a, 1984, 1990a) explained that practice was the complex interplay of these main concepts. These concepts help make sense of the relationship between objective social structures (like institutions) and everyday practice.
a0mb | 6 Habitus
ki8m | Bourdieu describes habitus as "socialized subjectivity" (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992, p. 126). Bourdieu suggests that through the experiences of everyday life social agents (individuals and collective) unconsciously adopt the norms of the society. In society, social practices are characterized by regularities despite there being no explicit rules that dictate these practices (Bourdieu 1990b). Conceptions of what is right and/or appropriate become embedded, instinctive patterns of thought and behavior. According to Bourdieu (1990a), habitus constitutes,
km8w | Systems of durable, transposable dispositions, structured structures predisposed to function as structuring structures, that is, as principles which generate and organize practices and representations that can be objectively adapted to their outcomes without presupposing a conscious aiming at ends or an express mastery of the operations necessary in order to attain them. (p. 53).
wzno | To Bourdieu, habitus constrains but does not determine thought and action; it operates at the subconscious level. Bourdieu (1984) writes, "The schemes of the habitus, the primary forms of classification, owe their specific efficacy to the fact that they function below the level of consciousness and language, beyond the reach of introspective scrutiny or control by the will" (p. 466). For Bourdieu, habitus defines the dispositions through which we perceive and act in the world through lasting exposure to particular social conditions and conditionings. The habitus is not just the producer of actions, but it is a product of the structural conditions a social agent encounters. Bourdieu (1990b) also describes habitus as a "feel for the game" or a "second sense" that equips social agents with practical knowledge to navigate the social field.
xagm | The concept of habitus confronted organizational theorists' assumptions that indi- viduals and organizations make rational decisions. According to Bourdieu the theo- rists ignored the socio-economic conditions that shaped the actions they take (Bour- dieu 1990b; Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992). Bourdieu concludes that habitus is the result of social conditionings or history but it can be transformed as it encounters different types of fields (Bourdieu 1990a, 1990b; Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992).

pxbq | Not only can habitus be transformed by new experiences, it can also be "controlled through awakening of consciousness and socio-analysis" (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992, p. 116).
jfsr | 6.1 Capital
u15r | Capital is anything that has been designated to have value in a particular social field. Capital is context specific, transferable, and convertible (Bourdieu 1993a). Bourdieu (1986) identifies three primary forms as, economic capital, cultural capital and social capital. Economic capital can be directly converted into money social capital can be defined as connections or networks that can be converted into economic capital. Bourdieu defines cultural capital as background, knowledge, dispositions, and skills. Cultural capital has three distinct forms: embodied, objectified and institutionalized (Bourdieu 1986). Embodied cultural capital consists of dispositions and competen- cies. Objectified cultural capital consists of physical possessions, such as books and works of art. Institutionalized cultural capital consists of institutional recognition, in the form of academic qualifications of the cultural capital held by an individual.
lq35 | Bourdieu (1986) used cultural capital to explain differences in educational outcomes between children of different classes. According to Bourdieu, children from upper class households inherit a substantially different cultural capital than do those from poor working-class households. Schools reward the cultural capital of the upper classes at the same time they devalue or misrecognize that of the poor working classes. Cultural capital allows those well endowed to benefit from education in ways those without cannot.
3g9w | Bourdieu (1986) defines social capital as "the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less insti- tutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition" (p. 248). The amount of social capital will depend on the size of the network and the capital (economic and cultural) members of the network possess. This network is the product of investment strategies.
d09o | 6.2 Field
ylhz | Bourdieu and Wacquant (1992) describes fields as microcosms in which the social agents (individuals or social institutions) interact and struggle with each other in accordance with field-specific rules and hierarchies. The struggle within the fields is for control of resources (economic, cultural and social capital). Bourdieu (1998) describes a social field as,
a3td | A structured social space, a field of forces, a force field. It contains people who dominate and people who are dominated. Constant, permanent relationships of inequality operate inside this space, which at the same time becomes a space in which various actors struggle for
ex5k | the transformation or preservation of the field. All the individuals in this universe bring to the competition all the (relative) power at their disposal. It is this power that defines their position in the field and, as a result, their strategies. (p. 40-41).
9d4o | Therefore, a society can be viewed as a system of interconnected fields; each field has its own characteristics, hierarchies and laws of functioning (Bourdieu 1990a). Although fields are autonomous, they are embedded and influenced by other fields. For example, the educational leadership field may also be influenced by the political and the economic fields. According to Bourdieu, society can be thought of as one large field; within the field, there is a struggle skewed in favor of those with economic, social and cultural capital (Bourdieu 1991; Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992). In each field the social space is stratified. Capital determines the dominant and the dominated social agents.
cjq2 | One can only determine what constitutes a field by studying empirical work; however, Bourdieu cautions researchers about the complexity of the relationships between fields (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992). Bourdieu and Wacquant (1992) suggest three necessary and interconnected steps that could be used to study a field. The first step analyzes the positions of the field vis-à-vis the field of power. The second step maps out the objective structures of relations between the positions occupied by the social agents (individuals or institutions) who compete for power in the field. And, the last step analyzes the habitus of social agents. Bourdieu studied many fields including, education, art, television, journalism, religion, housing construction, and literature (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992).
5esx | In sum, we see Bourdieu's (1977b, 1984, 1986, 1990a) concepts of habitus, field and social capital as critically important to understanding the relationships the indi- vidual has with schools and society. Bourdieu's theories extend and enhance socio- logical perspectives on schools as societal institutions and leaders as agents within these institutions (Fayol 1949; Simon 1958), yet few scholars have explicitly applied Bourdieu's theories to schools and school leadership.
m5ka | 7 The Interconnectedness of the Thinking Tools
byu8 | The formulation "(Habitus x Capital) + Field = Practice" helps us to see how the thinking tools are interconnected (Bourdieu 1984). The equation can present the rela- tionship between the tools: practice is the result of relations between one's habitus (dispositions) and the quantity and quality of one's capital within the current field. Bourdieu uses the thinking tools to understand social practice, and particularly to uncover the inequalities in particular social spaces. The thinking tools cannot be examined in isolation from one another. Bourdieu and Wacquant (1992) empha- size, "Such notions as habitus, field, and capital can be defined, but only within the theoretical system they constitute, not in isolation." (p. 96).
76b0 | The value of capital hinges on the existence of a field or game that allows the possessors to wield power; thus "capital does not exist and function except in relation

xnth | to a field" (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992, p. 101). Therefore, any strategies of social agents in the field depend on the quantity and quality of capital they possess. While most social agents play the game to increase or conserve their capital, others play to transform the existing rules of the game (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992). Bourdieu and Wacquant (1992) argue that "in order to construct the field, one must identify the forms of specific capital that operate within it, and to construct the forms of specific capital one must know the specific logic of the field" (p. 108).
vafm | Habitus can be seen as the theoretical bridge between capital and field because it explains why within a particular field social agents' actions or decisions are based on the types and quantity of capital they possess (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992). Therefore, as we work with Bourdieu to understand educational leadership, we must examine the relationships that exist between the thinking tools in the context of schooling.
2zmw | 8 Extant Scholarship on Bourdieu and Leadership
bf9k | In an introductory essay for a special issue on Bourdieu in the International Journal of Leadership in Education, Lingard and Christie (2003) present the case for using Bourdieu's theoretical framework to examine the work of school principals. The special issue sought to explore how Bourdieu's conceptual frameworks and method- ological approaches might be applied in educational leadership research. Lingard and Christie (2003) articulate substantively how Bourdieu enhances the educational lead- ership field with attention to relationships between individuals and social structures within the context of schooling. They argue that Bourdieu's theoretical approach will "enable us to move beyond trait, situational and transformational leadership theories, emphasizing instead the recursive relationship between agency (individual leader habitus) and structure (field) in the broader social context" (p. 319).
