You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

dpv6 | Assessing the female figure identification technique's reliability as a body shape classification system
8r5j | This paper demonstrates the effects of slight differences in measurement definitions on resultant body shape classification. Ergonomic researchers consider the Female Figure Identification Technique (FFIT) a 'gold standard' body shape classification system to describe variation in a population's 3 D profile. Nevertheless, researchers use FFIT without a scientific basis or consider- ing their ergonomic suitability. This paper rigorously evaluates FFIT, focussing on ergonomics, garment construction, and scientific research applications. Through analysing 1,679 3 D Body Scans, we assess the level of agreement between the FFIT's body shape classification when measurements placed following FFIT's or SizeUK's guidance. We establish how different interpre- tations of FFIT's measurement placement cause the same body to be categorised into different shapes - in up to 40% of cases. FFIT omits shoulder measurements that have little relationship to body shape yet are vital in garment construction. Using FFIT with different datasets and defi- nitions, therefore, leads to inconsistent conclusions about shape differences.
2taz | Practitioner Summary: To increase the effectiveness of body shape classification, research must appraise current systems through statistics. This paper demonstrates how current body defini- tions are too unspecific and exclude relevant body morphology for garment construction. Our paper suggests alternative anthropometrics and demographics for inclusion in a more advanced model.

r5il | Introduction
5gui | Despite garment construction practices ignoring cur- rent body shape classifications (Faust 2014), body shape underpins how ergonomists, practitioners, and researchers understand the human form. An increasing number of clothing ergonomics academics are embracing the Female Figure Identification Technique (FFIT) developed by Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan (2004a, 2004b). In using the FFIT, clothing ergonomics academics assume its suitability for scientific research,
82qc | including nationality-based body shape comparisons (Yim Lee et al. 2007; Robinet 2009), body shape based health estimations (Sarakon et al. 2017; 2016), and consumer's perceptions of their body's shape (Ridgway, Parsons, and Sohn 2017; Zhang et al. 2017). Body shape is also essential for online fashion retail's virtual fit/garment size prediction tools (Januszkiewicz et al. 2017). For these scientific and retail applications to be reliable, their underpinning body shape classifi- cation system must be indisputable. An indisputable

t8vv | system is when assessment categorises a person into the same shape every time. Consistent categorisation requires dependable definition with a system like FFIT, something which is problematic when the system and its definition need careful analysis to understand.
qvnu | Given FFIT's prevalence and influence within body shape research for apparel, researchers may assume Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan (2004a, 2004b) devel- oped a system that consistently defines body shape. The FFIT, developed using a TC2 body scanner, uses six girth measurements - bust, waist, hip, high-hip, stomach, and abdomen - which is an advance on more traditional 2 D width-based classifications. Width- based analysis was necessary in the FFIT development because of limitations of knowledge, but they made a clear advancement in circumferential definitions – relating shape more clearly to clothing; The FFIT then defines nine body shapes among American women (hourglass, bottom hourglass, top hourglass, spoon, rect- angle, diamond, oval, triangle, and inverted triangle; see Figure 1) which is again an advance on traditional sys- tems. The mathematical descriptors of body shapes that the FFIT proposed were based on logic: devel- oped from literature, experts' tacit knowledge in apparel design, and visual analysis of the segmental proportions in the female body's bust-to-hips zone - excluding the shoulder-to-bust zone. However, the FFIT only provides general guidelines on how a practi- tioner should take its six measurements. The practi- tioner also needs familiarity with the TC2 scanner because FFIT is grounded in the TC2 scanner's soft- ware definitions. Furthermore, practitioners need care- ful reading of FFIT's supporting texts to ensure consistency of measurements used. Those reporting on using FFIT apply common names for
kggw | measurements with multiple definitions (e.g. waist), potentially leading to significantly different measure- ments (Gill et al. 2014) and then different shapes.
xrd1 | Careful analysis of FFIT shows it uses measurement definitions different from those used in significant European body scanning surveys, particularly the United Kingdom (UK) National Sizing Survey: SizeUK (2002). The SizeUK survey is the UK's first national sur- vey of the population since the 1950s, capturing three-dimensional (3 D) shapes of the population, using the same 3D body scanners (TC2) as FFIT instead of tape measures. SizeUK's goal was to sup- port UK retailers to amend their size charts and pro- vide a data source for scientific research, including medical, health, transport, and product design. SizeUK provides a database of anthropometric measurements for industry's use, and it not a body shape classifica- tion system. Nevertheless, Size UK influences how industry understands human measurements and their placements. Ergonomists and researchers may com- bine SizeUK's measurement definitions with the FFIT's body classification process. Combining measurement definitions is clear in Yim Lee et al.'s (2007) work, showing brief consideration is given to consistency of measurement definition or capture device.
5746 | The FFIT defines the hip in TC2 software as the larg- est circumference in the crotch-to-waist region (Table 1). Size UK, in contrast, uses the buttock prom- inence (Seat) to define the hip. Both the FFIT and Size UK, however, use the nomenclature hip to classify their measurement. This highlights the complexities of using scanning technologies and varied measurement definitions, complicated further as some standards related to scanning ISO 20685 (ISO 2010a). The ISO Standards - 7250 (ISO 2010b) and 8559-1 (ISO 2017)
7toz | - provide foundational support for research compar- ing measurements. Nevertheless, ISO 7250 does not have a hip circumference definition. Without a hip cir- cumference definition, ISO 7250 has little applicability to the FFIT, and this paper, as the FFIT relies upon the hip.
j346 | While the FFIT and SizeUK use a 3 D Body scanning system by TC2 (TC2 2011), the lack of standardisation in methods meant three vital measurements were incompatible at the hip-girth, the waist, and the seat. Without standardisation of definition, the same tool leads to a practitioner taking a different measurement placement than the FFIT intended. SizeUK, however, uses TC2's seat measurement for its hip (see Table 1). TC2's seat measurement corresponds to the Hip defin- ition of International Organisation of Standardisation (ISO) 8559-1 (2017): the body's horizontal girth
v8uq | measured at the hip - the greatest projection at the body's back (buttocks or seat); see Figure 2.
x972 | The FFIT's waist measurement is set as Small of the Back (SOB) +6.35 cm (FFIT), while SizeUK situates the waist as SOB +4.0 cm (SizeUK). These slight differences are problematic as the narrowing of the female form towards the rib cage can locate a much smaller cir- cumference outside where a practitioner may desig- nate the waist region. Altering hip and waist measurement placement significantly changes the measurements' size (Gill and Parker 2017). Suppose a practitioner uses alternative definitions of measure- ments within an FFIT body classification exercise. In that case, the impact of different measurement place- ment on body shape classification is uncertain, yet potentially damaging to the FFIT's between-studies comparisons.
cwrw | Figure 2. Measurement Positions (A) and Hip Level under ISO 8559-1 (B).
4i0e | The FFIT's body shape classification's applicability to extensive anthropometric surveys, including SizeUK, is potentially low yet untested. Rejecting the FFIT based on poor applicability with the anthropometric surveys that influences how industry understands human measurements is radical. Meticulous examin- ation is, therefore, essential.
h2l3 | 3D Body Scanning - following accepted ISO stand- ards - takes measurements following different place- ment definitions than FFIT - loosely - dictates. Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan (2004a, 2004b) name the bust, waist, hip, stomach, and abdomen when developing FFIT, but omits replicable measurement defi- nitions. Sokolowski and Bettencourt (2020, 2) even state, ‘Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan did not provide detailed descriptions of where on the scan these meas- urements were taken'. Instead, Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan (2004a, 2004b) primarily used the measure- ments programmed into the TC2 (TC2 2011) anthropo- metric software - as their later work with Yim Lee (2007) describes. Unless a researcher seeking to use FFIT has the same TC2 software, they must choose measure- ment within the stated regions, as Figure 2 shows.
dfzb | The FFIT's definitions are potentially incompatible with the way 3 D Body Scanning's anthropometric software defines measurements as standard. This incompatibility may have serious consequences given the FFIT's common application to 3 D Body Scanning data. The FFIT used a hip measurement definition that allows the hip circumference to occur anywhere in a given zone (see Figure 2), including above the seat. Hips cannot, anatomically, occur above the seat. This may be why SizeUK used the Seat in place of the Hip. The standard 3 D body scanning posture requires par- ticipants to keep their feet at least 200 mm apart: 'standing position A' according to ISO 20685 (ISO 2010a). 3 D Body Scanners require standing position A
u6ty | (Figure 3) to identify crotch and thigh geometry more accurately.
awvu | Nevertheless, 'standing position A' has a problem. Its wide feet position causes the largest circumference between crotch and waist to move, occurring at a position different from the hip level defined in ISO 8559-1:2017 (Gill and Parker 2017). A person's measurements, therefore, change if the practitioner uses manual or 3D Body Scanning measure- ment methods.
on9b | Practitioners are placing measurements on different parts of the body by using different measurement methods. If the different measurement methods can place the same body into a different shape classifica- tion, the impact may be severe. Two surveys - both using the FFIT shape classification tool but using dif- ferent measurement methods - may reach conclusions about inter-group body shape differences that do not exist in reality. Researchers in these hypothetical stud- ies may assume they classify bodies in the same way. This is because FFIT is not explicit on where to place measurements. FFIT also relies on measurements exist- ing within zones (see Figure 2) instead of precise placements. Even the most meticulous practitioners may, therefore, be measuring bodies at different loca- tions without knowing it.
a8ge | If this is true, then the FFIT - or any research that utilises the FFIT - cannot be authoritative because of the FFIT's propensity for error caused by the effects of slight differences in measurement definitions. The published FFIT research does not, arguably, communi- cate the need for measurement definition standards to an adequate level. This is important because con- sistent results rely on practitioners applying consistent measurement definitions.
h27a | Additionally, the FFIT only classifies a person's lower-torso region instead of the entire body, despite
pdjh | Figure 3. Measurement Positions (A and B).
xmgs | research using the FFIT for this purpose. In defining the body, the FFIT only uses six circumferences in the region from the bust to the hip. The restricted body form consideration limits how the FFIT might inform pattern construction because it excludes measure- ments in the critical upper-body control zone/the shoulders' anchor area. Unlike earlier body classifica- tion systems - e.g. Rasband (1994) - the FFIT's shape sorting formulae excludes shoulder anthropometry. Shoulder measurement's exclusion is surprising as they are essential for clothing design and construction (Aldrich 2015; Beazley and Bond 2003). The FFIT's suit- ability for garment construction, and apparel related purposes, is unsubstantiated.
bd9h | FFIT defines the bust in line with ISO definitions. However, as Figure 2 shows, the waist and hip are defined as occurring within zones. Within these zones, measurements can fall into regions that they would not naturally occur within. For example, the hip can occur anywhere from the crotch to the waist, including above the seat. For all definitions, this can never be classified as the hip as the seat (a circumference at maximum buttock projection) should be the upper limit. Because FFIT omits clear measurement definitions, differently defined measurements sharing the same name are likely to be applied to the published shape calculations; as with Sokolowski and Bettencourt (2020).
m047 | While the FFIT may have specific measurements, these measurements are unavailable - and unreplica- ble - to the broader ergonomic field (Sokolowski and Bettencourt 2020). The measurement extract is spe- cific to TC2's Scanner software and hardware. As measurements are used interchangeably by name,
gy8c | two practitioners will likely use such alternative meas- urements - such as SizeUK - while attempting to rep- licate FFIT. Sokolowski and Bettencourt (2020) even modifies FFIT to address the underlying assumptions about measurement placement that cannot work on women over size 14. However, these placement assumptions are invisible to third-party practitioners who do not run studies 'hacking' the algorithm. If using alternative measurements reclassifies bodies into different shapes, then FFIT is unauthoritative out- side of its original application because of unreplicable measurement definitions. In such a situation, ergono- mists who attempt to use the FFIT system in their work may not, therefore, be able to compare their work to others - but they are unaware of these underlying issues.
y4mj | We aim to assess the FFIT's suitability as a body classification system for scientific research and gar- ment construction purposes, considering how slight changes in measurement definitions may affect shape classifications. We use FFIT as the case by which to explore how body shape systems may provide unreli- able when used more broadly than specified systems and measurements extractions. In pursuing this aim, we consider the following hypotheses:
