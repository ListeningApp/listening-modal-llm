        "content": "hvhm | War and Political Violence in\n863b | Twentieth-Century Europe\nfj24 | The last volume of the so-called 'New' - meanwhile fairly old - Cambridge Modern History, published in nineteen-sixty, covered the years eighteen-ninety-eight to nineteen forty-five. It was entitled 'The Era of Violence'. The title was dropped for the second edition, which appeared eight years later, and replaced by 'The Shifting Balance of World Forces'. The editor of the revised edition, C. L. Mowat, thought that 'the era of violence' was appropriate for the earlier version, reflecting as it did the understandable 'spirit of the nineteen-fifties'. But by the late nineteen-sixties this emphasis had changed. In his introduction to the new edition Professor Mowat remarked that 'As he surveys the twenty years or more since nineteen forty-five, . .. the historian may feel that violence has not been the main characteristic of this century'. Despite nuclear weapons, Mowat looked optimistically from the vantage point of nineteen sixty-eight to a future greatly improved through advances in science and technology, to which world politics would positively respond. He saw a world 'increasingly bound together by common problems, common aspirations, and the world-wide effects of ever larger advances in science', concluding that 'though public war and private violence still rage, the historian is less likely to see violence as the mark of the age'.\nuz3c | Even if our view is narrowed to Europe, Bosnia and Kosovo prompt us to pause at such a statement. And the merest glance at the wider world, not least events very close to our own time, might make us even more sceptical. Even so, and however pessimistically we look back on world history in recent decades, it is plain that the ultra-violence that characterised the first half of the century had no equivalent in the second half, though the later decades could still witness the horrific episodes of violence in, for example, the Chinese Cultural Revolution, Khmer Rouge Cambodia or Rwanda. This first half of the century - or, more precisely, the years nineteen fourteen to nineteen fifty that spanned the period from the beginning of the First World War to the end of\nd5bi | the Second World War, embracing also its immediate aftermath, when high levels of violence against civilian populations with the resulting misery of millions continued - has indeed claim, more surely than any other period in history, to be labelled 'the era of violence'. That is to say: in these four decades of the twentieth century, violence had epochal character; it determined the age.\nba4l | A number of questions come immediately to mind. A first is obvious: what caused such an earth-shattering explosion of immense, state-sponsored violence in the first half of the twentieth century? Nothing in the previous decades had prepared the world for what was to come. The First World War is obviously a major part of the answer. But it it is unlikely to have been the only cause. Epochal forces in history do not usually have just short-term causes. And this, surely, was no exception.\nffx8 | Another question relates to the propensity of states and the societies they claimed to represent to violence. If we understand the politics of violence in a wide sense - as violence stimulated by political motives or intentions, within, between, by or against states - or even if we speak more narrowly (though widely enough) of state violence against civilian populations involving physical repression in all its manifestations, then it becomes immediately obvious that, looked at comparatively, nation-states and the political systems that operated within them can be placed in a spectrum running from those presiding over very low levels to those where the levels soared into the stratosphere. Why, to take the question this prompts, were states more - or less - prone to use of extreme violence?\ns6su | The answer to this question might help with a third. Since, arguably, every century (or even half-century) throughout history has been violent in greater or lesser measure, is it merely the scale of violence, made possible by new technologies of destruction, that singles out the twentieth century? Or was there something qualitatively different, essentially modern, about this violence?\ny219 | Returning to Mowat for a moment, and accepting that the second half of the twentieth century - at least in Europe - was immeasurably less violent than the first half, we face the obvious question: why was this the case? Eric Hobsbawm, whose vision in his Age of Extremes was nothing if not global, spoke of an 'Age of Catastrophe' spanning the world wars followed by the 'Golden Age' that ran up to the oil crisis of the nineteen-seventies. Even the onset after that time of new, structural crises, causing great instability and disturbance, did not, Hobsbawm points out, usher in a new 'age of catastrophe'. But Hobsbawm's brilliant book ends in nineteen ninety and therefore takes no account of the upsurge of violence that began in the nineteen-nineties - and still continues. Does this renewed violence, if not so extreme as the period of what Arno Mayer called the 'Thirty Years War of the Twentieth Century', mean that, after all, we should see violence as a hallmark of the whole of the twentieth century, perhaps of modernity itself, and not just of a more limited period?\n06ht | In what follows I hope to offer some hints of my own highly tentative and superficial answers, though these amount in essence to little more than thinking aloud - often about areas where my knowledge is scant, to say the best - and voicing my reflections on the questions which, I think, are of some importance to understanding the century just gone and the world we live in at present.\nv3r2 | Before addressing the questions, however, let us remind ourselves - leaving aside for the moment qualitative differences - of the sheer scale of the violence, that is the quantitative difference with what had gone before, in the 'era of violence'. Raw statistics tell nothing, of course, of the death, pain and misery of the millions who suffered so grievously through the violence. They shock, nevertheless. Take first the deaths from war - the most extreme form of inter-state violence. In Europe, the century between the Congress of Vienna in eighteen fifteen and the First World War in nineteen fourteen was probably the most peaceful - that is, war-free - of any hundred-year period to that time. The Crimean War of eighteen fifty-four to six, leaving some four hundred thousand dead, and the Franco-Prussian War of eighteen seventy to one, when one hundred eighty-four thousand lives were lost, were the most violent European conflicts of that era. In the First World War, the dead totalled more than eight million military casualties and perhaps, according to some estimates, a further five million civilians (mainly on the eastern front, though including victims of famine in Poland and probably of the continued bitter fighting in eastern Europe after the Armistice); in the Second World War, forty million military and civilian deaths would be a minimal estimate. Beyond these figures are those of the refugees forced from hearth and homeland: four to five million in nineteen eighteen to twenty-two, as many as forty million 'displaced persons' between nineteen forty-five and nineteen fifty. A good number were driven out or deported. Others fled from repression, terror, ethnic cleansing and genocide. How many were affected by ethnic cleansing in this period (even if the horrible phrase was not then in circulation) is not known with any precision. Some estimates of the numbers affected worldwide by ethnic cleansing across the twentieth century put the figure at anywhere between sixty and one hundred twenty million.\nnv42 | Another statistic is worth bearing in mind. Whereas the civilian dead in the First World War formed on the highest estimate just over a third of the victims, in the Second a conservative ratio is around two-thirds - from a maximum of five up to some twenty-seven millions. This huge increase was not just a reflection of the new technology of mass killing - for instance, through area bombing. It is an indicator, too, that war",
