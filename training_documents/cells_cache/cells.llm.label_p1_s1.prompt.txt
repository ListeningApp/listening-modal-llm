You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1wj6 | Flow-induced reprogramming of endothelial cells in atherosclerosis
936l | 1,2,3
06yq | Abstract
dpv6 | Atherosclerotic diseases such as myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and peripheral artery disease continue to be leading causes of death worldwide despite the success of treatments with cholesterol-lowering drugs and drug-eluting stents, raising the need to identify additional therapeutic targets. Interestingly, atherosclerosis preferentially devel- ops in curved and branching arterial regions, where endothelial cells are exposed to disturbed blood flow with characteristic low-magnitude oscillatory shear stress. By contrast, straight arterial regions exposed to stable flow, which is associated with high-magnitude, unidirectional shear stress, are relatively well protected from the disease through shear- dependent, atheroprotective endothelial cell responses. Flow potently regulates structural, functional, transcriptomic, epigenomic and metabolic changes in endothelial cells through mechanosensors and mechanosignal transduction pathways. A study using single-cell RNA sequencing and chromatin accessibility analysis in a mouse model of flow-induced atherosclerosis demonstrated that disturbed flow reprogrammes arterial endothelial cells in situ from healthy pheno- types to diseased ones characterized by endothelial inflammation, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, endothelial-to-immune cell-like transition and metabolic changes. In this Review, we discuss this emerging concept of disturbed-flow-induced reprogramming of endothelial cells (FIRE) as a potential pro-atherogenic mechanism. Defining the flow-induced mechanisms through which endothelial cells are reprogrammed to promote atherosclerosis is a crucial area of research that could lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets to combat the high prevalence of atherosclerotic disease.

r5il | Introduction
5gui | Atherosclerosis is a multifactorial and chronic inflammatory disease of the arteries, in which fibrofatty plaques develop in the arterial wall1. As advanced plaques develop, the arterial wall stiffens, the arterial lumen narrows and, occasionally, plaques rupture or are eroded, result- ing in severe clinical consequences, including myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and peripheral artery disease, which are the leading causes of death worldwide2.
82qc | Dysfunction and inflammation of endothelial cells have a crucial role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis3. Endothelial cells lining the inner layer of the blood vessels are in direct contact with the blood and become dysfunctional and inflamed in response to various risk factors, such as hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes mellitus, hyper- tension, smoking and ageing, especially at specific atherosclerosis- prone regions associated with disturbed blood flow. At these sites of endothelial inflammation, circulating monocytes bind to endothelial cells and transmigrate into the subendothelial space, differentiating into macrophages. These regions also show increased permeability to circu- lating LDL cholesterol, which becomes oxidized in the subendothelial space and is ingested by nearby macrophages, thereby promoting foam cell development and triggering a vicious cycle of inflammation and macrophage accumulation1. In addition, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in these regions transdifferentiate into synthetic phenotypes and migrate to the subendothelial layer and proliferate, contributing to arterial wall thickening4. In addition, some VSMCs transdifferentiate into foam cells5, eventually leading to the formation of fatty streaks and fibrofatty plaques (Fig. 1a). As atherosclerotic plaques grow outwardly and inwardly, mature and progress, some plaques rupture, causing major cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke 5,6.

t8vv | preferentially develop in a focal manner in curved and branching regions of the arteries associated with disturbed blood flow7. Disturbed flow in these regions is characterized by the delivery of low-magnitude oscillatory shear stress (OSS) to the endothelial cell surface7-9. Endothe- lial cells detect various shear stress patterns and magnitudes through mechanosensing receptors (mechanosensors), which translate these mechanical cues into cell signalling (mechanosignal transduction) and subsequent structural and functional responses10. Advanced omics analyses have demonstrated that flow potently regulates nearly all facets of endothelial cell biology and pathobiology, from individual molecules and genes to structures and functions of the entire cell. Flow regulates endothelial cell transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes at a genome-wide scale in vivo and in vitro, altering endothelial cell func- tion, proliferation, survival and differentiation. Whereas stable blood flow, with the characteristic high-magnitude, unidirectional laminar shear stress (ULS) observed in straight, non-branching regions of the vasculature, promotes atheroprotective endothelial cell homeostasis, disturbed flow promotes pro-atherogenic endothelial cell responses, including endothelial dysfunction.
qvnu | Although lipid-lowering drugs such as statins and PCSK9 inhibi- tors are highly efficient in reducing blood cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease burden11, atherosclerotic diseases continue to be leading causes of death worldwide, highlighting the need for novel anti-atherogenic drugs targeting non-lipid, pro-atherogenic pathways. In this context, the CANTOS trial12 demonstrated that inhibi- tion of vascular inflammation using the IL-1ß inhibitor canakinumab significantly reduced atherothrombotic events in patients with previ- ous myocardial infarction compared with placebo, in a cholesterol- independent manner. Although canakinumab was not approved by the FDA owing to an increase in fatal infections with canakinumab treatment in the trial, the findings demonstrated that targeting an inflammatory pathway could be a novel and effective anti-atherogenic therapy. Similarly, genes, proteins and pathways regulated by flow (flow-sensitive) that control pro-atherogenic endothelial cell dysfunc- tion and inflammation could be promising novel therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis. To this end, in this Review, we discuss the current literature on flow-sensitive genes, proteins and pathways, including the emerging concept of disturbed-flow-induced reprogramming of endothelial cells (FIRE), involved in endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis.

xrd1 | Vascular haemodynamics
5746 | The vascular endothelium is in direct contact with the blood in the arterial lumen and forms a protective barrier between the blood and the outer vascular wall13,14. The vascular endothelium is constantly exposed to haemodynamic forces: normal (transmural) stress and circumferential stress in the arterial wall resulting from blood pressure, and tangential shear stress on the endothelial surface due to blood flow (Fig. 1b). Whereas transmural pressure and circumferential stress in the vessel wall mainly affect and regulate medial VSMCs, fluid shear stress mostly affects endothelial cells, potently regulating their function 13-16

In straight, non-branching regions of human arteries, viscous forces of blood flow predominate over inertial forces, leading to stable, unidirectional laminar flow, which delivers high-magnitude ULS (-15 dyn/cm2) to endothelial cells13,16. Conversely, in curved and branching regions, inertial forces become more promi- nent, leading to disturbed, multidirectional oscillatory flow that deliv- ers low-magnitude OSS (approximately ±4 dyn/cm2) to the endothelial cell surface14,17 (Fig. 1d). The terms 'stable flow' and 'disturbed flow' are typically used in in vivo studies, whereas most in vitro studies use ULS and OSS to describe the experimental flow conditions to which endothelial cells are exposed. To reduce potential confusion and sim- plify these interchangeable terms, we use stable flow or disturbed flow in this Review, whenever feasible.

dfzb | The clinical significance of blood flow is that atherosclerosis pref- erentially develops in curved or branching vascular regions exposed to disturbed flow conditions in the presence of additional risk factors such as hypercholesterolaemia and diabetes. For example, athero- sclerotic plaques form preferentially in the lateral wall of the internal carotid artery at the carotid bifurcation, the lesser curvature of the aortic arch, and the proximal portion of the left anterior descending coronary artery18,19.

Studies using the partial carotid ligation (PCL) and the shear stress-modifying constrictive carotid cuff mouse models directly demonstrated the effect of disturbed flow, or low flow, on atherosclerosis development20,21. In the PCL model, three of the four caudal branches of the left common carotid artery (LCA) are surgically ligated without manipulating the LCA itself. The PCL surgery induces disturbed flow in the LCA with characteristic low-magnitude OSS patterns (Fig. 2a). In Apoe / mice or C57BL/6 mice overexpressing PCSK9 fed a high-fat diet to induce hypercholesterolaemia, the PCL sur- gery causes rapid development of atherosclerosis in the entire length

The external carotid artery (ECA), occipital artery (OA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) are surgically ligated (black lines) to induce disturbed flow in the left carotid artery (LCA), which promotes atherosclerosis development in the LCA in hypercholesterolaemic conditions, such as in Apoe / mice fed a high-fat diet (central panel)20,143 and mice with adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated PCSK9 overexpression fed a high-fat diet (right image, middle-right and bottom panels; shown by oil-Red-O staining)22. By contrast, even in hypercholesterolaemic conditions, the right carotid artery (RCA), which is exposed to stable flow, does not develop atherosclerosis (right image, middle-left panel). Mice without AAV-PCSK9- induced hypercholesterolaemia do not develop atherosclerotic plaques in the RCA or the ligated LCA (right image, top panels). b, Schematic representation of the shear-modifying constrictive cuff model.

Importantly, in this mouse model, the contralateral right carotid artery (RCA) continues to be exposed to stable flow and does not develop atherosclerotic plaques, serving as an ideal control in the same animal20,22,23 (Fig. 2a). The constrictive carotid cuff model involves the implantation of a shear stress-modifying cast over a portion of the RCA (Fig. 2b), which exposes that portion of the RCA to three different shear stress regimes that translate into atherosclerosis-inducing patterns in hypercholesterolaemic Apoe-/- mice fed a Western diet: low-magnitude, stable flow in the region proximal to the cast, which induces the development of vulnerable
