To avoid confusion, it is worth noting here, that Rumpet provides an excellent description of another sea-east Asian fishery for \"red\" jellyfish, but it is unlikely that this is C. mastigophora. Rumpet's report from the South China Sea almost certainly refers to Rhopilema esculentum based on the description of fisheries for this species and Rhopilema hispidum elsewhere in the South China Sea by Nishikawa\nzlxc | et al. The economic feasibility of a fishery for C. mastigophora has not been evaluated in Australia and maybe worthy of examination especially if swarms continue to have detrimental economic impacts.\nk0bw | Bivalve larvae, pteropods and invertebrate eggs dominated the prey items we found on C. mastigophora arms and twenty-six percent of all observed prey items were bivalve larvae. Nothing is known of the feeding rates of C. mastigophora; however, at the population sizes we recorded the potential for them to deplete plankton from the water column must be considered. Some jellyfish species feed predominantly and selectively on bivalve mollusk larvae including other rhizostome jellyfish. For example, Larson found very high feeding rates by Stomolophus meleagris on oyster larvae which made up fifty-six percent of prey items and Ballard and Myers found bivalve larvae made up more than eighty percent of the diet of Proboscidactyla stellata. In the southern Kimberley region where we observed significant swarms in two thousand six, two thousand ten, two thousand eleven, and two thousand twelve, the silver lipped pearl oyster Pinctada maxima forms the basis of Australia's pearl industry valued at one hundred twenty million Australian dollars per year. P. maxima spawn in the spring beginning in September when the peak spawning occurs although the spawning season can extend through to April. The peak spawning period coincides with the same period that C. mastigophora swarms have occurred near Broome and Eighty Mile Beach which is the most important area for pearl oyster broodstock in north-western Australia, meaning that when they are dense, C. mastigophora might be a significant predator of pearl oyster larvae. Condie et al. showed how tidal currents dominate pearl oyster larval transport in the Eighty Mile Beach region meaning larvae are retained in the area. This would make them vulnerable to large swarms of C. mastigophora which would be subject to the same transport patterns. Larson measured the feeding rate of the closely related S. meleagris and found a three hundred twenty-five gram jellyfish would consume six thousand prey items per day over half of which were oyster larvae. Based on these feeding rates, the population numbers of C. mastigophora estimated in this study could consume upwards of three hundred billion oyster larvae per day. It is important that a more in-depth study of the diet and feeding rate of C. mastigophora be\naq5a | undertaken to determine its significance as a predator of P. maxima and other bivalve larvae as our data on diet represent just a snapshot in time.\nsc5y | Studies on the planktonic system are also required to determine the relative abundance of oyster larvae and other plankton in the water column as well as in the diet of C. mastigophora. The low C to N ratio, three point nine to one, and carbon thirteen of C. mastigophora tissue indicate a dependence on marine derived sources of carbon in its diet. The C to N ratio is similar to that found in other jellyfish: four to one and three point one to four point two to one. The carbon thirteen and nitrogen fifteen isotopic signatures of C. mastigophora are similar to that recorded for another catostylid jellyfish Catostylus mosaicus, carbon thirteen equals negative twenty point nine to negative twenty-two point two and a rhizostome jellyfish carbon thirteen equals negative twenty-two to negative seventeen point four, nitrogen fifteen equals four point eight to ten point six but lower than in Pelagia noctiluca. Pitt et al. found that copepods and mysids were the most important components of the diet of C. mosaicus based on comparative analysis of jellyfish and prey item stable isotope values. The use of stable isotopes can be used to infer the importance of particular food sources integrated over time as opposed to a snapshot in time in the case of prey items sampled from jellyfish arms. However, we can conclude little about the importance of different components of the diet of C. mastigophora over the longer term given we lack stable isotope data for the prey items we found and the difficulties interpreting diet from jellyfish tissue isotopic signatures without adequate temporal, spatial, ontogenetic and between organ sampling.\n```",
