But the caricature need not always establish complete differentiation. Depending on its design, it may work selectively to problematize some features of the 'other', while indirectly leaving other features intact. Consider the following excerpt.\nu2ob | Excerpt five\n2gnm | Participants: M: Moderator, D: Don, H: Hal, A: Andi\nemgw | One M: okay listen (.) so is it that the girls think that the guys are only looking for looks and =\nxaqt | Three D: =depends on the guy (.) cause [some ( )]\n5rcb | Five M: is that a common thing [some guys] just look for looks\n524j | Four A:\nxd3m | Seven M very common (one point zero) so you think you all are different from these guys\n8qb6 | Nine ((all three boys nod))\nwkbn | Ten M you think so huh (.) Hal (.) you too\nftfg | H: yeah (.) those guys annoy me actually (.) like the guys that are all OHH she has such a nice butt (.) OH: I like it so: much ((laughter, one point zero))\n7xi5 | Thirteen M: now are these also kids in your group\nw8r5 | Fourteen D: yeah (.) like we say: that (.) like but if we really wanna go out with em' (.) fifteen we like just say Ä®hey you have a nice ass' (.) just say that and like (.) but sixteen DON'T be like THEY: I WANNA GO OUT ((laughter, one point zero))\nybik | The moderator's extreme case formulation of 'only' in line one marks the activity of the category 'guys' as extreme. Don undermines the extreme claim with a contrastive counter ('depends on the guy' in line three) that works to open the landscape of possible masculine positions. They agree with the moderator in admitting that looking 'just for looks' is a common thing, but they all deny being like these kinds of guys (marked in line eight). By adopting a minority position, the boys are able to differentiate themselves from one feature of normative masculinity - looking just for looks. When the moderator asks Hal if he is different, he agrees and then upgrades the difference to being an 'annoying' difference (line ten). Hal's tag of 'actually' at the end of the assessment indexes his position as 'literal' or 'truthful', and in so doing, orients to the moderator's question as a potential challenge. Again, it positions the moderator as potentially misunderstanding and his question as incorrectly assuming that Hal is not different.\ngii5 | Hal continues in lines eleven to twelve to offer the first caricature of these annoying boys, imitating the exaggerated and pronounced way in which these other boys fawn over girls' bodies, particularly with the way they are so obvious and forthcoming about it. The caricature parodies an 'obsession-style' discourse of transparent infatuation with 'butts'. What appears to be annoying to Hal is their extreme gawking, as indexed through the way he emphasizes the emphatic 'Oh's' and desire terms ('like it so ::: much'). When challenged by the moderator (twelve) as to whether they nevertheless affiliate with these types of boys, Don concedes that there are similarities in terms of the content of what they say ('like we say :: that'). But Don clarifies that there are differences, and that those differences are salient when they 'really want to go out with them' (line fourteen). Like the use of Hal's 'actually' (line eleven), Don's use of the 'really' positions him as serious or truthful, and by extension, suggests that there are other times in which he is not 'really' being forthright. The 'really' indexes these other times, times when they are perhaps 'just playing around' (as in Excerpt one). As such, there\nq5eu | appears to be a dichotomy between being into looks in a 'real' or serious way and being into them in a less than 'real' or serious way. This dichotomy is treated by Don as the relevant context for differentiating themselves from these 'other' boys.\na7ao | Don goes on to offer a second caricature (lines fourteen to fifteen). He works to show how they would tell a girl she has a 'nice ass' if they were serious about going out with her. The caricature differentiates a rather calm and unassuming approach, marked with the case softener 'just' and lack of prosody in 'just say hey you have a nice ass' (line fifteen) with an exaggerated and emphatic approach ('HEY ::: I WANNA GO OUT'), which is reminiscent of the way Hal stylizes his caricature in lines eleven to twelve. The latter approach is not only loud and demanding, but arguably desperate sounding. What we have, then, is a more qualified idea of what the caricature is and is not differentiating. What is different about these 'other' guys is not necessarily that they are into looks while Don and Hal are not. The difference lies in the way their interest is conveyed.\n29a3 | Hal's and Don's caricatures position the 'other' boys as being over the top, obvious, loud, and seemingly desperate in the way they are interested in girls' looks. In contrast, Hal and Don are more nonchalant, even-tempered and seemingly confident in the way they go about orientating to girls' looks. The boys are not interested in resisting a normative male preoccupation with girls' looks because there is something in principle wrong with such a preoccupation. They are simply resisting overt displays of obvious and desperate infatuation with girls' looks in order to appear calm and confident when asking a girl out. Although this type of differentiation may seem instrumental or shallow, it is arguably part of the doing of maturity for them. While we would not want to argue that they are necessarily 'resolving' developmental tasks or that they are doing anything to thwart 'hegemonic masculinity' per se, we would argue that they are working to manage those aspects of 'heterosexual attraction' and 'desire' that, from their perspectives, need to be negotiated in order to successfully appear mature.\nsb1e | Discussion\nw2yn | The aim of this article has been to offer a contextually sensitive analysis of several discursive methods used by adolescent males to present themselves as both mature and heterosexual while discussing their interest in girls' looks and physical attraction. It is our belief that a discursive methodology is essential for examining how such interests get brought off and situated rather seamlessly in the midst of questions and implicit challenges. Our goal has been to focus on the interactional subtleties and rhetorical finessing in the boys' management of such questions and challenges. We see such rhetorical finessing as illustrative of the 'developmental imperative'; that is, as ways of negotiating adolescent-appropriate forms of maturity. As such, we do not work from the assumption that their gendered identities arrive on the discursive scene pre-packaged, as more or less mature, such that the boys simply report their attitudes in the kind of straightforward way that they would on a scale or inventory. The value of a discursive analysis is that it reveals that it is precisely the sensitive orientations, and the work done to pre-empt and deflect possible counters to the hearable trouble in such orientations, that matter most for the boys as they work to position themselves as mature within the larger context of displaying their adolescent and heterosexual identities.\nap6l | There are several consequences to investigating maturity this way. First, it allows developmental researchers to move beyond survey or questionnaire approaches to adolescent male sexuality that catalogue problem attitudes and behaviours that are\n```",
