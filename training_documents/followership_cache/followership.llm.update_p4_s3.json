It offered me and a number of organizations a way to think about the type of behavior that led to all the negative stereotypes, as well as to conceive of the positive followership that rarely got mentioned. In my work, I try not to ignore reality or feedback. Rather than pretend that the negative stereotypes did not exist and come up with some idealized follower that the world should embrace, I wanted to explore the full reality of how people follow. Are people stuck in followership styles? Is a person's style static or dynamic? Once you are a pragmatic, are you always a pragmatic? Or do people's styles change depending on the leader they have or the job they find themselves in? Can a person be a star follower in one situation and an alienated follower in another situation? Why do people adopt a particular style? Why would someone end up as a pragmatic follower? What conditions might lead to that? Are there ways to help people move toward a chosen style?\nqy1i | This model, in my experience, tends to be very powerful for people, having a lot of face validity as well as some statistical validity. For example, when my colleagues and I teach a weeklong leadership program at Carnegie Mellon University,\n1k9e | The Art of Followership\n5bjs | I am no longer surprised that the overwhelming response from the participants about what opened their eyes the most, the thing that got them the most excited, is the followership model. So I continue to use it.\nuodj | RETHINKING FOLLOWERSHIP\nk16v | As I look forward for the field of followership, my thoughts swirl around the following seven topics:\nb2lm | One. World events\nti7f | Two. Culture\noksu | Three. Leader(ship)\nwtow | Four. Follower qualities\no22k | Five. Role of the follower\nnwfz | Six. Language of followership\nnvfy | Seven. Courageous conscience\nmror | In some of these areas, I think followership should be playing a more important role than it is. In other areas, I see research opportunities for all the scholars involved in the field.\nzlxc | World Events\nk0bw | One of the things I'm concerned about is that we scholars have gotten too \"micro\" and too \"parochial\" when discussing followership. We overly examine the follower-leader interaction on the small stage of college student life or coach-player dramas. Can followership help us unravel the big issues happening in the world, issues that affect many people's lives-suicide bombers; the rise of religious fundamentalism and its corresponding lack of tolerance; democratically elected dictators and corrupt government officials of any kind who harm their followers and the larger society; or corporate abuses of power that cheat employees, customers, suppliers, investors, and in some cases the larger society?\naq5a | For example, the increase in suicide bombings and in the types of suicide bombers (for example, more women, more middle-class people, more professionals) has much of society searching for an explanation. If we take a psychological approach, we might look for answers in the bombers' needs for power, revenge,\nsc5y | Rethinking Followership\n0yab | or the promise of heaven. We might also see it from an economic vantage point in that the bombers are guaranteed the economic well-being of their families in return for their acts. Or we could search for sociological root causes, such as poverty, unemployment, or societal disenfranchisement. Each of these inquiries might yield some valuable insights.\nw95z | My question is, Why are we not making a followership inquiry into the issue of suicide bombers? Surely followership plays a role and might offer more powerful insights into the phenomenon. What kind of followers are suicide bombers? Are they sheep, pragmatics, or star followers? What motivates their followership? Are they disciples, dreamers, or something else? What human needs are at work? Can the world \"afford\" this type of followership? Would more \"enlightened\" followership reduce the occurrence of and damage done by this behavior (or any of the others that I mentioned earlier)? How can any of the scholarly work on followership help us answer these questions? How do we unlock the practical applications of our knowledge about followership? It seems to me that followership could help us address these world events equally as well as leadership can.\n0i1k | Culture\ndqlg | Culture affects people's belief systems and behaviors. So do we need to consider the cultural aspects of followership? If you were raised in Japan, are you going to think about followership and carry out the role differently than if you were raised in the United States or Kenya? In terms of religion, if you were brought up in the Judaic tradition, you arrive at truth by questioning. That is a very different approach than that of evangelical fundamentalists, who are supposed to accept on faith. These perspectives will likely produce different approaches to followership, and it would help if we understood these differences. In our suicide bomber example, how does culture affect followership? Which factors (for example, country of origin, ethnic identity, or religious background) affect culture the most, and how do these factors play a role in a suicide bomber's followership behavior?\np6pq | Followership is also influenced at the subcultural level. Consider how followership varies between civilian employees versus those in the military, members of tribes versus urban residents, or prison inmates versus members of middle-class society. This is just a starter list that can energize our inquiries.\nzse6 | Do some cultures produce more yes-people or star followers? If so, then why? Do cultures characterize followership differently, thus producing different\np2n3 | The Art of Followership\nohh7 | followership styles and behaviors that are not generalizable across cultures? Or are there universal followership styles, motivations, and role performance?\nvbni | We can take this a step further and look at followership during cultural clashes. When a culture that advocates free speech and a free press produces a political cartoon that is viewed as insulting by another culture, how does followership play out? What drives followers in the offended group to start rioting and harming members of the free speech culture? What makes the followers in the free speech culture surprised by this retaliation, but not retaliate in return?\ndgcw | Leader(ship)\ngvwz | Traditionally, we have viewed the world from a leadership-centric vantage point. We have assumed that all other factors, including followership, are secondary to leadership. When followers have been surveyed, it was to determine their views of the leaders. But what if we turned all this around? What if we put followership center stage and asked all the same questions, but only in reference to the followers instead of leaders? For example, when we talk about leader-follower distance, we always talk about the follower's distance from the leader, but we should also talk about the leader's distance from the follower. Likewise, what are the interactions between leaders and followers from the follower's point of view? We tend to think of leaders as the proactive \"cause\" and followership as the reactive \"effect.\" But what if the opposite were true? Are leadership attitudes, behavior, and performance more a result of followership than the other way around? For example, do sheep produce a particular style of leadership, regardless of the leader's personality or predisposition? Is it this turn of events that leads to a particular outcome?\n```",
