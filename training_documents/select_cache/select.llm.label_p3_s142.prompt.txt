You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

gy8c | Although the selectivity of forming allenyl imidamides is good, the formation of alkyne isomer could not be suppressed in many cases. At this juncture, we surmised that trapping the ketenimine intermediate with alcohols may have different product distributions.50,51 Indeed, under identical conditions except for the replacement of i-Pr2NH (1.2 equiv) with MeOH (10 equiv) and Et3N (2 equiv), the reaction of 1,3-diynes selectively provided 2,3-dienyl imidates without a vestige of the alkyne isomer (Table 2). The lower stoichiometry of methanol
y4mj | Table 2. Synthesis of Allenyl Imidates by Trapping with Methanol
vpgq | led to the lower efficiency of the reaction. Alkyl and alkenyl diynes, which provided a mixture of allenyl and alkynyl imidamides previously, selectively generated allenyl imidates (3ae, 3ce, and 3de) in moderate to good yield (entries 1-3, respectively). Even though 1,3-diyne 1g containing a free secondary alcohol led to decomposition (entry 4), the corresponding <LATEX>\begin{array}{} { \text { ding acyl- } } \\ { 1 , 3 - \text { divec } } \end{array} ,</LATEX> benzyl-, and tert-butyldimethylsilyl- protected provided 2,3-dienyl imidates (3he, 3he', and 3he", respectively) in good yield (entries 5-7, respectively). Similarly, 1,3-diyne with benzyl-protected secondary alcohol 1i delivered 2,3-dienyl imidate 3ie in 72% yield.
ousl | Subsequently, we observed that under standard conditions, 1,3-diynes 4 containing an an acetoxy or benzoyloxy substituent at the propargylic position provided mono-, di-, and trisubstituted [3]cumulenes (Table 3).52-56 For example, 1,3-diynes 4a-4c afforded trisubstituted cumulenes 5a-5c, respectively, in 76-80% yields (entries 1-3, respectively). 1,3- Diynes substituted with a cycloalkyl moiety afforded the corresponding cumulenes 5d-5f in good yields (entries 4-6, respectively). Unexpectedly, while the acetate derivative of tertiary alcohol was afforded, the corresponding primary and secondary acetates provide a mixture of the expected [3]cumulenes and the corresponding acetoxy allene deriva- tives. However, upon replacement of the acetate with <LATEX>p -</LATEX> nitrobenzoate (4g-4i), only cumulenes 5g-5i were obtained (entries 7-9, respectively). We believe this is the consequence of the better leaving group capacity of a benzoate compared to that of an acetate. [3]Cumulenes make up a special class of polyene organic compounds whose synthetic utilities have been little explored.7-60 Thus, the current mild protocol to allow the preparation of [3]cumulenes containing various

wzno | We envision that with a suitably tethered nucleophile, the conversion of 1,3-diynes to the corresponding conjugated allenyl imidamide and imidates would promote an intra- molecular Michael-type addition (Table 4).61-65 Under

iwn5 | standard conditions, homopropargyl alcohol-containing 1,3- diynes 6a and 6b were smoothly converted to tetrahydrofur- anylidene imidates 7a and 7b in 48% and 87% yields, respectively (entries 1 and 2, respectively). The corresponding homopropargyl sulfonamide 6c led to 1-tosylpyrrolidinylidene imidamide 7c in 72% yield (entry 3); however, the formation of a six-membered ring 7d from 6d failed (entry 4). 1,3-Diynes 6e and 6f substituted with a phenyl group containing an o-OH or NH2 participated in the cascade reaction to generate benzofuranyl imidamide 7e in 70% yield and indolyl imidamide 7f in 64% yield (entries 5 and 6, respectively).

However, because of the thermodynamic preference for 2-alkynyl isomers, we surmised that the isomerization of 2 or 3 to 8 would happen if a base stronger than secondary amines is used (Scheme 4).00 Indeed, treating a

lq35 | mixture of 2 and 3 with DBU (0.1 equiv) rapidly induced isomerization to provide 2-alkynyl imidamides 8a-8d. On the contrary, phenyl- and silyl-substituted 3-alkynyl imidiamides 2 and 3 did not isomerize to the corresponding 2-alkynyl isomers 8e and 8f, respectively.
3g9w | In conclusion, we have developed efficient protocols to generate discrete isomers of 2-alkynyl, 3-alkynyl, 2,3-dienyl, and 2,3,4-trienyl imidamides and imidates from copper- catalyzed reactions of 1,3-diynes and tosylazide. The selectivity between 3-alkynyl and 2,3-dienyl imidamides could be controlled by a heteroatom substituent at the propargylic position of the 1,3-diynes and employing different trapping reagents such as amines and alcohols. [3]Cumulene derivatives were also generated by employing 1,3-diynes that contain an acetoxy or bezoyloxy substituent at the propargylic position. While trapping of the putative azacumulene intermediates with amines provided either 3-alkynyl or 2,3-dienyl imidamides depending on the structure of the trapping amines, trapping with methanol selectively generated 2,3-dienyl imidates. It was found that both 3-alkynyl and 2,3-dienyl imidamides could be isomerized to selectively generate the corresponding 2-alkynyl isomers under equilibrating conditions with a stronger base such as DBU. Intramolecular trapping of the putative azacumulene intermediates provided five-membered hetero- cyclic products if the 1,3-diyne substrates contained a homopropargylic hydroxyl or amino substituent. A unique feature of these unprecedented reactions is that under mild reaction conditions, terminal 1,3-diynes could be selectively converted to different unsaturated carboxylic acid derivatives with good selectivity.
