Yet, several other philosophical perspectives on extinction and contributions from outside of the fields of moral philosophy and the philosophy of biology also provide insights that are pertinent for thinking about the ethics of extinction that complement and enrich some of the discussions considered throughout this article. For example, there is a vibrant sub-debate in the conservation literature according to which ethical concepts and values should be supplemented or replaced by aesthetic concepts and values. Thus, one could claim that a species extinction is analogous to the loss of a great work of art.\nxaqt | A particularly notable further area of debate is the philosophical contributions in the interdisciplinary overlap with the environmental humanities and social sciences in a broad research area called 'extinction studies'. Before concluding, we will highlight some elements of this perspective to find areas of convergence and divergence between these different intellectual traditions working on the ethics of extinction.\n5rcb | Scholars working within the extinction studies framework tend to emphasize an understanding of extinctions as a biocultural phenomenon that cuts across reality, inviting a vision of existence that recognizes the deep interwoven nature of multispecies communities, experiences and collaborations. In line with this understanding, some writers have conceptualized extinctions as the loss of ways of life, underlining the fact that extinctions represent the demise of distinct forms of mating, nurturing, intergenerational learning, educating, interacting and so on.\n524j | Influenced by the work of philosophers such as Edmund Husserl, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and others, this perspective emphasizes a phenomenological approximation to extinction, opposing a mere behavioral approach to the nonhuman world and, instead, stressing the importance of attentiveness and lived experience in our interactions with the natural world. A key point of this approximation is to underline the experiences of those affected by extinction rather than focusing on the abstract disappearance of species. This speaks to the idea that the very experience of living on a biologically impoverished earth is understood as a source of deep concern. This methodological emphasis, in turn, motivates the interest of extinction studies in individual stories of extinction investigated through the tools of so-called field philosophy and other alternative methods.\nxd3m | Another important aspect of this perspective on analyzing extinctions is the idea that the consideration of processes and occurrences of extinction cannot be separated from a critique of various forms of colonialism, imperialism and capitalism.\n8qb6 | To illustrate, returning to themes introduced in section \"Defining extinction\", while extinction studies do not attribute a single, all-encompassing meaning to extinction, this phenomenon is regarded as the result, amongst other things, of complications derived from concepts used hegemonically, including the terms 'species', 'biodiversity', 'extinctions' and 'scientific knowledge', amongst other notions. It is argued that these concepts represent a conventional classification of the natural world that is tinted by colonialist and anthropocentric biases that universalize Western scientific perspectives, thus privilege some organizational hierarchies over others and naturalize distinct power relations within dominant biodiversity conservation paradigms. These terms employed with the purpose of organizing reality 'exclude myriad forms of life and relations and draw sharp boundaries between \"living\" and \"dead\" that confound the basic principles of so many living cosmologies'.\nwkbn | When thinking about responses to extinction - for example as an 'ethos of responsiveness towards the phenomenon of mass extinction' - also in extinction studies, there is a general skepticism towards de-extinction projects as shared by the approaches introduced above. If extinctions are understood not as the demise of the last individual of a population, but as the disappearance of a way of life, de-extinction projects are doomed to fail, because they do not seem capable of capturing the deeply relational nature of life. This is interestingly complementary to some of the views discussed in the previous sections that, when examining the wrongness of extinctions and the problems of technological solutions such as de-extinction, emphasize the relevance of ecological and cultural relationships as the basis for what has value. Confronted with the failure of preventing extinctions and the magnitude of the biocultural losses produced by the disappearance of these ways of life, some extinction studies scholars emphasize the importance of mourning and remembrance as a proper response to extinction. Rather than undoing loss, the moral significance of reflecting - remembering, mourning, grieving and imagining - the disappearances of deeply interwoven ways of life is underlined, giving rise to a moral psychology aspect to extinction.\nftfg | Conclusion\n7xi5 | This overview of the ethics of species extinctions has not attempted to spell out or critically discuss all topics or argumentative positions in detail. More humbly, our aim has been to provide an initial glimpse into some of the themes relevant for thinking about extinction that are being discussed in the literature of environmental ethics. For that purpose, we have given special attention to the possible philosophical grounds for Michael Soul√©'s assertion that the untimely 'extinction of populations and species is bad', which does not answer what should be done to prevent extinctions.\nw8r5 | While there is no simple or straightforward answer to the question of why anthropogenic extinctions are 'bad' or morally wrong, there is clearly largely agreement on the issue that anthropogenic extinctions are in most cases wrong, except for the controversially discussed cases of planned species extinctions in support of human (and nonhuman) health, such as with respect to vector- borne diseases. In such cases, anthropogenic extinctions might even be morally required. Besides such special cases, there is a broad\nybik | plurality of arguments and perspectives underlying and supporting the need to pursue expansive biological conservation policies. Which conservation strategies and practices should be pursued (and which should not), in turn, remains an additional matter of debate, the subject of the ethics of conservation that supplements the ethics of extinction.\n```",
