We notice that if we set r sub two equals zero and choose a local-in-time r sub one of k sub negative tau minus tau prime equals k delta of tau minus tau prime, the so-called Callan-Symanzik regulator then this choice effectively adds a quadratic term to the potential W goes to W plus k phi squared and leads to a relatively simple flow equation:\nkwpw | Partial derivative with respect to k of W sub k of phi equals one fourth times one over k plus partial derivative with respect to phi squared of W sub k of phi.
