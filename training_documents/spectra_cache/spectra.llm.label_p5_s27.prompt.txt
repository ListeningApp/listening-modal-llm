2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

75y3 | Formed as a result of reaction 1, the excited water molecule can react by processes 3, 4, and 11 or with the unexcited water molecules, the concentration of which inside the cavitation bubble is high enough (see above). In the last case the energy can transform very effectively ("resonant quenching"). In addition, water molecules quench the excited states of hydroxyl radical37

q1q2 | Thus, the total scheme (simplified of course) of chemical reactions inside the cavitation bubble, which lead to SL, in the presence of noble gas can be presented as follows:
cb7r | Spectra of Water Sonoluminescence
68xu | It is necessary to include also in this scheme reactions 5-8 and 14. It is seen from scheme 15 that the rate of luminescence quenching of H2O* and OH* species increases with the increase of water molecules concentration. This diminishes the total SL light emission and changes the spectra: the intensity of a short- wave part of the spectrum decreases more significantly as the "resonant quenching" is usually more effective. The difference in the spectra of water SL at high and low frequency is explained by SL quenching.16
hd35 | The proposed scheme may be seen strained. Actually, we did not find in the literature the experimental data on the formation and the emission of H2O *. M molecules, although the vibrational excited H2O.Ar van der Waals molecules are described.43 On the other hand, this propostion can easily explain the observed phenomena.
2zpk | Following the thermal theory of sonoluminescence and sonochemical reactions, the maximal temperature inside the bubble and, consequently, the yield of excited species must be at the stage of maximal compression, that is, at Rmin. However, the experimental results show that SL is over before Rmin is reached. This fact cannot be explained by thermal conductivity of the bubble content, as the maximum temperature is not yet achieved, but it can be the consequence of the processes of luminescence quenching. The number of collisions per particle for the time == 10-10 s is around 103, and the concentration of excited species is small (see above). The atoms of inert gas are not effective in the reactions of energy transformation, but it takes only a few collisions for water molecules in these processes. For larger molecules the energy transformation processes are more effective. For example, the SL spectra of potassium lines in octanol solutions are much broader than in the water solution, and the lifetime of the excited state of K atoms is around 0.05 ps.25
epu7 | It has been shown recently6 that the time of SL flash decreases from 150 to 50 ps as the bulk temperature of water increases from 10 to 22 °C. This result can be explained by the increase of the rate of SL quenching as a consequence of the increase of water vapor concentration inside the bubble with the increase of bulk solution temperature. Actually, the lower the bulk solution temperature, the lower the vapor pressure inside the bubble and the lower the rate of sonoluminescence quenching. In this case the stationary state between the rates of excited species formation and the rates of SL quenching is achieved later, closer to the minimal size of a bubble. In addition, the rate of sonoluminescence quenching is lower at bulk solution temperature of 10 °C, so SL diminishes with time not as fast as in the case of the "more vaporous" bubble. Thus, the total SL intensity is much higher and the time of SL flush is longer at 10 °C.

0bqy | Reactions of the Hydrogen Peroxide Formation. Next we shall consider shortly the chemical reactions inside or outside the cavitation bubble, which produce or destroy hydrogen peroxide.
b780 | Hydrogen peroxide is formed by the recombination inside the bubble or in the liquid after the end of bubble compression:
ccmb | OH + OH- (M) · H2O2 (16)
ma93 | The reaction
c6hh | H + OH (M) H2O

Note that the excited hydroxyl radicals OH* can also take part in these reactions. Formed hydrogen peroxide can be destroyed by high temperature inside the bubble

g9du | H + H2O2 + H2O + OH (19)

pbea | or react with hydrogen peroxide HO2 + H2O2 -> H2O + O2 + OH
ccpt | (22)
0fpw | Reactions 19-22 in the solution become observable at high enough concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and for a long time of ultrasound exposures. In this case the yield (time) (Y(H2O2)- (t)) dependency deviates from the linear one. We neglected the reactions of hydrogen peroxide destruction in the solution as we were working at short time of exposures on the linear part of yield (time) curves. Note also that we took into account only the concentration of OH radicals that avoided recombina- tion (17).
dqn8 | Following ref 45, around 80% of original OH radicals recombine by process 17. So, the ratio of total number of original OH radicals to the number of radicals avoiding recombination (17) should be around 5:1. If we assume that OH radicals are formed, basically, by reactions (3a)-(4a), i.e., the number of original OH radicals corresponds to the number of photons emitted by OH* radicals, then the ratio obtained in this paper of OH*/OH ~ 5.6 (see Table 1 for xenon-water vapors filled cavitation bubble) agrees well with the results of ref 45. This is the maximum value for that ratio, as we did not consider the processes of sonoluminescence quenching of OH* radicals.
cop0 | At high temperatures inside the bubble the reaction of H atoms with H2O molecule can increase the yield of OH radicals:46
lhkq | H + H20- OH + H2 (23)
82ju | It has been shown recently47 that at elevated temperatures inside the cavitation bubble the OH radicals are formed, basically, by reaction 18. Note here that the first step in the
y2qo | 9748 J. Phys. Chem., Vol. 98, No. 39, 1994
1piq | formation of OH radicals is the destruction of water molecules by reactions 1-4. At higher temperatures reaction 23 plays a dominant role and produces an additional quantity of OH radicals.47 There were considered 21 chemical reactions influencing the yield of OH radicals inside the cavitation bubble at the time of its implosion. Unfortunately, the mechanism of the excited species reactions inside the cavitation bubble was not considered in ref 47.
7fqw | Thus, the mechanism of formation and chemical reactions of excited particles and radicals is very complex, and it can change depending on the conditions inside the bubble at the time of its compression. We did not consider in detail all the possible processes as, first, the mechanism of reactions and the type of the species formed are not clear, and, second, the calculation of temperature inside the bubble at high amplitude of its pulsation is complicated.47
rhaz | Effect of Noble Gas Properties. Since the time when it was first discovered by Prudhomme and Guilmart,19 a number of papers were devoted to the studies of the noble gas properties on the yield of hydrogen peroxide and sonoluminescence. A principal conclusion has been made by Hickling39 and was confirmed by others researchers,20 that the major reason of the increase of SL and the yield of H2O2 is the decrease of thermal conductivity of a gas in the order of noble gases He > Ne > Ar > Kr > Xe. As a result of this, the temperature inside almost adiabatically collapsing cavitation bubble increases in the same order.
wak1 | The solubility of a gas can also have an influence on SL and on the yield of hydrogen peroxide. Actually, the increase of a gas solubility in the order from He to Xe is accompanied by the growth of the number of emitting light bubbles and, thus, by the increase of SL and the yield of H2O2.
wtfz | However, this cannot explain the changes in SL spectra and in the OH*/OH ratio in the order of noble gases. Following the scheme of eq 15, these changes can be the result of SL quenching as a consequence of different vapor/gas ratio inside the cavitation bubble filled by different noble gas. Actually, the increase of gas solubility from He to Xe promotes the process of a gas diffusion into the bubble as it expands, but the diffusivity of noble gases decreases in the same direction and seems to offset the growth of the bubble.39 Studying SL from a single nonlinearly pulsating cavitation bubble, the authors of ref 7b found the variation of the SL intensity with time. This can be due to the processes of the gas diffusion inside and outside the bubble. In a cavitation field the processes of rectified diffusion are complicated by the translational motion and coagulation of bubbles. Thus, the effects of a gas solubility on the vapor/gas ratio inside the cavitation bubble need more detailed experimental and theoretical examinations.
qy1i | The changes of thermal conductivity of gas can also change the vapor/gas ratio inside the bubble. In the stage of a bubble expansion the temperature of liquid-gas interface decreases because of the evaporation of water into the bubble. Thermal diffusivity of the gas contained inside the bubble corrects this deviation from the bulk solution temperature. So, the tempera- ture on the bubble wall adjacent to the gas phase and the vapor pressure inside the bubble will be higher in the case of the gas with higher thermal diffusivity; that is, it will grow in the order from Xe to He. However, the temperature drop on the bubble- liquid interface is small and becomes significant only at high enough temperatures48 of a bulk solution. Actually, thermal processes occur at the bubble growth in dynamics, when crispation appears on a bubble surface and the diffusion of a gas inside the bubble can influence the rate of evaporation. Thus,
1k9e | Didenko and Pugach
5bjs | from this point of view we cannot make any definite conclusion about the vapor-gas ratio inside the bubble at the stage of its expansion.
uodj | Thermal conductivity of a gas plays a significant role in the vapor/gas ratio also at the time of the bubble collapse: the higher the thermal conductivity, the smaller the radius and the higher the pressure inside the bubble.49 Assume that the vapor pressure inside the bubble at the stage of its maximal size is equal for all noble gases, filling the bubble, then at the stage of the minimal bubble size the vapor pressure will increase in the order Xe < Kr < Ar < He-filled vapor-gas cavitation bubble.
k16v | Thus, the solubility and the thermal conductivity of noble gas can, in principle, influence the gas/vapor ratio inside the cavitation bubble. However, it is difficult to estimate the significance of these effects at this time.
b2lm | The results obtained in this work can be simply explained by assuming that the temperature inside cavitation bubbles increases in the order He < Ar < Kr < Xe following the decrease in thermal conductivity.39 Thus, the yields of SL and hydrogen peroxide also increase in the same order.
ti7f | The temperature inside the He-containing bubble is not high enough to produce the large quantity of water molecules in the Č state, and the A and B states are generally formed. The dissociation of these states is accompanied basically by OH radical formation in a quiescent electronic state (reactions 2, 3a, and 3c). The number of water molecule in the B state is lower than in the A state so the ratio of OH*/OH is small, =0.26 (Table 1).
oksu | The growth of temperature inside the bubble promotes the number of water molecules in B and Č states. As a result, the ratio of OH*/OH and the short-wave part of the spectra of A < 270 nm increase in the order He, Ar, Kr, Xe (Table 1 and Figure 1).
wtow | Conclusions
o22k | Sonoluminescence originates from the thermal heating of the cavitation bubble content at the final stage of its compression. The unexpectedly high velocity of the SL decay cannot be explained by thermal losses.47 Besides that SL is over before the minimum size of a bubble is achieved, but following to thermal theory the temperature inside the bubble must be maximal at that moment. Thus, SL is not a blackbody radiation and is a form of luminescence. The concentration of excited particles inside the bubble is small, but the density of its content is high, so the processes of luminescence quenching can be very effective and they determine the SL (time) dependence.
nwfz | The obtained experimental results can be easily explained by the decrease of thermal conductivity and, consequently, by the increase of temperature inside collapsing cavitation bubble in the order of noble gases from He to Xe. Correspondingly, the number of water molecules excited on higher electronic states also increases. Thus, the SL intensity, the yield of hydrogen peroxide, and the OH*/OH ratio increase in the same order.
nvfy | It is difficult to estimate quantitatively the processes inside the bubble as the temperature calculations at high amplitude of the bubble pulsations are complicated. In addition, the condi- tions inside the collapsing cavitation bubble are very peculiar to use directly the results from other fields of physics and chemistry. In this paper an attempt to describe the mechanism of SL was made, which could explain qualitatively the main points of the observed phenomena.
