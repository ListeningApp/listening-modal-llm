You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

syiw | 6 CONSTRAINTS FROM PRIMORDIAL NUCLEOSYNTHESIS
kg3t | Before we find constraints on power-law cosmology param- eters from primordial big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), it is helpful to reproduce the brief review of the BBN in stan- dard model given by Kaplinghat et al. (1999). The neutron- proton ratio <LATEX>n / p = \exp \left( - Q / T \right) ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>Q = 1 . 2 9 \mathrm { M e V }</LATEX> is the neutron-proton mass difference, at high temperatures <LATEX>T \gtrsim 1 \mathrm { M e V }</LATEX> is maintained by charged-current weak inter- actions among neutrons, protons, electrons, positrons and neutrinos. When the Universe is of order 1 s old, <LATEX>T \lesssim 1</LATEX> MeV, the <LATEX>n / p</LATEX> ratio "freezes out" due to the inequilibrium of weak interactions and free neutron decay with a lifetime of 887 s. At this stage the deuterium (D) produced due to
lvae | Constraints on power-law cosmology
o9sc | collision of neutrons and protons is rapidly photodissoci- ated by the cosmic background photons. This causes very low abundance of <LATEX>D</LATEX> and thus heavier nuclei are not formed at this epoch. Thus nucleosynthesis is delayed by this "pho- todissociation bottleneck". However, when the universe is ~ 3 minutes old, the temperature falls below ~ 80 keV, the deuterium bottleneck is broken. At this stage the nuclear reactions quickly burn out the remaining free neutrons into 4He and leave trace amounts of D, 3He and <LATEX>{ } ^ { 7 } \mathrm { L i }</LATEX> (Walker et al. 1991). A viable cosmological model must mimic the above scenario for proper synthesis of the light elements in the early Universe. In the following, we test the power-law cosmological model for primordial nucleosynthesis.
121u | In power-law cosmology the scale factor <LATEX>a \left( t \right)</LATEX> and the cosmic microwave background temperature <LATEX>T \left( t \right)</LATEX> are related through the relation:
zh03 | <LATEX>\frac { a } { a _ { 0 } } = \frac { T _ { 0 } } { \beta T } = \left( \frac { t } { t _ { 0 } } \right) ^ { \frac { 1 } { 1 + q } } ,</LATEX> (14)
1mvw | where <LATEX>\beta</LATEX> stands for any non-adiabatic expansion due to en- tropy production. In standard cosmology, the instantaneous <LATEX>e ^ { \pm }</LATEX> annihilation is assumed at <LATEX>T = m _ { e } .</LATEX> The heating due to this annihilation is accounted by <LATEX>\beta</LATEX> where <LATEX>\beta = 1</LATEX> for <LATEX>T < m _ { e }</LATEX> while <LATEX>\beta = \left( 1 1 / 4 \right) ^ { 1 / 3 }</LATEX> for
6d4s | <LATEX>T > m _ { e } .</LATEX> In order to find constraints from primordial nucle- osythesis on power-law cosmology parameters, we utilize <LATEX>t _ { 0 } \approx 1 3 . 7 \mathrm { G y r }</LATEX> (age of the Universe) estimated by Komatsu et al. (2011) on the basis of 7 year data from WMAP and astrophysical data from other sources. Further, the model is assumed to have current temperature <LATEX>T _ { 0 } = 2 . 7 2 8 \mathrm { K } .</LATEX> The primordial nucleosynthesis requires that <LATEX>t \leq 8 8 7</LATEX> <LATEX>T \approx 8 0 \mathrm { k e V } .</LATEX> This puts the following constraints on <LATEX>q</LATEX> and
