You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

fim0 | creatine stores and subsequently experience the pur- ported ergogenic benefits of creatine supplementation. However, lower daily creatine supplementation dosing strategies (i.e., 3-5 g/day) are well established throughout the scientific literature for increasing intramuscular cre- atine stores leading to greater improvements in muscle mass, performance and recovery compared to placebo [2]. While effective, these non-loading creatine supple- mentation dosing strategies (Figure 1, side B) delay max- imum intramuscular creatine storage. For example, in the classic 'loading' vs. daily 'maintenance' dose compari- son study by Hultman et al. [35], creatine accumulation in muscle was similar <LATEX>\left( \sim 2 0 \right.</LATEX> increase) after participants consumed 3 g/day for 28 days or 20 g/day for 6 days [35]. Thus, it is currently recommended that individuals consume ~3-5 g/day of creatine for a minimum of 4 weeks in order to experience similar skeletal muscle sat- uration levels. Determination of which creatine supple- mentation strategy is preferred may depend on the goal of the individual. For instance, if an athlete is hoping to maximize the ergogenic potential of creatine supplemen- tation in a very short period of time <LATEX>\left( < 3 0 \right.</LATEX> days), adopt- ing the creatine 'loading' strategy may be advised. However, if an athlete or exercising individual is plan- ning to ingest creatine over an extended period of time (> 30 days), or if avoiding potential weight gain which can sometimes occur during creatine 'loading', the creat- ine 'maintenance' strategy would be a viable option. Ath- letes who are carrying out a creatine loading phase (i.e., 20 g/day) should emphasize the smaller dosing strategies (e.g. less than or equal to 10 gram servings) throughout the day, as dosages of greater than 10 grams may poten- tially lead to gastrointestinal distress (i.e., diarrhea) [105].
ojro | In summary, accumulating evidence indicates that you do not have to 'load' creatine. Lower, daily dosages of creatine supplementation (i.e.
l6t9 | Antonio et al. Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition
1ujy | 3-5 g/day) are effective for increasing intra- muscular creatine stores, muscle accretion and muscle performance/recovery.
qzor | Is creatine beneficial for older adults?
a0by | There has been an increasing number of studies showing that creatine supplementation plays a therapeutic role in a variety of clinical conditions (see Gualano et al. [106] for a comprehensive review on this topic).
u1ky | Perhaps one of the most promising conditions that could benefit from creatine supplementation is age- related sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is defined as a progressive and generalized skeletal muscle condition (i.e. decrease in muscle mass, strength, and functionality) that is asso- ciated with increased likelihood of adverse outcomes in- cluding falls, fractures, physical disability and mortality [107]. While resistance training is considered corner- stone in the treatment of sarcopenia [108], accumulating evidence indicates that creatine supplementation may enhance the anabolic environment produced by resist- ance training, subsequently mitigating indices of sarco- penia [9, 10, 19, 27].
htm9 | Creatine supplementation can increase functionality (e.g., strength, activities of daily living, delay fatigue) and muscle mass in older adults [9, 10, 19, 87, 95, 109, 110]. However, the literature indicates that creatine alone (that is, without a concomitant resistance training pro- gram) is unlikely to result in substantial gains in muscle strength and functional performance [95, 111-113], al- though it does improve some parameters of muscle fatigue [114-116]. Likewise, most studies failed to show a beneficial effect of chronic creatine supplementation alone (≥ 30 days) on lean mass [98, 99, 113, 114]. For instance, we recently showed that creatine supplementa- tion was not able to increase lean mass in postmeno- pausal women who supplemented with creatine (3 g/ day) for 2 years, suggesting that creatine supplementa- tion without exercise may be ineffective to prevent sar- copenia [99]. It is likely that increases in lean mass occasionally attributed to creatine supplementation in short-term studies (e.g., 7 days) are explained by in- creased body water, since creatine is osmotically active and it can sometimes induce water retention.
8hul | Conversely, substantial evidence indicates that creatine supplementation is capable of augmenting the hyper- trophic response to resistance training in young adults [117], which is extended to older adults, as confirmed by three systematic reviews and meta-analyses [19, 118, 119]. The fact that creatine is more effective when com- bined with a training stimulus suggests that the main mechanistic action of creatine is its ability to enhance training volume and/or intensity, which may influence muscle protein kinetics, growth factors, satellite cells,
87vz | inflammation and/or oxidative stress [9, 10, 19], ultim- ately resulting in greater skeletal muscle adaptations.
ym66 | Regarding aging bone, emerging research over the past decade has shown some benefits from creatine supple- mentation. For example, healthy older males (> 50 yrs) who supplemented with creatine and performed whole- body resistance training for 10-12 weeks experienced an increase in upper limb bone mineral content [120] and a reduction in bone resorption compared to placebo [121]. More recently, Chilibeck et al. [122] showed that 52 weeks of creatine supplementation and supervised whole-body resistance training attenuated the rate of bone mineral loss in the hip region compared to placebo in postmenopausal females. However, a 2 year creatine supplementation protocol was infective for improving bone mass or bone geometry in post-menopausal women, again suggesting that creatine should be com- bined with resistance-type exercise to produce beneficial bone adaptations [99].
l0a3 | From a clinical and healthy aging perspective, it is recom- mended that creatine supplementation be combined with resistance training to produce the greatest adaptations in older adults. Future clinical trials involving frail populations with long-term follow-up(s) and larger samples are needed. The therapeutic potential of creatine supplementation for cachexia, myopathies, post-surgery rehabilitation, bed rest, other muscle/bone wasting condition/diseases and brain health warrants further investigation.
u8nw | In summary, there is growing body of evidence showing that creatine supplementation, particularly when combined with exercise, provides musculoskel- etal and performance benefits in older adults.
l2v9 | Is creatine only useful for resistance / power type activities?
afbe | Although creatine supplementation has been theorized to primarily benefit athletes involved in high-intensity intermittent resistance/power type activities, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that creatine sup- plementation may also provide beneficial effects for other activities. For example, creatine supplementation with carbohydrate [123] or carbohydrate and protein [124] has been reported to promote greater muscle glycogen storage than carbohydrate supplementation alone. Since glycogen replenishment is important for promoting recovery and preventing overtraining during intensified training periods [2, 125], creatine supplemen- tation may help athletes who deplete large amounts of glycogen during training and/or performance (i.e., sport- ing events) to maintain optimal glycogen levels. Second, there is evidence that creatine supplementation may re- duce muscle damage and/or enhance recovery from in- tense exercise. For example, Cooke and colleagues [126]
