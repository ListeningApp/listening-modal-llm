You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

d0ik | Role of winds and tides in timing of beach strandings, occurrence, and significance of swarms of the jellyfish Crambione mastigophora Mass 1903 (Scyphozoa: Rhizostomeae: Catostylidae) in north-western Australia
0x0s | Abstract Very large swarms of the red jellyfish Crambione mastigophora in north-western Australia disrupt swimming on tourist beaches causing eco- nomic impacts. In October 2012, jellyfish stranding on Cable Beach (density 2.20 ±0.43 ind. m 2) was estimated at 52.8 million individuals or 14,172 t wet weight along 15 km of beach. Reports of strandings after this period and up to 250 km south of this location indicate even larger swarm biomass. Strandings of jellyfish were significantly associated with a 2-day lag in conditions of small tidal ranges (<5 m). More than 90% of strandings occurred 2 days after winds were blowing onshore, but with the small number of days when satellite wind data were available during the
4exe | study period, this result was not statistically significant. Dedicated instrument measurements of meteorological parameters, rather than the indirect measures used in this study (satellite winds and modelled currents) may improve the predictability of such events and help authorities to plan for and manage swimming activity on beaches. We also show a high incidence of predation by C. mastigophora on bivalve larvae which may have a significant impact on the reproductive output of pearl oyster broodstock in the region.
0myz | Introduction
xh3i | Jellyfish are a ubiquitous and readily observed com- ponent of marine plankton. They may exist in high
syiw | densities as swarms (aggregations from local or distant sources usually brought together by oceanographic or behavioural processes) or blooms (high density, locally derived population). The different manifesta- tions of high densities of jellyfish and how they are formed have been reviewed previously (Graham et al., 2001; Hamner & Dawson, 2009). However, there has been recent interest in using and understanding oceanographic processes to develop predictive capac- ity to forecast when jellyfish might swarm near the shore bring them into contact with swimmers (Pontin et al., 2009; Gershwin et al., 2014). The extent to which jellyfish biology and behaviour can affect swarming and beach stranding (Fossette et al., 2015) has also gained recent attention. Jellyfish swarms at the coast cause other problems such as clogging power and desalination plant seawater intakes (Daryanabard & Dawson, 2008; Dong et al., 2010) and fish mortality in aquaculture farms (Doyle et al., 2008), and predic- tive capacity would assist in preparing for or prevent- ing harmful and damaging effects of jellyfish swarms.
kg3t | Jellyfish swarms and blooms are natural phenom- ena, but their occurrence is increasingly being asso- ciated with anthropogenic disturbance and modification of the world's oceans and coastal seas. Climate change, overfishing and coastal development have all been suggested as contributing to jellyfish swarms and blooms, although the evidence is often equivocal (Mills, 2001; Purcell et al., 2007; Richard- son et al., 2009; Dong et al., 2010; Lilley et al., 2011; Duarte et al., 2012; Purcell, 2012; Gibbons & Richardson, 2013), and the evidence of a world-wide trend in jellyfish swarms and blooms is debated (Condon et al., 2012, 2013). The jellyfish swarms described in this study occurred in the remote north- western Australia, where anthropogenic impacts are regarded as being very low on a global scale (Halpern et al., 2008) offering an opportunity to examine the drivers of swarms as well as their ecological, social and economic significance.
lvae | The jellyfish Crambione mastigophora Maas 1903 is recorded from the eastern Indian Ocean and western Pacific (Kramp, 1961; Omori & Nakano, 2001; Kitamura & Omori, 2010). Despite its apparently common and sometimes abundant occurrence in north-western Australia (this study), Indonesia (Omori & Nakano, 2001), the "Malayan Archipelago", Sri Lanka and the "Truk Islands" (Micronesia) (Kramp,
o9sc | 1961), there is little published information on C. mastigophora beyond the taxonomic texts of Kramp (1961) and Stiansy (1929). C. mastigophora is capable of forming large swarms in north-western Australia where they are a nuisance due to stinging swimmers (Marsh & Slack-Smith, 2010). Hamner & Dawson (2009) categorised it as a putative bloomer on the basis that if they are fished commercially (Omori & Nakano, 2001), they must be very abundant, at least seasonally. However, there have been no previous studies any- where describing the nature, extent, and time course of C. mastigophora swarms. Similarly, there are no published studies on any aspect of the biology of C. mastigophora.
121u | This study resulted from an unplanned opportunity which arose when very large swarms of C. mastigo- phora washed ashore in a small population centre on the only regularly lifeguard patrolled beach in what is a very remote part of Australia in 2012. The purpose of the paper is to record the incidence and scale of these, and earlier C. mastigophora swarms off the western coast of Australia, determine whether wind, currents and tides play an influential and predictable role in beach stranding events of these jellyfish and outline the likely socioeconomic and ecological implications of swarms of this species.

For the period of detailed investigation on Cable Beach (Fig. 1iii) in 2012, daily records of jellyfish strandings were made by TT and other Cable Beach life guards, for the period from 12 August to 31 October.
