You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1pjs | Reflection on Reading 2: What is Gender and Why a Gendered Perspective?
o2kr | Growing up, I used to think sex and gender meant the same thing - a simple way of differentiating people's identities to be either male or female. Through these readings, I have learned that sex and gender have distinct meanings: sex is an ideal construct that is forcibly materialized through time, whereas gender is a social attribute assigned to individuals by society (Butler, 1993). Butler and MacGregor concurred that both sex and gender are the result of social construction, meaning that they are not inherent. They also believe that there is a strong connection between gender and its environment and that it is all governed by the power dynamics in play (patriarchal systems), in which misogyny is manifested strongly (Butler, 1993). According to Butler, sex is to gender as feminism is to masculinity.
v6sk | On the other hand, MacGregor (2017) identifies that in communities that are predominantly identified as cisgender, there is a lot of predominant masculinity as opposed to feminists (theorized as hegemonic) (MacGregor, 2017). Hence, paving the way for the effects of climate change to prevail over time, despite the abundance of nature's atmosphere and resources, cultural practices are allowed to act on nature, which leads to the materialization of nature (Butler, 1993).
1wj6 | MacGregor (2017) clearly explains how different gendered perspectives shape our experiences as humans and how our environment is seen through a gender lens. MacGregor argued that women were closer to nature in the 1990s in the Global North due to their subordination to men and the environmental crisis, which informed their moral duty to save it; hence, the birth of ecofeminism. The idea of gender is used by ecofeminist theorists to examine how people interact with nature (MacGregor, 2017). Matthew (2017) then examined the ecofeminist concept of
936l | dualism to critique MacGregor's view of ecofeminism. The power exhibited over nature through the medium of science enables the west to colonize other societies, thereby producing a space in which male dominance exists in some societies (Mattew, 2017). This results in the emergence of gendered categories and acts as a catalyst for dominance over feminists (Matthews, 2017). A clear example of dualism is humans versus nature, where humans feel like the subjects and nature is the object.
06yq | In lieu of the criticism above by Matthew and the agreement by Butler and MacGregor, MacGregor believes that four (4) approaches should be employed to analyze the concepts of gender and environment: First, research on the discovery that there is a complicated relationship between feminists' environment and other axes of social differences that shape people's lives, such as race, ethnicity, class, and sexuality (Butler, 1993, MacGregor, 2017), The second approach is political discourse within the academic forum, which heavily relies on climate change, thereby raising the bar for the United Nations to prioritize gender equality and climate action as part of the 17 key areas of focus for sustainable development objectives. The gender-environment connection in politics, policy, and practice is the third approach that seeks to discuss how women tend to be on the front lines in times of crisis and the significance of gender analysis in policymaking. This approach aligns well with Alison and Miguel's (2020) article on why feminism is beneficial for your health and the illustration from the paper, which describes explicitly how countries led by women curbed the pandemic better. The fourth approach elaborates on the visionary nature of feminist research, which leads to political movements and social change because gender and environment shape people's lives differently, as argued by MacGregor (2017). It assumes that gendered roles and life patterns adapt to the context in which individuals live (MacGregor, 2017).
dpv6 | The global pandemic (COVID-19) has provided clear grounds to reasonably argue why feminism is good not only for health but for the environment as well. Alison and Miguel (2020) argued that countries headed by women were able to manage pandemics more efficiently than those in patriarchal systems. I agree with Alison and Miguel's perspective that in all spheres of politics, economics, and society, women's leadership emerges from and strengthens equality. A feminist is resilient in challenging circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic (Alison & Miguel, 2020). I have seen women in Northeast Nigeria building resilience in internally displaced camps due to insecurity despite disease outbreaks and very harsh living conditions, yet they strive to live life and protect their families and their environment even though the conditions are not conducive. It is true that "feminism could save our lives" (Alison & Miguel, 2020).
8r5j | In a nutshell, history has recorded that gender and sexualities are different contextually, and their differences are their identities, and that is what shapes their lives. There are, however, a lot of similarities that exist globally, though they are more prevalent in the global south than the global north, which has adjusted to accommodate the LGBT+ since the 1990s (MacGregor, 2017). The perspective of gender in environment, health, and development even today has fueled the development of the sustainable development goals by the United Nations Development Programs (UNDP), where gender equality and climate action form part of the 17 core goals to be achieved by 2030. Inasmuch as these cultural differences exist and directly affect our environment, looking at the governing systems and individual lives from a gendered perspective (inclusion) will bring about development rather than wasting resources and energy on power tussles and predominance.
