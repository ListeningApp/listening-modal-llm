You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

8whh | Anyone can think of several schools, cults, religions, systems of psychology or philosophy which fall into the above classifications.
iywu | We must categorically affirm that it is impossible to increase human knowledge in the higher field by these methods. The statistical possibility of useful gains within a reasonable time is so remote as to be excluded from one's calculations.
qn1v | Why, then, do people persist in raking over the embers and looking for truth when they have so little chance of finding it? Simply because they are using their conditioning propensity, not their capacity for higher perception, to try to follow the path. There is intellectual stimulus and emotional attraction in the mere effort to plumb the unknown. When the ordinary human mind encounters evidences of a higher state of being, or even when it conceives the possibility of them, it will invariably conclude that there is some possibility of progress for that mind without the application of the factors of teaching-teacher-students-time-and- place which are essentials.
o9ng | Man has few alternatives in bis search for truth. He may rely
6od4 | upon his unaided intellect, and gamble that he is capable of per- ceiving truth or even the way to truth. This is a poor, but an attractive, gamble. Or he can gamble upon the claims of an in- dividual or institution which claims to have such a way. This gamble, too, is a poor one. Aside from a very few, men in general lack a sufficiently developed perception to tell them:
jx1z | 1. Not to trust their own unaided mentation;
hrlm | 2. Whom or what to trust.
wfjt | There are, in consequence, two main schools of thought in this matter. Some say 'Follow your own promptings'; the other says: 'Trust this or that institution'. Each is really useless to the ordin- ary man. Each will help him to use up his time.
g779 | The bitter truth is that before man can know his own inade- quacy, or the competence of another man or institution, he must first learn something which will enable him to perceive both. Note well that his perception itself is the product of right study; not of instinct or emotional attraction to an individual, nor yet of desiring to 'go it alone'. This is 'learning how to learn'.
by5l | All this means, of course, that we are postulating here the need for preparatory study before school work takes place. We deny that a man can study and properly benefit from school work until he is equipped for it: any more than a person can study space- navigation unless he has a grasp of mathematics.
wye3 | This is not to say that a man (or a woman) cannot have a sensation of truth. But the unorganised and fragmented mind which is most people's heritage tends to distort the quality and quantity of this sensation, leading to almost completely false con- clusions about what can or should be done.
oc7w | This is not to say, either, that man cannot take part in studies and activities which impinge upon that portion of him which is connected with a higher life and cognition. But the mere applica- tion of special techniques will not transform that man's conscious- ness. It will only feed into, and disturb, more or less permanently, centres of thought and feeling where it does not belong. Thus it is that something which should be a blessing becomes a curse. Sugar, shall we say, for a normal person is nutritionally useful. To a
k5k4 | 287
wngq | diabetic it can be poison.
udft | Therefore, before the techniques of study and development are made available to the student, he must be enabled to profit by them in the direction in which they are supposed to lead, not in a short-term indulgence.
foay | Thus our curriculum takes two parts: the first is the providing of materials of a preparatory nature, in order to equip the indi- vidual to become a student. The second is the development itself.
43mx | If we, or anyone else, supply such study or preparatory material prematurely, it will only operate on a lower level than it could. The result will be harmless at best. At worst it will condition, train, the mind of the individual to think and behave in patterns which are nothing less than automatic. In this latter way one can make what seem to be converts, unwittingly play upon emotions, on lesser desires and the conditioning propensity; train people to loyalty to individuals, found and maintain institutions which seem more or less serious or constructive. But no real progress towards knowledge of the human being and the other dimension in which he partly lives will in fact be made.
ld7j | The preparation of the student is as important as anything else which he does. The Sufi poet Hafiz says:
mf5v | 'The Seeker must not be unaware of the way and method of the stages.' This awareness comes through following the teaching course, which is taking part in the activities of a school, plus abiding by the directions of your teacher.
f31w | In learning how to learn from a Sufi school, the intending student should take note of this admonition, which indicates his difficulties:
yofz | 'If you are too soft, you will be crushed; if you are too dry, you will be broken; if you are too hard, you will cause hurt; if you are too sharp, you will inflict wounds.'
4mdw | The curriculum of a School is one which may work with second- ary things, but which employs them instrumentally, and certainly not imagining that they are primary things.
49f1 | In the words of Sheikh Al-Intaki, quoted over a thousand years ago by Hujwiri in his Revelation of the Veiled:
csae | the honour of the ordinary [person] is to accept secondary
c29v | [things as real] causes, while the honour of the dervish is to reject secondary [supposed] causes, insisting on The Cause.
gkgm | The School works with what is primary. The (to some) apparently purposeful activity of those who use correct materials but apply only the ordinary, limited senses, is portrayed in the actions of Nasrudin with his seedlings:
swmm | RIGHT IDEA, WRONG MATERIALS
dak5 | The Mulla once spent a whole day transplanting some seedlings in his garden.
57sj | When he stood back to admire his work, a sudden thought struck him.
qdqk | Dusk was falling as he started to pluck the plants from the ground, wrapping them in sackcloth by the light of a lantern.
emd4 | Going home along the fields some cronies called to him. 'What- ever are you doing, Nasrudin ?'
m9fu | 'Acting in accordance with careful consideration. I realised - late in the day, but not too late as you see-that it is better to keep one's property in the house, under proper supervision.'
b3ph | The secondary ('commanding') self in everyone is the false self which everyone takes to be the real one. It stands in relation to the real being of the person as the face does to the person: virtually a persona. Everyone, says Rumi, in Fihi ma Fihi, likes a mirror, and is enamoured of the reflection in the mirror of his attributes and attainments: though he does not know the real nature of his face.
9j3h | The veil which he sees on the looking-glass he imagines to be his face. Take the covering from your face, so that you may see me as the mirror of your real face: so that you will realise that I am a mirror.'
q1lo | The curriculum of a School, from 'inside the School' as you put it, is based on the teacher being able to be that mirror. He is therefore able to assess the peculiarities and needs of the student. His miming is often of the student, so that the latter may see him- self mirrored and react accordingly.
biqi | 289
xl19 | Knowing all about Someone
j83k | Q: Is it enough to associate with a man of knowledge to acquire some of it? Does the Teacher not need the Student?
nle2 | A: You must remember instances, at least, when you have not said anything and everything in your mind.
19po | Have you ever thought about the people whom you may know who do not discuss with you things which they know, even though such things might be of abiding interest to you?
sx65 | You may 'know a man well', even meet him every day of your life, 'share his opinions', exchange ideas. At the same time, you may have no conception of his possession of certain knowledge and even of his capacity to pass it on if the conditions are correct.
ilzn | He may not seem an enigma to you; but he may be as deeply concealed as anything on earth.
uzp0 | The conception that one knows all about a person because of shared experiences and the exchange of confidences is not a true one. It is based upon the misconception that people cannot avoid communicating whatever they are discussing with one another.
yq4x | Knowledge does not automatically 'brush off, any more than it can be transmitted by words alone; neither is it to be conveyed by training of any ordinary kind.
i901 | You cannot, therefore, learn real knowledge merely by associat- ing with someone who has it - especially if you do not even know that it is there, and if you are not focussed correctly to learn.
n98j | Someone or something has first to impart to you how to perceive the presence of knowledge. Without preparation there can be no teaching.
xgyu | As to the need of the Teacher, the great teacher Jami in his Lawaih says (Essay XXI) 'The Absolute does not stand in need of the relative, except for its manifestation, but the relative needs the Absolute for its very existence.' Similarly, the teacher is to be regarded as more important than the student in the situation of learning.
ue40 | 290
tq0f | That is to say, the Teacher is so to be regarded by the learner. The Teacher himself may regard the learner as more important, but that is a matter for the Teacher, and there is no point dis- cussing his attitudes when the conversation is about learning and not teaching.

une6 | Remarks upon the Matter of the Dervish Path
eroy | Q: Can you give us a number of outstanding points which should be studied by those interested in the Dervish, the Sufi, Path? How do the miracles attributed to Sufis come about?
b09g | I. The human environment produces certain subtle changes in the individual which penetrate his whole being. Instead of under- going only these changes, man has a chance to gain access to a form of self which is, by comparison, infinitely superior. To use the technical term: he is at present 'only half awake'.
psuf | II. This change, although it increases man's awareness of his destiny, does not interfere with his ordinary human relationships. On the contrary, it enriches them.
ojfh | III. In order to take part in this process, there has to be the coincidence of a teacher with the doctrine, the application of the doctrine in a way suited to the pupils; and the right environ- mental circumstances. Nothing less than all these factors will do.
qri0 | IV. One way of rendering the message given here is that there is a deeper truth, and a wider dimension, in which man already partly lives, though he is ordinarily indifferent to it. There is the hope that he can become as aware of it as he is of the familiar world.
hbbb | V. The self-realisation of this dimension enables a man or woman to attain heights of achievement in the easily-perceptible world and in other areas; and prevents him from becoming the tool of a mere conditional existence, with all its anxieties and ultimate meaninglessness. Man tends to be unhappy not because of what he knows, but because of what he does not know.
uy56 | VI. It is only through the attunement of a group of people, each with the possibility of this attainment, correctly harmonised into a true community (whether physically in contact or otherwise) that
sy3k | 292
ido2 | true understanding and the next step in human progress can come. VII. The unity and integration of this group are essential to in- dividual as well as collective success. In fact almost the only opportunity for man to realise his individual importance is through the support of a group of suitable people.
uq3f | VIII. This doctrine and the manner of its application have been known and propagated from time immemorial. They are, in fact, the property and destiny of man. They link with a past in which this development was much more widely known, through a present where it has fallen into disuse except for a few, to a future in which The Great Work will be the entire legitimate goal of man- kind.
c006 | IX. The New Man', 'The Real Man', 'The Perfected Man' are all terms used in different formulations, throughout the ages, for this activity, which has been called 'secret', 'hidden' or 'initiatory' for reasons other than people realise.
yatc | People are interested in miracles, when they would do better to be interested in Truth. Miracles are by-products or else part of the special extradimensional activity in which certain people are involved. This involvement is because they acquire added functions with every addition of knowledge or capacity, just as in ordinary education but in this case in its own realm.
ny4k | An example, among many thousands, of the activity which is carried on by extra-sensory perception in Sufi service shows how 'miracles' are linked with duty. Ibn Arabi in his Ruh al-Quds, tells how one evening he felt an urge to go to see Abu-Abdullah al- Khayyat ('The Tailor') of Seville, and made his way a fair distance to see him. Al-Khayyat said: 'Why were you so long? You have something with you which I need'. Ibn Arabi took the five dirhams which he had in his pocket and gave them to him. The other Sufi told him that he had need of the money for a certain poor man called Ali al-Salawi.
gqd8 | 293
etr7 | Meetings, Groups, Classes
3m6c | Q: There is great interest in meetings, groups and classes. Are these forms the aims of Sufi teaching?
h1un | A: People who do not understand how higher teachings operate, or who have been trained to think in a shallow manner about them, are naturally confused when they meet written and spoken materials which do not fit into their preconceived patterns.
nljo | Nowhere is this more strikingly evidenced than in the matter of communication and relationships.
ookx | After hearing a few hundred people explain how they feel, after reading a few dozen letters from 'seekers', even a machine would surely see the pattern of shallow assumption upon which even the most ardent of this type allow themselves to work.
0h9f | People who live in approximately the same area think that they should be grouped together, willy-nilly. People who are not of a mind to read books agitate for 'personal contact'. People who live in distant places crave travels, visits, materials to devour. People with whom you have been out of formal contact become distressed, bitter, interested in sources of readier gratification. People jealously (if unconsciously) cherish the 'cult of the Centre', whose distin- guishing mark is the belief that 'If I could only go to such-and- such a place all would be well.'
a5nf | Virtually none of these people has any true concept of how a real community comes into being, how it develops, how its local manifestations are working, what its future might be-how they could benefit from what is being done.
htog | If you circularise people with details of how a local class or group is run, they all want to be in a local class or group. It is just like mentioning a lollipop to a child: it may have been think- ing about something else, but this key-word can possess its think- ing mechanism to the exclusion of everything else.
d9zz | For a moment, as an exercise, transpose this situation into some other field, and you will see that such behaviour is so primi-
eovv | 294
f6vi | tive, so crude, so unfortunately wasteful of energy, or understand- ing, of everything, that it is obvious that something has to be done for such people. Anyone prone to such behaviour-patterns is in no position to benefit from any higher knowledge at that point. He is, however, a suitable prey for one or other of the people or bodies which offer instant assuagement of tensions by going along with the individual's infantile behaviour.
