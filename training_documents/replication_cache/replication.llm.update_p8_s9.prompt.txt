You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

mt0f | Flavivirus-induced vesicle packets contain the viral RNA replication proteins, dsRNA, and nascent RNA and are the site of genome replication (48, 49). Three-dimensional EM tomogra- phy showed vesicle packets to comprise a bounding membrane vesicle bearing multiple spherule invaginations retaining necked openings to the cytosol (50-52) (Figure <LATEX>\left. 3 b \right) ,</LATEX> confirming parallels noted in EM tomography of nodavirus spherules (17) (Figure <LATEX>\left. 3 a \right) .</LATEX> The convoluted membranes contain replicase proteins but no RNA, and they may be sites for replication factor production and storage preparatory to RC formation (52).
awab | While most Flaviviridae form spherule RCs, HCV induces some closed single-membrane vesi- cles and more DMVs (53, 54). Further features and evolutionary implications of these DMVs are reviewed below.
ixcc | 3. DOUBLE-MEMBRANE VESICLE RNA REPLICATION COMPLEXES
8p6h | In contrast to (+)RNA viruses forming spherule RCs, RNA replication by some <LATEX>\left( + \right) R N A</LATEX> viruses- including coronaviruses, picornaviruses, noroviruses, and hepaciviruses-is accompanied by for- mation of single- and double-membrane vesicles or tubules lacking membrane openings to the cytosol (55). For coronaviruses, DMVs were recently established as the major sites of viral RNA synthesis (56), while for other viruses in this category the respective relevance of single- and double-membrane compartments for RNA replication remains less clear. Below we briefly review these results and their implications.
pmgl | 3.1. Coronaviruses
90no | Coronaviruses and in particular the beta-coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. They include the causal agents of the prior severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics (57) and the current devastating COVID-19 pandemic. Coronaviruses have ~30-kb genomes, the largest known genomes among (+)RNA viruses (Figure <LATEX>\left. 2 b \right) .</LATEX> Over 70% of these genomes encode enormous, overlapping la and lab polyproteins that are essential for RNA replication and for coronaviruses' unusual discon- tinuous subgenomic mRNA transcription (58). These polyproteins are processed by two virus- encoded proteases into 16 individual nonstructural proteins (nsps) providing functions in RNA replication organelle formation (nsps 3, 4, and 6) plus enzymatic functions such as protease (nsp3 and nsp5), <LATEX>\mathrm { R d R p }</LATEX> (nsp12 and cofactors nsps 7 and 8), RNA capping (nsps 12, 14, and 16 and cofac- tor nsp10), helicase (nsp13), exonuclease (nsp14), and endonuclease (nsp15) (59). The structures of many nsPs have been solved (59), but how they collectively interact for RNA synthesis and export remains a question.
jt0y | Proteins nsp3, 4, and 6 each have multiple membrane-association domains and induce a network of interconnected, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived membrane rearrangements in- cluding complex convoluted membranes and hundreds of 200- to 300-nm DMVs (60-62) (Figure 3c). While viral RNA replication proteins are observed throughout this network, dsRNA is found only in DMVs (56, 63, 64). Moreover, autoradiography of actinomycin-D-resistant 3 H-uridine incorporation in coronavirus-infected cells identified DMVs as the dominant if not sole sites of coronavirus RNA synthesis (56). DMVs arise ~2 h postinfection. Their outer mem- branes are often interconnected through neck-like channels to other DMVs and to convoluted membranes (64). Convoluted membranes arise later than DMVs and, unlike DMVs, do not har- bor RNA. However, they abundantly immunolabel for coronavirus nsps and, analogous to similar flavivirus-induced structures, could be sites for replicase production, processing, and storage (64).
qb7o | A long-elusive path for the potential release of viral RNA products from DMV interiors was provided when cryo-EM tomography revealed a sixfold symmetrical pore that spans both DMV membranes and contains nsp3, the largest <LATEX>\left( > 1 , 9 0 0 \right.</LATEX> aa) coronavirus RNA replication factor (65) (Figure 4c). This coronavirus channel or crown parallels the crowns previously recognized on spherule RCs (Figure <LATEX>\left. 4 a , b \right)</LATEX> in being a ringed complex of viral RNA replication factors that gates cytosolic release of viral RNA products and may assist in guiding their synthesis. Both the cytosolic and luminal portions of this coronavirus crown appear to interact with other viral and cellular factors (65). Potential luminal interactions with other viral RNA synthesis factors could help to coordinate synthesis and release of RNA replication and transcription products. On the crown's cytosolic side, nsp3's ubiquitin-like N terminus interacts with viral RNA and nucleocapsid protein (66-69), greatly enhancing RNA replication, likely by facilitating RNA delivery to the RC (66, 67, 70). As addressed below, in later infection these same nsp3/nucleocapsid interactions may guide encapsidation of progeny genomic RNA.
