You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

75y3 | To study the AAV-x-syn-mediated mechanisms, it is important to use appropriate controls to ensure that the degeneration is not due to protein or RNA overexpression in general. It is also valuable to study whether the control proteins, RNA, or empty vectors are toxic to the dopamine neurons. As mentioned, substantia nigra dopamine neurons are particularly vulnerable to stress and therefore can be easily damaged. Although AAV vectors produce a minimal immune response in the brain [86], the extent of the cellular antiviral defence response in substantia nigra dopamine neurons after AAV vector injections is not known and not well studied. Innate immune responses triggered by pattern recognition receptors in relation to AAV capsids or by DNA are not known; for example, there have been no studies conducted on the relationship of Toll-like receptors and AAV vectors [87]. However, an important study was performed in which the authors observed that AAV9 mediated the overexpression of GFP, a protein from jellyfish, which resulted in an astrocyte-mediated immune response when injected to the nonhuman primate brain, as opposed to AAV carrying a non-foreign protein, which did not end in a toxic response [69]. Additionally, while increasing the titer of an AAV will naturally increase the amount of positive cells and protein expressed, it can also lead to neurodegeneration. In a study in which AAV8 carrying GFP was injected into the substantia nigra of rats, the high dose used caused a 41% loss of dopamine neurons compared to the non-injected side, however the lower dose showed no neurotoxicity [88]. When a chimeric AAV1/2-GFP was used at the same titer as AAV1/2 carrying A53T «-syn, it also caused neuron death in the substantia nigra of rats, but when the titer was lowered to 1:3 or 1:10, no toxicity was observed with GFP [81]. A recent study compared the titers of AAV-x-syn and AAV-GFP and demonstrated that, at a titer of 2 x 1014 gc/mL and higher, GFP resulted in approximately a 62% loss of TH positive cells in the substantia nigra [64]. These studies clearly demonstrate that overexpression-induced dopamine neurodegeneration is not specific to -syn and careful testing and caution needs to be taken with regard to how much virus is used in the control condition, particularly with neurodegeneration studies. And indeed, it has been previously reported that AAV5-eGFP can cause a significant lesion to the dopamine system as the corresponding AAV5-x-syn vector [89]. In addition, immune responses to non-self proteins need to be taken into consideration. We have found that not only the overexpression of GFP via AAV but also the overexpression of RNA that did not translate to any protein, led to degeneration of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease models [65]. Neuronal loss after AAV-mediated transduction is most likely caused by the increased sensitivity of dopamine substantia nigra neurons to stress, due to their properties [10], and the results clearly suggest that it is not only protein overexpression that can be detrimental but also RNA overexpression. Indeed, excessive RNA and/or protein synthesis after AAV-mediated transduction of nigral dopamine neurons can impair proteosome and autophagy pathways, promote formation of stress granules, activate endoplasmic reticulum, and unfolded protein response pathways, collectively leading to synaptic dysfunctions and impaired neuronal activity (Figure 1). The results described above suggest that such overloading of substantia nigra dopamine neurons with either RNA or protein can be caused by the overexpression of WT, mutant «-syn, GFP, untranslated RNA, or perhaps by any non-specific sequence. Therefore, intranigral injections of AAV vectors for dopamine neuron transduction may not be the best method in neurodegeneration studies.
