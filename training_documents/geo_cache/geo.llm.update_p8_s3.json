        "content": "d0ik | Twenty twenty-one. While pure quartz remained always strongly water-wet (brine contact angles less than fifty degrees) for all conditions tested, aged quartz samples were weakly water-wet (brine contact angles fifty to seventy degrees) for most scenarios examined. Al-Yaseri and team reported contact angles for the clay brine and shale brine system based on empirical correlations as a function of pressure and temperature. All clays showed water wetting (zero to less than forty degrees) under all experimental conditions and were shown to be conducive to capillary and residual trapping of the gas. The shale's hydrogen sealing capacity was shown to decrease with increasing depth and TOC values, but remained at strongly water-wet conditions with contact angles of not more than seventeen degrees at highest pressure and TOC. The above measured and estimated data show that rocks are highly water-wet (contact angle less than fifty) in the presence of hydrogen at most storage conditions. However, based on the hydrogen wetting behavior of aged quartz and aged mica, researchers demonstrated that angles may increase to ninety degrees or more at greater depth (three thousand seven hundred meters for quartz), which sets a limit to hydrogen storage capacity below which hydrogen will percolate through the cap rock. In practice however, limitations on the depth are questions of economics and depths greater than one thousand two hundred meters are uncommon in underground gas storage facilities. The optimum storage depth for hydrogen can be computed based on the sealing capacity of the cap rock and the density of hydrogen gas that was estimated to be at one thousand one hundred meters depth assuming average geothermal and hydrostatic gradients. In line with carbon dioxide storage, a minimum depth of eight hundred meters is recommended in order to avoid spoiling potable water resources.\n0x0s | Three point four. Cushion gas requirements\n4exe | The capacity of any gas reservoir consists of two components: cushion gas (also known as base gas), which is used to maintain the minimum reservoir pressure and hence desired production levels, and working gas, which refers to the portion of gas that can be withdrawn and used during a storage cycle. In underground gas storage, the composition of the working and cushion gas is generally the same. The total amount of cushion gas required depends mainly on the type of storage, with pore storages requiring higher cushion gas shares than salt caverns. However, no general recommendations can be made because the proportion of cushion gas in pore storage facilities depends on many reservoir parameters, such as storage volume, permeability and porosity, reservoir geometry, depth and the resulting pressure and temperature conditions. It also depends on technical configurations, such as well distributions, shut-in periods between injection and production, and the respective injection and production rates. In Germany, for example, the cushion gas share in natural gas pore storage facilities active and inactive ranges from twenty-one to ninety-three percent.\n0myz | Unfortunately, there are no direct experiences with pure hydrogen in pore storages we can draw on, but numerical reservoir simulations demonstrate that aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon fields can be operated with reasonable hydrogen recovery rates of seventy-eight to ninety-three percent. Simulations of saline aquifers show that the injected cushion gas can efficiently displace\nxh3i | formation water from injection and production wells, creating the conditions for subsequent hydrogen injection and withdrawal with significant improvements in UHS performance. This also results in a lower demand for cushion gas in deeper structures and reservoirs with higher permeabilities. Since hydrogen in particular involves considerable upfront costs, alternative cushion gas compositions such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide or natural gas have been discussed in the literature to cut costs and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Hence, the possibility of mixing with an inert cushion gas that is present in the reservoir must be considered. Gas mixing depends on viscosity and density contrasts, and is governed by diffusion and dispersion. A process that is particularly important to consider when converting depleted hydrocarbon fields with high gas saturation and low reservoir pressures. However numerical simulations of depleted gas reservoirs indicate that undesired physical phenomena such as viscous fingering caused by mobility and density contrasts are of minor importance in gas saturated reservoirs. Numerical simulations in saline reservoirs with hydrogen and nitrogen as working and cushion gas, respectively, demonstrate likewise the overall feasibility, but stress the importance of optimized injections schemes as the volume-weighted average hydrogen fraction of the produced gas increased from fifty-two percent during the first cycle to eighty-five percent in the fourth cycle. In a most recent study of aquifer storage and withdrawal capacity, researchers demonstrated likewise the operational feasibility and indicated that methane outperforms carbon dioxide and nitrogen in terms of hydrogen recovery. The general feasibility has also been demonstrated in converted town gas storages across Europe. At Beynes, for example, natural gas was being injected on one side of the reservoir from nineteen seventy-two while town gas had been withdrawn from the other side of the reservoir, replacing all of the working and forty percent of the cushion gas with natural gas. Despite the fact that sixty percent of town gas resided in the reservoir, only minimal mixing of gases occurred during conversion, and less than one percent of the withdrawn gas consisted of the original town gas after conversion was completed in nineteen seventy-three. It follows that detailed reservoir models are required to draw accurate conclusions about the demand and cushion gas requirements for any pore storage system, despite its general feasibility.\nsyiw | Three point five. Hydrogen solubility and losses\nkg3t | The solubility of hydrogen in brine water depends on a number of factors, including temperature, pressure, and salinity, but it is generally lower compared to other gases such as carbon dioxide or methane. Hence, less loss due to dissolution is expected compared to other gases. Experimental and modeled data suggest that hydrogen solubility increases with increasing pressure, but decreases with increasing salinity resulting in less than zero point zero zero one of mole fraction of hydrogen at storage conditions. This is important, because dissolved hydrogen may diffuse and leak out of the reservoir resulting in hydrogen loss. The rate of diffusion will likewise depend on a number of factors, including the temperature and pressure. Diffusion rates of hydrogen in brine water can be estimated",
