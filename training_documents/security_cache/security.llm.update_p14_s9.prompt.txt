You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ryvv | Some of the issues involved in responding to a 'Right of Bang' situation will be covered in more detail in the Crisis Management module, but it is worthwhile noting that when something does go wrong, your response will almost certainly consist of a mixture of pre-planned options and responses that you create 'on the hoof'. As the nature of the problem becomes clearer, and you gather more information, the effectiveness of the pre-incident preparation will start to kick in. Effective crisis management is based on the ability to manage the transfer of information around a number of different stake-holders, make decisions under pressure, deploy teams and then receive information from them once they have assessed the situation for themselves. There is also the need to deal with Secondary Consequences, that is, the knock-on effects from the initial problem that will in themselves become problems for your incident management team.
zdrh | The ability to respond effectively to an unexpected event is, in many ways, the ultimate test of a security manager's effectiveness.
osmo | 4.2 Summary
0b8v | The role of the Risk Management procedure is to give the security manager the tools to create viable and realistic risk management programmes capable of responding to the thousands of potential incidents that could possibly occur. The truth is that the vast majority of a security manager's time is taken up dealing with the same few situations that occur on a recurring (and often daily) basis. An effective security management programme should be able to identify the predictable normal incidents that can be dealt with using Standard Operating Procedures, those that need a higher level of management input and decision-making, and those that can be classified as crisis and which could potentially impact significantly on the wider organisation and its activities.
fucs | In summary:
yply | . Risk Management has three component parts: Risk Assessment, Risk Control, Contingency Planning
75n5 | . Risk Value is based on Likelihood and Impact
ec91 | · The Risk Assessment identifies possible Risks, and gives them a Risk Value
wul6 | . Risk Control consists of Protocols introduced to manage the risks identified in the Risk Assessment
4rhy | . Contingency Planning is concerned with the Reponse Options that would be triggered if an unwanted event did occur
092d | . Contingency Planning is also concerned with Secondary Effects that can impact on the organisation as a result of the unwanted incident
94ul | 4.3 Self-assessment exercises
0vdu | Self-assessment 1: Choose any organisation, identify ten potential threats that they might be facing, and then put them into a Risk Matrix based on the likelihood of those events occuring, and the impact it would have if they did occuur.
a230 | Self-assessment 2: Take three of the situations you have identified in Exercise 1, and produce a Risk Control protocol to prevent them from occuring, and which would also allow you to respond effectively if they did occur.
dvoe | 5 Creating a Safe Organisation
677t | 'The purpose of security is to create safety, not respond to danger'.
5hk6 | One of the most effective ways of developing security management systems is to look at how other organisations manage their security programmes, and to learn from how they have managed to balance the various aspects that we have covered in previous sections. This section introduces two organisations that are widely accepted to have developed world class Best Practices for dealing with widely differing threat profiles: one is tasked with managing mass-access but low-threat amusement parks, whilst the other has developed its own security management practices in the face of international terrorism for over forty years. The principles that they have developed to create security management capability across their organisations will be of value for anyone involved in any aspect of security management.
viei | 5.1 Total Security Management
rk0j | Although the 'Creation of a Safe Organisation' is the ultimate objective of any security manager, there are still many differing (and in some case, conflicting) ideas of how that can be achieved.
c6x9 | One of the common models of security management has been 'Threat-Based Management' which was covered in the three-stage Risk Assessment - Risk Control - Contingency Planning model introduced in Section 1.2, which is based on the idea that if you identify all possible threats, and then develop methods ('protocols') to prevent them from happening, you will then have created a safe organisation. The problem is, of course, that you will never run out of possible threats, and the likelihood is that however many threats you think of, the world will throw a new one at you that you hadn't taken into consideration.
g5at | However, another method is to approach the problem from the other side, namely by concentrating on creating security as an integral part of the organisation, and then trusting that any potential problem that might become a threat to the organisation will be identified early enough to manage and deal with before it has the opportunity to escalate into an actual danger. One phrase used to describe this approach is 'Total Security Management'. Although TSM was originally coined to describe the management of vertical risk - that is, through the different levels of supply chain management, so that the end-user was not dependent on the effective management of the previous links in the supply chain that were outside of their control, it can be equally used to describe the total control of territory that comes under a security manager's responsibility. In this way, security management can be seen as a proactive measure designed to create safety, rather than a reactive system that responds to risks, threats and dangers only after they have been detected.
re3j | There are two organisations that are widely recognised to have integrated best-practice security and risk management into every aspect of their wider management operations, one dealing with the issue of normal, daily low impact high-likelihood scenarios, and the other dealing with potentially more serious low-likelihood- high impact threats.
6z45 | The first is Disney World, which has created a self-contained Kingdom within which one of the main selling- points for potential visitors is its safety. Although Disney World is designed to deal with a massive amount of people with the freedom to choose to do a massive amount of different activities, the underlying management system is one based on total control of their territory, so that once you are inside Disney World you are actually experiencing a totally managed experience. The second organization is El Al, the Israeli national airline, which since the first political hijacking of a plane on 21st June 1967 of an El Al plane from Rome to Tel Aviv airport (following the end of the 6-Day War), has maintained security in its airports and planes across the world for 45 years. Despite a couple of notable exceptions, specifically the killing of 26 people in an attack on Lod Airport (now Ben Gurion) in 1972 by members of the Lebanese-trained Japan Red Army, El Al is still considered as perhaps the most effective security management system in the world, and its methodologies are widely accepted as setting the bench-mark for securing mass access public areas. Although Disney World and El Al are seemingly faced with radically different threats, the methods they have devised to manage them are remarkably similar.
