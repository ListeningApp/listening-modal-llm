You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fo3 | 6. An attachment crisis gets catalyzed from the transition into nonmonogamy. I've found that the first four points, once identified, are relatively simple to address and move forward from. The last two points are more complicated and typically need more time and attention to address. The fifth point of how to recover and reinvent yourself when you are going through an awakening of the self-what I also call a crisis of deconstruction-requires more attention than I can allot here, since the focus of this book is the sixth point of how transitioning from monogamy to CNM impacts our attachment.
mwxk | I've observed that the attachment changes in a person's relationship (s) that occur from becoming nonmonogamous are at the foundation of struggles with being CNM (as well as any previous insecure attachment traumas that can get brought into their relationships). Attempting to do CNM with an insecure attach- ment style or having attachment insecurity arise as a result of becoming non- monogamous can seriously disrupt a person's sense of self, as well as their inner and outer safety in ways that can feel unbearable and be unsustainable. When tran- sitioning into nonmonogamy there are several different ways that people expe- rience challenges with their attachment system. Knowing where your specific at- tachment challenges stem from is an important part in healing. Addressing the cause can help you move from being polyinsecure to polysecure. Here are the ways that I see attachment disruptions occur in CNM:
ovs7 | Going CNM can expose your individual attachment insecurity.
0dyv | For some people, monogamy can serve as a stand-in for actual secure attachment. Since the rules and structure of monogamy are so well-known and so strongly rein- forced, many times all you have to do is fall back on the structure of monogamy it- self to create a sense of safety in a relationship. The very fact of being monoga- mously exclusive, verbally committed or legally married can be sufficient enough for some people to feel secure in the relationship. When these people then remove the structure of monogamy by going nonmonogamous, their own insecure attach- ment style can get exposed. In such cases, being monogamous shielded the part- ners from having to face their own insecure attachment history. They may have been somewhat aware of their painful past, but being in a committed monog- amous partnership was enough to assuage their own attachment insecurity. Once the security blanket of monogamy is lifted, these people are flooded with the pains of their insecure attachment past, as well as awareness of the ways they were actu- ally relying on, even clinging to, monogamy to feel secure within themselves and in their relationship.
sl16 | Monogamy can also buffer us from our own personal insecurities. These may or may not be attachment-based, but can be rooted in relational and cultural trau- mas or anxieties about our achievements, looks, intellectual abilities, likability, etc. When we commit to a long-term monogamous partnership or get married, these insecurities may still show up every now and again, but many of them get eclipsed by the very fact that we have someone who has devoted themselves to us, some- one who we think will love us and stay with us no matter how pimply our butt gets, no matter how much our body changes or no matter how stained and worn-out our underwear becomes. In such cases, our self-esteem and sense of self-worth are contingent on our partner being monogamously committed to us instead of an- chored in our own internal sense of self-worth, self-love and self-esteem. When people have depended on their partner's exclusivity for their own self-confidence, going nonmonogamous can pop the cork on all of their personal insecurities, mak- ing it painfully difficult to manage the fears and threats that surface in relation to
lrz1 | what it means for them or their partner to be dating again.
ku5c | Examples of signs that your transition to CNM has exposed your own attach- ment insecurity:
3z35 | . You intellectually want to be nonmonogamous, but you're having trouble with emotionally getting on board.
0xdu | . Even though your partner has been wonderful about meeting enough of your relationship needs and is doing a good job reassuring you that you matter to them, you still experience a roller-coaster of anxiety before and/or during the time they spend with other people, or you start to withdraw to protect your- self.
bpdv | . You intellectually want to feel compersion for your partner having positive ex- periences with others, but you keep interpreting them being with others as a sign of your deficiency.
b0xd | . After opening up, you are flooded with many of your childhood experiences and/or past traumas.
e106 | . After opening up, you realized that you have patterns of emotional/relational avoidance or codependency.
mh8r | Going CNM can expose attachment insecurity in the relationship that is opening up.
ud3i | In the same way that monogamy can mitigate personal attachment insecurities, it can also conceal attachment insecurities that are relationally based. As a couple opens up from a monogamous relationship, they usually perceive themselves as having been healthy and secure together. But, as the structure of monogamy is lift- ed, issues in the relationship that the couple didn't have to face before can appear, or issues that were ignored or tolerated can no longer be ignored or tolerated in the new structure of nonmonogamy. On both this point and the previous point, I see people depending on the relationship structure for their security instead of their ac- tual relational experience with their partner. When the structure is removed, they are faced with all of the ways that the relationship was not functioning. CNM is inherently insecure.
8qfv | Unlike the built-in security that can ostensibly come from being monogamous, CNM is a relationship structure that is inherently insecure. In CNM, we don't have the security of knowing that a partner is with us because they see us as the best, one or only partner out there for them. In CNM we may not be the only or first per- son that our partner turns to or the last one they say goodnight to. In CNM we are less likely to meet new partners when they or we are single and able to create a new life together. Instead, we often have to figure out how to fit together alongside pre- existing structures and commitments with other partners. Furthermore, in CNM we are opening ourselves up to people who could become game changers for us or for our partner. Of course, game changers arise in monogamous relationships too, but in CNM we are intentionally going out to open our hearts and our bodies to more and different people who can potentially shake up our other relationships in un- foreseen ways. Also, and importantly, in CNM we don't have all of the cultural and institutionalized support that our society has created for the monogamous couple.
iers | The insecurity in CNM can actually be a good thing in that it can keep us from taking our partners for granted or becoming complacent in our relationships in ways that are often found in monogamous relationships. Personally, I find security in the fact that when I'm in CNM relationships I know that my partners are not with me because they are obliged to be, but because they continue to choose to be. However, the inherent insecurity in CNM relationships can be grinding. This form of relationship can bring up levels of uncertainty that many people are not yet equipped for, especially when they don't have enough internal secure attachment. To create sustainable healthy relationships with multiple partners, it's crucial to learn how to build polysecurity in your CNM relationships and even more so to cultivate secure attachment and equanimity within yourself.
z6h3 | Having multiple partners can replicate the conditions of attachment insecurity.
