You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

y4mj | 3. ECOTHERAPY
vpgq | In addition to carbon awareness in traditional health care, patients may seek unconventional ecotherapy. Ecotherapy is not necessarily sustainable, but it has environmental resonance.54 Ecotherapy may encom- pass "prescriptions for nature"55 such as walks in a for- est, going outside more,56 attending a nature retreat, or participating in other forms of open-air recreation.57 While the medicalization of nature is problematic, as it may lead to instrumentalization, many patients find
ousl | 646
m4ju | medical legitimacy through the word "therapy" and retain use of the term. To be sure, patients may still utilize traditional medicine and may not be concerned with reducing their impact on the environment. In fact, if ecotherapy is used as a conjunctive to tradi- tional medicine it can require more total resources. This inconsistency is part and parcel of health care; even as some patients try to be healthier in one area of life, such as not smoking, they may flout health care wisdom in other areas, like physical activity.
a0mb | B. Physicians
ki8m | The notion of activism - particularly in the envi- ronmental movement - often invokes the image of protests, people holding signs, chaining themselves to a tree, or acts of civil disobedience that may result in arrest.58 While using the label "activist" in ecology may be viewed by some as synonymous with a liberal agenda, white privilege, or even a eugenic Malthusian- ism, physician activism in environmental initiatives is frequently indicative of a dedication to the health of all, not just the elite few. Physicians for Social Respon- sibility (PSR) have been active for over 50 years. As the group developed, an "Environment and Health Com- mittee" was added as an area of focus. Topics under this banner include environmental concerns such as fracking, climate and health, and clean energy.59 PSR are motivated by activism on "issues that represent the gravest dangers to human health." Doctor activ- ists also urge the nation to act on climate change60 and draft position papers on climate change and health.61
km8w | Physicians are concerned with the amount of waste they emit in the course of their work; 62 with the struc- tural design of their health care facilities;63 and with the toxicity of their work environment.64 The Uni- versity of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) began a Green Health Center project almost two decades ago with the objective to "engage in educational and research programs that support this aim (of sustain- ability) and to begin the process of redesigning our own institution toward sustainability."65 Other medi- cal centers, particularly those affiliated with universi- ties, have followed by developing their own pathways to greener health care facilities.66 Green health centers across the country are supported by physician leader- ship and maintained by policies and practices within hospitals.
wzno | 3. GREEN TEAMS
xagm | Green Teams are a smaller group of health care pro- fessionals who may or may not be situated within a
iwn5 | Green Health Center. At the Massachusetts General Hospital for Children at Harvard Medical School, a Green Team of medical professionals were organized "to develop high impact strategies towards the cre- ation of a zero-carbon emissions model in the PICU" (pediatric intensive care unit).67 The Green Team col- lected waste and itemized the excess. By identifying areas for waste reduction - such as returning unused equipment to a storage space - they were able to reduce their waste while providing excellent patient care.
uooz | 4. GREEN PRESCRIPTIONS
pxbq | Some physicians attempt to green their prescribing practices through a mixture of preventative health care advice and low-carbon treatments. It is widely documented that plant-based diets have numer- ous health benefits and are less resource intensive than meat based diets.68 In recognition of this, some physicians are recommending plant based diets as a medical standard for global carbon reduction and better health outcomes.69 Maximilian Andreas Storz declares, "plant-based diets are a powerful tool - not using and advocating for them is not only unethical, but harms patients and the planet alike."70 Vegetarian and vegan diets have become more prevalent in soci- ety and thus more accessible.71 Green prescriptions combine the legitimacy of physician-directed advice with environmental ethics.
jfsr | 5. EDUCATION
u15r | Physicians provide education to peers through Grand Rounds, on-the-job training, and in continuing edu- cation. Medical educators argue that "health care pro- viders require training on the connections between the climate, ecosystems, sustainability, and health and their responsibility and capacity in changing the status quo,"72 which is largely wasteful. In an effort to support this education, Dr. Rebecca Philipsborn at the Emory School of Medicine has developed a virtual 4- week Climate Change and Health curriculum, which includes topics and syllabi to be implemented in other medical schools.73 It should also be noted that the UK also has a significant amount of curriculum develop- ment around sustainable health care.74
lq35 | Other educational resources include articles on functionally green initiatives, which may employ con- cepts such as "Choosing wisely,"75 not using "Too Much Medicine,"76 avoiding "do not do" practices,77 optimiz- ing "high value care,"78 or minimizing its opposite - "low value care."79 Publications written in different countries are accessed by those in the United States, thus reflecting the culturally relevant reach of green physician education.80

d09o | III. Rationale for Participation in Green Initiatives
ylhz | Highlighting the green initiatives that patients and physicians participate in and probing their motiva- tions for such participation permits strategic devel- opment of areas of consensus in sustainable health care, which can lead to green health care reform. This section speculates on broad trends in participa- tion in green health care initiatives. Patients appear to participate in green initiatives based on a valuing of nature and the desire to reduce health care issues. Doctor participation in green health care initiatives stems from an investment in health promotion and discomfort with wasteful hospital practices.
a3td | A. Patients
ex5k | Sustainability is important to patients.81 Patient involvement in sustainable health care - as with other pro-environmental actions - may be driven by a con- cern for nature having intrinsic worth, or the assess- ment that nature has instrumental worth.82 In the for- mer, nature should be preserved for the good it has in itself. This is similar to a "deep ecology" perspective,83 where animals and plants are independently valuable. In the latter, individuals want to enjoy nature, use nat- ural resources, or have these opportunities available for future human generations. Both the non-anthro- pocentric and anthropocentric perspectives guards against overuse of health care resources in order to create a better environment.
9d4o | 2. REDUCE HEALTH ISSUES
cjq2 | "Climate change anxiety" has emerged as a new mental health issue84 affecting those who worry pathologically about the deteriorating planet.85 Patient participation in green initiatives may be an attempt to manage cli- mate change anxiety, or it can be part of therapy for dealing with anxiety. Climate change anxiety may be regarded as an American luxury, whereas psychologi- cal issues arising from climate change health hazards - such as post-traumatic stress from climate events and fear of experiencing future climate change health hazards - require global attention. However, the entire spectrum of health care issues related to envi- ronmental destruction warrant attention.86 By reduc- ing resource use in health care, patients may be able to minimize health issues associated with climate change.
5esx | B. Physicians
m5ka | 1. HEALTH PROMOTION
byu8 | It could easily be argued that a doctor's primary motivation for practicing medicine is the health and
76b0 | wellbeing of patients. Since climate change is a rec- ognized health threat, some professionals see it as their obligation to practice sustainability measures in order to reduce the effects of climate change.87 Patient health could be subsumed into the broader obligations toward public health, the commitment to the healing profession, and professionalism.88 Physicians who participate in green initiatives may do so as a matter of personal integrity and professional responsibility.89
zxz6 | Effective health care reform will require compliance across the board.
xnth | Health care administrators must support sustainable health care initiatives financially and socially through hospital policies. Governmental structures, including health care programs must be invested in sustainable health care through federal and state regulations, and local policies. Accreditation bodies that mange medical education, building safety, and health care professional licensure need to integrate sustainability into their ethos.
vafm | 2. DISCOMFORT WITH WASTE
2zmw | Physicians and other health care providers are at the terminus of the production chain. As they provide care, they use and dispose of resources. When surveyed, a majority of surgeons and physicians were troubled by the amount of waste they generate.90 Obstetrician/ gynecologists91 and ophthalmologists exhibit similar concerns.92 The concept of moral distress has gener- ally been applied to end-of-life care,93 but it is also rel- evant for compulsory participation in unsustainable health care practices.94 Green initiatives may be an attempt to counteract environmental distress.
bf9k | IV. Towards Green Health Care Reform
otkr | Effective health care reform will require compliance across the board. Health care administrators must support sustainable health care initiatives financially and socially through hospital policies. Governmental structures, including health care programs must be invested in sustainable health care through federal and state regulations, and local policies. Accredita- tion bodies that mange medical education, building safety, and health care professional licensure need to integrate sustainability into their ethos.95 These are, by and large, beyond the scope of this paper. Here, the focus will remain on developing areas of consensus for patient and physician participation in sustainability initiatives, since this at once provides a path to, and legitimizes, green health care reform.
ibgs | Among patients and physicians participating in green initiatives, there appears to be consensus
colo | 648
d6r4 | around the themes of "health" and "ecology." Health - as an umbrella term for the wellbeing and harmony of the body and the planet - emerges as a focus of green initiatives. Both patients and physicians desire good physical health, which includes absence from pollu- tion and climate events. They also seek mental equi- librium by avoiding eco-anxiety and environmental moral distress. Many public health paradigms braid physical, mental, and environmental aspects of well-
9mrz | being into one holistic model.96 These paradigms can be integrated into broader aspects of health care. Ecol- ogy is also an encompassing concept, which includes resource conservation, waste reduction, sustainable care, and carbon management. Both patients and physicians invested in green health care are working to lighten their carbon impact. It is likely that other forms of resource reduction would be considered in US health care as well.
pk06 | Green health care reform will require sweeping implementation of sustainability initiatives. Patients and physicians can lobby health care plans and health care insurance companies by highlighting the values of health and ecology. The former can be developed through green health care plans for policyholders and the latter through green health care insurance companies.
7wn9 | A. Health and the Green Health Care Plan
wcd0 | The most recent statistics on health care coverage in the US show that two thirds of Americans are privately insured.97 As part of the free market, the American health care system has the potential for great agility as it seeks to entice the individual patient-consumer. Sustainable health care plans can utilize existing frameworks of insurance coverage while respecting the environmental preferences of individual policyholders by, for instance, offering a "Green" tier of coverage in addition to Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum.98
caos | A Green tier health care plan would be a more sus- tainable choice than current health care insurance
qrvy | options. For instance, a Green tier health care plan may have a variety of low-carbon procedures to choose from. Preventative care initiatives, such as gym subsi- dies,99 would be more generously reimbursed, while extended medications, low-success treatments, or elective procedures may be limited. Green tier health care plans could be similar to the multi-level approach proposed by Tom Beauchamp and James Childress, whereby basic health care plans include "public health measures and preventive care, primary care, (and) acute care,"100 while minimizing financial burden to the policyholder. While there may be a concern that a Green tier health care plan would be the default offered by parsimonious employers, thus resulting in minimal coverage,101 sustainable health care plans may not be less expensive than other options.
pn9j | Indeed, the Green plan could cost more, and a percent of premiums could be put towards ensuring that the health care plan provider is offering the most sustainable option, similar to buying "carbon offsets" when one purchases an airline ticket102 or paying more for a health care plan with more coverage. In the for- mer scenario, the extra cost is voluntarily incurred for the environmental trade-off, or because it is required by law.103 In the latter, the extra cost is seen as value- added to a necessary service. As with other sustain- able, but more expensive options, the individual who chooses the green health care plan would likely feel satisfied knowing that she is making the better envi- ronmental choice.
1pmc | Since health care plan tiers are the voluntary choice of policyholders, the individual would enjoy the appar- ent "sacrifice" they are making in limiting certain high- carbon options, while still being assured of quality, value-driven care. An analogy might be choosing a veg- etarian meal at a restaurant. Not everyone will want to "give up" meat, but those attuned to health, carbon expenditure, and the moral claims of others will readily make a sustainable choice, and indeed, be distressed if there are not opportunities to express one's envi- ronmental values. And, like any health care plan, an individual could switch to a different tier during open enrolment if they wanted more resource intensive options, or pay out of pocket for non-covered services.
5z6q | Companies would be incentivized to offer Green tier health care plans to make themselves more appeal- ing for employee recruitment.104 Shrewd health care plans will find inexpensive ways to offer sustainable health care that maintain access to basic health needs in response to patient and doctor demands. Even if a Green tier plan is not offered as part of health care reform, best environmental practices should be incen- tivized; the green option should be the economical option.

b8hf | B. Ecology and the Green Insurance Company
hntf | Governmental regulations which would adopt a comprehensive, legally binding model of sustainable health care - such as the one utilized by the United Kingdom's National Health Service-would likely be rejected by US residents as overly restrictive. How- ever, the health care free market gives great lati- tude for health care plans (e.g., Blue Cross or United Health Care) to determine which medical treatments and services they will offer based on patient prefer- ences. Moreover, the free market and decentraliza- tion permit companies to become more sustainable independently.
99fo | A green health care insurance company would be accountable for environmentally sound practices. From fair-exchange coffee, to "cruelty free" cosmetics, to locally grown food, more customers are willing to support companies that unite ethics with the product they supply. Each year, a handful of articles call on health care to divest from fossil fuel sources.105 Sustain- able energy and investment in renewable sources are two ways an insurance company can be green. Alter- natively, a green insurance company might choose to partner only with health care facilities that are mem- bers of organizations which actively participate in sus- tainability initiatives, such as Practice GreenHealth,106 Health Care Without Harm,107 the Healthier Hospitals Initiative,108 and the Catholic Health Association.109
y5r7 | To be sure, insurance companies are dependent on many different supply chains. For instance, phar- maceuticals are known environmental menaces110 and consistently one of the largest carbon emitters in health care.111 Requiring environmental accountability from drug companies would be a significant first step for greening insurance companies, with ample data to support the move.112 Once sustainability measures are in place, insurance companies can brand themselves as green, thus rising as visible leaders in green health care reform.
