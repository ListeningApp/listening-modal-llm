You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

afbe | SNV and ASB annotation
78r8 | Genomic annotation. To annotate SNVs according to their genomic location (Fig. 3c), we started with mapping SNVs to FANTOM5 enhancers and promoters62. The remaining SNVs were annotated with ChIPseeker63 with a hierarchical assignment of the following categories: promoter (≤1 kb), promoter
320g | (1-2 kb), promoter (2-3 kb), 5'UTR, 3'UTR, Exon, Intron, Downstream, Inter- genic. For clarity, promoter (≤1 kb) and 5'UTR categories were both tagged as "promoter"; promoter (1-2 kb) and promoter (2-3 kb) were both tagged as "upstream."
tp8g | Sequence motif analysis of ASBs. For TF ASBs, we annotated the corresponding SNVs with sequence motif hits of the respective TFs. To this end, we used models from HOCOMOCO v11 core collection64 and SPRY-SARUS65 for motif finding. The top-scoring motif hit was taken considering both Ref and Alt alleles, and, at this fixed position, the "motif FC" was calculated as the log2-ratio of motif <LATEX>P</LATEX> values at the reference and alternative variants so that the positive FC corresponded to the preference of the alternative allele.
gxfd | To analyze the ASB motif concordance (Fig. 4), we considered the ASB SNVs (min(FDRRef <LATEX>\left. F D R _ { A l t } \right) \leq 0 . 0 5</LATEX> that overlapped the predicted TF-binding site: (min (motif <LATEX>P \quad v a l u e R e f</LATEX> motif <LATEX>\left. P \text { value } _ { A ! t } \right) \leq 0 . 0 0 0 5 ,</LATEX> and had |FC| ≥ 2. We defined the motif concordance/discordance as a match/mismatch of the signs of FC and
s2v1 | <LATEX>\Delta \mathrm { F D R } = \log _ { 1 0 } \left( \mathrm { F D R } _ { \mathrm { A l t } } \right) - \log _ { 1 0 } \left( \mathrm { F D R } _ { \mathrm { R e f } } \right) .</LATEX> Annotation of ASBs with phenotype associations. To assess enrichment of ASBs within phenotype-associated SNPs, we used the data from four different SNP- phenotype associations databases, namely: (1) NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog36, release 8/27/2019 with EFO mappings66 used to group phenotypes by their parent terms for Supplementary Fig. 9; (2) ClinVar catalog37, release 9/05/2019 (entries with "likely pathogenic," "pathogenic," or "risk factor" clinical significance); (3) PheWAS catalog38; (4) BROAD fine-mapping catalog of causal autoimmune dis- ease variants39. All entries were systematized in the form of triples <dbSNP ID, phenotype, database>. Next, the entries were annotated with the TF- or cell type- ASB data.
jkp9 | To evaluate TF-phenotype associations in detail, we used NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog and the following pipeline:
z8tt | (1) We filtered out TFs with less than two candidate ASBs, and phenotypes associated with less than two SNPs, resulting in 765 TFs and 2688 phenotypes suitable for the analysis. For each TF, we considered all SNPs with candidate ASBs passing the coverage thresholds.
9g22 | (2) For each pair of a TF and a phenotype, we calculated the odds ratio and the <LATEX>P</LATEX> value of the one-tailed Fisher's exact test on SNPs with candidate ASBs considering two binary features: whether the SNP is associated with the phenotype, and whether the SNP is included in ASB candidates of the particular TF. The superset of SNPs was collected independently for each TF by gathering SNPs with candidate ASBs for all TFs but only from LD blocks42 containing either TF-specific SNPs or phenotype-associated SNPs. The P values were then FDR corrected for multiple tested TFs separately for each phenotype.
41fx | Analysis of eQTLs and eQTL target genes. To analyze an overlap between ASBs and eQTLs, we used significant <variant, gene> pairs from GTEx41 (release V8).
7um8 | To evaluate ASB-driven eQTL target genes' associations with medical phenotypes, a one-tailed Fisher's exact test was performed on the enrichment of protein-coding genes of medical relevance (6026 genes found linked with entries with "pathogenic," "likely pathogenic," or "risk factor" clinical significance in Clin Var catalog37) among eQTL target genes of ASB SNPs (16,865 protein-coding genes according to GTEx), considering all human protein-coding genes from GENCODE67 (v35, 19,929 gene symbols) as the background set.
uow2 | ASB prediction with machine learning. In our work, we used a standard software implementation of the random forest model from the scikit-learn package. The number of estimators was set to 500 and the other parameters were defaults. Three feature types were used (Supplementary Table 4): allele-specific chromatin DNase accessibility, synthetic data from neurons from the last layer of the DeepSEA11, and HOCOMOCO motif predictions obtained with SPRY-SARUS65. As a global set of SNVs, we used 231,355 dbSNP IDs overlapping between ADASTRA and Maurano
iat7 | et al.16 data, which provided allele-specific DNase accessibility. For the general model, we used SNVs with ASBs for any of TFs or in any of cell types as members of the positive class, and the remaining set of candidate SNVs as members of the negative class. For TF- and cell type-specific assessment, we defined ASB and non- ASB SNVs for a particular TF or in a particular cell type as the positive and negative class, respectively.
