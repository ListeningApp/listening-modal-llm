Because\nsknv | exp(-(E) =exp(-ßE1) ... exp(-BEN),\nusuw | the partition function Za is a product of integrals which are all equal:\nd4hr | BJR3 e-Bp·p/2m d3pd3q h3 .\nph8j | Za =\nbemf | The integral in the parentheses is the partition function of a single particle in a box. We have already seen that this equals\ns9l9 | JB JR3 e - Bp.p/2m d3pd3q _V h3\nbs07 | A cubed\ny6eq | where A is the thermal wavelength. Thus we have\n0tl4 | Za =\nvbq2 | We can also do this calculation with a lot less work using Puzzle thirty-six. This implies that when we build a new system from N identical noninteracting copies of some old system, the partition function of the new system is the Nth power of the partition function of the old system. What I just did is show this in a special case.\npfrt | GAS OF DISTINGUISHABLE PARTICLES: ENTROPY\niws8 | In thermal equilibrium, an ideal gas of N distinguishable classical particles of mass M in a three-dimensional box of volume V has expected energy\nn452 | expected energy equals kNT\nztct | and free energy\nenir | A cubed N VN\ne4d4 | Fa equals negative kT ln\nd8ta | where A equals h over square root of two pi m k T is the thermal wavelength. Its entropy Sa is expected energy minus Fa over T, so\nc9cw | Sa equals kN ln N (lnN + three)\nb93o | We use the subscript d for a gas of N distinguishable particles. Since the energy is a quadratic function of three N variables, the equipartition theorem says the expected energy is expected energy equals kNT.\ntjqy | The free energy F is minus Boltzmann's constant times the logarithm of the partition function, which we just computed:\n58xg | Fa equals negative kln Za equals negative kln\n70zf | Thus the entropy of the gas is\nxnbe | Sa equals expected energy minus Fa T V( 3 +2). h equals\nuv86 | A equals square root of two pi m k T three two Tm h squared plus two\ngksi | If we expand this out using\noh7q | we get the formula I promised earlier:\n6gn8 | Sa equals kN (lnV +lnkT +ln\nyun5 | The only advantage of this messier formula is that it separates out the temperature dependence and the volume dependence.\nvdx2 | THE GIBBS \"PARADOX\"\n4k9e | For the ideal gas of N distinguishable classical particles in a box of volume V, the entropy\nkeds | Sa equals kN ln V plus ln kT plus ln three\nugy5 | two three two Tm plus three h squared two\nyhw8 | more than doubles if we double both N and V while keeping everything else the same. This confused people for a while, so it's called the 'Gibbs paradox'.\no7zq | Start with a box B containing an ideal gas of distinguishable classical particles. Then double the volume of the box to get a new box B', and double the number of particles in the box too, while keeping the temperature and everything else the same.\nhqd5 | We might expect the entropy to double. After all, we could take the doubled box and slip a thin wall down the middle to get two identical copies of the original box. So the entropy should be twice as big now. Right?\nsu3f | Apparently not! Instead of just doubling the kN ln V term in the original entropy, we are replacing it with two kN ln( 2V ), which is more than twice as big. The reason is that in the doubled box B' each individual particle has twice as much room to roam than if you put a wall down the middle. Thus, it takes more information to say where all the particles are.\ns1l7 | While there's no real paradox here, people found this result deeply counterintuitive, so they called it the 'Gibbs paradox'. And in fact they had a good reason for being suspicious of this result. It would be correct if gas molecules were distinguishable. But in fact molecules of the same kind are not distinguishable they don't have little labels on them that let you recognize which is which. And if we take this fact into account, our formula for the entropy changes. Let's see how!\n12yz | GAS OF INDISTINGUISHABLE PARTICLES: PARTITION FUNCTION\n0xfx | The partition function of an ideal gas of N indistinguishable classical particles of mass M in a three-dimensional box B of volume V is\nbg91 | Zi(B) equals Za(B) divided by N factorial\nbsog | beta cubed N over two equals one VN N factorial h cubed N\no7e8 | Thus\nxjy8 | Zi(B) equals N factorial A cubed N one VN\n6746 | where A equals h square root of eight over two pi m\nr5zg | The partition function Zi for a gas of N indistinguishable particles is one over N factorial times that for a gas of distinguishable particles. Why? We got Za by integrating exp negative beta E over the space of ordered N-tuples of position-momentum pairs. The energy E here does not change if we permute our N-tuple, so we can also think of it as a function of unordered N-tuples. Then we get Zi by integrating exp negative beta E over the space of such unordered tuples. Notice that there are N factorial ordered N-tuples for each unordered N-tuple, except for N-tuple with repeated entries, which form a set of measure zero and thus contribute nothing to the integral. Thus, we should not be surprised that\nhk56 | Zi(B) equals Za(B) divided by N factorial.\n29ac | But we've seen\nno4d | Za(B)= A cubed N VN\nnh8n | where A is the thermal wavelength, so\nircn | Zi(B) equals N factorial A cubed N divided by VN\nnpsf | Making this sketchy argument precise requires more notation. I think carefully doing the case N equals two is the best way for you to see what's going on.\ndynl | GAS OF INDISTINGUISHABLE PARTICLES: ENTROPY\nmsij | In thermal equilibrium, an ideal gas of N indistinguishable classical particles of mass M in a three-dimensional box of volume V has expected energy\n8n3m | expected energy equals three over two k N T and free energy\nech9 | free energy equals minus k T ln one over N factorial V to the N over lambda cubed N where lambda equals h over square root of two pi m k T is the thermal wavelength.\np94v | Its entropy Si is expected energy minus free energy divided by T, so\ngf1i | Si equals k N ln V over lambda cubed plus three over two  minus k ln N factorial. We use the subscript i for a gas of N indistinguishable particles. Since the energy is a quadratic function of the three N momentum variables, the equipartition theorem says the expected energy of this gas is\nrouh | expected energy equals three over two k N T. The free energy F is minus Boltzmann's constant times the logarithm of the partition function, which we just computed:\n```",
