This mouse model demonstrates flow-dependent atherosclerosis development within a single carotid artery. Both animal models have been used in numerous laboratories worldwide and are extremely valuable tools to study flow-dependent endothelial cell function and atherogenic mechanisms in vivo. One major difference between the models is that in the PCL model, atherosclerotic plaques form throughout the entire length, approximately one centimeter, of the LCA, whereas the contralateral RCA remains healthy and serves as a control. Therefore, this model provides sufficient endothelial samples from the LCA and RCA from the same animal to conduct omics studies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, or bulk RNA sequencing, unlike the cuff model, which provides relatively smaller amounts of endothelial samples.\nwtow | In addition to these mouse models of disturbed flow-induced atherosclerosis, the use of zebrafish has emerged as a genetically tractable model to examine early events of atherogenesis. Combined with genetic manipulation approaches to reduce blood flow, zebrafish models provide further evidence that disturbed flow causes atherosclerosis under hypercholesterolemic conditions. An interesting question is whether disturbed flow-induced atherosclerosis occurs with other risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, independently of hypercholesterolemia.\no22k | In vitro flow models\nnwfz | Numerous in vitro models of shear stress, including the cone-and-plate viscometer, the parallel-plate flow chamber and the microfluidic channel have been developed and have been reviewed previously. These in vitro bioreactors expose endothelial cells to various shear conditions and can be used to determine the detailed mechanisms of shear stress-dependent endothelial function in a well-defined biomechanical environment.\nnvfy | Blood flow regulates endothelial function\nmror | Endothelial cells in vivo are constantly exposed to various hemodynamic factors, especially shear stress associated with blood flow, which potently regulates nearly all facets of endothelial cell function. Blood flow regulates vascular tone; endothelial barrier permeability; angiogenesis; endothelial cell proliferation, death, differentiation, senescence, metabolism, inflammation and morphology; and extracellular matrix remodeling. Defining the mechanisms by which stable flow protects endothelial homeostatic function and disturbed flow induces endothelial dysfunction is crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of flow-dependent atherosclerosis and developing novel therapeutic approaches.\nzlxc | Blood flow potently regulates endothelial barrier function. Stable flow protects endothelial barrier permeability, whereas disturbed flow promotes endothelial barrier dysfunction. Stable flow regulates endothelial cell permeability by promoting tight junction stability via control of occludin expression and attachment to the actin cytoskeleton, as well as control of adherens junction integrity via phosphorylation and degradation of VE-cadherin. Disturbed flow increases both endothelial cell proliferation and apoptosis via multiple mechanisms, including downregulation of the expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and inhibition of the anti-apoptotic kinase AKT. Stable flow induces autophagy through a sirtuin one-dependent and FOXO one-dependent pathway, providing a cytoprotective mechanism for endothelial cells. Disturbed flow induces endothelial cell senescence through a\nk0bw | p53-dependent and sirtuin one-dependent mechanism, thereby reducing endothelial cell migration and disrupting arterial repair mechanisms.\naq5a | Blood flow also regulates metabolism and redox reactions in endothelial cells. Whereas stable flow reduces endothelial glucose uptake and metabolic activity as well as the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in glycolysis, disturbed flow promotes glycolytic metabolism, causing a markedly different metabolomic profile and increased mitochondrial fission. Disturbed flow also increases the endothelial production of reactive oxygen species, or R O S, and oxidative stress. This process is mediated by bone morphogenetic protein four, which induces increased production of superoxide via NADPH oxidases and endothelial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling-dependent mechanisms. Endothelial R O S generation in response to disturbed flow increases vascular oxidative stress and LDL oxidation in the context of atherosclerosis and hypertension.\nsc5y | Disturbed flow potently induces endothelial cell inflammation and transdifferentiation of endothelial cells, which have crucial roles in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Disturbed flow induces endothelial inflammation by increasing the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules, VCAM one, ICAM one, and E-selectin, which mediate monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. Activation of nuclear factor-K B signaling is crucial in disturbed flow-induced inflammation. In addition, disturbed flow promotes the expression of cytokines and chemokines such as I L one, I L six and C C L five. Disturbed flow can induce the transdifferentiation of endothelial cells to mesenchymal cells, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition; EndMT, and immune-like cells, endothelial-to-immune cell transition; EndIT. The pathophysiological importance of EndMT in disturbed flow-induced atherosclerosis has been demonstrated, but the validation and relevance of EndIT in atherosclerosis remain to be determined. Increased endothelial cell turnover under disturbed flow conditions also coincides with increased transcription of genes encoding angiogenic factors and with increased neovascularization.\n0yab | Morphologically, endothelial cells adopt an elongated, fusiform shape and align to the direction of flow under stable flow conditions. By contrast, endothelial cells under disturbed flow or no-flow static conditions adopt a polygonal, 'cobblestone' shape without uniform alignment. These morphological changes are accompanied by actin cytoskeleton remodeling from a pattern of bands encircling the periphery of the cell to a pattern of thick, central stress fibers aligned in the direction of shear stress. These cytoskeletal changes alter intercellular stress and cellular traction forces, affecting subsequent cellular strain and status. In addition, shear stress induces subcellular structural changes, such as changes in nuclear shape and relocation of the Golgi apparatus towards the upstream flow direction.\nw95z | Mechanosensors and mechanotransduction\n0i1k | Endothelial cells transduce flow signals into intracellular changes through the processes of mechanosensing and mechanosignal transduction. Endothelial cells recognize fluid shear stress through mechanosensors located in the apical and basal surfaces of the cell, in cell-cell junctions and intracellularly. On the apical surface, the mechanosensors include plasma membrane proteins, such as the cation channels PIEZO one and P two X purinoreceptor four, NOTCH one, protein kinases, G protein-coupled receptors and plexin D one, as well as membrane-associated structures, such as caveolae, the glycocalyx and primary cilia. PIEZO one is an inward-rectifying calcium channel present in many cell types that opens in response to mechanical force. In endothelial cells, PIEZO one mediates shear stress magnitude-dependent increases in\n```",
