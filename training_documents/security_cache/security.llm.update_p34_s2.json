        "content": "7hgg | One of the hidden effects of organisational complexity is that it blurs lines of responsibility. In some cases, complexity is introduced specifically to allow people to avoid individual responsibility for decisions and policies that they know to be questionable, flawed or even illegal. Many of the major incidents that hit the national headlines are a direct result of organisational over-complexity that left a vacuum where clear responsibility and leadership should have been. This includes the Federal Emergency Management Agency response to Hurricane Katrina, the Japanese government's response to the Fukushima disaster, the BP response to Deepwater Horizon Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the G4S failure to supply security personnel to the London two thousand twelve Olympics, or the BBC's failure to adequately respond to the issue surrounding Jimmy Savile and accusations of child abuse within the organisation.\nxwsv | The problem with complexity is not just a theoretical problem, but is reflected in almost every aspect of operation management. The more complex an operation becomes (especially if the additional complexity seems to be unnecessary), the more likely it is to lead to serious, and perhaps catastrophic, failure. Example of how the break-up of British Rail into separate companies, each of which had the responsibility for a separate aspect of the overall operation, is just one example of how additional complexity can lead to management breakdown and eventual disaster.\n756b | Seven point seven Case Study: Railtrack - Complexity and Disaster\n6bx7 | One of the clearest cases of the connection between complexity and loss of organisational control was Railtrack, the company that was created after the privatisation of the railway system by the Conservative government in one thousand nine hundred ninety-six. Formerly known as British Rail, the nature of the railway network was already extremely complex, with a high degree of interconnectedness and mutual systems-dependency - (ten thousand three hundred forty-six miles of track and signalling, forty thousand bridges and viaducts, fifty tunnels, two thousand five hundred eight stations, fifteen hundred signal boxes, nine thousand level crossings). Although there were organisational problems with BR before the break-up, at least there was one organisation that was responsible for the entire system, and which had clear lines of responsibility for its maintenance and management.\nspl6 | After nationalisation, different section of BR were broken up into autonomous organisations, each responsible for a specific area of operations, and often developing a competitive or even adversarial relationship with other areas of operation. The trains and rolling stock were owned by three separate companies, that in turn leased them out to twenty-five different train operating companies. Railtrack owned the track, but its role was purely administrative. Responsibility for the maintenance of the track (a critical factor in the operation) was subcontracted to other companies, which although they were then tasked with the responsibility for the maintenance of the track, in turn subcontracted it out to other companies to actually deliver the work. Railtrack did not have its own engineering department, and did not have the technical knowledge within the company to oversee the maintenance work, or even to gauge whether it was being delivered effectively.\n7wzm | Another consequence of the break-up of BR was that rather than acting as a single entity with different divisions, each division acted in order to maximise its own profit and minimise any potential liability. This meant that the highly critical and immensely complex network of relationships between the new companies were controlled by detailed contracts, each of which tried to micromanage extremely complex operations. There were two hundred twenty-four separate legal agreements covering freight contracts, and apportioning responsibility for delays was based on one thousand nine hundred checkpoints, two hundred four predefined delay causes, and one thousand three hundred delay-attribution points. Railtrack employed fifty people just to account for delays in the Southern region alone. These contractual relationships led to increasingly bitter legal actions between the various companies, which in turn led to a breakdown in overall service delivery. Although the government still held nominal responsibility for overseeing the running of Railtrack, that was equally murky, with a raft of different organisations involved in the oversight, including the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising, the Office of the Rail Regulator, Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate, the British Railway Board, the Rail Passengers Council, and the Transport Secretary. It will be no surprise that rather than working cooperatively and collaboratively, these government agencies often saw each other as rivals for power and influence, and spent more time trying to out-manoeuvre each other than concentrating on the actual objectives.\ne9xj | Thirty-four\n9vl6 | The consequences of this organisational complexity became tragically clear on the morning of seventeenth October two thousand, when an Intercity train travelling at one hundred fifteen miles an hour was derailed near Hatfield, with the death of four passengers and over seventy injured. Subsequent enquiries found that the cause of the derailment was the failure to repair damaged tracks, despite the fact that the damage and potential consequences were known. The official review into the incident laid the blame for the accident squarely on the lack of clear responsibility for the management of the tracks. This accident led to massive disruption of national rail services (with an estimated loss to UK businesses of six million pounds per day), and ultimately caused Railtrack to go into administration in two thousand two.\nc2fd | Seven point eight Regular Reviews\njzvp | One of the fundamental developments in security management since nine eleven has been the realisation that rather than something that is limited to a security department, security management should be an integral part of every aspect of an organisation's operations and culture. In a similar way, security protocols are no longer seen as static things that are written and then forgotten, but are living documents that develop and evolve in the same way that any other part of the organisation would develop and evolve. Regular reviews of every aspect of the security management system play an important role in ensuring that security management capabilities are maintained at the highest possible level. As well as reviewing existing protocols and documentation, regular reviews also allow the security managers to develop their relationships with managers and personnel in other divisions or departments, which in turn helps facilitate the personal relationships which underpin effective security management at every level of an organisation.\nf71y | Seven point nine And Finally....\n31e1 | In many ways, security management fulfils a different role from every other activity within an organisation. Whilst mistakes in most other divisions are recoverable, and can often be resolved by way of a simple apology, mistakes made in the security department can often have much more significant consequences, are not recoverable, and may, in the worst circumstances, lead to death, injury or catastrophic impacts. The responsibility of the security manager is to create the correct balance between freedom of movement and activity on the one hand, and safety and security on the other, but also to ensure that lessons are learned, mistakes rectified and the overall system strengthened and improved on an ongoing and continuous basis. Security management in its fundamental form is a simple art, but it is the ability to maintain standards, and to manage them effectively over time, that is the ultimate test of the success or otherwise of the security management system.\n40ry | Seven point ten Summary\nd1j2 | It is almost certain that the front page of the newspaper you bought this morning carries an example of where failures in security management have had significant impacts, and quite possibly have led to actual disasters. The likelihood is that these failures did not happen because of some catastrophic outside event, but are the result of a breakdown of what should be basic management controls. The reasons for these failures are usually predictable and well known, but have in some way been ignored or side-stepped. The issues covered in this chapter will give any security manager the ability to audit their own operations, and to identify problems that have a high likelihood of leading to significant operational failures.\nwstc | In summary:\nba1e | . You can't always prevent incidents - but you can take responsibility for how you respond to them\nen95 | . Incidents and crises don't 'just happen'. They develop over time, and the earlier you are aware of potential problems, the more effective you will be as a security manager",
