You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

1mvw | Unfortunately, the details of this reaction are not described. Really, two-body collisions in the conditions of high pressure inside the bubble, when SL originates, have much lower probability than three-body collisions like (7). The formation of triplet-excited water molecule is doubtful (see above). In addition, the excitation energy of the <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O ^ { * } \left( { } ^ { 3 } B _ { L } \right)</LATEX> molecule is 7.1 eV;38 consequently, the emission at the transition (9) has to be at <LATEX>1 > 1 7 5 \quad n m</LATEX> (7.1 eV), and the shift of the maximum to 280 <LATEX>n m ^ { 1 5 }</LATEX> is difficult to explain. Thus, the position of the emission maxima at <LATEX>1 < 3 0 0 \quad n m</LATEX> in SL spectra (Figure 1) cannot be explained by reactions 9 and 10.
6d4s | The transition from the excited <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathrm { B } } \mathrm { o r } \widetilde { \mathrm { C } }</LATEX> states of water molecule to the quiescent state has to be accompanied by the vacuum-ultraviolet emission as the excitation energy of these states is ~8.3 and 10 eV, respectively.32 Really, the maximum in the SL spectra of noble gas-saturated water is situated at 262, 268, 250, and 242 nm for <LATEX>\mathrm { H e } _ { * } \mathrm { A r } ,</LATEX> Kr, and Xe, respectively, and the intensity of those bands increases in the same order (Figure 1). One could assume that SL is blackbody radiation; then both these experimental observations can easily be explained by the increase of temperatures inside the cavitation bubble in the order from He to Xe followed by the decrease of thermal conductivity in the same order.39 However, SL is not
mqah | a blackbody radiation, the band at <LATEX>1 < 3 0 0 \quad n m</LATEX> is not formed by the noble gas emission (see above), and a water molecule dissociates at high temperature, giving the excited OH*(22+) radical which emits at 310 nm.
xxr8 | Thus, it is impossible to explain the results obtained in this paper with the help of known data on the emission of excited water molecules or excited atoms of the inert gases. We propose that the bonds at <LATEX>< 3 0 0</LATEX> nm in the spectra of water SL are due to the emission of excimer molecules like H2O *. M.
rl4j | It is well-known that noble gases can form complexes with water molecules and their stability increases in the order from argon to xenon.40 The pressures of dissociation of Ar, Kr, and Xe hydrates at 0 ℃ are 105, 14.5, and 1.45 atm, respectively. The increase of static pressure promotes the growth of clusters concentration.41 Thus, one can say that the clusters like <LATEX>m H _ { 2 } O r n M ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>m ,</LATEX> <LATEX>n = 1 , 2 , 3 ,</LATEX> etc., and <LATEX>M</LATEX> is the atom of a gas, can be formed after bubble collapse and cooling. On the other hand, at the process of bubble collapse, when temperature inside it is increasing, the formation of big clusters seems less probable. So we can only propose that the excimers and clusters like <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O ^ { * * } X e</LATEX> and H2O.Xe can be formed at the conditions of a bubble collapse.
vz32 | The dissociation energy <LATEX>D _ { e }</LATEX> of such van der Waals complexes is not high. For example, <LATEX>D _ { c }</LATEX> of <LATEX>A r H _ { 2 } O</LATEX> molecule is around 0.02 eV.42 Similar weak bounded complexes exist, and they are described in the literature (see review in ref 43).
ncb0 | The excimers are formed by three-body collisions:
8mp0 | <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O ^ { * } + 2 M \rightarrow H _ { 2 } O ^ { * } \cdot M + M</LATEX> (11)
xjyk | This process takes place at short distances between <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O ^ { * }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\mathrm { M } ,</LATEX> where the collisional potential is higher or around thermal energy, because only in this case a third particle can remove the excess kinetic energy of <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O</LATEX> and <LATEX>M . 4 3</LATEX> The quiescent state for for these excimers can be bounded
mt0f | <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O ^ { * * } M \rightarrow H _ { 2 } O M + h v</LATEX> (12)
awab | or unbounded
ixcc | <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O ^ { * } M \rightarrow H _ { 2 } O + M + h v</LATEX> (13)
8p6h | The distance between H2O* and <LATEX>M</LATEX> will increase in the order of Ar-, Kr-, and Xe-containing excimers following the increase in atomic shell size. Thus, the energy difference between excited and quiescent states will increase, but the wavelength of emission will decrease in the same order, which was detected in the experiments (Figure 1). A similar relationship was revealed in the order of weakly bounded excimers KrXeF*, KrXeCI*, KrXeBr*, and KrXeI* 43
pmgl | Note that the formation of excimers like H2O *. N2 and <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O ^ { * } \cdot O _ { 2 }</LATEX> inside the cavitation bubble is also possible as the corresponding clusters exist.40,41 Probably, the band discovered in refs 6 and 7 around 230 nm originates from these species.
90no | Formed as a result of reaction 1, the excited water molecule can react by processes 3, 4, and 11 or with the unexcited water molecules, the concentration of which inside the cavitation bubble is high enough (see above). In the last case the energy can transform very effectively ("resonant quenching"). In addition, water molecules quench the excited states of hydroxyl radical37

qb7o | Thus, the total scheme (simplified of course) of chemical reactions inside the cavitation bubble, which lead to SL, in the presence of noble gas can be presented as follows:
