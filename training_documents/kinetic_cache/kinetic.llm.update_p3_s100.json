Representative illustrations of (a) E sub a p p superscript O left parenthesis b right parenthesis K sub a p p for electrochemical reactions at a specific potential, (c) K sub s sub a p p for electrochemical reactions with the Butler-Volmer model, and (d) K sub max , a p for electrochemical reactions with the Marcus-Gerischer model as functions of P H. These data were generated with the model described in Figure one and the associated equations given in the text. In these plots, P K a , Ox equals three , P K a , Red equals eleven, P K sub one equals negative one, and P K sub two equals negative six. The standard potential (vs N H E) of each channel is E sub F T one superscript zero equals one point zero zero volts sub one, E sub F T two superscript zero equals zero point five three volts, E sub F P T one superscript O equals one point one two volts, E sub E D T two superscript O equals zero point seven zero volts.

The following derivation will focus on electrochemical PCET, but the same equations have been adapted for homogeneous PCET.\nybik | For the half-reaction Ox plus e superscript negative equals Red superscript negative , the concentrations of the oxidized and reduced species at the standard potential E superscript circle are equal: [Ox] equals [Red-]. Here, we neglect the difference between activities and concentrations and avoid introduction of the formal potential. For more complicated systems such as the four-channel model shown in Figure one, each redox species can exist in different forms. In this case, we can define the apparent standard potential E sub a p superscript O for each channel as the potential when the total concentrations of the oxidized and reduced species are equal: left bracket Ox sub total right bracket equals left bracket Red sub total right bracket. In the general case, for the ith channel, E sub a p p , i superscript O can be calculated from the corresponding standard potential via the Nernst equation\ngii5 | E sub app , i superscript circle equals E sub i superscript circle minus fraction numerator R T divided by F end fraction ln fraction numerator Z sub Red sub i divided by Z sub Ox sub i end fraction .

Here, script X Ox , and script X sub Red , are the mole fractions of Ox; and Red, respectively, which are defined as the ratios between the concentration of the ith form and the total concentration",
