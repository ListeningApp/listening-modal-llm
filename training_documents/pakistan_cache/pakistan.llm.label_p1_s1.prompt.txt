You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1pjs | As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, Pakistan has implemented several legal measures to address hate speech and its impact on society. It's important to note that legal frameworks can evolve, so I recommend checking with up-to-date sources to get the most current information. Here are some of the key legal measures that were in place or under consideration:
o2kr | 1. Pakistan Penal Code (PPC):
v6sk | The Pakistan Penal Code contains several provisions that can be used to address hate speech and incitement to violence. Sections 153A, 295A, 298, and 505 deal with offenses related to promoting enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion, race, ethnicity, or language, and deliberate acts intended to outrage religious feelings. These provisions criminalize hate speech that incites violence or promotes hostility. Pakistan Penal Code (PPC): The Pakistan Penal Code has been in place since its enactment in 1860 during British rule. The specific sections related to hate speech, such as Sections 153A, 295A, 298, and 505, have been part of the code since its inception.
1wj6 | 2. Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) 2016:
936l | PECA, enacted in 2016, includes provisions aimed at regulating online activities and combatting cybercrimes, including hate speech and incitement. Section 10 of PECA deals with offenses related to glorification of an offense and hate speech. Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) 2016: The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act was enacted by the Pakistani government on August 11, 2016. It outlines various offenses related to cybercrime, including provisions to address hate speech and online harassment.
06yq | 3. Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997:
dpv6 | Certain forms of hate speech that incite violence or promote terrorism can also be dealt with under the Anti-Terrorism Act. This law provides mechanisms for identifying and prosecuting individuals or groups that engage in hate speech that is linked to terrorism or extremist activities. Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997: The Anti-Terrorism Act was enacted in 1997 as a response to terrorism and extremism. It provides legal mechanisms to combat terrorism-related offenses, which can include hate speech that incites violence or promotes extremism.
8r5j | 4. Defamation Laws:
2taz | While defamation laws primarily focus on protecting an individual's reputation, they can also be used to address hate speech that targets an individual or a group based on their characteristics, beliefs, or identity.
o3ya | 5. Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA):
r5il | PEMRA is responsible for regulating electronic media, including television and radio broadcasts. It has the authority to take action against content that promotes hate speech, violence, or incitement on electronic media platforms. PEMRA was established in 2002, and its regulatory role over electronic media, including addressing hate speech on television and radio broadcasts, has been ongoing since its inception.
5gui | 6. Cybercrime Reporting Portals:
82qc | Government agencies and bodies such as the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) provide online portals where citizens can report instances of hate speech and cybercrimes. These platforms allow individuals to report offensive content for investigation and potential legal action.
ls7d | 7. National Action Plan (NAP) Against Terrorism:
tzt3 | The National Action Plan includes provisions for countering hate speech and extremism. While not solely focused on legal measures, it encompasses various strategies to address radicalization and hate speech through education, awareness campaigns, and the promotion of tolerance.
t8vv | It's important to note that the effectiveness of these legal measures can vary based on factors such as enforcement, societal attitudes, and evolving challenges presented by digital communication. In recent years, concerns have been raised about potential misuse of these laws for silencing dissent or curbing freedom of expression. Balancing the need to combat hate speech while preserving democratic values remains a challenge.
