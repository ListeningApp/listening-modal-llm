In other words, carbon materials with higher graphitization degree exhibit superior Faraday capacitance. In detail, according to the G C D profiles,\nnav4 | the F C-one-eight and F C-one-eight-H C l electrodes can deliver the specific capacitance as high as four hundred twenty-eight point zero and two hundred forty-three point three F g superscript negative one at one A g superscript negative one, whereas the specific capacitance of F C-zero-eight are only eighty-four point three F g 1 at one A g 1. The capacitance value of F C-one-eight outperforms most reported Fe-based carbon materials in Table two.\ngem8 | The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis was carried out to inspect the kinetic properties of these four samples in the range of zero point zero one Hertz to one hundred kilohertz, the results were delivered in Figure five c. It was found that low frequency part of the region was almost straight, implying the low diffusion resistance. In the high frequency part of the E I S plot, F C-one-eight and F C-one-eight-H C l display lower R sub c values than F C-zero-eight. It is reasonable that the improved electrochemical performance is related to the higher graphitic degree. The R sub c t values of zero point two one and zero point two two 92 for F C-one-eight and F C-one-eight-H C l were much lower than that of F C-zero-eight, zero point four one 92, implying the faster charge transfer at the electrode and electrolyte interface.\ne8nr | As consistent with the C V analysis, the graphitic electrodes of F C-one-eight and F C-one-eight-H C l showed a much longer discharge time than the other counterpart demonstrating higher specific capacitance (Figure S3 plus). The higher values in specific capacitance can be contributed to the improved conductivity of graphitic carbon, the larger S S A and the porous structure. The C V curves of F C-one-eight at multiple scan rates were accessed in Figure five d. C V curves displayed similar shape with the scan rate decreasing from one hundred to five millivolt per second (Figure five d). The reduction and oxidation peaks moved outwards as the increase of scan rates due to the polarization of the electrode. The details of galvanostatic charge/discharge curves were exhibited in Figure five e. Likewise, the galvanostatic charge-discharge curves showing voltage platforms are believed to the nature of pseudocapacitance. F C-zero-eight and F C-one-eight-H C l exhibited typical rectangular shape of C V curves and triangular G C D curves, demonstrating a double layer electric capacitive behavior (Figure S4 plus). The cycle stability was carried out by performing ten thousand times at five A g superscript negative one (Figure five f). F C-one-eight retained a moderate rate of fifty-one point seven percent compared with the initial capacitance and the inferior cycle stability of F C-one-eight was probably due to the irreversibly oxidized of Fe three C and Fe to Fe three O four in K O H electrolyte. The morphology of F C-one-eight and F C-one-eight-H C l samples after electrochemical activation were conducted to uncover the mechanism of electrochemical performance (Figure S5 plus). It was found that both samples presented spherical structure as before, while F C-one-eight sample showed a relatively smooth surface compared with the initial one. The absence of Fe three C and Fe species resulted in the inferior cycling performance.\nk78w | Four. Conclusions\ng9du | In conclusion, we achieved the transformation from amorphous carbon spheres to graphitic carbon through hydrothermal carbonization, chemical activation and graphitization using K sub two F e O sub four. The obtained F C-one-eight with graphitic carbon and Fe three C and Fe structure are believed to be the promising electrode material. On the one hand, the embedded Fe three C and Fe NPs are contributed to the pseudocapacitance performance with a high specific capacitance of four hundred twenty-eight point zero F g superscript negative one at a discharge current density of one A g superscript negative one. On the other hand, the graphitic carbon could improve the conductivity. When removing Fe three C and Fe NPs, the graphitic carbon of F C-one-eight-\nf682 | H C l with high specific surface area up to two thousand eight hundred thirteen point six square meters per gram exhibited a high specific capacitance of two hundred forty-three point three F g 1 at one A g 1.\nli1k | Author contributions\npbea | Conflicts of interest\nccpt | The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n0fpw | This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China.\ndqn8 | Notes and references\ncop0 | Paper",
