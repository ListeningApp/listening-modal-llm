You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

mty2 | Dashboard Design and Styling
tbjy | The purpose of a dashboard is to tell a story. In the scheme of human history, hieroglyphs, the Bible, epic poems, theatre, comic books, and even social media are a few of the many different media through which we recount events to each other. All stories have one of the several primary purposes, to teach values or historical lessons, create culture, motivate people to take action, or entertain, to name a few.
mszq | Knowing the purpose of the story that you are telling is imperative to making it memorable. Good stories have several important attributes, which should be kept in mind when you are working. Some of these attributes are as follows:
i0p0 | · They're simple and focused
ok43 | . They create an emotional response
qnqv | . Listeners can relate to the actors in them
iwpq | · They have good, real data
oial | It's a good idea to take a few minutes to think about the story that you want to tell before you even create a new dashboard. Think about the stories that are the most memorable to you and the data points in them. Then, put yourself in the place of your listener. Design with your listener in mind. If you can develop a list of the top three data questions that you think are most important to your listener and then design a dashboard that focuses on answering them simply and evocatively, then your dashboard will likely be impactful.
8xfx | Dashboard Design and Styling
pgp5 | With Tableau Public, you can tell stories in a variety of ways- with individual visualizations, well-formed dashboards, and story points. You can also integrate your work in Tableau Public into other tools by using the JavaScript API (which is beyond the scope of this book). But just because there are many tools and options at your disposal, it does not mean that you should make your dashboards overly complicated. It's actually just the opposite. Good journalism focuses on keeping stories simple, and you should use the same ethos with your stories. Just because you can do something doesn't mean that you should do it.
8rz1 | It truly applies well to designing dashboards; less is more. Knowing your user and their questions is fundamental to a good design, and everything else flows from that.
xhb4 | In Tableau Public, you can make a dashboard from one or more visualizations, and you can add images, free text, filters, legends, parameters, links, and even embedded web pages. All of these capabilities are designed to enable you to create a data story that has the right context for your dashboard, both for the consumer and for its relativity to other events and data elements. While you can publish individual worksheets to Tableau Public, we encourage you to organize your work into dashboards so that you can guide your user through a complete story.
kext | In this chapter, we will discuss some best practices for dashboard creation, the elements of a dashboard, and how to navigate the dashboard worksheet. The following topics will be discussed in this chapter:
tshv | · The design process
arau | · Best practices of dashboard design
i36b | · The elements of a successful dashboard
x6yc | · Creating a dashboard
xcfx | · Adding context with titles, images, links, and tooltips
ybu5 | In the next chapter, we will discuss dashboard filters, actions, and parameters, and after that, we will discuss publishing your work to Tableau Public.
wxhx | The dashboard design process
f4i3 | The purpose of Tableau Public is to help you tell data stories interactively. Dashboard design, like view design, should tell a concise story that flows from one element to the next. When you are first starting your journey of dashboard design in Tableau Public, you should expect it to be an iterative process in which you design dashboards and revise them over time, often with input from other people. You might also find it helpful to draw out dashboards before building them in Tableau Public. Leave room and time for experimentation when building your dashboard.
avlk | Chapter 7
vi9g | You may find that more views, or different views, are needed in order to tell your story. Pulling various views together into a dashboard sometimes exposes flaws in the initial design. In that case, go back and change or add to your views, and then come back to the dashboard design process.
tyl7 | Best practices for dashboard design
2hpu | Dashboard design should highlight data and decoration should be limited, to add to a reader's understanding. Much has been written about dashboard design for data visualization. The following are some key points that you should consider when designing dashboards:
a10k | . Keep it simple: Your dashboard needs to answer only one question. If you can construct it so elegantly that it answers several questions, that's great, but according to Stephen Few, the maximum number of data points that any of us can remember at once is three.
2pp5 | . Keep in mind the audience: Consider what devices will be used to read or consume the data story and content.
l20h | . The method of consumption: Will users interact with virtualization on their computer, mobile phone, or tablet? Size your dashboard accordingly.
kfwj | . Performance: Like any other web application, the amount of time it takes for a consumer to get what they need is a major factor of performance. Design your visualizations and data sources so that they perform efficiently.
7hi1 | . Start big and end small: Always place the most aggregated (macro) data points or summary metrics on the upper left, and guide users to granular, actionable data points.
vpa2 | . Use colors, graphics, and fonts that are appropriate for your subject matter and consumers. Choose a simple, single color or complementary palette colors. Consider red-green color blindness and improve accessibility. Remove all non-data ink except labels, limited titles, and bare-bones instructional text. Additionally, you can create your own custom color palettes in Tableau Public fairly easily. Use labels, titles, and simple instructional text for the dashboard, and format tooltips so that they add context and calls to action for your users.
mtlg | Dashboard Design and Styling
6rz3 | For the dashboard that we are using in this chapter, we created a rough wireframe in Microsoft Visio. We'll refer to it throughout this chapter so that you can see how the functional elements that we are discussing will be included in the final design. It's fairly common for people to draw out the designs that they would like to build in Tableau Public. Also, it's a great way to keep your objectives in perspective when laying out the dashboard in Tableau Public.
oxdb | Our sample dashboard, which will be included in a blog post at www.dataviz. ninja, follows the Rule of Thirds - after adding the title to the dashboard, the three primary visualizations, namely aggregated data, change over time, and granular details, will consume about one-third of the total space, as shown in the following screenshot. We have also provided space for filters and color legends, and we will continue to use this dashboard design concept in the following two chapters, which cover filtering and publishing:
v978 | Chapter 7
uqzw | Creating a dashboard
56yl | Creating a Tableau Public dashboard is a process of adding the various elements (starting with worksheets), onto the dashboard canvas, adding titles, configuring filters, titles, and layout, and then modifying the behavior of the dashboard.
r00c | Now, we will build a dashboard from simple visualizations that were created by using the Climate Change data that was published by the World Bank and which is available at http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/climate-change. It's structured in a way that is similar to that of the other data sources that we are using. You can download the sample dashboards from https: //public. tableau. com/views/Chaper7-Dashboards/CO2EmissionsDashboard. We will use the data sources that we have discussed in the previous chapters to build sample dashboards so that you can download the source files to practice.
bhhp | Our workbook includes a summary map of carbon dioxide emissions by country in 2008, as well as a line graph that shows change over time as regards the total emissions and emissions per capita by region. Lastly, it contains a heat map that shows the foreign aid distributed for generic programs by the United States by year.
byke | The objective of this section is to build a dashboard that allows users to navigate from high-level areas of interest, that is, outliers, to more detailed data to identify causation.
