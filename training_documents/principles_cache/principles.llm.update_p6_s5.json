Providing guided practice after teaching small amounts of new material, and checking for student understanding, can help limit the development of misconceptions.\nfcco | Seven. Obtain a high success rate: It is important for students to achieve a high success rate during classroom instruction.\n8uji | Research findings\ndf3e | In two of the major studies on the impact of teachers, the investigators found that students in classrooms with more effective teachers had a higher success rate, as judged by the quality of their oral responses during guided practice and their individual work. In a study of fourth-grade mathematics, it was found that eighty-two percent of students' answers were correct in the classrooms of the most successful teachers, but the least successful teachers had a success rate of only seventy-three percent. A high success rate during guided practice also leads to a higher success rate when students are working on problems on their own.\n53eu | The research also suggests that the optimal success rate for fostering student achievement appears to be about eighty percent. A success rate of eighty percent shows that students are learning the material, and it also shows that the students are challenged.\na5u1 | In the classroom\nry7u | The most effective teachers obtained this success level by teaching in small steps (i.e., by combining short presentations with supervised student practice), and by giving sufficient practice on each part before proceeding to the next step. These teachers frequently checked for understanding and required responses from all students.\ni4li | It is important that students achieve a high success rate during instruction and on their practice activities. Practice, we are told, makes perfect, but practice can be a disaster if students are practicing errors! If the practice does not have a high success level, there is a chance that students are practicing and learning errors. Once errors have been learned, they are very difficult to overcome.\nr8sm | As discussed in the previous section, when we learn new material, we construct a gist of this material in our long-term memory. However, many students make errors in the process of constructing this mental summary. These errors can occur when the information is new and the student did not have adequate or\ncuin | well-formed background knowledge. These constructions are not errors so much as attempts by the students to be logical in an area where their background knowledge is weak. But students are more likely to develop misconceptions if too much material is presented at once, and if teachers do not check for student understanding. Providing guided practice after teaching small amounts of new material, and checking for student understanding, can help limit the development of misconceptions.\nn1i7 | I once observed a class where an effective teacher was going from desk to desk during independent practice and suddenly realized that the students were having difficulty. She stopped the work, told the students not to do the problems for homework, and said she would reteach this material the next day. She stopped the work because she did not want the students to practice errors.\n0r5m | Unless all students have mastered the first set of lessons, there is a danger that the slower students will fall further behind when the next set of lessons is taught. So there is a need for a high success rate for all students. \"Mastery learning\" is a form of instruction where lessons are organized into short units and all students are required to master one set of lessons before they proceed to the next set. In mastery learning, tutoring by other students or by teachers is provided to help students master each unit. Variations of this approach, particularly the tutoring, might be useful in many classroom settings.\nne2o | Eight. Provide scaffolds for difficult tasks: The teacher provides students with temporary supports and scaffolds to assist them when they learn difficult tasks.\nsqxn | Research findings\n6pmo | Investigators have successfully provided students with scaffolds, or instructional supports, to help them learn difficult tasks. A scaffold is a temporary support that is used to assist a learner. These scaffolds are gradually withdrawn as learners become more competent, although students may continue to rely on scaffolds when they encounter particularly difficult problems. Providing scaffolds is a form of guided practice.\n195r | Scaffolds include modeling the steps by the teacher, or thinking aloud by the teacher as he or she solves the problem. Scaffolds also may be tools, such as cue cards or checklists, that complete part of the task for the students, or a model of the completed task against which students can compare their own work.\nkqmi | One characteristic of effective teachers is their ability to anticipate students' errors and warn them about possible errors some of them are likely to make.\ng8rd | The process of helping students solve difficult problems by modeling and providing scaffolds has been called \"cognitive apprenticeship.\" Students learn strategies and content during this apprenticeship that enable them to become competent readers, writers, and problem solvers. They are aided by a master who models, coaches, provides supports, and scaffolds them as they become independent.\nnns9 | In the classroom\n9uwy | One form of scaffolding is to give students prompts for steps they might use. Prompts such as \"who,\" \"why,\" and \"how\" have helped students learn to ask questions while they read. Teaching students to ask questions has been shown to help students' reading comprehension.\nsrly | Similarly, one researcher developed the following prompt to help students organize material.\ndl6i | One. Draw a central box and write the title of the article in it.\n89ub | Two. Skim the article to find four to six main ideas.\ndhle | Three. Write each main idea in a box below the central box.\n2nib | Four. Find and write two to four important details to list under each main idea.\nnaev | Another form of scaffolding is thinking aloud by the teacher. For example, teachers might think aloud as they try to summarize a paragraph. They would show the thought processes they go through as they determine the topic of the paragraph and then use the topic to generate a summary sentence. Teachers might think aloud while solving a scientific equation or writing an essay,\n7h0h | and at the same time provide labels for their mental processes. Such thinking aloud provides novice learners with a way to observe \"expert thinking\" that is usually hidden from the student. Teachers also can study their students' thought processes by asking them to think aloud during problem solving.\na64c | One characteristic of effective teachers is their ability to anticipate students' errors and warn them about possible errors some of them are likely to make. For example, a teacher might have students read a passage and then give them a poorly written topic sentence to correct. In teaching division or subtraction, the teacher may show and discuss with students the mistakes other students have frequently made.\ngi7n | In some of the studies, students were given a checklist to evaluate their work. Checklist items included \"Have I found the most important information that tells me more about the main idea?\" and \"Does every sentence start with a capital letter?\" The teacher then modeled use of the checklist.\n3pn1 | In some studies, students were provided with expert models with which they could compare their work. For example, when students were taught to generate questions, they could compare their questions with those generated by the teacher. Similarly, when learning to write summaries, students could compare their summaries on a passage with those generated by an expert.\nwjuz | Nine. Require and monitor independent practice: Students need extensive, successful, independent practice in order for skills and knowledge to become automatic.\n3yxv | Research findings\nd8zj | In a typical teacher-led classroom, guided practice is followed by independent practice-by students working alone and practicing the new material. This independent practice is necessary because a good deal of practice (overlearning) is needed in order to become fluent and automatic in a skill. When material is overlearned, it can be recalled automatically and doesn't take up any space in working memory. When students become automatic in an area, they can then devote more of their attention to comprehension and application.\n```",
