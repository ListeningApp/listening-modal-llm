Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

936l | 1. Introduction. Statistical physics provides a formulation to study the macro- scopic properties of interacting particle systems based on the behavior of their mi- croscopic constituents. Its numerical realization, known as "molecular dynamics", has played an essential role in science for the past 70 years; see [3] for a historical perspective, and [17, 46, 27, 1] for reference textbooks. One of the major aims of molecular dynamics is to compute macroscopic quantities or thermodynamic proper- ties, typically given by averages of basic dynamical variables, which allows to obtain quantitative information on a system. Molecular dynamics can be thought of as a nu- merical microscope, as it bridges the gap between theoretical and experimental work, playing an important part across (essentially) all of science.
06yq | One particular interest in molecular dynamics is the computation of transport coefficients, such as the mobility, thermal conductivity and shear viscosity. At the macroscopic level, transport coefficients relate an external forcing acting on the system (i.e. a perturbation on the equilibrium dynamics) to an average response expressed through some steady-state flux (of energy, momentum, charged particles etc). From a mathematical perspective, this can be done by introducing a reference dynamics which models systems at equilibrium, and perturbing it by some external forcing of magnitude n E R mimicking the driving exerted on the system to create some flux. This corresponds to the so-called nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) [6].
dpv6 | To realize this in molecular dynamics simulations, we consider general perturbed dynamics of the form
8r5j | dX" =(b(X")+nF(X}))dt +o(X")dWt,
2taz | where F is the external forcing and n E R its magnitude, and Wt a standard Brownian

r5il | motion. In general, it is observed that the response En(R) of the system, given by the steady-state average of a physical observable R of interest which has average 0 for unperturbed dynamics (n = 0), is proportional to the magnitude of the forcing for small values of the forcing. This corresponds to the linear response regime; see Figure 1. When this is the case, the linear response p1 is computed as
5gui | PI = Jim En (R). En(R)
82qc | (1.1)
ls7d | By definition, transport coefficients are the proportionality constants p1 relating the response En (R) to the forcing for |n| small. One typical example is the case where the force F is constant and the configuration space is a torus. Such a forcing is considered to compute the mobility of particles in the system, which we discuss in more detail in Section 2.2.3. Another example is the case where F has components in one direction only, whose magnitude depends on the position in another direction. Such forcings can be used to estimate the shear viscosity through the so-called sinusoidal transverse force method [19].
tzt3 | In practice, steady-state averages involved in the linear response are computed as ergodic averages over a very long trajectory of the system, obtained as a realization of the stochastic differential equation (SDE) (2.4). Although there are several such ways of computing these steady-state averages, it is typically done in one of two ways: either based on (i) equilibrium techniques based on Green-Kubo formulae, which are integrated autocorrelation functions [20, 26]; or (ii) nonequilibrium steady- state methods where the limit (1.1) is numerically estimated; see [6]. Both numerical methods have advantages and drawbacks, and are constantly undergoing algorithmic advances; see [7, 37], and [43] for a comparison and discussion between the methods. In this work, however, we focus exclusively on the nonequilibrium approach.
t8vv | In the NEMD approach, a standard estimator to compute the linear response (1.1) is
qvnu | (1.2) În,t = |R(X) ds,
kggw | where the fixed value of n / 0 should be small enough in absolute value in order for the nonlinear part of the response to be negligible. Although there are various sources of error associated with the estimator (1.2), as made precise in Section 2.3, the variance associated with (1.2) is the main issue. In particular, in the context of computing transport coefficients, the large signal-to-noise ratio leads to a very large statistical error, as we are averaging very small linear responses [42]. The estima- tor (1.2), for instance, has asymptotic variance of order O(t-1n-2), much larger than the usual asymptotic variance of order O(t-1) associated with its equilibrium averages counterpart, as the linear regime is only valid for |7| < 1. This motivates the inter- est of variance reduction techniques, which are used to decrease the statistical error in the estimated averages. Examples of standard variance reduction techniques for Monte Carlo simulations, for which a review is provided in [5], are antithetic variables, stratification, control variate methods and importance sampling.
xrd1 | One of the main challenges with computing nonequilibrium steady-state averages, however, is that traditional equilibrium variance reduction techniques cannot be used the same way (see [29, Section 5.4] for a detailed discussion on obstructions to this end). Although many practitioners of molecular dynamics realize that the computa- tion of transport coefficients is a difficult numerical issue, there were only a handful

j346 | of attempts to develop dedicated variance reduction techniques. Many practitioners still use direct, brute force numerical methods based on a time integration of the dynamics.
v8uq | In order to reduce the statistical error of order 1/(n2t), one idea is to extend the regime of linear response, which consequently allows to use larger values of n. One approach for doing so is to use synthetic forcings. Such forcings, as presented in this work, were introduced by Evans and Morriss [11] ("synthetic fields", in their terminology) with the purpose to produce a mechanical analog of a thermal transport process. This notion was originally used by Gillan and Dixon [18], then abstracted and extended by Evans and Morriss in [11]. The name synthetic is used to denote that the external fields under consideration do not exist in nature.
x972 | The key idea behind synthetic forcings is that there are infinitely many forcings which lead to the same transport coefficient. This flexibility should be used to develop better numerical methods for the computation of transport coefficients. In theory, one can add an extra forcing to the physical perturbation of the system, as long as this extra forcing preserves the invariant measure of the reference system, which in turn preserves the linear response. We call the resulting perturbation a synthetic forcing, as it has no physical representation; it is a mathematical device used to simplify the problem at hand.
cwrw | The aim is to find synthetic perturbations allowing to reduce the nonlinear part of the response as much as possible (see Figure 1) in order to consider larger values of |7|. In this article, we present a mathematical framework for choosing and quantifying the quality of synthetic forcings, in the context of linear response theory, and discuss various possible choices for them. We illustrate the analysis with numerical results in low dimensional systems.
4i0e | This work is organized as follows. We present in Section 2 a review of linear

u6ty | response theory and associated computational techniques, and state technical results which make precise some error estimates, in particular bounds on the asymptotic variance of time averages such as (1.2). We then introduce the notion of synthetic forcings in Section 3, where we also give examples and discuss them in more detail. We next demonstrate the possibly dramatic benefits in terms of statistical error with some numerical results in low dimensions in Section 4, namely one and two-dimensional overdamped Langevin dynamics, and one-dimensional Langevin dynamics. We finally discuss in Section 5 the extensions and perspectives of this approach.
awvu | 2. Linear response and associated computational techniques. In this sec- tion, we review linear response theory and the computational techniques allowing to compute transport coefficients. The framework we consider is that of stochastic dy- namics, ergodic for the Boltzmann-Gibbs measure, which are perturbed by external forcings.
on9b | We start in Section 2.1 by setting up the framework for general time-homogeneous SDEs, and the specific dynamics we consider, namely (non)equilibrium overdamped Langevin and Langevin dynamics. We then review in Section 2.2 linear response theory, the definition of transport coefficients and discuss the associated standard numerical techniques to estimate these coefficients. We finally present the numerical analysis of nonequilibrium molecular dynamics in Section 2.3.
a8ge | 2.1. Reference dynamics and perturbation. We start by describing in Sec- tion 2.1.1 the general setting for linear response theory for a general stochastic differ- ential equation (SDE). We introduce in particular some assumptions on the dynamics which will be used in the analysis throughout this paper. We next describe the dynam- ics and their nonequilibrium perturbations for overdamped Langevin and Langevin dynamics in Sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.3, respectively.

A simple setting is to assume that b and o are C00, hence locally Lipschitz, which is used to prove existence and uniqueness of the solution [40, 33, 22]. The SDE (2.1) is associated with the following infinitesimal generator

vpgq | We assume that the dynamics (2.1) has a unique invariant probability measure with a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure denoted by o(x). This density satisfies

uooz | The generator of (2.4) is denoted by Cn = Co + nCphys, where Cphys is the generator associated with the physical perturbation:

u15r | ASSUMPTION 1 (Uniqueness of the invariant measure). The dynamics (2.4) admits a unique invariant probability measure for any n E R, with a smooth density un with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Moreover, trajectorial ergodicity holds: for any observable R E L1 (Vn), and any initial condition X",

a3td | Sufficient conditions for Assumption 1 to hold are discussed after Assumption 2 below. Although Un can be shown to uniquely exist, its analytical expression is generally not known. Note that in the case n = 0, the dynamics (2.4) reduces to the reference dynamics (2.1).
ex5k | We need to make precise some estimates on the evolution semigroup associated with (2.4) for the analysis presented in Section 2.3. We consider to this end weighted spaces of bounded functions. To define them, we first introduce a family of Lyapunov functions denoted by (Kn)nEN, with Kn : X > [1, +00) such that
