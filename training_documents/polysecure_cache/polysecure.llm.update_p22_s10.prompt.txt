You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ek18 | Attachment wounds can occur for many reasons, and it is imperative to emphasize that attachment ruptures are not always the fault of one's at- tachment figures. Attachment theory is not about parent blaming. Disrup- tions in attachment can occur for various reasons outside of the attach- ment figures' control: physical or mental illness, hospitalizations, acci- dents, the needs of other children or family members in the home, death, poverty, housing instability, war and other social factors. I give a more in- depth analysis of the different levels of potential attachment ruptures in Chapter Three.
hdkt | Attachment styles are not staticl If you experienced an insecurely attached childhood you can still go on to have healthy securely attached adult rela- tionships, experiencing what is called an earned secure attachment. Your at- tachment styles are survival adaptations to your environment and since
yyzt | they were learned, they can also be unlearned. I will touch more on earned secure attachment in Part Three.
7lvc | Attachment styles are not rigid identities to take on. These different inse- cure styles are not how you relate all of the time and they are not the total- ity of who you are. I often hear people describe themselves as "I am an avoidant" or "I am anxiously attached," seeing themselves wholly through this one lens. We can also do this to our partners, labeling them and every- thing they do as a result of them "being an avoidant" or "being preoc- cupied," etc.
rt7z | From a narrative therapy perspective, this would be a form of essentializing in which someone takes one part of their identity or experience and sees it as the entirety of who they are. To me, this also exposes the paradox of la- bels. Labeling ourselves or even receiving a diagnosis can be very helpful. It can give important clarity and definition to the struggles that we have been facing. Whether it be a personality type, a medical condition, a psy- chiatric diagnosis or an astrology chart, finding ourselves in a certain type can be refreshing. We may feel that our experience is no longer mysterious or just limited to us, but is actually understood, well-articulated and even shared with others. For some, reading about a certain attachment style can literally put their entire life and relationship history into context, liberating them from the idea that they are broken or helplessly doomed to never have relationship success. Instead, they can see themselves as a person who has wisely taken on a certain attachment adaptation and they can feel empowered to change that adaptation and choose a more secure path from which to move forward.
wpui | Conversely, labeling or receiving a diagnosis can also confine us into rigid categories that may restrict our sense of self or obscure the fullness of who we are. Labels can easily keep us stuck in the mindset of this is who I am, and so this is who I will continue to be. Instead of seeing ourselves as someone who struggles with anxiety, we see ourselves as anxiety itself.
23tt | Instead of seeing ourselves as someone who is battling depression, we see ourselves as depression itself. So, when reading about attachment styles, please identify with what feels useful, and please be mindful of rigidly iden- tifying yourself or others. We are more than the problems we face.
v3cv | You might relate to more than one style. Some people see themselves in two, three or even all four of the styles. You might function from a more secure style most of the time, but then act out a particular insecure style while under stress, or you might experience different attachment styles de- pending on who you are relating to. Many of us have different attachment styles in relation to each of our parents, for example-we might have felt very secure with one parent, but insecure with another. The styles of our partners also have an impact on our own attachment expression. A partner with a dismissive attachment style might provoke more anxious/ preoccupied behaviors from us, or being with a more anxious partner might polarize us into being more dismissive. Our attachment styles can change from one relationship to the next and they can also change within a specific relationship with the same person.
o6hl | Lastly, your attachment style is not an excuse for abusel I've heard people use their attachment style as an excuse for their actions, blaming their un- skilled or even harmful behaviors on the "fact" of them having a certain at- tachment style. Please don't do this! If you are acting out in harmful ways towards yourself, your partners or anyone you're in contact with, please take your traumas and wounds seriously and seek professional support. Cycles of violence, abuse or neglect can undoubtedly be broken when the right support is in place.
pv9r | INSECURE ATTACHMENT STYLES
3ujw | In this section, I will first present the three insecure styles in the typology in which they are commonly presented by other authors. However, some researchers and
ekyb | theorists have moved away from using the traditional four-type attachment typol- ogy, proposing instead that attachment plays out over the two dimensions of at- tachment anxiety and attachment avoidance. This two-dimensional perspective can be a more precise way of understanding the different expressions of the secure and insecure attachment styles, which I will present after the three insecure styles.
09tz | The Avoidant/Dismissive Attachment Style
ncf7 | Avoidant Attachment in Childhood
qd2c | The avoidant and anxious styles were first observed in children by Mary Ainsworth in 1978 through her Strange Situation Procedure.17 In these experiments, infants and young children were observed with their primary attachment figure (usually the mother) in a room filled with toys. Each child was at times alone with their parent in the room, then left alone with a stranger while the parent stepped out of the room for several minutes. Of particular interest were how much the child explored the room of toys, how much anxiety the child felt when left alone with the stranger and how the child responded to first being separated and then reunited with their parent. The child's response to separation and reunion became the primary way of assessing secure and insecure attachment.
in7g | Children with a secure attachment were observed as comfortable exploring the room of toys while their parents were present, at ease interacting with strangers when parents were present and then expressing healthy attachment distress when their parents left the room, followed by relief and comfort when their parents re- turned.
1sn7 | The children who were classified with the avoidant attachment pattern were ob- served as being distant from their caretakers, showing little to no distress upon separation, expressing little interest in the parents upon reunion, and even showing little preference for being with their parents versus the stranger. These children were less likely to explore the room of toys and often preferred to play by them- selves. Interestingly, the seemingly unaffected demeanor of these children, who were physically and emotionally distant from their caretakers, did not reflect their
bcxr | internal state. Even though these children appeared "fine" on the outside, they were actually experiencing internal signs of elevated heart rate and physiological stress.
0dtd | A child who had parents who were mostly unavailable, neglectful or absent adapted to their attachment environment by taking on a more avoidant style. Par- enting that is cold, distant, critical or highly focused on achievement or appearance can create an environment where the child learns that they are better off relying on themselves. When a child does not get enough of the positive attachment re- sponses that they need or they are outright rejected or criticized for having needs, they will adapt by shutting down and deactivating their attachment longings. A child in this scenario learns that, in order to survive, they need to inhibit their at- tachment bids for proximity or protection in order to prevent the pain and confu- sion of neglect or rejection. In this situation a child often learns to subsist on emo- tional crumbs, assuming that the best way to get their needs met by their parent is to act as if they don't have any. In adulthood, having a deactivated attachment sys- tem includes not only minimizing one's own bids for care and attention, but also having a diminished ability to pick up on and register attachment cues from others.
