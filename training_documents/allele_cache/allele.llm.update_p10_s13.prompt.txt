You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ewfp | In this meta-study, for each SNV, we integrated the data by considering a TF bound to SNV in different cell types or a cell type and different TFs bound to the same SNV. Surprisingly, ASB identification through data aggregation had better sensitivity than standard ChIP-Seq peak calling at the level of individual data sets. Particularly, in GTRD, the ChIP-Seq peak calls were gathered from four different tools (MACS, SISSRs, GEM, and PICS), but only 85-90% of significant ASBs were detected within peak calls (199,819 of 233,290 and 324,890 of 351,965 for TF-centric and cell type-centric aggregation), suggesting that up to 15% of ASBs could be lost if the ASB calling was restricted to the peak calls only.
oczy | Each particular ASB can either be a "driver" directly altering TF-binding affinity, or a "passenger" with differential binding resulting from differential chromatin accessibility (in turn, caused by some neighboring SNVs), or a protein-protein interaction with the causal TF. In terms of machine learning, we expected the TF ASBs to provide an easier prediction target since they could be mostly determined by the sequence motif of the respective TF. However, as found, the percentage of "passenger" ASBs is rather large (e.g., 24,662 out of 27,233 CTCF ASBs lack significant CTCF motif hits), and the TF-specific models showed a limited ASB prediction quality. Further surprise came from cell type-specific models which displayed a notably higher performance. We interpret these data as follows: the cell type ASBs are easier to predict by learning a small set of cell type-specific master reg- ulators, while passenger TF-level ASBs are very diverse, as coming from data aggregation of many different cell types with varying cell type-specific features such as key TFs.
2ttg | ASB events should be distinguished from other sources of allelic imbalance such as aneuploidy and local CNVs, which can imitate ASB by varying the allelic dosage. Commonly used cell types are often aneuploid: K562 and MCF7 cells are triploid on average, and 59 of 121 cell types overlapping between ADASTRA and COSMIC also have median copy number above 2. The ADASTRA pipeline, to our knowledge, includes the first control-free approach to
his3 | reconstruct the genomic map of BAD directly from SNP calls and to use this map as a baseline for detecting genuine allelic imbal- ance. Despite a multitude of available software for ASB calling, there has been no approach suitable for the uniform analysis of diverse existing data. Thus, when developing ADASTRA, the intention was to be able to process and include most of the data including non-replicated experiments, data sets lacking genomic input controls, or with the controls sequenced at low coverage, at the expense of general sensitivity achieved at particular data sets. Further on, such a pipeline might be applicable to other sequen- cing data that allow allele specificity, e.g., analyses of allele-specific expression or chromatin accessibility. With matched cell types, BAD-corrected data on allele-specific chromatin accessibility will also allow for better classification of driver and passenger ASBs and better application of machine learning techniques.
m50z | Our collection of ASB events per se is also useful for other research areas involving TF-DNA interactions. First, ASBs pro- vide unique in vivo data on differential TF binding and can be used for testing the predictive power of computational models for precise recognition of TF-binding sites33. Second, the TF binding not only affects transcript abundance, but also affects RNA splicing, localization, and stability54,55. Thus, ASBs may affect other levels of gene expression, particularly, the mRNA post- transcriptional modification: out of 65 RNAe-QTLs reported in56, 4 are listed as ASBs in ADASTRA.
me84 | Last but not least, ADASTRA reports hundreds of TF- switching ASBs, where alternative alleles are preferably bound by different TFs. This possibility has been discussed previously57 but, to our knowledge, we are first to report the genome-wide inventory of such events. Importantly, the respective SNVs exhibit the highest enrichment with phenotype associations. Probably these sites serve varying and allele-dependent molecular circuits. A particularly interesting example is rs28372852 located in the G elongation factor mitochondrial 1 (GFM1) gene pro- moter. According to ADASTRA, rs28372852 serves as the Alt- ASB of CREB1 and Ref-ASB of MXI1, and in both cases, the allelic imbalance is concordant with the respective binding motifs. Also, according to GTEx41, GFM1 is the target of rs28372852 eQTL. According to UniProt48, CREB1 is a transcriptional acti- vator, while MXI1 is a transcriptional repressor, suggesting that ASB can directly switch the gene expression activity. At the same time, UniProt reports four amino acid substitutions in GFM1 that are associated with combined oxidative phosphorylation defi- ciency. Interestingly, according to ClinVar37, this SNP is benign in regard to combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency; and in this case we speculate that ASB data might facilitate reevalu- ating the variants' functional roles and pathogenic potential. We believe that further analysis of TF-switching ASBs in the scope of metabolic and regulatory pathway alterations will provide valu- able insights into molecular mechanisms underlying particular normal and pathologic traits.
