Symmetry transformations for script S sub BM and Ward-Takahashi identities\nm6hi | In this subsection, we recall the transformations that leave the action script S sub BM invariant, up to boundary terms. We comment on the implications of such symmetries, also paying attention to the boundary terms that are usually dropped under the assumption of equilibrium, or, equivalently, a corresponding infinite amount of elapsed time between initial and final states. For us to later use SUSY fRG flow equations in section three, it is crucial to verify the presence of this symmetry in an out-of-equilibrium context.\nvpkf | In general, invariances of the action imply relations between various correlation functions in field theory, generally known as Ward-Takahashi (W-T) identities. Their derivation can be summarized as follows: A general infinitesimal transformation of the fields Phi arrow Phi prime equals Phi plus delta Phi will generically change the action S arrow script S prime equals script S plus delta script S. Also, shifting J arrow J plus delta J leads to\n4d67 | delta script Z equals the integral over t of the partial derivative delta script Z with respect to delta J of t times delta J of t equals the integral of script D Phi e to the power of negative script S of Phi plus the integral over t J Phi times negative delta S plus J delta Phi plus delta J Phi, where we used that a) Phi is simply an integration variable in fifty and script Z is not altered by a change in Phi but only D equals D prime. The transformation involves no non-trivial Jacobian determinant. Symmetries of the dynamical system comprise of transformations for which delta S is, at most, a total derivative (or a total divergence for higher dimensions): delta script S equals the integral over t of d over dt script A equals script A of t sub f minus script A of t sub i equals left bracket script A right bracket sub t sub i to t sub f.
