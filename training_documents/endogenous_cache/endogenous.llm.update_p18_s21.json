        "content": "tv8z | Seven hundred nine controls, which likely suggests that other mechanisms besides ApoE are at play in controlling\nwj6v | Seven hundred ten neuroproteasome localization. It is therefore an open and important task to define the milieu of\nax4d | Seven hundred eleven molecular and cell biological factors that can influence neuroproteasome localization. Detailed\ngtbn | Seven hundred twelve characterization of such mechanisms may help understand whether and how neuroproteasomes\nui4d | Seven hundred thirteen contribute to the large diversity of phenotypes in Tauopathies and neurodegenerative disease.\n2h4x | Seven hundred fourteen\n0s3f | Seven hundred fifteen Along these lines, ApoE has large effects on both amyloid deposition and Tau aggregation based on neuropathological data. Future work will determine whether and how neuroproteasomes\n1ajd | Seven hundred sixteen can impinge on the amyloid pathway, if at all.\nqj5b | Seven hundred seventeen\n15wh | Seven hundred eighteen In the broadest sense, we find that neuroproteasome localization and function is a determinant\nad3x | Seven hundred nineteen for the proteostatic capacity of neurons to defend against protein aggregation. A major\n6zdx | Seven hundred twenty conclusion of our work is that neuroproteasome-specific inhibition induces the formation of\nlwg2 | Seven hundred twenty-one endogenous Tau inclusions, suggesting the neuroproteasome is a pivotal mechanism in\nzsvp | Seven hundred twenty-two determining Tau aggregate formation. This function is notably distinct from the canonical role of\nssmj | Seven hundred twenty-three proteasomes in protein clearance. Sarkosyl-insoluble Tau aggregates formed by neuroproteasome \nssmj | Seven hundred twenty-four inhibition in neurons are endogenous, without a need for pathogenic mutations. We suggest that \nssmj | Seven hundred twenty-five this may be important for Tau aggregation observed in a high percentage of sporadic Alzheimer's Disease patients\nnda1 | Seven hundred twenty-six who do not have genetic lesions in the MAPT locus. It will likely be important to determine how\n5mk0 | Seven hundred twenty-seven neuroproteasome inhibition-induced endogenous Tau aggregates compare to other types of misfolded Tau.\n5bgd | Seven hundred twenty-eight\nm3bl | Seven hundred twenty-nine\n7ul5 | Seven hundred thirty One of the key observations we make is that new protein synthesis is necessary for\n1b57 | Seven hundred thirty-one neuroproteasome-inhibition induced Tau aggregation. Taken together with the dramatic increase\nrwom | Seven hundred thirty-two in newly synthesized Tau protein following neuroproteasome inhibition, we propose two models \nrwom | Seven hundred thirty-three to explain our observations (Figure S seven D): one, that neuroproteasomes degrade newly synthesized\nw1qt | Seven hundred thirty-four Tau, or two, that neuroproteasomes indirectly regulate the translation machinery itself. The latter\nemp6 | Seven hundred thirty-five is unlikely because only approximately five hundred proteins increase after neuroproteasome inhibition, which suggests\nvm2i | Seven hundred thirty-six some degree of specificity of what is regulated by neuroproteasomes. Based on the small number\nu7au | Seven hundred thirty-seven of neuroproteasome substrates and even smaller number of proteins which we identify in this \nu7au | Seven hundred thirty-eight study which become insoluble, we suggest that the model that neuroproteasomes degrade Tau to\n1ti5 | Seven hundred thirty-nine be the most likely option. While further experiments are needed to determine which is accurate,\nvpp5 | Seven hundred forty our observation that newly synthesized and endogenous Tau forms aggregates following\ny9yd | Seven hundred forty-one neuroproteasome inhibition is likely to be an important finding for the field. Indeed, if newly\nrwaf | Seven hundred forty-two synthesized Tau is a neuroproteasome substrate, future analysis would determine if Tau\nxbze | Seven hundred forty-three mutations or Tau seeding would perturb the balance of protein synthesis and degradation. This\np2wh | Seven hundred forty-four \nuzhc | would be an important cautionary consideration for using these common models to study\nf2h2 | Seven hundred forty-five neuroproteasome-dependent Tau aggregation.\n8z32 | Seven hundred forty-six\n0yaq | Seven hundred forty-seven As a concluding note, our findings increase the urgency to understand fundamental aspects of\no21p | Seven hundred forty-eight neuroproteasome biology. For example, revealing the genetic and cell biological elements which\n0g5c | Seven hundred forty-nine control neuroproteasome localization and trafficking are likely to be critical to reveal how ApoE\nql4n | Seven hundred fifty exerts an effect on neuroproteasome localization. The majority of the other components\neyg6 | Seven hundred fifty-one identified are involved in synaptic vesicle recycling and membrane trafficking.\n00l8 | Seven hundred fifty-two Vps thirty-five and Sorl one, AP two and AP three. We believe this reflects the underlying cellular mechanisms for\n00l8 | Seven hundred fifty-three regulating localization of these complexes to the plasma membrane, a subject for future study.\nojx3 | Seven hundred fifty-four Understanding these, as well as related mechanisms like how newly synthesized proteins are\n7o0d | Seven hundred fifty-five\n7atk | degraded by neuroproteasomes, are likely to open up therapeutic avenues that can impinge on\nopr3 | Seven hundred fifty-six neuroproteasome biology to boost neuroproteasome dependent-proteostasis and delay or prevent protein aggregation.\nrsan | Seven hundred fifty-seven\n3l5p | Seven hundred fifty-eight Seven hundred fifty-nine\nkeiw | Seven hundred sixty\nh95r | Seven hundred sixty-one\n8bxq | Seven hundred sixty-three\nbzwy | Seven hundred sixty-four We thank the families and patients who contributed human tissue which enabled the discoveries in this manuscript.
