You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1wj6 | Radical Clock Substrate Probes and Kinetic Isotope Effect Studies of the Hydroxylation of Hydrocarbons by Methane Monooxygenase
936l | Abstract: Four mechanistic probes, trans-2-phenylmethylcyclopropane (1), 2,2-diphenylmethylcyclopropane (2), trans-1,2- dimethylcyclopropane (3), and bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane (4), were used as substrates to investigate the possible formation of radical intermediates in the catalytic cycle of the methane monooxygenase (MMO) system from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) in reactions conducted at 45 â„ƒ. Hydroxylation of 1 gave two products in equal amounts, the alcohol trans-(2-phenyl- cyclopropyl)methanol (1a) and the phenol trans-2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane (1c). The two different products are attributed to discrimination by the enzyme of the two enantiomers of probe 1, one of which leads to hydroxylation of the aromatic ring and the other to formation of the primary alcohol. The absence of ring-opened product, 1-phenylbut-3-en-1-ol (1b), is noteworthy and suggests that the hydroxylation reaction may not proceed through formation of the cyclopropylcarbinyl radical or cation. The former species rearranges to the 3-butenyl radical with a rate constant of <LATEX>4 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 1 } s ^ { - 1 } \text { at } 4 5 ^ { \circ } C ,</LATEX> which would require a rebound rate constant for MMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) in excess of <LATEX>1 0 ^ { 1 3 } s ^ { - 1 } .</LATEX> The possibility of a stereoelectronic barrier to ring opening in the active site of the enzyme is addressed through a semiquantitative analysis of the rate constant with Marcus theory. Studies with the other radical clock probes support the notion that a significant component of the hydroxylation reaction pathway does not proceed through a radical intermediate. Compound 2, the cyclopropylcarbinyl radical of which has a ring-opening rate constant of <LATEX>5 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 1 } s ^ { - 1 } ,</LATEX> yields exclusively (2,2-diphenylcyclopropyl)methanol (2a); <LATEX>3 \left( k = 4 . 4 \times 1 0 ^ { 8 } s ^ { - 1 } \right)</LATEX> affords only trans-(2-methylcyclopropyl)methanol (3a); and <LATEX>4 \left( k = 3 \times 1 0 ^ { 9 } s ^ { - 1 } \right.</LATEX> gives mainly a mixture of endo- and exo-2-hydroxybicyclo[2.1.0]pentane (4a and 4b). Kinetic isotope effect experiments were also carried out with derivatives of 1, mono-, di-, and trideuterated at the methyl position. No intermolecular isotope effect, assessed by comparing the rate of conversion of the undeuterated and trideuterated probes, was observed, a result consistent with C-H bond breaking not being involved in the rate-determining step of the enzymatic reaction. Intramolecular kinetic isotope effects of <LATEX>k _ { H } / k _ { D }</LATEX> = 5.15 and 5.03 were obtained from studies of the mono- and dideuterated probes, respectively, which indicates that the hydroxylation reaction involves a substantial C-H bond stretching component. The MMO hydroxylase from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b gave both unrearranged and a small amount (3-5%) of rearranged products with 1, the ratio of which corresponds to a rebound rate constant of <LATEX>6 - 9 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 2 } s ^ { - 1 } \text { at } 3 0 ^ { \circ } C .</LATEX> These results are discussed in terms of several possible detailed mechanisms for the MMO hydroxylase reaction.
06yq | Introduction

2taz | lococcus capsulatus (Bath)2 and Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b,3 two of the better studied systems, comprise three proteins. Included are a hydroxylase enzyme that binds substrate and dioxygen, a reductase that contains Fe2S2 and FAD moieties and accepts electrons from NADH, and a coupling protein that reg- ulates electron transfer between the reductase and the hydroxylase4 and also modulates the substrate specificity5,6 and redox potentials7 of the latter. Recently, much attention has been focused on the hydroxylase enzyme, which is capable of hydroxylating a wide variety of substrates, in addition to methane.8,9 EXAFS, EPR, MÃ¶ssbauer, ENDOR, and other physical studies have shown that the active site in this enzyme contains a dinuclear non-heme iron center in which the metals are probably each coordinated to a histidine and several carboxylate ligands and linked to one another by a monodentate oxygen atom, either from water, hydroxide, or monodentate carboxylate, as well as by a bidentate carboxylate bridge.10-12 The center resembles that in the crystallographically characterized R2 protein of ribonucleotide reductase.13

tzt3 | Especially important in establishing the presence of radical in- termediates in this mechanism were studies with substrate probes that, following hydrogen atom abstraction to form a radical, isomerize to form, ultimately, a rearranged alcohol product.21-23 This process is illustrated for a specific probe, trans-2-phenyl- methylcyclopropane (1), in Scheme I. Attempts to employ this methodology in studies of the hydroxylation of 1,1-dimethyl- cyclopropane with the MMO hydroxylase from M. trichosporium OB3b were consistent with radical formation, although cationic intermediates were also invoked.14 Other experimental evidence for the involvement of radical intermediates in the hydroxylation chemistry of MMO from the same organism has been report- ed.8.15,24
t8vv | In the present article we describe our investigations of the MMO hydroxylase from both organisms in which four substrate probes, 1-4, illustrated in Chart I, have been used to address the question of radical intermediates and other aspects of the hydroxylation mechanism. Specifically, reactions with trans-1,2-dimethyl- cyclopropane (3) and bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane (4), both of which were used to study the rate constants for rebound with cytochrome P-450,21,22 and with two additional, much faster, radical clock substrates, trans-2-phenylmethylcyclopropane (1) and 2,2-di- phenylmethylcyclopropane (2), were carried out to determine whether substrate radicals are produced during hydroxylation. If, for example, hydrogen atom abstraction from probe 1 at the methyl position were to occur, the resulting cyclopropylcarbinyl radical (U', Scheme I) either would be trapped before ring opening to give trans-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)methanol (1a) or would ring open to the 1-phenylbut-3-enyl radical (RÂ°). Subsequent trapping of radical R' would afford 1-phenylbut-3-en-1-ol (1b). Substrate 1 has been employed previously as a hypersensitive radical probe in oxidations by resting cells and crude enzyme preparations of Pseudomonas oleovorans monooxygenase.25 In that work, the only oxidation product detected was the ring-opened alcohol, leading to the conclusion that radical intermediates had been

5746 | Isolation and Purification of Proteins. M. capsulatus (Bath) was grown as reported previously.11.26 The hydroxylase protein was purified and assayed following the described procedure,11 except that Q Sepharose was substituted for DEAE Sepharose in the initial ion exchange chro- matography step. The coupling protein (formerly designated protein B) was prepared from an Escherichia coli strain harboring a plasmid con- taining this gene from M. capsulatus (Bath)27 and then purified ac- cording to published procedures.28 The reductase was purified as de- scribed28 except that an HPLC TSKG3000SWG column was employed as a final purification step. Specific activities with propylene were measured at 200-250, 8000-8500, and 4000-4200 milliunits/mg for the hydroxylase, coupling protein, and reductase, respectively.
7toz | Growth of M. trichosporium OB3b and purification of its hydroxylase were carried out as reported.29 Its specific activity for conversion of propylene to propylene oxide was monitored11 with the use of coupling protein and reductase from M. capsulatus (Bath), for which cross-re- activity with the M. trichosporium OB3b hydroxylase has been reported previously.30.31 The measured activity was 180 milliunits/mg of protein, a value considerably less than expected,29 possibly due to the use of coupling protein and reductase from a different organism. Reactions of 15 AM solutions of the M. trichosporium OB3b hydroxylase with 10 mM hydrogen peroxide produced 0.19 mM propylene oxide in a 3-min reac- tion, however, which compares favorably with literature reports that 44 uM hydroxylase and 10 mM H2O2 yielded approximately 0.4 mM pro- pylene oxide in the same time period.16 The measured iron content, 2.2 mol of Fe/mol of hydroxylase, was less than that found by others, 4.3 mol of Fe/mol of protein,29 for which we have no obvious explanation.
j346 | Synthesis and Characterization of Substrates and Products. The substrate trans-2-phenylmethylcyclopropane (1) was prepared as previ- ously reported32 by reducing commercially available trans-2-phenyl- cyclopropanecarboxylic acid or its ethyl ester to alcohol la, trans-(2- phenylcyclopropyl) methanol, with LiAlH4, converting the alcohol to the mesylate, and reducing the mesylate with LiEt3BH. As an alternative, conversion of alcohol la to the corresponding chloride by treatment33 with Ph3P and CC14 followed by reduction with LiAlH4 gave hydrocarbon 1 and ring-opened product 4-phenylbut-1-ene; treatment of the mixture with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid to epoxidize the alkene byproduct, followed by silica gel chromatography, gave pure 1. Deuterated ana- logues of 1 were prepared by the mesylate route with LiAID4 as the source of deuterium. Their NMR and mass spectra were consistent with the expected amount of deuterium incorporation for each analogue.
v8uq | The substrate 2,2-diphenylmethylcyclopropane (2) was prepared by a sequence similar to that described above for 1. Reaction34 of ethyl diazoacetate in the presence of CuSO4 with 1,1-diphenylethene gave ethyl 2,2-diphenylcyclopropanecarboxylate, which was reduced with LiAlH4 to (2,2-diphenylcyclopropyl)methanol (2a). Conversion of 2a to the mesylate followed by LiEt3BH reduction gave 2.
x972 | Authentic samples of the products obtained by the MMO-catalyzed oxidation of substrates 1 and 2 were prepared in the following manner. trans-(2-Phenylcyclopropyl)methanol (1a) and its dideuterated analogue were obtained from the synthesis of 1, and alcohol 2a was available in the preparation of 2, as indicated above. Monodeuterated la was pre- pared by LiAID4 reduction of trans-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)methanal which, in turn, was obtained from the acid by sequential treatment with H3BSMe2 and pyridinium chlorochromate.35 1-Phenylbut-3-en-1-ol (1b) and 1,1-diphenylbut-3-en-1-ol (2b) were prepared by reactions of allyl- magnesium chloride with benzaldehyde and benzophenone, respectively.
cwrw | An authentic sample of trans-2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane (1c) was prepared by the following sequence. Reaction34 of p-vinylanisole with ethyl diazoacetate gave a mixture of ethyl cis- and trans-2-(p- methoxyphenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylates, which was separated by col- umn chromatography and crystallization. The trans isomer, identified
