You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

bqfb | A green health care insurance company would be accountable for environmentally sound practices. From fair-exchange coffee, to "cruelty free" cosmetics, to locally grown food, more customers are willing to support companies that unite ethics with the product they supply. Each year, a handful of articles call on health care to divest from fossil fuel sources.105 Sustain- able energy and investment in renewable sources are two ways an insurance company can be green. Alter- natively, a green insurance company might choose to partner only with health care facilities that are mem- bers of organizations which actively participate in sus- tainability initiatives, such as Practice GreenHealth,106 Health Care Without Harm,107 the Healthier Hospitals Initiative,108 and the Catholic Health Association.109
wwdt | To be sure, insurance companies are dependent on many different supply chains. For instance, phar- maceuticals are known environmental menaces110 and consistently one of the largest carbon emitters in health care.111 Requiring environmental accountability from drug companies would be a significant first step for greening insurance companies, with ample data to support the move.112 Once sustainability measures are in place, insurance companies can brand themselves as green, thus rising as visible leaders in green health care reform.
mn1r | V. Conclusion
5vqw | While there is justified suspicion about American health care - which is capitalistic and atomized113 - the potential for individuals to change the system is also the greatest strength. Historically, health care policymakers have been amenable to stakeholder requests and willing to comply with patient and doc- tor demands. Such was the case with lowering the cost of HIV-medications.114 Many patients and physicians recognize that a healthy body and mind depend on a healthy planet. Their collective actions can stimulate green health care reform.
meyw | Cheryl Macpherson, Elise Smith, and Travis Rieder maintain, "given the goals of health care, claims of
2e62 | and calls for health promotion are hypocritical unless they involve strategies and policies that explicitly pro- tect environments and natural resources."115 Patient and doctor participation in green initiatives, in tan- dem with advocacy, makes green health care reform not only possible, but truly a requirement of climate change.
