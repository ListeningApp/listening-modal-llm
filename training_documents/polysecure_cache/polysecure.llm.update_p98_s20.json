If we refer back to early childhood, it is easy to see how children thrive when there is enough structure and predictable routine for the different needs of their bodies and the various transitions within a day. As adults, this does not change. There are natural rhythms to our cycles of sleeping, eating, resting and having sex that suffer when ignored. Both men and women have hormonal cycles that fluctuate, impacting our mood, mental acuity, how sensitive we feel and how short or long our fuse for anger and frustration will be. Secure attachment with self includes knowing your inner rhythms (biological, emotional and mental) and figuring out what routines and daily rituals best support you to be in alignment with your own needs and pacing.\nbovo | Larger, more intentional or ceremonial rituals also play an important part in your relationship with yourself. Rituals and rites of passage that are intended to initiate us into higher aspects of self or mature us into adulthood are all but lost in our Western culture, and the few that remain (confirmation of faith, the bar or bat mitzvah, marriage, the sweet sixteen or quincea√±era, high school or college graduation) have been co-opted and commercialized so as to divest them of their\natnz | traditional purpose, which was a literal change of consciousness for which the people involved had been physically, mentally and emotionally prepared, leaving only a vestigial symbolic importance. The loss of the impact of such culturally approved rites of passage means that the millennia-old practice of having a ritual-based matrix in place to assist us with adjusting to life events and the accompanying change of consciousness required to accommodate those events is often no longer available to us.\n85ak | The traditional ashrama system in Hinduism, for example, specifies that after having been a student and a householder and fulfilling one's earthly responsibilities in the culture, a person should undergo the ritual of sannyasa (renunciation of worldly affairs) and shift consciousness towards preparation for giving up their body at the time of death. Without such a custom, we are often left to deal with the anxiety and stress of end-of-life issues without a supportive community or a clearly understood cultural context that contributes to our psychic security.\ngk8u | The modern \"psychedelic renaissance\" when Westerners travel to South and Central America and partake in ayahuasca rituals for the purposes of healing and self-discovery also underscores the lack of such important rituals in our own cultural milieu, while simultaneously demonstrating how far people will go to restore the much-needed self-awareness such rituals potentially provide. When examining the apparent emptiness of much sacramental or ritual activity in the West and its lack of ability in modern times to alter the consciousness of the person undergoing it, many philosophers (Carl Jung and Terence Mckenna, among others) have noted that over time, sacraments have become merely symbolic. Fortunately, nothing stops us from revitalizing older rituals or even creating new ones to assist us with living successfully and happily in the world we inhabit.\ndyg8 | When focusing on establishing a more secure relationship with yourself, one of the most influential routines we can implement is what I refer to as self-alignment practices. When we start to clear away the debris of our insecure attachment styles, we reveal a secure self that can be cultivated and aligned with. Many of us already have a sense of the parts of us that we might refer to as our better self or higher\nqoea | self, or what I refer to as my secure self or aligned self (this is the part of me that is aligned with my better skills, values, visions and morals). When we actively engage in practices that bring these parts of us to the forefront, we are rewiring ourselves to resonate more easily with a self that is more peaceful, joyful, loving and accepting. If we give fuel to a negative self in the form of constant or obsessive mental reinforcement of that version of ourselves, then we strengthen that construct. But it also stands to reason that the opposite is true. If we live in alignment with our most secure, loving and happy self and practice living through the lens of the qualities about us that are remarkable, then we stabilize that construct until that is who we will eventually become.\ned2n | Questions to consider\n3xp7 | What routines and rituals do you have that support you in your well-being and self-care?\n2hce | What routines and rituals do you need to add into your day or week that would even better support you in your well-being and self-care?\n12p5 | Are there larger rituals or rites of passage that you would like to experience?\ns4t5 | What practices do you already do that align you with your better or secure self?\n7ojm | What practices could you take on to align yourself with the secure you?\nx0cv | Things to try and to experiment with\nd5cm | If you could design your ideal day or week based on your natural rhythms of sleeping, eating, resting, connecting or having sex, what would that look like? Experiment with adjusting some of your day or week to better accommodate these preferences.\ncojo | Imagine your ideal day or week that includes self-care activities and rituals that support you in secure functioning with yourself. Start to add some of these routines to your daily or weekly activities, even if you start with something as small as five minutes a day.\nlsvc | Plan larger rituals or rites of passage that you think might assist you in your\nlfgp | journey. A quick internet search may give you some ideas. There are also a variety of group ritualistic practices available in many places, ranging from silent retreats to group shamanic drumming. Find one you think would be helpful and experiment.\ny6yk | Check out Dr. Daniel P. Brown's Ideal Parent Figure exercise, which can support you in rewiring your past and feeling more secure in the present.\n477w | Give definition to your secure self. What does this part of you look like? How does this part of you behave? What values and principles guide this part of you? Explore different techniques and practices to support you in aligning with your more secure self.\nu0zj | T: Turning towards yourself after inner conflict and doing trigger management\nlfp7 | In the previous chapter, the T in HEART was about turning towards each other after conflict, focusing on how we repair with our partners when there have been disconnections, fights or misunderstandings. Repairing with ourselves is also essential. How we treat ourselves when we have made a mistake, when there is an internal battle between different parts of ourselves or when we have fallen short of our own standards, ethics or expectations, is imperative in building a strong inner secure foundation. In the section on expressed delight with yourself, I have already spoken about the importance of working with one's inner critic, which is equally relevant here as well. When your inner critic is beating you up, bullying you or injecting self-doubt into your consciousness, knowing how to work with this part of you and reclaim your power from it is enormously helpful. Left unchecked, our inner critic can further feed cycles of attachment anxiety and avoidance that can be destructive and paralyzing.\n```",
