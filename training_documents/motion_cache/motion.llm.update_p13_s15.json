        "content": "poxj | The results of the distance test are shown in Figures four through six. The ELERM is the most accurate set, with a position error in the order of the meter for almost all the simulated conditions. The CR3BP assumption introduces a significant error, as can be seen comparing the position error of ELERM and CNERM in Figure four. In particular, the position error is in the order of the meter only for initial relative distances lower than few kilometers. The linearization of the CNERM does not introduce a great difference in the results, except for target initial conditions near the periselene. This difference can be observed comparing the values of the error index near the mean anomalies M equals zero and M equals three hundred sixty degrees in Figures six B and six C.\n2xvb | The two-body-based equations perform worse than the other sets for all the analyzed initial conditions. However, LERM equations show an acceptable error in the order of the meter when the target starts its motion far from the periselene, for initial mean anomalies M between ten degrees and two hundred eighty degrees.\nm1hx | All the equation sets showed good accuracy in terms of relative velocities, with values of speed errors always below the meter per second, except for large separations in the case of two-body-based equation set (in particular for initial distances above ten kilometers, with target starting its motion near the periselene).\n9psh | D. Speed Test Results\naiqv | The aim of this test is the analysis of the equations accuracy when the initial relative velocity is not zero, as in the distance test. The results are presented in Figures seven through nine.\n4klz | The ELERM confirmed their higher accuracy compared with the other sets. The CR3BP assumption produces a significant growth in both the position and velocity errors, though in the latter case remain acceptable (below the meter for almost all the tested conditions). Again, there are no significant differences between the CNERM and the CLERM sets.\nxz5d | The two-body-based equation sets showed the worst accuracy, in both position and velocity computation. In particular, for all the test conditions, the position error is above one hundred meters for the LERM, and above one kilometer for the Hill's equations.\nerwx | The analysis of the error index v surfaces in Figure nine confirms the overall higher accuracy of the ELERM, with respect to the other equation sets.\nie7i | E. General Remarks\naksw | One. Applicability of CR3BP at the Aposelene\n0fsl | From the analysis of the position accuracy of the equation sets based on the CR3BP assumption, Figures six B, six C, seven B, and seven C, a region can be found at the aposelene, where the error is small enough to provide a reliable estimation of the chaser relative state. This is highlighted in Figure ten, where the average position error for the distance and speed tests is evaluated in the rendezvous zone. In the distance test the position error at the aposelene is less than a centimeter for distances below one hundred meters; see Figures ten A and ten B. In the speed test, at the aposelene the position error is of the order of the meter for relative speeds below zero point one meters per second. Therefore, CNERM and CLERM equation sets are suitable for relative guidance system design for terminal rendezvous at the aposelene. In particular, CLERM equations are appealing for the design of classical robust controllers due to their linear nature and the reduced number of time-varying parameters, which are the target position with respect to the Moon and the LVLH angular velocity and acceleration vectors. These parameters can be modeled as bounded uncertainties, defined by a prior analysis of their values around the aposelene. Because of the reduced target velocity at the aposelene, the parameters' rate of change will be limited and robust control techniques can be successfully applied.\n0m3g | Two. Linearization Error\n9sp0 | The effects of the linearization are evident near the periselene. Considering, for instance, the distance test, the error index v at the periselene is larger for the linearized sets ELERM and CLERM than for the nonlinear set CNERM; see Figures six A through six C.
