        "content": "d8zj | Additional security can be created by increasing the distance from the focal point of control and the main area that is being protected, and by the introduction of additional barriers. The basic principles behind Security in Depth are the same whether it is limiting access to the backstage area at a concert, the VIP room of a club, the Chairman's office in a major corporation or the research laboratories in a technology company.\nywxn | Five point three Principle Two: Total Cover: Everyone is Responsible for Security\nuxhs | One of the fundamental principles of both Disney World and El Al is that security is not just a single event - you show your pass to someone, and then the security checks are finished - but that security is in-built into every aspect of that organisation's functions. For example, whilst the security teams in both systems are highly-trained, extremely professional and well-resourced, they are not the only people responsible for security. The car park attendants, the toilet cleaners, the peanut-sellers, the people taking the rubbish out of the kitchen are all considered to be part of the security management programme. In this way, it is possible to have total cover of an organisations' territory, where someone will be bound to spot any potential problem before it becomes an actual danger. The role of that person is then to inform the security team that something is not quite right, and they will then be able to respond in an appropriate manner, assess the situation and take the necessary actions.\ned6e | Five point four Principle Three: Tight Management\n6qqm | David Veness, the former head of Metropolitan Police Special Operations Unit, who was later a Special Adviser to the United Nations Commission on Security, used to have only one sign on his desk. It read 'Security is the management of complacency'. Any effective security management programme has to be one which can be maintained over time, without any loss of capability. Although this is a simple idea to put into words, it is possibly one of the hardest aspects of security management to actually control.\nonum | People are lazy, systems that are considered too intrusive are switched off, good practices are left to wither, systems are not maintained, and often after a certain amount of weeks or months, things return to how they were. It is well recognised that to create genuine organisational change is one of the hardest things to achieve, and yet to a large degree that is the purpose of the security manager. After all, if everything was OK, there would be little need for the security manager in the first place.\n3iir | Although there are often limits in what a security manager can achieve (it is often true that the security manager is relatively low in the organisational power chain), there are a number of basic rules that will make it easier to achieve organisational change, and introduce an effective security management system that will at least move towards the creation of a safe organisation.\n7a0a | The first is that it is better to have a few rules that everyone follows, rather than many rules which are mainly ignored. The purpose of the security management programme is to support the overall activities of the organisation, so any rules that are introduced should be simple, easy to adhere to and understood by everyone. If there is a system of access passes, that should be used by everyone. If there is a rule that lone workers should log where they are going to be, and then confirm that all is well in a final call before they go home, that should be adhered to.\no1qp | The second rule is that the security management system needs to be supported by everyone, from the Chairmen to the toilet cleaner. Security is not just the responsibility of the security team, but is one of the basic functions of everyone who works within that organisation.\njrik | And the third rule is that security is for ever. It is the role of the security management to ensure that the level of security awareness and readiness is maintained, and that standards are not allowed to slip. The second law of thermodynamics, also known as Entropy, states that unless extra energy is put into a system, it will tend to slow down, lose effectiveness and generally come to a halt. This is equally true of security management. Effective security management is not a natural state. It is the role of the security manager to ensure that the necessary protocols are adhered to, just as much as writing the initial security management programmes in the first place.\nxv78 | Five point five Kaizen\nsdks | Having taken two examples from American and Israeli organizations, we can finish off this Module with another concept, this time from Japanese management systems. Kaizen is the idea of 'Continuous Improvement', and has become one of the leading general management theories in the last twenty years. In its simplest terms, Kaizen is built on the principle of incremental improvement - identify a weakness, find a way of improving it, implement it. It is a philosophy as much as a method, and believes that everyone has expert knowledge of their own field - the car-park attendant is as expert at being a car park attendant as the chief scientist is as being a research manager. They might also be aware of ways in which the security of the car park might be improved which no one else in the organisation has. Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager, put it another way: 'If you improve a hundred things by one per cent, you get a hundred per cent improvement '. Whilst this may not be strictly true from a mathematical perspective, it is an excellent way of managing security kaizen.\ny8fb | Five point six Summary\n521q | Security has to begin and end somewhere, and that point is decided by how we define the territory that we accept responsibility for. Security in Depth describes the way that we can utilise our own resources in order to\nyogo | create progressively more secure environment. These simple principles of security management are used by two of the most well-respected organisations in global security management, each of which is facing completely different potential threats.\n2285 | These principles are easy to understand, simple to implement, and can be adapted to almost any security situation.\nys0g | In summary:\n7zvp | Total Security Management allows you to be proactive in developing a safe organisation, rather than responding to individual risks and threats.\nww6u | Total Security Management can be Vertical, as in Supply Chain Management, or Horizontal, through control of Territory.\nhpi6 | Territory is Space which is defined by Boundaries, and for which you have Information and Control.\n4uhb | Safety is increased by Security in Depth,\nepyi | Everyone in an organisation is part of the Security Management Programme.\ny51p | Kaizen allows for a culture of continuous improvement across the organisation.\nx95m | Five point seven Self-assessment exercises\nyfum | Self-assessment one: An organisation has been identified as being involved in an oil spill in Alaska. The Board have decided that the security system around its headquarters offices on the thirteenth through twentieth floors of an office block in Canary Wharf need to be reviewed, and if necessary improved. Using the principles covered in this module, what recommendations could you make to the Board?\nppx4 | Self-assessment two: Your Chairman has returned from a visit to Japan, where he has heard about Kaizen. He has requested you give a presentation to the next Board meeting, identifying how Kaizen can be of use to the overall security management of the organization. Put together a PowerPoint briefing about twenty minutes, that could be given to the Board, together with notes that could be distributed to the Board at the meeting.\nqf11 | Self-assessment three: Your company has taken over a production factory in Ukraine. It stands in its own area within a larger industrial park. As Head of Security EMEA, you are going to visit the facility to assess the level of current security, and to identify possible areas that might need improvement. Put together a checklist of points that you would need to cover during your visit to the facility.\n8oqt | Five point eight Further Reading\n6zah | Six Gold, Silver, Bronze Operations Management System",
