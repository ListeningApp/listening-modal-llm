        "content": "baj1 | Our data come from the first phase of a longitudinal and cross-sectional study investigating adolescent boys' (ages ten to fifteen years) discourse and identity development. Within the first phase, over three hundred hours of talk were audio- and video-recorded from fifty-four boys, including adult-guided and non-adult-guided discussions. All fifty-four of the participants were from public schools of a large city in the northeast of the USA. For this article, we specifically examine five excerpts from three different adult-guided group discussions with boys aged twelve to fifteen years. Each of the group discussions included between four and six boys, lasted between one point five and two hours, was videotaped, and was moderated by an adult male. The boys were told that the purpose of the group discussions was to generate talk about what it means, from their perspectives, to be growing up as young men. Because the discussions were adult-moderated, the boys did orient to the setting as a research setting with questions and answers, but did so flexibly, using their own vernacular to collectively fashion their own perspectives to the moderator's queries.\nn1wo | The main reason for examining only five excerpts of data versus a larger corpus of smaller excerpts is to provide sufficient specificity and analytic detail of the discursive processes that are used to orient to and against the gendered social norms that are occasioned in talk about physical attraction. Within discourse-analytic qualitative paradigms, the goals of analytic rigour, in-depth rendering of the participant's own positions, context specificity and particularization are key evaluative criteria. In contrast to some ethnographic and content-analytic approaches, the goal here is not to report a general compendium of findings, nor is it to offer summary snapshots, paraphrases or general themes of the conversational data. Instead of offering analyses that support the general finding that young men often work to appear 'mature' while talking about their heterosexuality (something we may already know), we are interested in examining in detail how such talk is accomplished; that is, the discursive work required to mitigate immaturity while securing a stake in hetero-normative masculinity. This type of micro-analytic focus not only addresses the 'how' question, but it also binds the analyst's claims to actual data. It reveals (rather than conceals) how the analysis was conducted, invites reflexive re-interpretations, and provides a concrete model for analysing similar segments of data.\n5bq3 | Data and analysis\nezla | Coming across as 'mature' while displaying an active 'heterosexuality' is one of the central activities for negotiating the 'developmental imperative' to demonstrate new age-appropriate or mature behaviours that consistently require a strategic engagement with the heterosexual social order. Micro-genetically, this engagement can be accomplished using a variety of discursive procedures, ranging from the construction of 'normativity' and irony, to rendering the familiar 'mysterious', to engaging in different forms of 'differentiation', to the use of 'suppression', or through the construction of 'in-agentive' versus 'agentive' voicing, to name but a few. For the current analysis, we will focus on three discursive methods that\nrsbu | are particularly relevant in the establishment of a 'system of social value'. These three discursive methods are:\nmagd | (One) Underscoring the non-literality of actions by appealing to motives\ntb74 | (Two) Denials with built-in concessions\n8l69 | (Three) Differentiation through caricature.\n1jyv | In previous studies, these discursive methods have been micro-analytically examined as ways of resisting being positioned within certain social categories, or alongside the less-than-desired features of certain social categories. For instance, Edwards' work on romantic couples' talk in therapy, and Widdicombe and Wooffitt's examination of 'punk' subcultures, each focus on how speakers cast their identities as 'non-literal' (or 'non-serious') exemplars of social categories by claiming that their outward behaviours or actions do not reflect their inward motives or dispositions. Speer and Potter have examined the ways that men attempt to resist the appearance of heterosexism in casual group discussions by strategically crafting less-than-robust denials that have concessionary elements to them; that is, concessions that allow the men to partly buy back into heterosexism at a less direct, or more subtle level. And finally, the use of 'caricature' as a strategy of differentiation has been documented by Rampton in his work on 'linguistic crossing' and 'stylization', and Georgakopoulou in her sociolinguistic work on the discursive strategies used to construct gender in Greek youth subcultures. What is common in each of these different research foci is an emphasis on these methods as discursive ways of indirectly or subtly constructing social and gendered identity positions so as to resist challenges and counters to such positions, and the micro-analytical aim of opening up these methods to closer inspection and potential critique.\nolce | Underscoring the non-literality of actions by appealing to motives",
