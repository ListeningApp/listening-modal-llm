Although coexisting vapor-rich and brine fluid inclusions\ntey0 | associated with boiling were not encountered in the investi-\nghiv | gated minerals, elevated salinities in several inclusions likely\no5ts | reflect mixing between a brine (derived from boiling) and\nhd7d | seawater. This strongly suggests that the highest-temperature\nehux | fluids have boiled at depth and cooled by mixing on ascent to\npoxj | the seafloor. Cooling of deep fluids from a higher temperature\n2xvb | at depth (e.g., three hundred fifty degrees Celsius for typical end-member hydrothermal\nm1hx | fluids) would have resulted in the deposition of most of the copper-rich sulfides below the seafloor, which could account for the predominance of zinc-rich sulfide in the chimneys.\n9psh | Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in clay minerals\naiqv | Clean separates of monomineralic nontronite\n4klz | F TKAD zero zero seven P zero zero two two eleven point two to eleven point three chamosite\nxz5d | osite, corrensite, and rectorite were\nerwx | analyzed for oxygen and hydrogen isotopes, spanning sample\nie7i | depths of two point eight to twenty-two point five meters b.s.f.
