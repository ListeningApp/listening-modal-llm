You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

4i0e | Colonias in Texas and the Land Titling Programme in Starr County
h2l3 | Before analysing the specifics of land devel- opment and land market practices in the study areas, it is important to outline briefly the nature of irregular settlement develop- ment and self-help in Texas and elsewhere in the US, not least since few researchers are aware of the widespread existence of settle- ments that are so closely akin to their Latin American and Mexican counterparts. In Texas alone, an estimated one-half a million people, almost exclusively of Mexican ori- gin, live in some 1600 plus settlements or colonias as they are more generally known (TWDB, www.twdb.state.tx.us; Ward 1999); while significant additional numbers of peo- ple also live in colonia-type sub-divisions in other border states such as New Mexico and Arizona (Ward and Koerner, 2004). While significantly different in many important re- spects from their Mexican counterparts (not discussed here, see Ward, 2003b, for further details), the formation of these settlements responds to a similar logic-namely, rapid urban and population growth, a context of little or no public housing supply and low state support for other low-income housing opportunities. Although illegal, they are ef- fectively the only route that poor households have if they are to embark upon home-own- ership, build a home and create a family patrimony, all within a context of poverty and low-wage economies, without access to
dfzb | low-interest formal Ilending institutions (Ward, 2003b). Housing acquisition is made affordable primarily by cheapening the cost of the actual lots themselves through the sale of agricultural land in rural (peri-urban) areas without adequate service provision at the outset, and doing so in such a way as to make the process seller-financed but without any transaction costs, and on terms that are favourable to the seller (ease of repossession for non-payment, etc). Thus, lots are sold under a 'Contract for Deed' mechanism whereby purchasers defer receipt of any deed or title until the lot is paid for in full. Some- times they are sold informally without any contract, just with receipts for payments. Modal lot prices range from $6000 to $10 000 in 2003 values, depending upon the county and lot size (Ward et al., 2000, Ward, 2003b). Another important way to achieve affordability is by lowering the cost of the housing unit itself, either through self-help construction or by living out of a camper or trailer, at least until household finances im- prove so as to allow for the purchase of a better manufactured home that can be placed on site.2 Services such as power and elec- tricity are provided privately and, in the ab- sence of county (public) capacity to provide water and wastewater removal services, these are also obtained privately from a number of possible sources including roving water tanker lorries. On-site septic tanks and evap- oration fields are usually privately purchased and installed to deal with household effluent, although these are rarely adequate especially in the poorest settlements and regions.
u6ty | Despite the hazards and difficulties associ- ated with colonia-type housing, this supply system remains the only mechanism of enter- ing home-ownership for low-income house- holds earning less than $25 000 a year (and many, in fact, earn only half this amount). Even compared with other very poor coun- ties near the border, in Starr County incomes are especially low: the median household income in 1999 was $16 504 (compared with $39 927 for Texas as a whole) and 45 per cent of households earned below $15 000 a Two principal land developers controlled year. Data for the other border counties are and oversaw most of the peri-urban settle-

on9b | also indicative of widespread poverty, albeit not quite as extreme as in Starr County. The following data are for other border counties in the same Lower Rio Grande Valley region and show the median household income and the proportion of households earning less than $15 000 total per year (figures in par- enthesis): Cameron $26 155 (29.6 per cent); Hidalgo $24 635 (32 per cent); Webb $28 100 (26.9 per cent); Zapata $24 635 (32 per cent), while Upper Valley El Paso County, although also poor, has a more bifur- cated income distribution, with $31 051 me- dian and 20 per cent of households receiving less than $15 000 per year. As one moves away from the border, so the median in- comes usually rise, but there remain a significant proportion of the population in the very poor category, such that colonia-type sub-divisions are also widespread (see Ward and Koerner, 2004). Travis County in central Texas where the relatively well-off capital of Austin is located, has a median household income of $46 761 (yet 12.2 per cent still receive less than $15 000), while Lubbock in the north has a median income of $32 198 (22.5 per cent below $15 000). Both cities have colonia-type sub-divisions in their peri- urban hinterland and, although they are de- veloped informally and are poor, the social conditions are rarely as extreme as one finds in the border area.
a8ge | The current study location of Rio Grande City has particularly little going for it eco- nomically, with a median income of just under $20 000, and 40 per cent of all house- holds earning less than $15 000. And as ex- pected, within the specific settlements studied, incomes are even lower. Fairly typi- cal (but not the poorest) is the colonia of Las Lomas where the median household income in 1999 was $10 927 with 65 per cent earn- ing below $15 000. Most householders have at least one worker and employment spans a wide range of low-paid (usually) service jobs, sometimes supplemented by part-time service work for women and/or migrant agri- culture and haulage jobs among the men.

pdjh | ment outside Rio Grande City. They were Mr Blas Chapa-a local judge-and Mr. Elías López. Independently, but sometimes to- gether, these two men accounted for most of the land sales in the RGC colonias that later would require title regularisation. As devel- opers, these two men were not unlike others in Texas (Ward, 1999), selling unserviced land with vague promises of later providing services, at prices and on terms that were affordable. However, the actual process of land development is rather atypical since the Chapa- and López-developed colonias, un- like most others, are distinctive in that many lots were not sold legally under Contract for Deed (although some were), but instead were sold piecemeal in exchange for receipts and handwritten entries in a book of sales. Equally problematic was that not all settle- ments were properly surveyed and platted (sub-divided into individual lots), but instead lots were identified by a 'metes and bounds' survey system that references land parcels according to distance and direction from a compass point, or by reference to a promi- nent feature-a clump of trees, a rock out- crop, or even to another person's property lines. Perhaps not surprisingly, therefore, many people ended up living on lots allo- cated and sold (but often not occupied) to someone else; others had homes that were actually in the street (which was poorly de- lineated and difficult to identify), while oth- ers lived unwittingly in the floodplain of an arroyo and only discovered the fact after a flashflood event. Finally, because relatively few people occupied their lots immediately and because the terms of default were so favourable to the developer, some lots were sold several times to different people.
xmgs | These scenarios will surprise few re- searchers familiar with irregular settlement in Mexico (notwithstanding some important differences), but the extensive irregularity of lot titles is highly unusual in the US, so much so that an NGO-Community Resources Group (CRG)-was commissioned by the Texas Government to undertake the regulari- sation of the affected settlements. The CRG programme targeted 15 colonias outside Rio
bd9h | Grande City and served over 2000 house- holds and 2500 lots. Of these, some 1000 households and lots were the focus of land title regularisation, usually because claimants had defective papers, or where their lot own- ership was challenged in some way-mul- tiple claimants, living in the wrong lot, or in an arroyo floodplain. The CRG's portfolio included the colonias and land that had been sequestrated from the developers, and the agency's brief was to carry out the title and servicing regularisation of these settlements. (However, the servicing component was soon dropped since there were no funds to carry it through.) Thus, the aim was to pro- vide clear title to those with legitimate claims and to move some households to new lot sites particularly those living in dangerous locations, or where there were multiple claimants to the same piece of land.
m047 | Here is not the place to describe the details of the regularisation process or an evaluation of the agency's performance (see Ward et al., 2003). Suffice to note that the findings re- ported here were collected as part of a de- tailed analysis and evaluation of the CRG regularisation programme and its impacts for the period 1995-2002, with particular em- phasis on the five years between 1997 and 2002 which was when the clearing of 'clouded' lot titles began in earnest. Data- gathering over a single year (2002) com- prised a number of sources. It began with a systematic review of CRG files and docu- ments; and a major household survey was undertaken primarily between January and June of 2002. The study embraced a range of methods of data collection: archival analysis, CRG database analysis, key informant inter- views and focus groups, as well as the house- hold survey of a total of some 266 families from a randomly pre-selected 436 house- holds (i.e. 61 per cent were interviewed) living in 6 of the larger colonias that had been affected by the CRG intervention (of which there were 15 in all). The purpose-de- signed household survey was applied to 2 sample groups. First, those who had no titles or who had experienced major difficulties and challenges associated with their titles or
gy8c | residence and who ultimately received titles as part of the CRG intervention. These were 195 of the 303 pre-selected cases and, in the following analysis, these households are re- ferred to as the "Study Group". Secondly, we interviewed a sample of resident households who had not experienced serious title prob- lems and who were therefore not affected by CRG intervention. Although they also lived in the same settlements (and especially in Las Lomas), they had received Contracts for Deeds or had completed the purchase of their lots such that they had been able to secure a warranty deed for their properties. Although they formed part of the CRG Receivership plan and hoped and expected to benefit equally from any later service provision, households in this group held secure title. We proposed to use them as a benchmark sample for comparative purposes and to help us assess the degree to which title provision made any significant differences to home improvement, land values, etc. Of the 133 households identified for pre-selection in this 'Control Group', 71 (i.e. 53 per cent) were eventually successfully interviewed. While open refusal rates were very low, notwith- standing multiple call-backs, it proved im- possible to interview everyone in the pre-selection group. While we cannot be ex- actly sure of the degree of bias this reduced sample may have introduced, we have no reason to suspect that it was important, or that it detracts significantly from some of the findings reported below.
y4mj | The detailed questionnaire was conducted in Spanish and covered information about housing trajectories, land market transac- tions, the 'meanings' attributed to titles by owners, property valuations in the area, the perceived impact of titles on colonia im- provements and upon home improvements, as well as standard socioeconomic indicators information. It took about 25-30 minutes to complete.3

Two principal sources are used: first, we drew upon the detailed data contained in a database that had been generated by CRG contact with residents as the agency sought to examine individual claims of ownership as a precursor to the actual clearing of property titles. Secondly, we cross-checked these data with information that we had collected from the questionnaire survey and, in so doing, were able to tie the analysis to responses from the deeper set of questions, and to the independent variable data that were col- lected. Although the data come from the same broad constituency, the advantage of this dual approach is that it allows us to triangulate the larger CRG database as well as undertake a deeper level of analysis in relation to a smaller 'panel' of respondents whom we interviewed in greater depth. We were also able to compare some of the so- cioeconomic data from these two sources with that of the 2000 Census in those cases where these colonias coincided with census- defined 'places' (CDPs)-as in the case of Las Lomas-for example. In such cases, the coincidence of findings between the census and the sample data were reassuringly close, providing greater veracity to our sample sur- vey findings.
ki8m | Methodology and the Database Samples
km8w | The first database that we analyse below is the one generated by CRG employees who gathered specific data from colonia residents as part of the individual files created to verify that they were eligible to benefit from the titling scheme, and to create a paper trail about who owned what land, how much they had already paid and what papers they had to prove 'ownership'. Thus, households were asked: to document the types of papers that they had received originally from the vendor, and which established their claim of owner- ship; to state the price they had paid at that time; to provide the name of the previous owner(s), or more usually the developer, who
wzno | 2628
xagm | sold them the lot; to describe the state of the lot at the time of purchase and whether or not there was any house or construction already on the lot at the time; and to outline what, if any, problems they had encountered when making their payments. This generated an overall database of some 1790 records, with data stretching over some 17 years from 1972 to 1999. However, although the infor- mation dates as far back as the earliest pur- chases in the 1970s and includes records up to the late 1990s, in fact most people bought lots during the 1980s (see Table 1). The database includes information for all 15 of the sub-divisions included in the CRG pro- gramme, from which data for the following variables were extracted: the sub-division name; the purchase date (year); the price paid; from whom it was bought; and, whether or not the lot was sold with or
