You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

nvfy | And this no can operate in the minds of scientists as strongly as in anyone's.
mror | What I am sketchily, inadequately, outlining here is a whole series of blocks and impediments that amount to a mental prison. Well, the Sufis say we live in such a prison, and it is their concern to give us the equipment to free ourselves. We are all conditioned, as we now claim so easily and trippingly; but perhaps being able to say that it is not enough to enable us to see how.
zlxc | If we want to approach the Sufis, their ways of looking at life, at some point it is necessary to swallow the unpalatable fact that they think of us as backward, barbarian, ill-equipped, ill-informed, and primitive, with closed minds in areas where it is vital to our futures that we open them.
k0bw | Meanwhile, Shah most patiently answers the questions he has been asked, waiting and hoping for questions that are more educated, more sophisticated, based on better information and self-understanding.
aq5a | He gets thousands of letters from everywhere, for he is not a Western more than an Eastern figure, and people from Afghanistan to California ask about the Sufi Way. From these questions and answers he has compiled this book, which is so full of useful viewpoints and information that I cannot do more than draw attention to ideas that may be found profitable starting points.
sc5y | Attention. Shah devotes a full section to it, so important does he consider it, and so indifferent are we to it. In our society we are not taught about attention as a need, as fundamental as food; and we go
0yab | blundering about, seeking ways to assuage the craving, instead of learning how to provide ourselves with what we need, sensibly and calmly. We feed the hunger blindly, telling ourselvess we are seeking God or Love or Service; and we are not taught to recognise the drive in others, and how we are used and manipulated by them. Once the mechanism is brought to our attention and we begin to study it, it is as ifa veil had been stripped off ordinary life, and we become freer in our actions, our choices.
w95z | Knowledge, 'God', as a commodity. Conditioned to the commercial, to having, wanting, trading, buying, selling, we treat everything in this way, including what Shah has to offer. But 'higher knowledge' is not a commodity, to be bought and sold.
0i1k | The uses of literature. Here Shah is revolutionary. The Sufis know and use dozens of techniques, while we believe there is one. Our teaching in schools and colleges is based on simplistic ideas that take no account of the variations from hour to hour of the human mind. We Westerners demand a standardised product, says Shah: it is what we prize. But the standardised and mass-produced is not what interests him or his associates, who teach individuals, in individual ways.
dqlg | The human group - its dynamics. Psychologists are indeed studying this subject, so vital to our society, and to all our associations. Shah has a good deal to contribute; the human group is what the Sufis work with, and their sophistication goes beyond anything we approach.
p6pq | Emotionalism. Shah does not hesitate to make the claim, infuriating to religionists everywhere, that nearly all we claim as 'religion', as 'higher feelings', as 'mystical experience', is no more than emotional- ism. We are taught that there are emotions and intellect, but not that there is something else possible, beyond both and not to be confused with either.
zse6 | Exposing delusions.
p2n3 | Using religions, cults, sects, 'God', to satisfy power drives, the need for togetherness, to provide substitutes for the family, sex.
ohh7 | How to recognise false teachers and self-appointed Sufis. They proliferate, and delude unfortunate people who could be saved from them by the use of a little logical thought and some common sense.
vbni | Many words and concepts have fallen out of real use. Reading this book, we are forced to recognise that in our scientifically-oriented, materialistic culture, words like humility, pride, greed, love, idolatry, charity, tend to be disposed of into areas labelled 'religion' or 'ethics'. Shah rescues them, strips them of sentiment and vague emotion, and re-introduces them - as tools.
dgcw | Abjure the why and seek the how, as one Sufi, the explorer Richard Burton, put it. Well, this book is about how we, individually and collectively, may learn to look at ourselves and our institutions differently. And if what we are being taught is unexpected and sometimes disconcerting, then that is in the great tradition too.

sk5m | 'Beginning to Begin
qws8 | by Idries Shah
877u | UNTIL only a few years ago, as literary people, psychologists and the increasing number of those engaged in studying human con- sciousness now so often remind us, Sufism was a closed book for the ordinary person. Its language, in the form found in its classi- cal and technical writings, seemed almost impenetrable. Orien- talists (now more correctly renamed Specialists in the Human Sciences in Asia and Africa) maintained a near-monopoly of in- formation on the subject and yet could be found extensively disagreeing as to what Sufism was, how and where it started, and what its teachings meant. Some Islamic workers were against it: others claimed it as the true essence of Islam. Some non-Muslim observers were powerfully attracted to it, others found it too culture-bound for their liking.
rzhj | The publication of Sufi stories stripped of didactic overlay and much verbiage, together with studies of Sufi psychological work and perhaps above all the observed analogies with current social and cultural concerns, has changed this picture quite dramatically. It is now generally accepted that Sufi research and experience during the past thousand years has been one of the most promising areas of development in the direction of understanding man and indicating his perceptions of extra-dimensional reality. But it was not until people, mainly in the West, began to note the congruence of religious and psychological, esoteric and cultural, thinking that a more holistic approach to the subject could develop.
bfax | Meanwhile, of course, laggards in science still regard Sufism as mysterious esotericism; cultists still want to preserve this aura; a few scholars wish to produce a monopoly by claiming that their interpretations alone are authoritative; the latter sometimes pre- senting a spectacle resembling that of the alchemist opposing chemistry because he does not understand it.
f2y8 | The work of displaying the many-sidedness and current rele- vance of Sufism has not been difficult, given two prerequisites: freedom to publish and a growing dissatisfaction, in many cul- tures, with hidebound and ignorant authority. All that has been needed has been to quote, from legitimate Sufi sources, including documents, teachings which show the scientific, as well as the religious, interest; to demonstrate, from the same sources, that the psychological insights of the Sufis have proved a source of continuing knowledge which is not inferior to the achievements of modern workers in the field of the mind. In addition, the 'discovery' of the Sufis by several such workers of undeniable importance, and the existence of a living Sufi tradition aside from repetitious cultism and the other deteriorated elements made it rapidly possible - within the span of a decade-for several workers to provide materials which have verified much of the true nature of the Sufi heritage and to confirm its continuing operation.
o7qm | It has been objected, of course, that the 'popularisation' of Sufi materials might alienate many people from the ancient traditions and values which it is held by some to represent. In actual fact, the reverse has been true. In one publication after another, even traditionalist and formal scholars, as well as many others - in East and West-have eagerly accepted the recent reclaiming of the meaning of the materials: and the number of people interested has enormously increased. To disdain these newcomers because they are not always professional orientalists or cultists (still too many people are both) is to fail to observe that many of them are at least as intelligent, well-informed and potentially useful in human research as the 'specialists'. One of the saddest things, in fact, about the reaction in some quarters against the revelation of fresh insights into the essential Sufism has been the displaying of almost primitive and quite stupefying bigotry and small-minded- ness in circles where these characteristics are prejudicial to the honour of the learned calling and dangerous to the likelihood that such people will continue to be taken seriously by those whose respect means so much to them.
d52l | In brief, Sufism has 'arrived' in the minds of people in the more flexible and increasingly interesting areas of contemporary thought. It has also become a part of the experience and interest
qlbb | 14
nhsg | of some of today's more distinguished people throughout the world. It is operating widely, in cross-disciplinary and general areas, as a factor whose value and contribution can neither be denied nor arrested. What has happened is that more people are prepared to study perennial truth apart from local manifestations and derivative sociological forms of mainly anthropological value.
hy0l | Traditionally, Sufi understanding has relied heavily upon question-and-answer. The following pages, extracted to give a cross-section of materials elicited during hundreds of hours of talks, relate to many of the subjects which interest such a very large number of people today. The hundred conversations also represent answers to questions which have been asked again and again in a postbag of more than forty thousand letters, from all over the world.
4jmz | In spite of the enormous demand for Sufi thought to be pre-
b7cq | ted only in terms of familiar attitudes and local cultural expression, it would be unfair, both to the Sufis and those who might learn from them, to attempt putting this quart into a pint pot.
0b39 | Sufi thought and action requires its own formats in which to manifest and operate: it is for this reason that it has always, in the past and in its several areas of expression, established and maintained its own institutions and teaching centres. But the odem Western atmosphere, however much it may have neg-
qecd | ated to develop such formats for itself, is nowadays much more than formerly prepared to accept the hypothesis that there might be a form of learning which is presented, concentrated and dis- seminated through characteristic and specialised institutions. It is only where we get people imagining that the outward form of such institutions, suited to one place or age, is both suitable for here and now, and also representative of the thing itself, that the onus is on us to point out the fact that such opinions are limited and limiting. They disable those who hold them from understand- ing in the same way that the yokel in the Sufi tale could not bene- fit from his bowl of liquid soup because 'all soup has lumps in it'.
1o7p | There was once a man who opened a restaurant, with a good kitchen, attractive tables and an excellent menu.
cp13 | One of his friends came along soon afterwards, and said:
bgre | 15
57lp | 'Why have you not got a sign, like all the other eating-places? I suggest that you put on it "RESTAURANT: FINEST FOOD".'
ukth | When the sign was painted and put up, another enquirer asked:
kpvt | "You have to be more specific-you might mean any old res- taurant. Add the words "SERVED HERE" and your sign will be complete.'
jie2 | The owner thought that this was a good idea, and he had the signboard duly altered.
d0ik | Not long afterwards someone else came along and said:
0x0s | "Why do you put "HERE"? Surely anyone can see where the place is?'
4exe | So the restaurateur had the sign changed.
0myz | Presently a further curious member of the public wanted to know:
xh3i | 'Do you not know that the word "SERVED" is redundant? All restaurants and shops serve. Why not take it out?'
syiw | So that word was taken out.
kg3t | Now another visitor said:
lvae | 'If you continue to use the phrase "FINEST FOOD", some people will be sure to wonder whether it really is the finest, and some will not agree. To guard against criticism and contention, please do remove the word "Finest".'
o9sc | And so he did. Now, just the word "FOOD" was to be seen on the notice, and a sixth inquisitive individual put his head through the doorway. 'Why have you got the word "FOOD" on your restaurant: anyone can see that you serve food here.'
121u | So the restaurateur took down the sign. As he did so, he could not help wondering when somebody who was hungry, rather than curious or intellectual, would come along ...
zh03 | In this tale, of course, the restaurateur is plagued by the literal-mindedness of the 'people of reason'; for whom, as for all of us, intellect plays a valuable part. The food which our man is trying to provide, however, is the 'food of the heart'; where the heart stands in Sufi parlance for the higher perceptive faculties of humankind.
1mvw | Our contemporary Sufi poet, Professor Khalilullah Khalili, my most illustrious compatriot, puts it like this:
6d4s | In every state, the Heart is my support: In this kingdom of existence it is my sovereign. When I tire of the treachery of Reason - God knows I am grateful to my heart .. .*

vz32 | Sufis and their Imitators
ncb0 | Q: What can you do about imitators? It has been observed that, since you started to make Sufism known really widely in the West, numerous small groups have been enlarged, and entirely new ones have sprung up - and most people realise that these are just cults, and not Sufi groups at all.
8mp0 | THE SMALL BOY AND THE EXAMINATION
xjyk | A: That reminds me of a joke. It is said that a small boy was faced with an examination question: 'What is rabies and what can you do about it?' He wrote as his answer: 'Rabies is Jewish priests, and there is nothing you can do about it!'
mt0f | These Sufis are Sufists, not Sufis, and there is nothing that you can do about it. I am, however, interested in an inherent assump- tion : the one behind the question - that one should either have to do anything about it, or that one could, indeed, do anything about it ... If we do try to do anything about it, we risk attracting large numbers of disenchanted former Sufists, who would hope at first that we could give them THE REAL THING-but who would become doubly homeless, so to speak, when they found that one branch of the entertainment industry had closed down, and another failed to open up!
awab | Sufi studies in the West and in the contemporary East, it should be remembered, are repeating a pattern .* Throughout the ages there have been Sufis and imitators. Perhaps, to clarify things in your own mind, you might like to ask yourself this question: "Why do I imagine that there is any activity that does not have imitators, charlatans, confusion and "tourists" and passengers?' People do not find that they can do anything about tricksters or .Not only do humorous tales contain valuable structures for understand- ing. Their use also helps to weed out people who lack a sense of humour. Sufis hold that people who have not developed or who have suppressed their capacity to enjoy humour are, in this deprived state, also without learning capacity in the Sufi sphere.
