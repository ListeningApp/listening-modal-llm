You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

vcu3 | 5.2.6. Spatially-Resolved Imaging of Platinum Metallodrugs in 3D Spheroids
hjzj | Driven by the fact that tumor penetration of a metallodrug is a crucial step that has to be studied in order to better understand the tumoral cell's response, Theiner et al. aimed to apply LA-ICP-MS to study this parameter in two types of tumoral spheroids: colon HCT116 and ovarian CH1/PA-1, exposed to three Pt (IV) compounds. Spheroids derived from HCT116 and CH1/PA-1 were grown in U-bottom 96-well plates at densities of 2000 and 10,000 cells/well, respectively. Using LA-ICP-MS, it was possible to detect the accumulation of the Pt (IV) compounds in specific areas of the spheroids. As can be seen in Figure 5, in the HCT116 spheroids, the Pt enrichment of the three compounds was observed in the periphery and the core, while in CH1/PA-1 spheroids, the accumulation occurred primarily in the periphery (compounds 1 and 2) and in the central region (compound 1). The distribution of compound 3 (satraplatin) in the CH1/PA-1 spheroids, did not follow a particular pattern. These findings showed that LA-ICP-MS may be used to analyze the spatial distribution of Pt in heterogeneous structures such as multicellular tumor spheroids [74].
j79f | 5.2.7. Single-Spheroid Metabolomics
6tbv | Despite being the subject of several studies, the mechanisms of action of some of the metallodrugs in clinical evaluation are still not fully understood. Studying the metabolome of tumoral cells after incubation with these metallodrugs could be a way of elucidating their anti-tumoral action. Rusz et al. tested spheroids on two different metallodrugs with distinct modes of action on colorectal cancer (HCT116): oxaliplatin and the ruthenium complex KP1339 under clinical trials [76].
xb13 | Spheroids were grown in ultra-low attachment U-bottom 96-well plates at a den- sity of 3000 cells/well. The spheroids metabolome was assessed 24h after exposure to 20 µM and 200 µM of oxaliplatin and KP1339, respectively. In the KP1339-treated samples, 19 metabolites were significantly downregulated compared with only six metabolites in the oxaliplatin-treated samples [76]. These findings were correlated to what was seen in the monolayer culture, where oxaliplatin demonstrated significantly milder effects than KP1339 [190]. The pathway enrichment analysis indicated that oxaliplatin exposure (Figure 6a) altered the purine metabolism and pyrimidine synthesis, being consistent with its established mode of action of DNA targeting, as well as pathways associated with redox stress, such as glutathione metabolism, biosynthesis of coenzyme <LATEX>\mathrm { A } ,</LATEX> and nicoti- namide metabolism [76,191,192]. Furthermore, this work allowed for elucidating the hypothesis that oxaliplatin was also involved in ribosome biogenesis stress [76,192]. On the other hand, KP1339 (Figure 6b) had a distinct mode of action, which resulted in different metabolic perturbations. This drug affected the pathways associated with redox stress, such as glutathione metabolism and purine metabolism, but also unfolded protein response, such as glycerophospholipid metabolism and several amino-acid-metabolism-related path- ways [76]. Overall, Rusz et al. were able to develop a protocol for metabolomics studies in tumor spheroid samples, allowing for the comparison of various conditions, such as incubation with different metallodrugs [76].
cxqi | These examples underline the need for incorporating cancer 3D models in the preclini- cal testing of metallodrugs, which can support, or not, the results obtained in 2D models. This combined approach can enhance the accurate in vitro assessment of the anti-tumor capabilities of metallodrugs, thereby potentially increasing the success of the process of drug exploration and advancement.
qfmx | 6. Conclusions
rut3 | The majority of clinically tested drugs fail during clinical trials due to inadequate ef- fectiveness or excessive toxicity, resulting in a significant financial loss [193]. As mentioned previously, this occurs in part due to the use of drug testing platforms that are unable to fully represent the tumor and the in vivo microenvironment [194].
m3cp | Different models such as 2D and 3D cellular platforms, and animal models are neces- sary for the proper preclinical study of metallodrugs for anti-cancer treatments. Nonethe- less, most of the metal compounds are still not tested in 3D models. Additionally, as far as we know, the few studies that incorporate 3D models use mostly spheroids. We envisage that in the future this paradigm may change and that 3D models become a regular tool in metallodrug preclinical studies. In addition to the most commonly used spheroids, more advanced platforms, such as organoids and tumoroids, have the potential to make these studies even more relevant by introducing multiple cell types. Complex models such as organ-on-a-chip are already used in drug toxicity assessments for predic- tive evaluations [156], and tumoroids could even be used in the future as platforms to verify which metallodrug will be more adequate for each patient, covering an important aspect of precision medicine. Tumoroids might also be used to determine whether some subpopulations are more likely than others to respond differently or have side effects to certain metallodrugs depending on their genetic makeup [195]. This is already the case for cystic fibrosis, in which concerted efforts in several European projects have developed and validated intestinal organoids as a clinical tool [196]. All in all, the potential for 3D models as valuable platforms for anti-cancer metallodrug testing has already been proven, and drug development could benefit greatly in the future from the introduction of 3D models as tools in preclinical studies.
