        "content": "otkr | Too Close to Integrable: Crossover from Normal to Anomalous Heat Diffusion\nibgs | Energy transport in one-dimensional chains of particles with three conservation laws is generically anomalous and belongs to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang dynamical universality class. Surprisingly, some examples where an apparent normal heat diffusion is found over a large range of length scales were reported. We propose a novel physical explanation of these intriguing observations. We develop a scaling analysis which explains how this may happen in the vicinity of an integrable limit, such as, but not only, the famous Toda model. In this limit, heat transport is mostly supplied by quasi-particles with a very large mean free path L. Upon increasing the system size L, three different regimes can be observed: a ballistic one, an intermediate diffusive range, and, eventually, the crossover to the anomalous hydrodynamic regime. Our theoretical considerations are supported by numerical simulations of a gas of diatomic hard-point particles for almost equal masses and of a weakly perturbed Toda chain. Finally, we discuss the case of the perturbed harmonic chain, which exhibits a yet different scenario.\ncolo | After more than twenty years of theoretical research there is a general consensus that energy transport in one and two-dimensional systems is anomalous, meaning that Fourier's law is invalid. Numerics as well as hydrodynamic and kinetic theories consistently indicate that the nonlinear interactions of fluctuations of conserved quantities yield, in reduced space-dimension, non-standard relaxation and transport properties, even in the linear response regime. The main signature of the anomaly is the divergence of the thermal conductivity k with the system size L, i.e. a superdiffusive heat transport. In one-dimension, although this is a genuine many-body problem, it can be described effectively as an ensemble of LÃ©vy particles, namely random walkers performing free ballistic steps with finite velocity for times that are power-law distributed. This description accounts quantitatively for several non-equilibrium properties, both transient and stationary. Remarkably, the phenomenon was shown to belong to the class of the famous Kardar-Parisi-Zhang KPZ equation, suggesting a universal behavior with implications for the theory of transport in nano-sized objects like individual nanowires, nanotubes, or polymers. In this general context, nanowires and single-walled nanotubes have been analyzed to look for deviations from the standard Fourier's law. Experimental evidence of such deviations has been reported for single-walled carbon nanotubes. Non-trivial length dependence of thermal conductance has been also observed in molecular chains. Transport anomalies can be even exploited to achieve optimal efficiency of thermal to electric energy conversion.\nd6r4 | Although the general framework is pretty well understood, there are still open issues that escaped so far a convincing explanation. For definiteness, we focus on anharmonic chains, represented by a Hamiltonian of the form\n9mrz | H :\npk06 | n plus U qn plus one minus qn , (one)\n7wn9 | where mn, qn and pn are respectively the mass, displacement and momentum of the nth particle. For a generic potential U, this family of models should show superdiffusive heat transport in the KPZ universality class, as confirmed by several studies. However, there is evidence of significant deviations of the dynamical exponents in some models with hard-core potential. Moreover, chains allowing for bond dissociation like e.g Lennard-Jones, Morse, and Coulomb potentials unexpectedly display finite thermal conductivity, while other similar potentials closely follow the prediction of anomalous scaling. For the double-well potential, an intermediate-energy regime with almost diffusive transport has been reported.\nwcd0 | Another, more surprising feature is the apparent normal diffusive heat transport observed at low energies in asymmetric potentials like the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou-alpha-beta chain, where mn equals m and U alpha beta y equals y squared over two plus alpha y cubed over three plus beta y fourth over four. Yet, more compelling evidence of a seemingly normal transport has been found in a Toda lattice under the action of an additional conservative noise and in the diatomic Hard Point Gas HPG. In the first context, successive studies\ncaos | demonstrated that the diffusive regime is a finite-size effect, whereby anomalous behavior is recovered for L large enough (see also the discussion based on mode-coupling arguments).\nqrvy | In this Letter we present a general explanation of the counter-intuitive normal transport, by tracing it back to the vicinity to an integrable limit. In this context, the kinetics is dominated by quasi-particles those associated to the integrals of motion of the integrable regime, e.g., solitons over a broad range of scales. In fact, this range extends beyond the very large quasi-particle mean free path, where a purely ballistic behavior is expected. More specifically, we proceed by first devising a finite-size scaling approach and then validating the theoretical arguments with the numerical analysis of a few test models.\npn9j | Let the parameter epsilon denote the distance from the integrable limit left parenthesis epsilon equals zero right parenthesis corresponding to the perfectly integrable regime. Building upon the intuition contained in Ref., we propose that for small &, the heat flux J left parenthesis L , epsilon right parenthesis can be written as the sum of two terms,\n1pmc | J left parenthesis L , epsilon right parenthesis equals J sub N left parenthesis L , epsilon right parenthesis plus J sub A left parenthesis L , epsilon right parenthesis, (two)\n5z6q | J sub A is the hydrodynamic contribution, arising from the mutual interaction among density, energy, and momentum fluctuations, and responsible for the asymptotic superdiffusion. For L approaches infinity, J sub A approximately equals L to the power of eta minus one with eta equals one third in systems belonging to the KPZ class, while eta equals one half in some special cases, like models with symmetric interaction potentials e.g., Fermi Pasta Ulam Tsingou beta chain with potential left parenthesis U sub beta left parenthesis y right parenthesis equals y squared over two plus y fourth over four right parenthesis and models subject to conservative noise e.g., the noisy harmonic or nonlinear chains. J sub N is a kinetic contribution, accounting for the energy transported by weakly interacting quasi-particles.",
