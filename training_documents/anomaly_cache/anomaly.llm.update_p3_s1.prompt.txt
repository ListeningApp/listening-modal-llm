You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ti7f | regression error. Wang et al. [51] extend the student task by regressing a feature pyramid rather than a single output of a pre-trained network. Bergmann and Sattlegger [5] adapt the student-teacher concept to point clouds. Local geomet- ric descriptors are learned in a self-supervised manner to train the teacher. Xiao et al. [53] let teachers learn to clas- sify applied image transformations. The anomaly score is a weighted sum of the regression error and the class score en- tropy of an ensemble of students. By contrast, our method requires only one student and the regression error as the only criterion to detect anomalies. All of the existing work is based on identical and conventional (non-injective) net- works for student and teacher, which causes undesired gen- eralization of the student as explained in Section 1.
oksu | 2.2. Density Estimation
wtow | Anomaly detection can be viewed from a statistical per- spective: By estimating the density of normal samples, anomalies are identified through a low likelihood. The con- cept of density estimation for anomaly detection can be sim- ply realized by assuming a multivariate normal distribution. For example, the Mahalanobis distance of pre-extracted fea- tures can be applied as an anomaly score [12, 35] which is equivalent to computing the negative log likelihood of a multivariate Gaussian. However, this method is very inflex- ible to the training distributions, since the assumption of a Gaussian distribution is a strong simplification.
o22k | To this end, many works try to estimate the density more flexibly with a Normalizing Flow (NF) [14, 22, 38, 39, 41, 44]. Normalizing Flows are a family of generative mod- els that map bijectively by construction [3, 15, 34, 52] as opposed to conventional neural networks. This property enables exact density estimation in contrast to other gen- erative models like GANs [21] or VAEs [27]. Rudolph et al. [38] make use of this concept by modeling the density of multi-scale feature vectors obtained by pre-trained net- works. Subsequently, they extend this to multi-scale feature maps instead of vectors to avoid information loss caused by averaging [39]. To handle differently sized feature maps so-called cross-convolutions are integrated. A similar ap- proach by Gudovskiy et al. [22] computes a density on fea- ture maps with a conditional normalizing flow, where like- lihoods are estimated on the level of local positions which act as a condition for the NF.
nwfz | A common problem of normalizing flows is unstable training, which has a tradeoff on the flexibility of density estimation [4]. However, even the ground truth density es- timation does not provide perfect anomaly detection, since the density strongly depends on the parameterization [28].
nvfy | 2.3. Other Approaches
mror | Generative Models
zlxc | Many approaches try to tackle anomaly detection based on
k0bw | other generative models than normalizing flows as autoen- coders [9, 18, 20, 37, 55, 57] or GANs [1, 11, 42]. This is motivated by the inability of these models to generate anomalous data. Usually, the reconstruction error is used for anomaly scoring. Since the magnitude of this error depends highly on the size and structure of the anomaly, these methods underperform in the industrial inspection set- ting. The disadvantage of these methods is that the synthetic anomalies cannot imitate many real anomalies.
aq5a | Anomaly Synthesization
sc5y | Some work reformulates semi-supervised anomaly detec- tion as a supervised problem by synthetically generating anomalies. Either parts of training images [29, 43, 46] or random images [54] are patched into normal images. Syn- thetic masks are created to train a supervised segmentation. Traditional Approaches
0yab | In addition to deep-learning-based approaches, there are also classical approaches for anomaly detection. The one- class SVM [45] is a max-margin method optimizing a func- tion that assigns a higher value to high-density regions than to low-density regions. Isolation forests [30] are based on decision trees, where a sample is considered anomalous if it can be separated from the rest of the data by a few constraints. Local Outlier Factor [10] compares the den- sity of a point with that of its neighbors. A comparatively low density of a point identifies anomalies. Traditional ap- proaches usually fail in visual anomaly detection due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the data. This can be circumvented by combining them with other tech- niques: For example, the distance to the nearest neighbor, as first proposed by Amer and Goldstein [2], is used as an anomaly score after features are extracted by a pre-trained network [32, 36]. Alternatively point cloud features [24] or density-based clustering [16, 17] can be used to characterize a points neighborhood and label it accordingly. However, the runtime is linearly related to the dataset size.
w95z | 3. Method
0i1k | Our goal is to train two models, a student model fs and a teacher model ft, such that the student learns to regress the teacher outputs on defect-free image data only. The train- ing process is divided into two phases: First, the teacher model is optimized to transform the training distribution px to a normal distribution N (0, I) bijectively with a normal- izing flow. Second, the student is optimized to match the teacher outputs by minimizing the distance between fs (x) and ft (x) of training samples x € X. We apply the distance for anomaly scoring at test-time, which is further described in Section 3.2.
dqlg | We follow [7, 22, 39] and use extracted features obtained by a pre-trained network on ImageNet [13] instead of RGB images as direct input for our models. Such networks have been shown to be universal feature extractors whose outputs
p6pq | carry relevant semantics for industrial anomaly detection.
zse6 | In addition to RGB data, our approach is easily extend- able to multimodal inputs including 3D data. If 3D data is available, we concatenate depth maps to these features along the channels. Since the feature maps are reduced in height and width compared to the depth map resolution by a factor d, we apply pixel-unshuffling [56] by grouping a depth image patch of d × d pixels as one pixel with ď2 chan- nels to match the dimensions of the feature maps.
