        "content": "fxlv | I am reminded of the old saying: The child remarks, 'That hawk is white', while the adult asks 'How sharp are its talons?'\nqjhd | And I hope that we do not forget, while we are on this subject, that most of the most prized traditions in the West are derived, and not without pride, from the Middle East, and especially the Eastern Mediterranean ...\ntk13 | How does the Sufi Teach?\nn106 | Question: Sufis do not teach by 'stereotypes', as you often say. How does the Sufi teach?\nz5g9 | Answer: The Sufi teacher has the task of communicating his message and reality. He has to reduce, not increase, the effect of his own personality, in favour of content.\nk22r | A test of the suitability of a student is to find out whether he can set aside the fixation upon a technique, person or school - and make himself open to receive a comprehensive teaching.\n6blh | The Sufi teacher's mission is to be in the service of those who can learn. He does not exist to please or to displease anyone. To accord with the preconceptions of others as to appearances is irrelevant to his functions: though not necessarily, as Ibn Arabi reminds us, to his social viability.\nbthj | He works in accordance with the prospects of his students and the possibility of maintaining the continuation of the community of Sufis.\nu2ee | He does not hand out formulas nor does he insist upon the performance of mechanical procedures. His knowledge, on the contrary, makes it possible for him to prescribe apposite studies for suitable people, at an indicated time, in the proper place.\n5bsw | Most people, whatever their opinions and protestations, do not want to learn. Contrary to appearances, they tend to engage in activities which they use as a substitute for learning. These activities they call 'studies'.\nco50 | Sometimes this proclivity is one which has been trained into them, through books or human contact, even by well-meaning imitators. This causes it to be assumed that certain shallow experiences represent spirituality or the transcendent, or have some other significance which is in fact absent.\n0vzs | If you really want to learn, do not be surprised if someone tries to teach you. And do not lightly reject the method. People who do not know the real bases of a study are, of course, likely to be\nh710 | surprised when its methods are revealed to them.\nciwy | This revelation is what is known to Sufis as heart-knowledge. Dhun'nun says:\nqud6 | What the eyes see is knowledge. What the heart knows is Certainty.\nnsco | False certainty is obsession, whether implanted or otherwise.\nug21 | Most people nowadays are educated by means of mechanical thinking and within very limited frameworks which, in turn, enable them only to handle certain kinds of experience. This education is excellent, but only for its own purposes. Products of this training use its impoverished and restrictive principles to 'assess' such things as Sufi learning. No wonder we get bizarre results!\n8ugn | Rumi tells of a Sufi and a grammarian who were sitting together. The grammarian announced that 'A word must be one of three things' referring to the grammatical assessment. At once the Sufi went into a frenzy and cried out: 'I have struggled for twenty years in the hope that there was more to a word than this, and now you have removed my hope!'\n1opx | In this way the Sufi tried to point out to the grammarian that his terms of study were far too narrow, and certainly could not be sustained without the preamble that 'this holds true in grammar' ...\npovt | There is another factor in teaching and learning, portrayed in a story.\nh8d7 | IN A LIBRARY\n5oxb | Three dervishes met in a library.\nuh0s | The first said: 'I am going to read all the books of Sufi wisdom. Then I shall ponder their meanings and see how they relate to me.'\nqo52 | The second said: 'I shall copy out the books in my own hand, so that their lessons may sink in. Then I shall review them in their inner and outer significance.'\n0yst | The third said: 'I shall earn enough to buy all the books and I shall then read them. Then I shall question you two in order to profit from the parts of the books which your words and actions indicate you have not understood.'\nkgr2 | 'And I' said a fourth dervish, who was passing by and had stopped to listen to them, 'I shall study the third dervish in order to see if his vanity has allowed him to see what there is to see, in the books and in the products of the books.'\nxhua | The Sufi may not be able to teach by direct teaching as ordinarily understood, even though people request this teaching.\n2hrt | It is related by Sheikh Fariduddin Attar that the great Samnun Muhibb was once asked, on his return from a pilgrimage, to give them a lecture.\n2bfx | THE LECTURE\nh527 | When the Sufi spoke, the people were completely unmoved.\n5r7l | So the Sheikh addressed himself to the candles in the mosque where they were - and it was they which rolled about and burned themselves out. The Sufi drew the parallel to his audience, and left.\n20k9 | Tadhkirat\nfzjf | al-Avliyya\ny3uq | Idiot's Wisdom\n292u | Question. Can you say something about your book Wisdom of the Idiots; how the tales and quotations work?\nufnl | Answer: The great fraternity of Sufis claims these three things:\n6uj2 | That the Sufi teaching leads to a realm of higher human enlightenment;\nxkfv | That whatever its changing outward forms, Sufism is timeless. It may be said to have existed always.\ndnlk | That the aim of Sufi teaching is to provoke experience towards higher knowledge, not simply to supply information or to deal in emotional stimuli.\nzhqb | Sufism has perfected, among other techniques, a characteristic teaching method which is almost unknown outside the ranks of the initiates of the Way. This method, called Diagrammatic of Impression Tales, is contained in the special use made by Sufis of oral and other literature.\nb2cq | Sufi stories, though they may seem on the surface to purvey a moral, or appear intended to entertain, are not literary forms as these things are commonly understood. They are literature incidentally, but teaching-materials primarily. Very many of the classical poets and writers of Persia are avowed Sufis: and their works contain such inner dimensions as those to which I am referring.\n989f | The Sufi tale, and certain Sufic quotations of other kinds, are designed, then, equally to be appreciated by the cultured, to convey information, to instruct and to provide what is called 'a framework for the reception of the illumination' in the mind of the student.\nvytc | This book is designed with the intention of preserving in English not only the form but also the Sufi intention of the story.\nvq9y | One specific thing which can be said about the Sufi tale is that\n8ys5 | its construction is such as to permit the presentation to the mind of a design or series of relationships. When the reader's mind is familiar with this structure, he can understand concepts and experiences which have a similar structure, but which operate on a higher level of perception. It could be called the relationship of the blueprint to the finished apparatus.\n19sy | This method, according to Sufi teaching, can yield enlightenment to the individual in accordance with his capacity to understand. It may also form an essential part of a student's preparation exercises.\n63m5 | The process includes getting beyond the external face of a story, without inhibiting the student's capacity to understand and enjoy its humour or other outward characteristics.\ndaa6 | In Sufi circles it is customary for students to soak themselves in stories set for their study, so that their many meanings can become available as and when they are useful for their development. This latter stage may at times require the aid of a teaching master, to indicate the time and place of such development.\n7w0s | It is for these reasons that, in old-fashioned terminology, Sufi tales are said to 'imprison a priceless secret', which is 'released by the power of a teaching master'.",
