You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

mn1r | The modelled <LATEX>b _ { 1 } : b _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratios were lower than the observed <LATEX>b _ { 1 } : b _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratios shown in Table 2. Our prediction used measured <LATEX>C _ { i }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> as input and took the effect of <LATEX>g _ { m }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { \star }</LATEX> into account, and therefore the effects of varying <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> were already considered in the modelling. This suggests that the plot of the modelled <LATEX>b _ { 1 } : b _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratios vs the <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> ratios should reflect the com- bined effect of both varying <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> and varying <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } } .</LATEX> The intercept of the plot for the modelled <LATEX>b _ { 1 } : b _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratios vs the <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> ratios was again close to 1; but its slope was 0.944 (Fig. 5b), much lower

As the intercept remained unaltered, this indi- cates that the combined contribution of varying <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> to the observed Kok effect can be estimated from slope values, that is, c. 36.9% <LATEX>\left( = 0 . 9 4 4 / 2 . 5 5 9 \times 1 0 0 \% \right) .</LATEX> Therefore, the effect of varying <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> alone explained c. 25.3% (36.9-11.6%) of the observed Kok effect across various <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> concentrations and various temperatures.

If we assume that the variation of either <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { a c t } }</LATEX> and/or <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 }</LATEX> with irradiance is negligible with the limiting light range, as is often assumed in measuring <LATEX>\Phi _ { \mathrm { C O 2 } } ,</LATEX> we can quantify the real inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> by light by removing the effect of chang- ing <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c } ,</LATEX> as described in the following. As such, this esti- mate should be considered as the maximum real inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { 1 }</LATEX> by light.
2zpk | The apparent relative inhibition in case of the Yin method is:
epu7 | <LATEX>\mathrm { I n h i t i o n } _ { \mathrm { a p p a r e n t } } \left( \% \right) = \frac { R _ { \mathrm { D 1 m e a u r c d } } - R _ { \mathrm { D 2 m e a s u r c d } } } { R _ { \mathrm { D 1 m e a s u r c d } } } \times 1 0 0 \quad \mathrm { E q n } 4</LATEX> The similar apparent relative inhibition can be proposed for the Kok method. The apparent inhibition was higher according to the Kok method than according to the Yin method (Fig. 6a), owing to the fact that the Kok method ignores the decrease of <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> with irradiance. Overall, the Kok method overestimated the apparent inhibition of <LATEX>R _ {</LATEX> by <LATEX>\mathcal{C} .</LATEX> 18%, as compared with the Yin method.
7od1 | Plotting the modelled A against <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> resulted in lower estimates of <LATEX>r _ { \mathrm { d 2 } }</LATEX> than <LATEX>r _ { d 1 }</LATEX> and plotting the modelled A against <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b } }</LATEX> <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> also resulted in lower estimates of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { D 2 } }</LATEX> than <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { D 1 } }</LATEX> than their respective estimates using the observed <LATEX>A</LATEX> (results not shown), although a single value of <LATEX>R _ { d }</LATEX> was used for each curve in modelling. This con- firmed the analysis of Farquhar & Busch (2017) that the appar- ent inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { 4 }</LATEX> by light was partly a result of the artefact of changing <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> with irradiance. The real relative inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> by light can be calculated as:
0bqy | <LATEX>\mathrm { I n h i b i t i o n } _ { \mathrm { r e a l } } \left( \% \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>= \frac { \left( R _ { \mathrm { D 1 m e a s u r e d } } - R _ { \mathrm { D 2 m e a u r e d } } \right) - \left( R _ { \mathrm { D 1 m o d e l l e d } } - R _ { \mathrm { D 2 m o d e l l e d } } \right) } { R _ { \mathrm { D 1 m e a s u r e d } } } \times 1 0 0</LATEX> Eqn 5
b780 | Compared with the relative apparent inhibition from the Yin method, the relative real inhibition was much lower (Fig. 6b). The results also suggested that after correcting for varying <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> light inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> only became lower but did not disappear: the real inhibition increased generally with relative amounts of photorespiration (Fig. 7).
ccmb | Discussion
ma93 | The 'linear decrease' of <LATEX>R _ { d }</LATEX> with light cannot generate the Kok effect
c6hh | The Kok effect was initially, and is still often, hypothesized to arise from the suppression of respiration by light (Fig. 1; Sharp et al., 1984; Heskel et al., 2013; Tcherkez et al., 2017a; Way et al., 2019). This hypothesis has received support from studies that have identified several mechanisms for the metabolic down- regulation of respiratory reactions by light, as reviewed by

Of the six scenarios considered, only the three sce- narios for 'decelerating decrease' of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> with irradiance (Fig. 3b-d) can generate the Kok effect, thereby excluding the other three sce- narios that are often considered relevant to the Kok effect. In par- ticular, the scenario of a 'continuously linear decrease' <LATEX>R _ { d }</LATEX> light (Fig. 3a) did not result in a break in the linear <LATEX>A - I _ { a b s }</LATEX> rela- tionship. This is in contrast to the statement of Tcherkez et al. (2017a) in their report for the <LATEX>1 8 ^ { \text { th } }</LATEX> New Phytologist Workshop that 'the widely-accepted (historical) origin of the Kok effect is the inhibition of respiratory metabolism by light (linear decrease of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> with light)'.
