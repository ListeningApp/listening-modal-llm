You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ccpt | However, more important than uncertain volume estimates, is the question what proportion of this total can be utilized for underground hydrogen storage under the parameters presented here. For example, as fields in the Weser-Ems and Elbe-Weser sector located in the Rotliegend formation may reach depths of 2,500-5,000 m (LBEG, 2021). From an economic point of view,

cop0 | storing gas at these depths is not profitable due to the high compression costs (e.g., Foh et al., 1979). Typical depths of natural gas storage facilities are 1,000-1,200 m (Sedlacek, 1999a). Physical constraints limit the storage of hydrogen to depth of 3,700 m below which hydrogen is thought to percolate through the cap rock and, hence, confinement loss (Iglauer et al., 2021). Details on the specific gas production, horizon and depth are, however, not listed. Former gas deposits in carbonates of the Stassfurt formation (Ca2), common in the eastern part of the North German Basin and the Thuringian Basin, may prove unsuitable as they contain significant amounts of hydrogen sulphur. However, former gas deposits in the Tertiary sandstones in the Upper Rhine Graben could again show suitable potential and supplement storage capacities in saline aquifers and the UGS facilities Stockstadt, HÃ¤hnlein, and Frankenthal. According to forecasts, this could be the end point of the North-South hydrogen pipeline. However, the nearby industrial clusters would depend on an economical and steady supply of hydrogen, which could be ensured by underground hydrogen storage facilities. For the Munich area, on the other hand, there are no pipeline plans according to the Gas Network Development Plan 2022-2032 or the IPCEI project plan. The question, therefore, arises as to how the supply will be ensured, and here, too, underground hydrogen storage could be of significance. Future research should therefore focus on the technical storage potential matching it with planned hydrogen infrastructures and industrial demands. This is of paramount importance in the South of Germany where storage potential is lower than in the North, making targeted planning necessary.
lhkq | 5.2 Assessment of underground hydrogen storage costs
82ju | Early economic analyses have shown that the cost of service for hydrogen is approximately equal to the costs of storing natural gas, but have stressed that the costs are very site specific and that a range of costs is possible for each type of underground storage (Foh et al., 1979). In a more recent life cycle cost analysis, Lord et al. (2011) conclude on a cost per kg of hydrogen basis that depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs and aquifers would be the economically attractive options, considering costs for pipelines and wells, compressors, cavern mining, and base gas. The overall costs for UHS amount to 1.6 $/kg for salt caverns, 0.04 $/kg for depleted hydrocarbon fields, 0.08 $/kg for aquifers, and 2.75 $/kg for hard rock caverns (Lord et al., 2011). This methodology has been adapted with most recent cost estimates as of 2019 in a review by Raza et al. (2022) for UHS to be 0.14-14.03 $/kg (0.004-0.421 $/ kWh) for salt caverns, 1.42 $/kg (0.043 $/kg) for depleted hydrocarbon fields, 1.49 $/kg (0.045 $/kWh) for aquifers, and 0.36-3.20 $/kg (0.011-0.096 $/kWh) for hard rock caverns. However, a comparison of natural gas storage costs in Europe and the United States shows that storage costs in Europe could be twice as high, not least because of higher regulatory requirements (Sedlacek, 1999a). But unlike in the United States, where these figures are sometimes published, cost estimates in Europe are rather poor (Sedlacek, 1999a). Something that all cost estimates for hydrogen pore storages have in common is the substantial
y2qo | influence of cushion gas on the ultimate costs of service, similar to natural gas storage facilities (Foh et al., 1979; Lord et al., 2011). At the same time it is considered more economic to leave some gas in the reservoir than to invest in the additional pumps and compressors to empty it completely (Foh et al., 1979). Therefore, one way to reduce these costs is to use lower cost cushion gas, but further research is needed to investigate the possibility of mixing, viscous fingering and gravity override that needs to be considered (see Section 3.4; Feldmann et al., 2016). The economics will therefore depend on the quantity of the cushion gas, the quality of the recovered hydrogen gas, and costs of gas separation if required (Foh, 1991).
1piq | 5.3 Hydrogen purity requirements
7fqw | Probably the most important parameters influencing the economic development of underground hydrogen storage are biotic and abiotic reactions. Potential contaminations may result from biotic reactions, such as for instance in the town gas storage Lobodice (Czech Republic) in which methanogens were shown to transform hydrogen and carbon dioxide to methane (Å migÃ¡Å et al., 1990). Or abiotic reactions like in the in the town gas storage Beynes (France) where pyrite reduction is believed to be responsible for the observed rise in hydrogen sulphide within the reservoir (Bourgeois et al., 1979). There are several process engineering options for removing hydrogen sulphide from natural gas and the hydrocarbon industry has decades of experience. In Germany, too, a large proportion of all natural gas reserves contain varying amounts of hydrogen sulphur, which have been processed at the GroÃenkneten desulfurization plant (Lower Saxony) since the 1970s. Here the hydrogen sulphur is removed from the gas and converted to elemental Sulphur used as feedstock by the chemical industry. However, this is a costly process and the purity requirements of hydrogen extracted from the storage facility will ultimately depend on the end user. Fuel cells, for example, require hydrogen of 99.97% purity according to Beuth Verlag GmbH, (2019) because contaminants such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide can impede electrode charging, while ammonia causes irreversible effects on fuel cell performance. In contrast, fuel quality specification for applications other than PEM fuel cell, i.e., combustion processes in hydrogen boilers will tolerate higher concentrations of impurities of about 98% (ISO, 2019). In contrast, industrial combustion applications (e.g., for sintering processes, heating of furnaces) and domestic appliances (boilers, cookers, etc.) are more tolerant with respect to the hydrogen content and impurity levels resulting in fuel-types similar to "town gas" with hydrogen contents of around 50%. Generally, these higher impurity levels could facilitate hydrogen utilization by increasing the heating value but replacement by other components, e.g., oxygen or carbon monoxide have to be considered carefully with regards to safety, decarbonization and cost-effective level of purity for end user applications and quality measurements.

wtfz | 6 Summary
qy1i | Hydrogen has the capacity to meet future emission targets by decarbonizing the industry, mobility, electricity, and heat generation. But, hydrogen utilization and the implementation of a hydrogen economy at large scale requires significant storage capacities. Underground hydrogen storage in porous geological structures has the potential to meet these storage requirements. Positive and cautionary indicators for safe hydrogen storage in porous structures were identified, and a comparison and linkage with existing and planned aboveground hydrogen infrastructures was established. We have identified porous sandstone formations located at depths ranging from 800 to 1,100 m and exhibiting temperatures exceeding 40â as highly promising reservoirs for hydrogen storage. Specifically, porosities exceeding 20% and permeabilities greater than 500 mD were identified as positive indicators for adequate storage capacity. Brine pH values below 6 and salinities above 100 mg/L are desirable for effective hydrogen storage that will minimize biotic and abiotic reactions. Based on our estimates, the total hydrogen storage capacity in underground natural gas facilities is projected to be as high as 8 billion cubic meters, or equivalently, 0.72 Mt at standard temperature and pressure. This capacity translates into a potential energy equivalent of 29 TWh of hydrogen. Additionally, saline aquifers could accommodate 81.6-691.8 Mt of hydrogen, equivalent to an energy potential of 3.2-27.3 PWh of hydrogen that would meet predicted storage requirements many times over. Most of these sites are located in the North German Basin. We conclude that pore storage systems are likely to play a vital role in the future German hydrogen infrastructure, particularly in regions with significant demand for industrial hydrogen (storage) and potential imports via pipelines and ships. We recommend that future research focus on assessing the technical storage potential of these sites and their compatibility with planned hydrogen infrastructures and industrial demand.
