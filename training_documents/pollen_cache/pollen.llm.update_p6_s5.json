But (again ideally) the animal would prefer to be as well fed and lazy as possible, getting as much food as it can from one flower with minimum energy expenditure, being relatively sedentary, and then moving on to any other nearby flower with copious nectar, whatever its species (although we already noted that some degree of fidelity may improve its foraging efficiency).\nccpt | Hence, although there are obvious benefits to both partners, there are potentially clear costs as well. The plant has to invest in attractants (its carbon and nitrogen resources are used to make flamboyant petals, pigments, and chemical scents), as well as mere rewards. If the plant reduces its rewards too far, the animal may not get enough food and will give up on that species. The plant generally also has to compete with other plant species for pollination, to obtain a share of the \"good\" pollinators, so it cannot afford to skimp on its offerings too much if it is growing within a reasonably diverse plant community. Many plants also have to\n0fpw | offset the additional costs of animal exploiters: those visitors who take rewards without pollinating and the flower eaters (florivores) or foliage herbivores also attracted by the pollination cues. For the animals, there may be costs linked to carrying the pollen they have inadvertently picked up (sometimes it is very unwieldy and can interfere with their wings or legs or sense organs), which may favor animals trying to cheat, and there may be costs also from the potential risks of predation or parasitism at flowers, since enemies can use them as a place to find prey or hosts reliably. There are also costs arising from the tendencies of the plants to cheat by offering no real reward and sometimes by trapping the animal.\ndqn8 | Six. Why Is Pollination Worth Studying?\ncop0 | Pollination ecology can provide almost unparalleled insights into evolution, ecology, animal learning, and foraging behavior. It is perhaps the best of all areas to see and understand some basic biological processes and patterns; studies that deal exclusively with pollination biology have often had major impacts on general ecological and evolutionary theory.\nlhkq | Pollination interactions often show us evolution by natural selection in action almost before our eyes and provide some very clear-cut examples of adaptive radiation and, perhaps, of plant speciation. They are particularly useful for studying coadaptations (coevolution), because such interaction often involve relatively few organisms interacting with relatively high interdependence and incorporating the most fundamental of phenomena (reproduction for the plant, food supply for the animal). There are selection pressures on each side of the partnership, offering hopes that effects at the basic level of male and female gene flow can be quantified, sometimes (in crop pollination especially) on a time scale that can be detected within one scientist's period of study.\n82ju | In terms of ecology, the study of pollination sheds light on how different organisms interact and affect each other, especially the competitive effects of plants upon each other, and on the various levels of interactions of plants with pollinators, including resource allocation, competition, exploitation, and simply cheating. In the last two decades there has been an increasing stress on community-level interactions in pollination\ny2qo | biology, now seen as an especially useful (because highly quantifiable) arena for more general work on community structures; so this book inevitably considers the community ecology of pollination, especially in later chapters.\n1piq | Pollination biology also gives exceptional insight into the ecology of reproductive strategies and the complexities of sex and reproduction. Flowers usually are hermaphrodites, but they have many ways of organizing their sex life sequentially or spatially to maximize their reproductive output and fitness. This book contains rather little coverage of plant reproductive strategies beyond the basics, because the field has now become dominated by theory and modeling, and the topic has also been extensively and recently reviewed in other works.\n7fqw | In the realm of animal behavior some key influences can be especially easily measured and manipulated with flower visitors, and it is no accident that much of the key work on visual discrimination, learning behaviors, and above all optimal foraging has used pollinators, especially bees. Optimal diet theory can model how animals should behave in an environ-\nrhaz | Why Pollination Is Interesting. Nine\nwak1 | ment offering different proportions of alternative prey as potential food items of differing value (also taking into account factors such as conspicuousness and different variances). The theory predicts that a range of outcomes from complete specialization on one kind of prey item to complete generalization on all possible items is to be expected, even from the same animal, as the prey parameters are varied. Substituting \"flower\" for \"prey item\" (and with the immense advantage of very easily quantified caloric rewards from nectar), it is not unexpected that pollinators similarly turn out to show almost the full range of possible foraging behaviors. Furthermore, they have proved ideal subjects with which to develop foraging models that can take into account different constraints on the foraging animals, whether from different physiological limits or from different cognitive skills. Learning ability is especially needed where resources are of intermediate predictability: that is, too unpredictable over one or a few generations for fixed behavior patterns to be favored, but not so greatly unpredictable that an individual cannot track the changes. This exactly applies to floral resources, so that we should expect flower\nwtfz | visitors from any taxon to be good learners. Fortunately this is also readily tested with real or model flowers where just one trait at a time can be varied or associations of traits compared; again, social bees are ideal animals to work with, reliably emerging from their nests and traveling straight to the flowers provided, then displaying clear choices between alternative flowers.\nqy1i | For all these reasons, and with the added concern over human-induced effects on pollinator services in relation to biodiversity and to crops, interest in pollination ecology has burgeoned in the last ten to fifteen years, and the subject is attracting strong interest beyond the traditional academic centers of the developed world, giving us valuable insights into more varied habitats in Asia, Africa, and South America and into a greater diversity of interactions. Increasingly these systems are being modeled, and our preconceptions are being challenged. But\n```",
