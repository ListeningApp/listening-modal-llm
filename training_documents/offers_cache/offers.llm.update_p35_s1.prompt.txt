You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

sban | Business Terms
hy6w | Before going any further, and to better flesh out the concepts that follow, we should take a second to define and better understand some key business concepts. When I stood in that Las Vegas penthouse in my "beast mode" t-shirt I was clueless about such terms. Let me help you be better than, well, me.
wlk5 | Gross Profit: The revenue minus the direct cost of servicing an ADDITIONAL customer. If I sell lotion for $10 and it costs me $2, my gross profit is $8 or 80 percent. If I sell agency services for $1,000/mo and it costs me $100/mo in labor to run that client's advertising, then my gross profit is $900 or 90 percent. Note: This is not net profit. Net profit is what's left over after all expenses are paid, not just the direct costs of fulfillment.
ais9 | Lifetime Value: The gross profit accrued over the entire lifetime of a customer. This is gross profit multiplied by the number of purchases an average customer will make over their lifetime. Using the example above, if the average customer stays five months, and they pay $1,000/mo while it costs me $100 per month to fulfill, then their lifetime value is $4,500.
cdkq | Here's the breakdown:
ajvs | Revenue: ($1,000/mo * 90% Gross Margin * 5 months) = $4,500 Lifetime Value (LTV)
mwef | Note that the indirect costs, like admin, software, rent, etc., are not included in LTV.
k8pl | Note: You will find different definitions for lifetime value depending on the source. The biggest difference is that some sources only count total revenue, while others focus on gross profit over the lifespan. I focus on gross profit. You may also see me refer to this as LTGP Lifetime Gross Profit in other texts for clarity's sake.
04f6 | Value-Driven vs. Price-Driven Purchases
3nhr | This book was intended to be a textbook for any business that wants to grow. I've spent (and continue to spend) hundreds of hours on calls and in-person meetings consulting entrepreneurs on crafting their offers. I have seen the ones that take off into the stratosphere and those that fizzle.
4hg2 | Having a Grand Slam offer makes it almost impossible to lose. But why? What gives it such an impact? In short, having a Grand Slam Offer helps with all three of the requirements for growth: getting more customers, getting them to pay more, and getting them to do so more times.
v0rl | How? It allows you to differentiate yourself from the marketplace. In other words, it allows you to sell your product based on VALUE not on PRICE.
8iyl | Commoditized = Price Driven Purchases (race to the bottom)
asz3 | Differentiated = Value Driven Purchases (sell in a category of one with no comparison. Yes, market matters, which I will expound on in the next chapter)
salu | A commodity, as I define it, is a product available from many places. For that reason, it's prone to purchases based on "price" instead of "value." If all products are "equal," then the cheapest one is the most valuable by default. In other words, if a prospect compares your product to another and thinks "these are pretty much the same, I'll buy the cheaper one," then they commoditized you. How embarrassing! But really . .. it's one of the worst experiences a value-driven entrepreneur can have.
v78z | This is a massive problem for the entrepreneur because commodities are valued at the point of market efficiency. This means that the marketplace drives the price down through competition until the margins are just enough to keep the lights on: "just enough" to become a slave to their business. The business makes "just enough" to justify the owner waiting anxiously for things to "turn around," and by the time that lie is realized . . . they are in too deep to pivot (at least, until now).
f0em | A Grand Slam Offer solves this problem.
c3sz | But What Does A Grand Slam Offer Do?
bghr | Alright, let's start by defining a Grand Slam Offer.
fdud | It's an offer you present to the marketplace that cannot be compared to any other product or service available, combining an attractive promotion, an unmatchable value proposition, a premium price, and an unbeatable guarantee with a money model (payment terms) that allows you to get paid to get new customers ... forever removing the cash constraint on business growth.
8191 | In other words, it allows you to sell in a "category of one," or, to apply another great phrase, to "sell in a vacuum." The resulting purchasing decision for the prospect is now between your product and nothing. So you can sell at whatever price you get the prospect to perceive, not in comparison to anything else. As a result, it gets you more customers, at higher ticket prices, for less money. If you like fancy marketing terms, it breaks down like this:
k3he | 1. Increased Response Rates (think clicks)
lze6 | 2. Increased Conversion (think sales)
c1ys | 3. Premium Prices (think charging a lot of money).
1tyf | Having a Grand Slam Offer increases your response rates to advertisements (aka more people will click or take an action on an advertisement they see containing a Grand Slam Offer).
ktwv | If you pay the same amount for eyeballs but 1) more people respond, 2) more of those responses buy, and 3) they buy for higher prices, your business grows.
0yl7 | I've "struck gold" on my share of offers. Not because I've got some superpower, but because I've just done this a lot of times (and failed even more). I sorted through the crap that chronically fails and pocketed all the stuff that reproducibly succeeds (and put it in this book) .
8kqn | Here's the key takeaway from all this: a business does the same work in both cases (with a commoditized or a Grand Slam Offer). The fulfillment is the same. But if one business uses a Grand Slam Offer and another uses a "commodity" offer, the Grand Slam Offer makes that business appear as if it has a totally different product - and that means a value-driven, versus price-driven, purchase.
ct3i | If you have a "commodity" offer, you will compete on price (having a price-driven purchase versus a value-driven purchase). Your Grand Slam Offer, however, forces a prospect to stop and think differently to assess the value of your differentiated product. Doing this establishes you as your own category, which means it's too difficult to compare prices, which means you re-calibrate the prospect's value-meter.
tvep | Real Life Grand Slam Offer Money Math: Before and After
dmvx | Quick backstory . . . one of our companies is a software that advertising agencies use to work leads for their customers. Using this software, agencies transform their offer from a commoditized offer of lead generation services to a Grand Slam Offer of "pay for performance." Let me show you the multiplicative effect it has on the revenue of the business.
9z6z | Old Commoditized Way (Price-Driven) - Race to the bottom
4qhr | Commoditized Offer: $1,000 down, then $1,000/mo retainer for agency services
3qb9 | Breakdown :_ At .5 to 1 return on advertising spend, you lose money getting customers. But in 30 days, those 5 customers will pay another $1,000 each, bringing you to $10,000 in total and break even. The next month, the $5,000 that comes in would be your first profitable month, and each month thereafter would be profitable (assuming they all stay).
aksw | This is an example of a commoditized service - normal agency work. There's a million of them, and they all look the same. Commoditized businesses and offers have a harder time getting responses from ads because all their marketing looks the same as everyone else's.
p87k | Note: It all looks the same because they are all making the same offer. You pay us to work. We do work. Maybe you get results from that work. Maybe you don't.
inmq | It's reasonable, but it's easily duplicated (and subject to commoditization). This commoditization creates a price-driven purchase . . .
