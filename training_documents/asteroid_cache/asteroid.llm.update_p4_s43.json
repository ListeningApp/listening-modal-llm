        "content": "82ju | grained high-porosity matrix. The matrix contains numerous opaque minerals with size variations from submicron to approximately ten micrometers. A large elongated silica grain composed of quartz and tridymite, with a size of one hundred micrometers wide by approximately three millimeters long, appears abruptly between the coarse-grained lithic clasts and the fine-grained porous matrix. These silica polymorphs provide additional information about thermal and metamorphic histories. All phosphates in the matrix areas are located adjacent to the quartz-tridymite grain. The apatite in the coarse-grained lithic areas does not exhibit such a relationship. Three apatite grains, two from the from the lithic clast, with four spot data, define matrix and one isochron age of four thousand five hundred fifty-two plus-minus eighty-five million years. Hereafter, the age uncertainties are at the ninety-five percent confidence level. The model ages were calculated to be approximately four thousand six hundred thirty to four thousand four hundred eighty-five million years, with a weighted mean of four thousand five hundred sixteen point nine plus-minus ten point four million years. Their two hundred thirty-eight U two hundred six Pb isochron age was poorly determined at five thousand thirty-seven plus-minus four hundred eighty million years. The large uncertainty in this age is primarily because most data points have indistinguishable two hundred four Pb two hundred six Pb ratios, which resulted in a small MSWD value of zero point one. Conversely, the four merrillite grains with eight data define an isochron age as young as four thousand two hundred plus-minus forty-nine million years. Their model ages range between approximately four thousand one hundred seventy million years and four thousand eighty million years with a weighted mean of four thousand one hundred fifty point three plus-minus eleven point six million years. Detailed results two hundred thirty-eight U two hundred six Pb isochrons are presented in Figures S7-S12. All the isotopic data are presented in Table S2.\ny2qo | In Camel Donga, several anhedral grains of F-rich apatite approximately ten to two hundred micrometers were found in coarse-grained lithic clasts and the granulitic recrystallized matrix. The nearby silica mineral\n1piq | phases are quartz, monoclinic tridymite, tridymite. The isochron ages were calculated using six apatite grains with eight spot data, giving ages of four thousand two hundred twenty-two plus-minus four hundred thirty million years and four thousand four hundred sixty-five plus-minus eighty-two million years, respectively. The large MSWD value of five point zero means that the isotopic data are highly scattered. The model ages vary between approximately four thousand five hundred seventy million years and four thousand three hundred seventy million years. Their weighted mean value was calculated at four thousand four hundred ninety-one point four plus-minus thirteen point five million years, except for the youngest outlier, which had an age of four thousand three hundred seventy-two plus twenty-six over minus twenty-seven million years. There is no apparent correlation between the textural or chemical properties of the individual apatite grains and their two hundred seven Pb* by two hundred six Pb* ages.",
