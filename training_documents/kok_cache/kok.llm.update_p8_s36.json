        "content": "l0a3 | Plotting the modelled A against I sub a b s resulted in lower estimates of r sub d two than r sub d one and plotting the modelled A against I sub a b Phi sub two also resulted in lower estimates of R sub D two than R sub D one than their respective estimates using the observed A, although a single value of R sub d was used for each curve in modelling. This confirmed the analysis that the apparent inhibition of R sub four by light was partly a result of the artefact of changing Gamma star over C sub c with irradiance. The real relative inhibition of R sub d by light can be calculated as:\nu8nw | Inhibition sub real left parenthesis percent right parenthesis equals the fraction of left parenthesis R sub D one measured minus R sub D two measured right parenthesis minus left parenthesis R sub D one modelled minus R sub D two modelled right parenthesis over R sub D one measured times one hundred. Equation five\nl2v9 | Compared with the relative apparent inhibition from the Yin method, the relative real inhibition was much lower. The results also suggested that after correcting for varying Gamma star over C sub c light inhibition of R sub d only became lower but did not disappear: the real inhibition increased generally with relative amounts of photorespiration.\nafbe | Discussion\n78r8 | The 'linear decrease' of R sub d with light cannot generate the Kok effect\n320g | The Kok effect was initially, and is still often, hypothesized to arise from the suppression of respiration by light. This hypothesis has received support from studies that have identified several mechanisms for the metabolic down-regulation of respiratory reactions by light, as reviewed by\ntp8g | y equals x. Gas exchange measurements have shown that R sub d, relative to R sub d k progressively decreased with increasing I sub a b s, either in a continuously linear manner or in a decelerating manner. Using Equations one through three, we assessed the effect of all possible scenarios for the often-said 'progressive' inhibition of respiration by light on the shape of A minus I sub a b s curves. Of the six scenarios considered, only the three scenarios for 'decelerating decrease' of R sub d with irradiance can generate the Kok effect, thereby excluding the other three scenarios that are often considered relevant to the Kok effect. In particular, the scenario of a 'continuously linear decrease' R sub d light did not result in a break in the linear A minus I sub a b s relationship. This is in contrast to the statement in their report for the eighteenth New Phytologist Workshop that 'the widely-accepted (historical) origin of the Kok effect is the inhibition of respiratory metabolism by light (linear decrease of R sub d with light)'. Given the consequences of the various scenarios on the Kok effect, and thus also on the estimation of Phi sub C O two, future",
