        "content": "ma98 | The slight discrepancy arises solely from the fact that a hydrogen molecule is not exactly half the mass of a helium atom! It's a bit heavier. It's actually more like zero point five zero three five-eight times the mass of a helium. This makes its thermal wavelength a bit smaller than our estimate in the last paragraph, which boosts its entropy. It's nice that such subtleties, ultimately due to nuclear physics, are showing up here.\nrboa | By the way, all our calculations have been for the most common isotopes of hydrogen and helium: hydrogen whose nucleus consists of a single proton, and helium whose nucleus consists of two protons and two neutrons. Other isotopes have significantly different mass, and this changes the entropy values significantly.\nbdkb | Puzzle forty-eight. Helium has a lighter isotope called helium three, whose nucleus is made of two protons and just one neutron. The mass of helium three is five point zero zero eight two three times ten to the negative twenty-seven kilograms. If we repeat our calculation of the entropy of helium at standard temperature and pressure, changing only this mass, what value do we get for the bits of entropy per atom of helium three?\nl47b | Puzzle forty-nine. Hydrogen has a heavier isotope called deuterium, whose nucleus is made of one proton and one neutron. The mass of a hydrogen molecule made of two deuterium atoms is three point three four four four nine times ten to the negative twenty-seven kilograms. If we repeat our calculation of the entropy of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure, changing only this mass, what do we get for the bits of entropy per molecule of this sort?\nzio7 | THE ENTROPY OF HYDROGEN: EXPERIMENT\nmty2 | The entropy of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure has been measured to be one hundred thirty point six eight joules per kelvin per mole.\ntbjy | One bit of unknown information per molecule corresponds to about five point seven six three one joules per kelvin of entropy per mole.\nmszq | Thus, each molecule of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure has about one hundred thirty point six eight divided by twenty-two point six seven five equals five point seven six three one\ni0p0 | bits of unknown information.\nok43 | Okay, let's compare our theoretical prediction to experiment.\nqnqv | The experimental figure for the entropy of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure is one hundred thirty point six eight joules per kelvin per mole, which translates into twenty-two point six seven five bits per molecule. This is larger than our theoretical prediction of twenty-one point eight four eight bits per molecule by about three point eight percent.\niwpq | That's not bad. We can say we solved our original problem fairly well. But the percentage error here is about four times worse than it was for calculation for helium. Why is it worse?\noial | I haven't studied this, but I can imagine two reasons. First, remember that quantum effects kick in when V over NA cubed ceases to be large. This quantity is a bit smaller for hydrogen than for helium. Remember, for helium it was two hundred seventy-nine thousand six hundred sixty-three at standard temperature and pressure, while for hydrogen it's one hundred thirteen thousand nine hundred seventy-one. But that's still very large, so I imagine quantum effects are still quite tiny.\n8xfx | Second, hydrogen molecules are not chemically inert like helium atoms, and they're larger, and diatomic rather than monatomic. So I'd expect them to interact more, making the ideal gas approximation worse. This feels like a more plausible explanation for the three point eight percent discrepancy.\npgp5 | Puzzle fifty. Do research to find more accurate calculations of the entropy of hydrogen gas. What are the main sources of error in the calculation we have done here?\n8rz1 | WHERE DID WE GO?\nxhb4 | The mystery: why does each molecule of hydrogen have roughly twenty-three bits of entropy at standard temperature and pressure?\nkext | The goal: derive and understand the formula for the entropy of a classical ideal monatomic gas:\ntshv | minus Wand M plus three times In M plus minus In KT plus Y.\narau | Including the mysterious constant Y:\ni36b | two m m square root.\nx6yc | Y equals two plus one-half plus two.\nxcfx | The subgoal: compute the entropy of a single classical particle in a one-dimensional box:\nybu5 | S equals k times In L plus minus In KT plus minus In one-half.\nwxhx | plus two times In two times one.\nf4i3 | The sub-subgoal: explain entropy from the ground up, and compute the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator:\navlk | S equals k times In one plus one times h times K T square root.\nvi9g | We're done! Or at least we reached our stated goal. But there is a lot more to say about entropy. In a way we've scarcely scratched the surface. For more on the mathematics of entropy, I recommend these books:\ntyl7 | For classical and quantum statistical mechanics, I recommend these:\n2hpu | The second one has an intense focus on our friend the box of gas. And for the principle of maximum entropy, I again recommend this insightful and opinionated text:\na10k | THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS\n2pp5 | Suppose a system has some measure space X of states with functions called energy E : X goes to R and volume V : X goes to R.\nl20h | Consider probability distributions on X maximizing the Gibbs entropy S subject to constraints on the expected values of E and V.\nkfwj | Then as we vary the expected values of E and V we have the derivative of the expected value of E equals T times the derivative of the entropy minus P times the derivative of the expected value of V.\n7hi1 | where T is called temperature and P is called pressure.\nvpa2 | I said we were done. But what kind of course on entropy doesn't cover the three laws of thermodynamics? I talked a bit about the Third Law, but I haven't even mentioned the other two yet.\nmtlg | Here's why: this wasn't a course on thermodynamics. In 'classical thermodynamics' there's a tradition of taking concepts such as energy, work and heat as primitive, and treating the laws of thermodynamics as axioms. I've instead been explaining a bit of 'classical statistical mechanics', where we start with probability theory and attempt to derive classical thermodynamics. In this approach the laws of thermodynamics are not fundamental. They actually look a bit odd: they become results that hold under various conditions, so each one becomes a collection of theorems and conjectures.\n6rz3 | I'll state versions of the three laws of thermodynamics in the language we've developed here. But please be aware that my versions are idiosyncratic and will make some people raise their eyebrows. I'm afraid you'll have to go elsewhere, like Reif's book, to learn these laws in their traditional form!\noxdb | We've been maximizing entropy subject to a constraint on the expected value of one quantity. What if we do two or more? Everything works the same way, but the fundamental relation between temperature, energy and entropy, the derivative of the expected value of E equals T times the derivative of the entropy, gets one extra term for each constraint. The resulting equation is a version of the 'First Law of Thermodynamics'.\nv978 | I'll explain the case with one extra constraint. Suppose we've got a measure space X whose points are states of some system. Choose two functions on it. They could be anything, but let's call them energy and volume and write them as E: X goes to R and V : X goes to R. These terms are favored because thermodynamics arose in part from the study of steam engines, where you've got a cylinder of steam with some energy and some volume. For any probability distribution P: X goes to the interval from zero to one, we can write down a formula for its Shannon entropy\nuqzw | H equals the integral over X of negative P of x times In P of x with respect to x\n56yl | and also the expected values",
