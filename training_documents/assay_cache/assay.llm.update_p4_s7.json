The Xpert sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values and their ninety-five percent confidence intervals were calculated using the following as one of the reference standards: i) LJ culture alone; ii) LJ culture and/or Xpert (confirmed TB); and iii) composite reference standard (CRS) (confirmed TB and Unconfirmed TB). Differences and similarities between the two methods (stool Xpert versus gastric aspirate Xpert) was determined based on the ninety-five percent confidence intervals. Non-overlapping ninety-five percent confidence intervals indicated a difference between the two methods (stool Xpert versus gastric aspirate Xpert) and vice versa.\nf2y8 | Ethical consideration\no7qm | Ethical approval was obtained from Institutional Review Board of Jimma University, Ethiopia. We obtained written informed consent from parents or legal guardians of children and assent from children above ten years old.\nd52l | Results Characteristics of study participants\nqlbb | A total of one hundred seventy-eight children with presumptive PTB were enrolled to the study. Out of these, twenty-six children were excluded from the final analysis: seventeen were unable to provide stool specimen and nine\nnhsg | Xpert MTB/RIF for the diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis\nhy0l | Table one. Demographic characteristics of participants with their diagnostic results.\n4jmz | had contaminated culture results. We included the remaining one hundred fifty-two participants for whom we analyzed seventeen expectorated sputum specimens, one hundred thirty-five gastric aspirates and one hundred fifty-two stool specimens. Seventy-eight of one hundred fifty-two participants were females and participants' ages ranged from seven months to fourteen years (median three years). Majority, ninety-eight of the participants were rural residents. Regarding the clinical manifestation of the participants, one hundred forty-one had cough for more than two weeks, one hundred twenty-two had loss of appetite, one hundred nine had fever, ninety had weight loss, ninety had weakness/fatigue, seventy had shortness of breath and thirty-five had TB contact history. The majority, one hundred forty-two, were vaccinated with BCG. Close to a third of the participants, fifty-four, were severely malnourished, whereas six of them were on anti-retroviral therapy.\nb7cq | Diagnosis of TB\n0b39 | Out of the one hundred fifty-two pulmonary specimens analyzed, MTB was detected in nine by culture and in eight by Xpert. In one of the participants, gastric aspirate Xpert was positive whereas the culture from the same specimen was negative. On the other hand, in two of the participants, culture from the gastric aspirates were positive whereas Xpert results were negative. All the seventeen expectorated sputum specimens were negative by both Xpert and culture. Stool Xpert testing revealed ten MTB positive cases. Rifampicin resistance was not detected in any of the Xpert positive specimens. Table two shows results of gastric aspirate Xpert, stool Xpert and gastric aspirate culture amongst study subjects.\nqecd | Overall, ten of the one hundred fifty-two study participants had microbiologically confirmed PTB, defined as a positive result on culture and/or Xpert on pulmonary specimen. We reviewed the medical records of the remaining one hundred forty-two of participants who were microbiologically negative. Of these, eight point five percent were clinically diagnosed as TB by the clinicians. Among the twelve clinically diagnosed TB cases, eighty-three point three percent showed clinical improvement after ATT. The remaining two cases died after two weeks of ATT initiation and were classified as unlikely TB cases. Out of the ten cases who have improved clinically, four had radiological findings suggestive of TB whereas six had no radiological evidences of TB documented on their medical records and hence were classified as \"unconfirmed TB\". However, none of the children with clinically-diagnosed TB had positive stool Xpert result. In the remaining ninety-one point five percent\n1o7p | Xpert MTB/RIF for the diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis\ncp13 | Table two. Proportion of positive gastric aspirate Xpert and stool Xpert compared to gastric aspirate culture for MTB.\nbgre | of the cases, TB was ruled out and an alternative diagnosis was made and hence, they were classified as \"unlikely TB\".\n57lp | Diagnostic performance of stool Xpert\nukth | Error/invalid results were documented in four point six percent of Xpert tests performed on stool. Due to a shortage of Xpert cartridges, we didn't repeat the tests in these invalid cases. Of the one hundred forty-five stool specimens with valid Xpert results, six point nine percent were MTB positive. Stool Xpert detected all gastric aspirate culture confirmed TB cases and one positive case missed by gastric aspirate culture. Moreover, stool Xpert also detected two MTB positive cases which were found to be negative on gastric aspirate Xpert.\nkpvt | Using culture of the respiratory specimen (gastric aspirate and expectorated samples) as the reference standard, stool Xpert had sensitivity of one hundred percent and specificity of ninety-nine point three percent, whereas gastric aspirate Xpert had sensitivity of seventy-seven point eight percent and specificity of ninety-nine point three percent. Using gastric aspirate culture and/or Xpert positivity (microbiological confirmation) as one of the reference standards, stool Xpert had each one hundred percent sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV.\njie2 | Moreover, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of stool and gastric aspirate Xpert were also calculated with reference to CRS. Accordingly, stool Xpert had a sensitivity of fifty percent, specificity of one hundred percent, PPV of one hundred percent and NPV of ninety-two point six percent against CRS. The corresponding sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for gastric aspirate Xpert were forty percent, one hundred percent, one hundred percent and ninety-one point seven percent respectively compared to CRS. Stool and gastric aspirate Xpert MTB detection rates compared to CRS is also shown in supporting information.\nd0ik | Discussion\n0x0s | Ethiopia is among the thirty countries with high-burden of TB and TB/HIV in the world and there is a huge number of undiagnosed TB in children. The national guidelines for TB care in Ethiopia recommends Xpert for the diagnosis of childhood TB. However, obtaining appropriate respiratory specimens from children is difficult. Thus, a non-invasive sample for the diagnosis of TB in children would improve care for this population. In the current study, we have demonstrated that stool Xpert has comparable performance with gastric aspirate Xpert in consecutively recruited children with presumptive PTB. Other studies have also reported promising findings.\n4exe | Xpert MTB/RIF for the diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis\n```",
