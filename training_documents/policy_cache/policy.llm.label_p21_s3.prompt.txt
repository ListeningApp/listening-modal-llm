You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

uz3c | Along with the technical and organizational aspects, the Data Protection Act limits the use of IS in everyday work practices. Indeed, the Finnish law about the data protection, especially in social and healthcare services strongly guides the street-level workers' access to data. The IS' functions allow containing various data about the clients, yet the law restricts its use. Thus, the street-level workers needed to be well aware of which data they have access to, as well as what they can register and who else can access the registered data. Confusion about the rights to access data sometimes led to fear of mistakes. From the perspective of fluent everyday work, overcoming the organizational and role-related boundaries to access client's data can sometimes be well justified, but the law restricts the access. Quite naturally, the street-level workers did not want to risk breaking the law even if they needed the data.
d5bi | Conclusions
ba4l | As our findings and Cabrera et al. (2001, 245) accurately illustrate: "[a]nyone who has lived through the implementation of a large-scale technological innovation in an
ffx8 | organization has run at some point or another into the crude reality of major organizational and human, rather than purely technological problems.". Indeed, discussions about the technology-driven development of public services often revolve around the aspects, problems and costs of technology as such. Instead, it seems that in the examined context of social services the new IS functions quite well, whereas the hindering and enabling elements of the implementation process are related to other issues than the technology. Next, Table 3 provides a summary of the aspects affecting the implementation of new technology from the street-level bureaucrats' perspective through the analytical framework of public service ecosystems.
s6su | Table 3. Aspects influencing the IS' implementation from a street-level perspective.
y219 | Change in PSE happens through institutionalization as actors disrupt, maintain, and create institutional arrangements (Rossi & Tuurnas, 2021); different institutional arrangements the different components of the PSE hold are brought together and affecting each other. The findings suggest that one of the crucial aspects guiding the implementation process - and technology-driven development - was the experience of individual SLBs working alone both in practices of their everyday work and, consequently, when implementing the new IS.
06ht | The individual context represents the micro-level of a PSE. Here, the institutional arrangement as values, beliefs, aims, attitudes and practices of the street-level bureaucrats guided the implementation process of the new IS. For example, the SLBs' individual history and experiences with previous IS' - as well as technology in general - affected their attitudes and beliefs and, ultimately, the implementation of the new IS. Also, their capabilities to learn new as well as unlearn old practices was seen crucial to the successful
v3r2 | implementation process. As the findings reveal, in social services - related not only to individual context but cutting across the organizational and institutional contexts - the street-level bureaucrats' daily work was often done alone. This, along with the individual beliefs and capabilities to learn, attitudes towards technology and implementation process led to individualized ways of using the IS. As Isett et al. (2006) note, frontline acceptance plays a key role for the success of implementation of new procedures, or as in her, new technologies.
nv42 | Although the empirical exploration focuses on the experiences of the SLBs, the findings are not limited to the individual level. On the contrary, the street-level bureaucrats' experiences about the implementation process reveal aspects related to the organizational (meso) and institutional (macro) levels of the PSE. This finding is in line with Carson et al. (2015) who underlined the systemic context for SLB's space for discretion.
xags | For example, the SLB felt that they did not receive sufficient support and guidance from their managers about how to utilize the features of the new IS, strengthening the role of the SLBs when making decisions about the implementation. This can be considered problematic from organizational and societal aims - choosing not to use for example the structured reporting features of the IS hindered the possibilities to gather data for organizational purposes and, instead, enabled the individualized practices. Consequently, as Torfing et al. (2019; see also Taylor 2014) have argued, we must rethink SLBs' practices, as well as leadership and managerial models in the public sector. Relatedly, the nature and values of social services placing the care and needs of the clients at the core of the practices, thus guiding the SLBs' decisions about the implementation process, can be considered as an overarching aspect that cuts across the levels of PSE.
jc47 | The organizational structures and division of social services' work was one of the crucial hindering elements the SLBs experiences foregrounded. These can be considered as aspects associated with the organizational context (meso level of PSE). Eriksson and Andersson (2023) argue that although the research on public services is building on a service logic, the street-level bureaucrats, in practice, are required to address the service logic ideals about active citizens, interorganizational collaboration and collaborative forms of value creation with NPM logic. Here, the social service organizations' organizational structures and division of work provided what Eriksson and Andersson (2023) describe as 'institutionalized NPM' guidelines for the SLB on how to make decisions about the implementation and practices with the new IS.
ko3c | SLBs' possibilities to foster multi-actor, interorganizational or even intra-organizational collaboration for the benefit of their clients was heavily reliant on the Finnish law. Thus, the institutional context of the PSE guided the implementation process and the practices of the SLBs implementing the IS.
