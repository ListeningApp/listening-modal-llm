You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

zxz6 | 2.6 | Data analyses
xnth | The data were used to assess the prevalence of achieving the aforemen- tioned endpoints at the subject-level and, when possible, tooth level. Although 'stable periodontitis' defines a case at the subject-level, the com- posite measures defining the endpoint <LATEX>\left( P P D \leq 4 m m \right.</LATEX> and <LATEX>P P D = 4 \quad m m</LATEX> + BoP) were used at the tooth level to identify the teeth responsible for not meeting the endpoint. The number of diseased teeth per patient, as per WWC 2017, was calculated using the total number of 'unstable' teeth divided by the total number of (i) subjects and (ii) 'unstable' subjects.
vafm | Incidence of tooth loss within a minimum duration of 5 years of SPC was recorded at the subject- and tooth-level in relation to the various endpoints. The number of teeth lost per patient per SPC year was calcu- lated using the total number of teeth lost divided by the total number of subjects with tooth loss data divided by the weighted average SPC years.
2zmw | Authors of journal articles were contacted if any queries arose from the data. Where data were unavailable for a subject, the corre- sponding subject was eliminated from the analyses.
bf9k | Meta-analyses were performed using 'RStudio' application and R core software to determine the association between the incidence of tooth loss during SPC, as a summary risk ratio, and the unsuccessful achievement of various endpoints. Studies answering FQ-2 with zero subjects or teeth within one of the arms (successful or unsuccessful in meeting endpoints) were not included in the meta-analyses, as two arms were required for the calculation of relative risk (RR). The zero count was inflated to 0.5 to avoid computational errors for studies where no events (tooth loss) were observed in one or both arms. Sub- analyses of studies following conventional APT, as per EFP's S3 treat- ment guideline, or those reporting periodontitis-related tooth loss were performed to explore possible causes of heterogeneity among study results. RRs, their ratios and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as effect sizes. With treatment outcome affected by subject-, tooth- and treatment-related factors, a random effects model was deemed appropriate to calculate the average distri- bution of mean effects, based on clinical and statistical reasoning (Papageorgiou, 2014). The Paule-Mandel method was chosen to

0fpw | The extent and impact of inter-study heterogeneity was assessed by inspecting the forest plots and by calculating the <LATEX>\tau ^ { 2 }</LATEX> (absolute het- erogeneity) and the I 2 statistics (relative heterogeneity), respectively. <LATEX>1 ^ { 2 }</LATEX> defined the proportion of total variability in the result explained by heterogeneity, and not chance, and we considered arbitrarily <LATEX>1 ^ { 2 } > 7 5 \%</LATEX> to represent considerable heterogeneity (Higgins et al., 2003).
dqn8 | Meta-analytical positive predictive values (PPV; a subject/tooth not meeting an endpoint and experiencing tooth loss) and negative predictive values (NPV; a subject/tooth meeting the endpoint and not experiencing tooth loss) were estimated at the subject and tooth level using pooled sensitivity and specificity for tooth loss across studies. For the meta-analytical pooling of the sensitivity and specificity, the bivariate approach was used as an improvement and extension of the traditional summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) approach (Reitsma et al., 2005; Rutter & Gatsonis, 2001) and the mada function in R (Doebler & Holling, 2015).

wak1 | Following screening of titles and abstracts, 230 articles qualified for full-text screening (Supplemental Material S2). The Cohen's kappa value for inter-reviewer agreement was 0.93 at first stage of screen- ing and 0.92 at the second stage. Corresponding authors of the 62 articles considered potentially suitable for inclusion were con- tacted for confirmation that all requested data were available. IPD were available for nine studies (Barbe et al., 2020; Ciurescu et al., 2021; Collins et al., 2022; Cortellini et al., 2020; De Wet et al., 2018; Nibali et al., 2017, 2020; Saleh et al., 2021; Saydzai et al., 2022) and summaries of the requested data were made avail- able via completed contingency tables for a further six studies (Aimetti et al., 2020; Baumer et al., 2020; Graetz et al., 2020; Jiao et al., 2017, 2018; Sonnenschein et al., 2017). There were no impor- tant issues in checking IPD integrity.
