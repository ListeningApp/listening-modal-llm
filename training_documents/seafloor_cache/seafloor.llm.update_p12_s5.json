        "content": "yfum | Site C is a large volcanic cinder cone, rising to approximately seventy meters above the seafloor and with a diameter of approximately one hundred twenty by ninety meters. Chimney complexes and mounds occur on the flank of this cone in the vicinity of a circular slump feature. TKAD zero three two intercepted unconsolidated volcaniclastic cover material to one point eight meters, followed by intensely altered volcaniclastic breccia to six point nine meters b.s.f. The altered sequence consists of monomict lapillistone with subrounded to subangular vesicular clasts but variable clay alteration. The uppermost lapillistone is matrix supported with variable sulfate cement and veins and disseminated pyrite, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite (decreasing downhole). Several horizons are clast supported (up to sixty percent clasts), with angular monomict clasts, and appear to be autobreccias. One gypsum-rich interval occurs at six point four to six point six meters b.s.f. TKAD zero three three was drilled at the edge of a small crater or collapse feature near the summit of the cone. The recovered rock types are similar to those in TKAD zero three two, with a transition between the volcaniclastic cover and the clay-altered footwall occurring at one point one meters b.s.f. Variable alteration intensity gives this rock a polymict appearance.\nppx4 | Site D is an irregularly shaped topographic high, approximately seventy by eighty meters in diameter, in the saddle between two cinder cones. Chimneys occur on the north flank, where there is local venting of milky fluids from fractures near the base of the chimneys. On the northern side of the chimney cluster, TKAD zero one seven intersected unconsolidated volcaniclastic cover material to approximately one point four meters, separated from an interval of chimney talus by a layer of oxidized mud and chimney fragments. The chimney talus extends to a depth of five point two meters b.s.f. but is interrupted by a second layer of oxidized mud at depths of two point six to three point three meters b.s.f. The altered footwall comprises subrounded, matrix-supported, monomict lapilli-sized clasts with minor disseminated pyrite and patchy anhydrite plus gypsum cement that increases downhole to a depth of seven point four meters b.s.f. A few subrounded fragments of chimneys are also found in the footwall. The upper oxidized layer between the cover sequence and the mineralized interval can be traced approximately twenty meters eastward to TKAD zero three zero. The lower oxidized layer was not recovered at TKAD zero three zero; instead, a buried sphalerite-rich chimney was intersected. The drilled sphalerite-rich chimney is underlain by chimney talus, which appears to be continuous with material in TKAD zero one seven. Altered lapillistone to five point three meters b.s.f. consists of several beds that are distinguished by changes in grain size and proportion of clasts to matrix and by a higher proportion of sulfate cement. The two oxidized intervals encountered in TKAD zero one seven were also traced twenty-five meters to the south in TKAD zero three one. The volcaniclastic cover sequence is absent in this drill hole, but\nqf11 | a large chalcopyrite- and sphalerite-rich chimney block that likely came from a chimney complex located upslope to the south was drilled. The uppermost layer of chimney talus was similarly encountered here, extending to a similar depth (approximately five meters b.s.f.). The cover sequence is also absent in TKAD zero one eight to the east. This hole started in oxidized chimney talus that is continuous with the uppermost oxidized interval in the other drill holes. The chimney talus here is only approximately zero point six meters thick, grading to the clay-altered footwall at one point two meters b.s.f. The clay-altered lapillistone at this location contains a higher proportion of fine-grained material (tuff). In the southeast, TKAD zero one nine encountered only unconsolidated volcaniclastic cover material (to six point one meters b.s.f.) that accumulated within a topographic low at the periphery of a chimney cluster. Within the thick accumulation of cover material, there are several distinct intervals of intensely oxidized sediment, which may be continuations with the oxidized layers in the other holes.\n8oqt | Site E is on the southernmost cinder cone near several small craters. TKAD zero zero five is near an inactive chimney complex on the eastern margin of the northernmost crater; TKAD zero zero three is on a small ridge south of TKAD zero zero five, near a scarp that may be a crater wall or slump and adjacent to a site of active venting. Both drill holes recovered moderately sorted, clast-supported, monomict lapillistone with weak grading and intense clay alteration. The matrix consists of anhydrite cement with minor disseminated sphalerite and pyrite that decrease in abundance downhole and are locally oxidized to hematite.\n6zah | Site F is located west of the main north-south-trending fissure, where chimneys and mounds are aligned in a circular pattern, but constructional volcanic features are absent. TKAD zero zero seven was drilled next to a site of active venting in a sequence of clast-supported, clay-altered monomict lapillistone characterized by moderately sorted subangular clasts. The lapillistone is cemented by anhydrite, which increases in abundance downhole and is locally fracture controlled. The breccia also contains minor disseminated pyrite and fracture-controlled patchy iron oxide. A few centimeter-wide pyrite-chalcopyrite veinlets associated with the most intense clay alteration occur at the top of the recovered core. Inactive chimney complexes and mounds surround the area of active venting and appear to be aligned along structural corridors. TKAD zero zero eight is located along one of these northwest-southeast-trending structures, one hundred two meters south of TKAD zero zero seven, on a low-relief ridge with numerous inactive chimney complexes and mounds. The upper part is matrix-supported lapillistone that grades downhole into a clast-supported lapillistone similar to that in TKAD zero zero eight. Increasing clast size and angularity and decreasing alteration intensity downhole suggest that this drill hole may be at the periphery of the main hydrothermal upflow zone.\n4v5o | Seafloor and Subseafloor Mineralization\nha9e | Isolated chimney complexes throughout the Tinakula area are most common on steep slopes that have not been completely buried by the volcaniclastic cover.
