You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

onum | 2.5. Effect of Loading History
3iir | Popov and his colleagues (e.g. [6, 18]) noticed that the applied loading history (or protocol) during an experimental study has a major effect on the observed plastic rotation capacity of EBF links. A comprehensive study on this effect was, however, conducted recently by Richards and Uang [66, 67].
7a0a | Okazaki et al. [29] reported unexpected link web fractures for a number of tested short links prior to reaching the code-specified 0.08 rad rotation limit. Richards and Uang [66, 67] attributed this issue
o1qp | mainly to the utilized loading history and stated that the loading protocol used by Okazaki et al. [29] (based on Appendix S of AISC 341-02 [68]) was significantly more severe than the loading sequences used in the 1980s tests on short links. Nonlinear time-history analyses were conducted by Richards and Uang [66, 67] on three prototype EBF structures subjected to 20 large-magnitude-small-distance Los Angeles ground motions. The obtained cumulative rotation demands were used to come up with a new protocol which was adopted by AISC 341-05 [69] for the cyclic testing of link-to-column connections. The proposed protocol has fewer cycles with large rotations compared to the old protocol.
jrik | Okazaki et al. [29] retested the specimens which failed to reach the code-specified plastic rotation limit under the AISC 341-02 [68] old protocol using the new (revised) loading protocol. All of the newly tested specimens exhibited rotation capacities higher than the code-specified limit, with an average increase of 52% in ymax. Further studies by Okazaki and his colleagues [31, 33] also confirmed the conclusion that the old protocol is overly demanding compared to the revised protocol for shear links. It is worth noting that other loading protocols, for instance, random loading protocols, loading protocols available in specifications other than the U.S. standards, or more severe loading histories than the AISC 341-02 [68] old protocol have also been used in some studies (e.g. [14, 31]) to demonstrate the sensitivity of the rotation capacity of shear links to the applied loading sequences.
xv78 | As explained by Richards [40], if the revised protocol is used for testing intermediate or long links, a modest increase in ymax for intermediate links and a modest decrease in y"ax for long links might be observed. Okazaki et al. [33] also noted that the cyclic demand imposed on flexural links by both protocols is somewhat similar. The revised protocol was used in a number of experimental and numerical studies on intermediate and long links (e.g. [13, 31, 70]). Daneshmand and Hashemi [13] demonstrated the sensitivity of the rotation capacity of intermediate links to the employed loading protocol. The value of ymax obtained via nonlinear FE analysis for an intermediate link reduced by 18% when the link was loaded based on the old protocol instead of the revised protocol.
sdks | 3. Detailing of Links
y8fb | 3.1. Flange and Web Compactness
521q | The link flange slenderness limit is needed to prevent severe strength degradation due to flange local buckling during intense loadings. Kasai and Popov [10] calculated the link flange stress at the ultimate shear of <LATEX>1 . 5 V _ { P }</LATEX> and its associated moment for 156 links with four different yield stresses and two length ratios, <LATEX>\rho = 1 . 6</LATEX> (short) and <LATEX>p = 2</LATEX> (intermediate), with and without axial force. The obtained maximum flange stresses were compared to a conservative critical plastic buckling stress determined based on Haaijer's method [71]. Kasai and Popov [10] did not detect flange buckling for the links with <LATEX>\rho = 1 . 6</LATEX> with no axial force when the flange slenderness (i.e. <LATEX>\left. b _ { f } / 2 t _ { f } \right)</LATEX> was limited to <LATEX>0 . 3 8 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } }</LATEX> , where <LATEX>b _ { f }</LATEX> and <LATEX>t _ { f }</LATEX> are the flange width and thickness respectively and <LATEX>E</LATEX> is the elastic modulus of the steel material. However, if these links were subjected to axial force, the stringent flange slenderness limit of <LATEX>0 . 3 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } }</LATEX> was suggested to prevent flange buckling. On the other hand, some of the intermediate links with <LATEX>\rho = 2 ,</LATEX> especially if subjected to axial force, were prone to flange buckling even if the flange slenderness was kept below the more stringent limit of <LATEX>0 . 3 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } } .</LATEX> Based on these, it was recommended to limit the flange slenderness of links to <LATEX>0 . 3 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } } .</LATEX> This limit was adopted by the early EBF specifications [12, 72, 73] and was in use prior to the 2005 edition of AISC 341 [69].
yogo | Adhering to the flange slenderness limit of <LATEX>0 . 3 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } }</LATEX> disqualified several efficient wide-flange rolled sections constructed from A992 steel from being used as links. A992 steel has become the most widely used steel material in the U.S. and has replaced A36 steel after the 1994 Northridge earthquake [51]. Using heavier sections to satisfy this requirement would be the common approach in practice, but this is not fruitful from the capacity design point of view. Richards and Uang [51] conducted a comprehensive numerical study to further investigate this issue. After verifying the FE modeling procedure using the experimental data reported by Arce [23], a total of 112 isolated I-shaped link models were analyzed considering different flange slenderness values. The numerical results demonstrated that the flange slenderness limit can be relaxed from <LATEX>0 . 3 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } }</LATEX> to <LATEX>0 . 3 8 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } } .</LATEX> Although some of the intermediate links could not achieve the code-specified rotation limit, this issue was related to the stiffener requirements and not the flange slenderness limit [51]. In addition to the
