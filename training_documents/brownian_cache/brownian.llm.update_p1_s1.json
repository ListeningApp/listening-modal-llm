After reviewing the functional integral formulation of the system and its underlying symmetries, including the resulting Ward- Takahashi identities for arbitrary initial conditions, we compute the effective action I from the fRG, approximated in terms of the leading and subleading terms in the gradient expansion: the Local Potential Approximation and Wavefunction Renormalisation respectively. This is achieved by coarse-graining the thermal fluctuations in time resulting in e.g. an effective potential incorporating fluctuations at all timescales. We then use the resulting effective equations of motion to describe the decay of the covariance, and the relaxation of the average position and variance towards their equilibrium values at different temperatures. We use as examples a simple polynomial potential, an unequal Lennard-Jones type potential and a more complex potential with multiple trapping wells and barriers. We find that these are all handled well, with the accuracy of the approximations improving as the relaxation's spectral representation shifts to lower eigenvalues, in line with expectations about the validity of the gradient expansion. The spectral representation's range also correlates with temperature, leading to the conclusion that the gradient expansion works better for higher temperatures than lower ones. This work demonstrates the ability of the fRG to expedite the computation of statistical objects in otherwise long-timescale simulations, acting as a first step to more complicated systems.\nqs5t | I. INTRODUCTION\nen4s | Stochastic processes appear in all kinds of contexts in physics: from the Brownian motion of small particles in a thermal bath to exotic scalar fields experiencing quantum fluctuations in the early inflationary universe, many problems of interest can be described by the overdamped Langevin equation. In this work we employ an effective description of the stochastic dynamics that captures the aggregate effect of fluctuations embodied in an effective action I[x(t)], a functional of the average position x(t) = which can be thought of as an analogue to the statistical free energy and can be derived from the partition function or generating functional via a Legendre transform. Once obtained, the effective action can be used to compute n-point correlation functions of the particle's position, characterizing the system's statistical properties. To obtain this effective action we will be coarse-graining the system in time such that we obtain e.g. an effective potential that incorporates thermal fluctuations on all timescales. To achieve this we will use a technique known as the\ncsb5 | functional, or exact, or non-perturbative Renormalisation Group - see for a review and an entry point to the literature on the subject, for a comprehensive overview of applications as well as e.g. for more elementary introductions.\ni096 | The renormalisation group was brought to full force through the work of K. Wilson who used it to understand phase transitions and since then the RG has become a widely used technique in modern physics with many applications in both particle physics and condensed matter physics. The RG is relevant whenever fluctuations significantly influence the state (static or dynamical) of a physical system. A recent popular incarnation of this programme is the functional RG formulation. Wetterich showed - see also - how one can define I' at some particular energy or momentum scale A in the UV (for us this will correspond to small timestep/high frequency) where the theory is known and then create an RG flow that interpolates through all energy (frequency/momentum) scales down to the IR (i.e. decreasing fluctuation frequency/increasing characteristic timestep of fluctuation here). This change of the effective theory at different scales, the fundamental idea behind the RG, can be formulated in an integro-differential equation known as the Wetterich equation:\ntlzt | One\n6iyf | where Ik is the effective action at scale K, T R denotes a trace over spatio-temporal points (an integral over space-time) and a trace over all other relevant indices, Rk is an IR regulator that acts as a cut-off for fluctuations below (momentum/frequency) scale K, and I two is the second functional derivative of Ik. A simple zero-dimensional manifestation of this flow equation in the context of the Boltzmann equilibrium distribution is illuminating and is reviewed in Appendix A. At the end of the flow, as K goes to zero, all fluctuations are included and the full effective action T is obtained.\no1nk | In this work we solve equation one in the context of the dynamics of particles under the influence of a deterministic force, stemming from an arbitrary potential, and thermal fluctuations. We will study a simple polynomial potential, a double Lennard-Jones potential, as well as one containing multiple barriers/trapping wells, serving as a toy model of an energy landscape on which particles can diffuse. To solve one we employ a widely used approximation scheme, the gradient expansion, to second order. We find good agreement with simulations (and the Fokker-Planck equation where it proved amenable to a numerical solution) at moderate to high temperatures and that this correlates with the spectral representation of the relaxation process, i.e. the overlap between the initial condition (a delta function initial probability distribution) and the spectrum of the Fokker Planck operator. In particular, the more the resulting spectrum is shifted towards lower-lying eigenvalues, the better the gradient expansion agrees with the exact evolution. This is in line with expectations about the validity of the gradient expansion, namely that it better captures slower evolution which should be associated with the lower eigenvalues. Furthermore, we expect that for a fixed initial condition lower temperatures correspond to a spectrum shifted towards higher eigenvalues and, correspondingly, worst performance of the gradient expansion.\nmnaf | We start in Section Two by reviewing the connection between Langevin dynamics and Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics in imaginary time, first shown in - see e.g. for a review of this connection. The path integral formulation then allows us to apply the fRG program directly. We include a brief summary of how the Langevin equation can be reformulated in terms of a probability distribution function whose evolution is described by the Fokker-Planck equation and how the latter relates to a Euclidean Schr√∂dinger equation. We close the section by discussing the symmetries of the resulting theory and their implications through Ward-Takahashi type relations, paying attention to the fact that the initial state may not be that of equilibrium.\n0yxe | In Section Three we present the flow equations for the effective action utilising a slight modification of the results of for supersymmetric RG flows. As we explain, the flow equation derived from the supersymmetric formulation ensures compatibility with the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution, a feature not directly obvious from the application of the renormalisation group to the",
