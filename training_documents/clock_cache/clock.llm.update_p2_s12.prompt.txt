You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

aq5a | In the present article we describe our investigations of the MMO hydroxylase from both organisms in which four substrate probes, 1-4, illustrated in Chart I, have been used to address the question of radical intermediates and other aspects of the hydroxylation mechanism. Specifically, reactions with trans-1,2-dimethyl- cyclopropane (3) and bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane (4), both of which were used to study the rate constants for rebound with cytochrome P-450,21,22 and with two additional, much faster, radical clock substrates, trans-2-phenylmethylcyclopropane (1) and 2,2-di- phenylmethylcyclopropane (2), were carried out to determine whether substrate radicals are produced during hydroxylation. If, for example, hydrogen atom abstraction from probe 1 at the methyl position were to occur, the resulting cyclopropylcarbinyl radical (U', Scheme I) either would be trapped before ring opening to give trans-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)methanol (1a) or would ring open to the 1-phenylbut-3-enyl radical (R°). Subsequent trapping of radical R' would afford 1-phenylbut-3-en-1-ol (1b). Substrate 1 has been employed previously as a hypersensitive radical probe in oxidations by resting cells and crude enzyme preparations of Pseudomonas oleovorans monooxygenase.25 In that work, the only oxidation product detected was the ring-opened alcohol, leading to the conclusion that radical intermediates had been
sc5y | formed and that the oxygen rebound step had a rate constant of <4 × 109 s-1.

w95z | Isolation and Purification of Proteins. M. capsulatus (Bath) was grown as reported previously.11.26 The hydroxylase protein was purified and assayed following the described procedure,11 except that Q Sepharose was substituted for DEAE Sepharose in the initial ion exchange chro- matography step. The coupling protein (formerly designated protein B) was prepared from an Escherichia coli strain harboring a plasmid con- taining this gene from M. capsulatus (Bath)27 and then purified ac- cording to published procedures.28 The reductase was purified as de- scribed28 except that an HPLC TSKG3000SWG column was employed as a final purification step. Specific activities with propylene were measured at 200-250, 8000-8500, and 4000-4200 milliunits/mg for the hydroxylase, coupling protein, and reductase, respectively.
0i1k | Growth of M. trichosporium OB3b and purification of its hydroxylase were carried out as reported.29 Its specific activity for conversion of propylene to propylene oxide was monitored11 with the use of coupling protein and reductase from M. capsulatus (Bath), for which cross-re- activity with the M. trichosporium OB3b hydroxylase has been reported previously.30.31 The measured activity was 180 milliunits/mg of protein, a value considerably less than expected,29 possibly due to the use of coupling protein and reductase from a different organism. Reactions of 15 AM solutions of the M. trichosporium OB3b hydroxylase with 10 mM hydrogen peroxide produced 0.19 mM propylene oxide in a 3-min reac- tion, however, which compares favorably with literature reports that 44 uM hydroxylase and 10 mM H2O2 yielded approximately 0.4 mM pro- pylene oxide in the same time period.16 The measured iron content, 2.2 mol of Fe/mol of hydroxylase, was less than that found by others, 4.3 mol of Fe/mol of protein,29 for which we have no obvious explanation.
dqlg | Synthesis and Characterization of Substrates and Products. The substrate trans-2-phenylmethylcyclopropane (1) was prepared as previ- ously reported32 by reducing commercially available trans-2-phenyl- cyclopropanecarboxylic acid or its ethyl ester to alcohol la, trans-(2- phenylcyclopropyl) methanol, with LiAlH4, converting the alcohol to the mesylate, and reducing the mesylate with LiEt3BH. As an alternative, conversion of alcohol la to the corresponding chloride by treatment33 with Ph3P and CC14 followed by reduction with LiAlH4 gave hydrocarbon 1 and ring-opened product 4-phenylbut-1-ene; treatment of the mixture with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid to epoxidize the alkene byproduct, followed by silica gel chromatography, gave pure 1. Deuterated ana- logues of 1 were prepared by the mesylate route with LiAID4 as the source of deuterium. Their NMR and mass spectra were consistent with the expected amount of deuterium incorporation for each analogue.
p6pq | The substrate 2,2-diphenylmethylcyclopropane (2) was prepared by a sequence similar to that described above for 1. Reaction34 of ethyl diazoacetate in the presence of CuSO4 with 1,1-diphenylethene gave ethyl 2,2-diphenylcyclopropanecarboxylate, which was reduced with LiAlH4 to (2,2-diphenylcyclopropyl)methanol (2a). Conversion of 2a to the mesylate followed by LiEt3BH reduction gave 2.
zse6 | Authentic samples of the products obtained by the MMO-catalyzed oxidation of substrates 1 and 2 were prepared in the following manner. trans-(2-Phenylcyclopropyl)methanol (1a) and its dideuterated analogue were obtained from the synthesis of 1, and alcohol 2a was available in the preparation of 2, as indicated above. Monodeuterated la was pre- pared by LiAID4 reduction of trans-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)methanal which, in turn, was obtained from the acid by sequential treatment with H3BSMe2 and pyridinium chlorochromate.35 1-Phenylbut-3-en-1-ol (1b) and 1,1-diphenylbut-3-en-1-ol (2b) were prepared by reactions of allyl- magnesium chloride with benzaldehyde and benzophenone, respectively.
p2n3 | An authentic sample of trans-2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane (1c) was prepared by the following sequence. Reaction34 of p-vinylanisole with ethyl diazoacetate gave a mixture of ethyl cis- and trans-2-(p- methoxyphenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylates, which was separated by col- umn chromatography and crystallization. The trans isomer, identified
