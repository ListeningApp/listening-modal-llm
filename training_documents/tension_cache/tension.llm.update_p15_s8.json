First, there are tensions arising from different information needs and appetites of different user groups - specifically, between financial market professionals (investors, portfolio managers, financial analysts, etcetera) on the one hand and stakeholders more oriented towards real sustainability impacts on the other hand. Thus, in addition to being tied to the practical nature of these groups' different decision-making purposes, this type of tension may also relate to a deeper-lying ideological tension. The dividing line then goes between those that believe that sustainability reporting should first and foremost be a tool for better informing decision-makers in financial markets about the financial implications of sustainability issues and those that believe that sustainability reporting should serve to increase the transparency of sustainability impacts in a manner that can drive real sustainability improvements.\ns0fl | A different kind of tension relates to the respondents' appetite for standardized and preferably quantitative information on the one hand and for information about emerging topics that are relevant in a dynamic materiality approach on the other. The respondents clearly stated a preference for the former, while at the same time indicating a need for emerging indicators that could be timely, but perhaps less established, standardized and comparable. Thus, this type of tension is also a consequence of taking the time dimension of materiality seriously. Finally and related to the latter, the perspectives of our respondents are suggestive of a tension between comprehensiveness and completeness on the one hand and precision and parsimony on the other, in the information needs and preferences of financial market professionals. As assessing materiality is ultimately about highlighting what is important for users of information, expanding the universe of non-financial information to disclose is in conflict with the attempt to effectively communicate what is most important. Indeed, this tension lies at the very heart of the practical challenges as well as the professional and academic conversations about materiality in sustainability reporting.\n43ia | Potential resolutions\n3g2y | How, then, can such tensions between different approaches to materiality be resolved? Poole and Van de Ven outline several strategies for resolving such tensions and paradoxes between two phenomena A and B. The perhaps most applicable of those strategies is to \"keep A and B separate and their contrasts appreciated\". This implies being as explicit and clear as possible about the manner in which a given sustainability indicator is either material in a SASB sense or in a G R I sense (or both). In its recently published document referred to above, the Global Reporting Initiative and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board argue for exactly such clarity in indicating the combined G R I and SASB relevance and materiality in sustainability reports.\ngc7v | The recent news of a statement of intent to work together towards comprehensive corporate reporting by the institutions C D P, C D S B, G R I, I I R C and S A S B could also prove helpful to provide a clearer and more informative materiality landscape. These five global institutions are responsible for the dominant frameworks, standards and platforms that shape sustainability reporting and the conflation addressed in this paper is in part because of differences in their respective approaches. In addition, in November twenty twenty, two of the institutions, S A S B and I I R C, revealed their plan to merge into one organization in twenty twenty-one - the Value Reporting Foundation. In its recent communication about the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, the E U has also stated its intent to build on this movement towards harmonization.\nwqfv | These two institutions arguably have relatively compatible frameworks and can therefore probably be successfully harmonized into one framework. What remains interesting is how the statement of intent to work together by the five institutions will be\nj30a | done in practice. But indeed, in the joint document, these institutions point out both the need for \"an approach to standard-setting that results in a globally agreed set of sustainability topics and related disclosure requirements that can serve distinct materiality concepts\" and for an approach that \"acknowledges the concept of dynamic materiality and the needs of multiple users.\"\n7bdk | The definition and understanding of materiality matters for these questions because despite increased standardization of sustainability reporting, users of information in financial markets still express a perceived lack of information availability and quality. Such users of sustainability reports require clarity and ability to discern between types of information. Investors need to know which E S G factors are considered financially material in a given industry and whether reported non-financial K P Is are indicative of future financial performance, related to returns, risk and in particular downside risk. N G Os or concerned citizens might want to understand the differential performance of companies on socially and environmentally material factors; that is, they want to understand which companies deliver real sustainable change. And yet other stakeholders might have other informational needs. This heterogeneous nature of stakeholders and their interests also implies that stakeholders systematically differ in their assessments which issues are material and worthy of consideration in decision making. This will require a concept of materiality and associated standards for disclosure that are strategically oriented, combining qualitative and quantitative indicators and forward-looking.\nfim0 | This heterogeneity in stakeholder interests and assessments is of course also exactly what makes materiality a complex phenomenon for reporting purposes and beyond. Katz and McIntosh argued that this complexity is both related to scope - as more and more sustainability issues emerge and rise in importance, disclosure becomes increasingly comprehensive - and to the specificity of disclosures for each industry or even each company. The S A S B approach allows for a narrower focus on the financially material issues demanded by a relatively homogeneous group of financial market professionals, while the G R I approach encompasses a broader emphasis on issues that respond to the information needs of a more heterogeneous group of stakeholders that use this information for different kinds of decisions or assessments. The attempt to combine and harmonize these approaches into one will be challenging but potentially important for retaining a broad focus on real sustainability impacts while ensuring high information quality for professional users of information.\nojro | Conclusion\nl6t9 | In this paper, we have shed light on the nature and consequences of the parallel use of two approaches to materiality in the practice of sustainability reporting. By means of examples and an empirical snapshot of stakeholders in Norwegian financial markets, we have discussed tensions and potential for conflation in practice. We have argued that there is currently some conflation in the conversation about and application of, materiality analyses as a tool for sustainability management and reporting. We have shown the problems of the coexistence of different understandings of materiality and how they may lead users of sustainability reporting information astray.\n1ujy | The need for clarity for scholars and practitioners alike about financially material and non-financially material sustainability issues (i.e. double materiality) as well as the dynamic nature of materiality analyses poses a large challenge for the institutions that shape the practice of sustainability reporting. We therefore welcome the movement towards embracing double materiality and dynamic materiality, as well as the stated intent of the large institutions in the field to work towards harmonized frameworks for sustainability reporting. This requires that\nqzor | Sustainability reporting and materiality\na0by | they succeed in reconciling the conflicting definitions of materiality without creating further tensions and confusion. The recent intention to collaborate between C D P, C D S B, G R I, I I R C and S A S B can be fruitful for such a development and the recent publication by the G R I and S A S B gives some indication of what the path forward may look like.",
