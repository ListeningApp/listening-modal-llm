Both network analysis and agent-based modeling are used extensively in SES research, and offer integrative frameworks that capture relations and connectivity, can help to develop rich pictures, and deal with heterogeneity and redundancy. Agent-based modeling and network analysis are process-oriented models that rely on decentralized control and automata to detect and create emergent patterns, and so do well to account for the adaptive and self-generating organizational capacities of CAS.\n9g22 | Generally, the methods used in SES research have been sensitive to the context-dependency of SES challenges, probably helped by the notion that SES research has emerged from place-based local-scale studies. Many methods used in anticipatory future studies are adept at adapting frameworks to context, and specifically focus on anticipating adaptation and change. These methods, and other participatory research methods that gather multiple evidence-based knowledge can help with observer-dependent framing.\n41fx | Although there are a reasonable number of methods that can account for the dynamic interactions that constitute complex systems and their relations with the environment, it may be difficult to find the necessary data to conduct analyses over sufficient time spans. Nevertheless, in fields such as system and dynamic modeling, there is a notable tradition of developing models that incorporate feedback loops, that is, account for slow and fast variables, nonlinearity, and unpredictability. Lade and Niiranen have proposed generalized modeling to be a particularly promising tool in both participatory and research settings to develop process-based understanding of SES dynamics despite limited system knowledge, but acknowledge that there are challenges to overcome. Similarly, Levin et al. show how essential features of SES have been successfully introduced into optimal management models, particularly in grasslands and coral reefs, and highlight strategies, like modeling fast and slow variables separately where possible, that can improve the suitability of dynamic models to the realities of SES as CAS.\n7um8 | There is mixed evidence for how good current methods are at coping with the radical openness of SES. Although participatory research, which can help with observer-dependent framing, is common, as are a host of other methods that gather multiple evidence-based knowledge, few methods can truly account for unknown variables that could have important influences on model behavior. Stochastic modeling methods, and research conducted at multiple scales, however, offer promising avenues.\nuow2 | Complex causality seems to be the organizing principle of CAS that methods struggle the most to address. To account for the nonlinearity of cause-and-effect trajectories and contend with emergence and the nature of wicked problems, we need methods that are able to collect large volumes of data, sense-making methods that can explore the implication of different trajectories, and methods that trace causality across scales. Although methods\niat7 | such as participatory narrative enquiry and dialogue workshops can help highlight nonlinear and cross-scale relationships, understanding how these relationships drive cause and effect or bring about emergent patterns of behavior is an exceedingly more complex and data-intensive task.\nywwr | CONCLUSION\n0i6j | In this paper we review several dimensions of the growth of the SES research field, most notably describing it by the methods used in empirical SES research. Methodological pluralism remains one of the biggest challenges in conducting SES research. Our categorized list provides a manageable overview of common methods used in SES research that can serve as a guide to new researchers entering the field, and a first step to more methodological transparency. Our list also offers an opportunity for this field to assess its development into the future, particularly in terms of methodological integration. Assessing methods through the lens of SES as CAS offers a first, if limited, perspective on the alignment between the theory and philosophy that underpins SES research and methods used in the field. More empirical assessments are needed on the suitability of different methods for understanding different elements of CAS in SES research, and it would be interesting to see research on the development of new methods to fill identified gaps. Last, this paper focuses on methods used in SES, but the way in which research is combined in different contexts is perhaps what makes the field most interesting. We hope that future researchers will build on our work to investigate the way in which methods are combined in practice, for different purposes, and on the ethical and ontological contexts that shape our questions and approaches.\n87cq | Giupponi, K.
