Like segmental contrasts, the relevant suprasegmental contrasts will differ across languages. If listeners do take account of stress, it can certainly help to reduce the number of word candidates. Van Heuven and Hagman's analyses of the Dutch vocabulary established that words could on average be identified after eighty percent of their phonemes (counting from word onset) had been considered; when stress information was included, however, a forward search was successful given only sixty-six percent of the phonemes. Wingfield, Goodglass, and Lindfield found that stress was relevant in determining the number of potential English word candidates from which listeners' recognition of gated words could be predicted. Section eleven point three considers empirical evidence for whether stress correlates in fact do constrain spoken word recognition.\n1mvw | Eleven point three. Stress in the Recognition of Spoken Words\n6d4s | Eleven point three point one. Lexical activation\nmqah | The acoustic information in the signal which varies as a function of stress could play an early constraining role in lexical activation in the following way: as speech input activates word candidates, only those candidates which match the structure signaled by the input in stress as well as in segmental structure would become active. Words with non-matching stress or mismatching segments would not come into consideration.\nxxr8 | Note that this means that stress information could play a substantial role in lexical activation even in languages where the number of word pairs distinguished by suprasegmental stress cues alone is vanishingly small. Word candidates may be activated by partial information as words are spoken; an utterance of bottle may temporarily cause activation of bother, botch, and botany among other words. A word-initial syllable consisting of a given string of phonetic segments may be differently stressed in different words even though the words do not form a minimal stress pair. Although this is more likely in stress languages without vowel reduction, it also happens in English and similar languages. Thus music begins with stressed mu- while museum begins with unstressed mu-; ad- has primary stress in admiral but secondary stress in admiration. If stress cues distinguish these syllables for the purposes of lexical activation, then mu- is not the same syllable in music and museum, and the utterance of one will not activate, even temporarily, the other.\nrl4j | The same opposition can of course occur with non-initial portions of words - compare -day in today or Tuesday, or -cide in decide or suicide - and this difference may play a crucial role in listening situations in which initial portions of a word have for some reason not been heard. But the role of stress information in constraining lexical activation via distinctions in word-initial sequences is potentially even more significant.\nvz32 | Evidence from studies of the effect of segmental mismatch on lexical activation suggests that as incoming phonetic information matches one of two competitors but not the other, the losing competitor suffers inhibition. Listeners exploit distinctive information rapidly to favor a matched competitor,\nncb0 | which is thus enabled to compete more effectively and actually cause significant reduction in activation of its mismatched rival. The effects of a stress mismatch and a segmental mismatch were directly compared by Soto-Faraco, Sebastián-Gallés, and Cutler. In their study, native speakers of Castilian Spanish heard spoken sentences (of a non-constraining type such as He did not know how to write the word ...) ending with a word fragment which fully matched one of two potential words and differed from the other in just a single phoneme or in stress pattern. For instance, the fragment prinCI- (stressed on the second syllable) matches the first two syllables of the Spanish word prinCIpio (beginning) and differs only in stress from the first two syllables of the Spanish word PRINcipe (prince). Likewise, the fragment sardi- matches sardina (sardine) but mismatches sardana (a type of dance) in a single vowel, and the fragment bofe- fully matches bofeton (smack) but mismatches boletin (bulletin) in a single consonant. At the offset of the word fragment listeners saw a string of letters on a screen and were asked to decide whether this string was a real word. Their responses were significantly faster to a visually presented word after matching fragments (e.g., to SARDINA after sardi-, to PRINCIPIO after prinCI-, etc.) than after control fragments (e.g., manti-); responses after fragments which minimally mismatched and favored another word (e.g., to SARDINA after sarda-, to PRINCIPIO after PRINci-, etc.) were, crucially, significantly slower than responses after control fragments. The three types of mismatch information (vocalic, consonantal, stress) each produced the same pattern of inhibition in Soto-Faraco et al.'s experiment.\n8mp0 | Donselaar, Koster, and Cutler replicated the stress comparison from Soto-Faraco et al.'s fragment priming study in Dutch, presenting fragments like octo- which matched one of either OCtopus or okTOber and mismatched the other only in stress placement. They too found that responses preceded by a matching prime were significantly facilitated, while responses preceded by a mismatching prime were slowed, in comparison to responses after the control prime. Again, listeners used the stress information to speed the victory of one of two competitors for lexical recognition. By comparison, a similar study by Cutler and Donselaar found that fragments like MUzee which mismatched muSEum in stress did not cause facilitation of the matched word, but also did not cause inhibition; no Dutch word begins MUzee so there is no competitor to inhibit the mismatched word. Words such as museum are thus activated only when their initial portions are appropriately stressed. This was shown directly by another of Cutler and Donselaar's experiments, using the word-spotting task, in which listeners monitor short nonsense strings for the presence of any embedded real word. McQueen, Norris, and Cutler had shown that this task could reveal competition effects; the English word mess was detected more rapidly in the nonsense context neMES (which activates no competitor) than in doMES (which activates doMEStic, competition from which slows the recognition of mess). Cutler and Donselaar replicated this result in Dutch: zee 'sea' was detected more rapidly in luZEE (activating no competitor) than in muZEE (activating museum). In MUzee, however, the detection of zee was not significantly slowed, suggesting that museum had not been activated.\nxjyk | A single-syllable fragment (e.g., the first syllable of octopus or oktober) produced significant facilitation if it matched, but did not produce inhibition if it mismatched, i.e., was taken from a word with the contrasting stress pattern (Donselaar et al.,\nmt0f | two thousand and five); the same pattern appeared in a fragment priming study in German by Friedrich two thousand and two. Friedrich, Kotz, and Gunter presented fragments of varying length, but did not use target pairs contrasting in onset stress such as octopus-oktober, so that (as in Donselaar et al.'s study with museum) no competition and hence no inhibition was involved; however, these authors found that facilitation did not significantly increase with increasing fragment size. The difference in inhibition due to the constraint in the competition process exercised by two syllables versus one is presumably a function of number of remaining potential competitors; after two syllables the competitor set will be smaller. In either case, cues to stress in the realization of word-initial portions are clearly used by listeners.",
