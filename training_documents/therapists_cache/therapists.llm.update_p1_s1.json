Describe each of the six modes, including their strengths, cautions, and associated phrases, questions, and facial and body language.\nvtbo | Four point two. Understand the importance of a clear differentiation between each mode.\nq8pa | Four point three. Differentiate between the therapeutic use of a mode and the three circumstances that characterize the suboptimal use of a mode.\nuc9x | Four point four. Apply each of the six modes in a simulation or practice situation.\nzy7o | Introduction\nkcar | Are we obligated to treat clients whose behaviors and attitudes may not be desirable or acceptable to us? To what degree should we try to do so before we decide to refer out? What attitudes and abilities explain the difference between a therapist who can interact successfully with a wide range of clients and one who attempts to do so but has less success with more challenging or disengaged clients? One key consideration in defining interpersonal excellence has been mentioned in the previous chapters; it is the willingness to pursue an empathically based understanding of each client. This allows therapists to accurately identify the critical interpersonal characteristics and events that are likely to complicate the therapeutic relationship. With respect to abilities, the primary means by which therapists may enact an empathic understanding of the client's interpersonal characteristics and events is by adjusting the enactment of his or her interpersonal styles (therapeutic modes) to best meet the needs of the client in a given moment.\n00aw | Initial Self-Assessment\n351p | Before continuing, please turn to the end of this chapter and complete the Self-Assessment of Modes, Version Three. This assessment is provided for you to begin to gain a greater understanding of the modes you might tend to utilize most frequently in a practice situation, and it is highly recommended that you complete this assessment before reading any further. This questionnaire is presented in Exercise Four point one in the Exercises section. After responding to the questions in the exercise, you should continue reading the chapter. After reading the chapter, it is recommended that you score your responses to Exercise Four point one, complete the Personal Modes Profile, and then complete Exercise Four point two. It is recommended that you not score your responses until you have finished reading the chapter.\nzzcb | CASE EXAMPLE Four point one Margarita's Daughter\nmxnx | Kamisha, an experienced occupational therapist certified in hand therapy, is assigned to work with Margarita Ramos. Ms. Ramos has recovered enough from her injury, described in Chapter One, that she is now ready to begin working on the passive range of motion in her hand. Kamisha prefers the Tyromotion Amadeo as a central approach for persons with Ms. Ramos' type of injury. The Amadeo is an interactive technology that uses magnets to guide the hand in ways that increase range of motion. This technology has the capacity to accommodate passive stretching exercises as well as more interactive game work requiring clients to use the muscles in their hands. Kamisha enjoys the Amadeo because it allows her to record the client's progress and grade the exercises according to the client's self-reported pain tolerance, overall development of range of motion, muscle strength, and control.\n11k8 | For her first appointment, Kamisha encounters Ms. Ramos and her daughter in the waiting room. Kamisha introduces herself, deliberately making eye contact with Ms. Ramos, who remains seated.\ntwwy | Kamisha: \"Hello, Ms. Ramos, I am Kamisha, the occupational therapist who will be working with you to strengthen and rehabilitate your hand.\"\nfyp8 | Before her mother can respond, Margarita's daughter rises quickly, towering over Kamisha, and shakes her hand firmly and rapidly, saying,\nz994 | Dr. Ramos: \"Hello, Tamisha (mispronouncing her name), I have learned that you are a certified hand therapist. That's great (wearing an incongruent smile). I'm Dr. Ramos, Margarita's daughter. You can call her Margarita. I will be taking her to her appointments, when I can, and my mom has already signed a HIPAA release allowing me to have access to all information pertinent to her care.\"\nvvqn | Without thinking twice about it, Kamisha responds: Kamisha: \"I always appreciate it when family members are involved in a client's care (empathizing mode). I am very pleased to meet you both. I look forward to our work together\" (encouraging mode).\np6xg | Together, the three of them proceed into the upper extremity laboratory. Kamisha begins the session by explaining the role of the occupational therapist and by orienting Margarita to the various exercises and activities that will occupy a good portion of her time during the next several weeks and by asking Margarita if she has any questions about the process. Outside of a concern about costs, which her daughter quickly resolves, Margarita does not have any questions. Kamisha continues the session by asking Margarita several questions about her various roles and daily activities as a spouse, parent, worker, and homemaker. When Margarita occasionally has difficulty expressing herself in English, her daughter speaks spontaneously on her behalf, sometimes embellishing the responses beyond what Margarita actually says. Though Kamisha has an average proficiency in Spanish, she is not very comfortable speaking it, so she allows Dr. Ramos to continue to take charge of the translating.\nbppc | After several questions, Margarita pauses, and, in Spanish, asks her daughter why Kamisha is asking so many personal questions. According to the IRM, this represents an interpersonal event (reluctance). Instead of asking Kamisha the same question, Dr. Ramos abruptly interrupts Kamisha and states that the questions are making her mother uncomfortable (another interpersonal event, resistance). Kamisha apologizes and asks Margarita, directly, if she wants her to stop asking the questions (collaborating mode). Margarita responds, again, by wanting to know why Kamisha is asking these questions. Kamisha then explains that her goal is to learn about her daily activities so as to customize the treatment to the greatest extent possible. Margarita looks curious, so Kamisha continues to explain, maintaining eye contact with Margarita (rather than with her daughter):\nilnw | Kamisha: \"The more relevant the treatment activities are to what you actually do in your daily life, the more likely it is that the home exercises I recommend will be more transferrable and successful in the long run\" (instructing mode).\nf3rc | Although Margarita appears to accept this explanation, her daughter does not. Dr. Ramos makes the following comment and abruptly leaves the room.\nd7bx | Dr. Ramos: \"I understand that the chitchat is important for your rapport-building, but my Mom's hand is the real priority, here. I want her to have as much time on the Amadeo as possible.\" (speaking to her mother) \"Mom, just have me paged when you are ready for your ride home.\"\ngx97 | Taken aback, Kamisha pauses to collect her thoughts. At this point, Dr. Ramos has left the room, and Kamisha turns to Margarita to say: Kamisha: \"Ms. Ramos, I respect your daughter's desire to ensure that you receive the best care possible (empathizing mode). Once I fully understand the occupations that are most important to you, I will make sure that you spend time on the Amadeo and that you receive the high standard of care that I give to all of my clients\" (instructing mode).\nppkp | It is becoming clear to Kamisha that Margarita's daughter places a high value on information-seeking and has a high need for control (a client interpersonal characteristic, in this case, attributable to the client's family member). The case example illustrates how Kamisha effectively used the empathizing, encouraging, collaborating, and instructing modes to address the interpersonal events that emerged during Margarita's first session.\n```",
