You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

s9zz | 2.2 Metrics
x97k | A program that commands the agent to wander around in a household environment is highly executable but is mostly not correct. On the other hand, a program composed of natural language instructions annotated by humans is likely correct but cannot be executed, because its format is ambiguous and may lack necessary common-sense actions (e.g. fridge must be opened before an agent can grab things from it). We thus consider two axes for evaluation: executability and correctness.
qwix | Executability Executability measures whether an action plan can be correctly parsed and satisfies the common-sense constraints of the environment. To be correctly parsed, an action plan must be syntactically correct and contain only allowed actions and recognizable objects. To satisfy the common-sense constraints, each action step must not violate the set of its pre-conditions (e.g. the agent cannot grab milk from the fridge before opening it) and post-conditions (e.g. the state of the fridge changes from "closed" to "open" after the agent opens it). We report the average executability across all 88 tasks and all 7 VirtualHome scenes.
6lnq | Correctness Unlike most embodied environments where the completion of a task can be easily judged, the ambiguous and multimodal nature of natural language task specification makes it impracti- cal to obtain a gold-standard measurement of correctness1. Therefore, we conduct human evaluations for the main methods. For the remaining analysis, we rely on a match-based metric that measures how similar a generated program is to human annotations. Specifically, we follow Puig et al. [38] and calculate the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two programs, normalized by the maximum length of the two. In the presence of multiple human-written programs for a single task, we take the maximum LCS across them. However, we note that the majority of the tasks only have one human annotation, but there are often many plausible ways to complete a certain task, making
nxb1 | this metric imperfect at evaluation program correctness2. Although correlation between the two is shown by Puig et al. [38], we consider it only as a proxy metric in replacement of unscalable human evaluation.
kwpw | 3 Method
usfa | In this section, we investigate the possibility of extracting actionable knowledge from pre-trained language models without further training. We first give an overview of the common approach to query large language models (LLMs) and how it may be used for embodied agents in Section 3.1. Then we describe an inference-time procedure that addresses several deficiencies of the LLM baseline and offers better executability in embodied environments. We break down the proposed procedure into three individual components, each discussed in Section 3.2, 3.3, 3.4. Pseudo-code is in Algorithm 1.
dnjr | Since LMs excel at dealing with natural language text instead of the specific format required by VirtualHome as described in Section 2.1, we only expose natural language text to LMs. To do this, we define a bi-directional mapping for each atomic action that converts between the natu- ral language format and the program format. For instance, "walk to living room" is mapped to [WALK] (living_room) (1) . Full list of the mappings is in Appendix A.4.
qser | 3.1 Querying LLMs for Action Plans
8gam | Previous works have shown that large language models pre-trained on a colossal amount of data would internalize rich world knowledge that can be probed to perform various downstream tasks [39, 5]. Notably, autoregressive LLMs can even perform in-context learning, an ability to solve tasks using only contextual information without gradient updates [5]. Contextual information is given as part of the input prompt and LMs are asked to complete the remaining text. It often consists of natural language instructions and/or a number of examples containing the desired input/output pairs.
z4db | We adopt the same approach to query LLMs to generate action plans for high-level tasks. Specifically, we prepend one example high-level task and its annotated action plan from the demonstration set to the query task, as shown in Figure 2. To obtain text completion results, we sample from autoregressive LLM using temperature sampling and nucleus sampling [18]. We refer to this LM as Planning LM and the approach using this LM for plan generation as Vanilla (LM), where (LM) is replaced by specific language model such as GPT-3.
lw7l | To improve the generation quality, we follow Chen et al. [7] to sample multiple outputs for each query. However, unlike Chen et al. [7] who investigate program synthesis and can choose the sample with highest unit test pass rate, we only consider the setting where one sample is allowed to be evaluated for each task. This is because repetitive trial-and-error is equivalent to probing the environment for privileged information, which should not be considered viable in our setting. For Vanilla (LM), to choose the best action plan X* among k samples (X1, X2, ... , Xk), each consisting of ni tokens Xi = (xi,1, xi,2, ... , Ci,ni), we select the sample with highest mean log probability as follows:
2exi | ni 1 j=1 ni log po (x , xi, <j) where 0 parameterizes the Planning LM. (1) Xi
16py | argmax ( Po (X) == = >
m4ov | 3.2 Admissible Action Parsing by Semantic Translation
9uqd | One issue arises when naively following the above approach to generate action plans: the plan expressed in free-form language often cannot be mapped to unambiguous actionable steps and thus is not executable by a robotic agent. Many reasons can cause such failures: 1) the output does not follow pre-defined mappings of any atomic action (e.g. "I first walk to the bedroom" is not of the format "walk to (PLACE)"), 2) the output may refer to atomic action and objects using words unrecognizable by the environment (e.g. "microwave the chocolate milk" where "microwave" and "chocolate milk" cannot be mapped to precise action and object), or 3) the output contains lexically ambiguous words (e.g. "open TV" should instead be "switch on TV").
8szx | Instead of developing a set of rules to transform the free-form text into admissible action steps, we propose to again leverage world knowledge learned by language models to semantically translate the action. For each admissible environment action <LATEX>a _ { e } ,</LATEX> we calculate its semantic distance to the predicted action phrase <LATEX>\widehat { a }</LATEX> by cosine similarity:
