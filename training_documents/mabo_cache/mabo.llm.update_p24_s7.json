        "content": "6pmo | The significance of Mabo in this respect is therefore that it has reinforced the legitimacy of international law and instruments as proper sources of influence in the development of the domestic common law of Australia. The proper inference to be drawn is that, after Mabo, the astute lawyer in Australia will, where appropriate, direct the attention of Australian courts to relevant international material. Courts themselves, upon the basis of Mabo and the subsequent cases, will increasingly regard such material as legitimate sources of data. As the cases bear out, such use of international material need not be limited to circumstances in which international law declares the existence of universal human rights. The use will come to extend to other, perhaps more mundane, circumstances. In this respect, Mabo has dictated that the common law of Australia will in future be influenced by legal authority, policy, principle and applicable rules of international law.",
