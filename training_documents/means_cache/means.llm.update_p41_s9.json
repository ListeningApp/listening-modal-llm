It's a bit beyond the scope of this book, but Rosnow, Rosenthal, and Rubin give a very clear account.\nys0g | \"Contrast equals Vt two plus degrees of freedom t two\n7zvp | (thirteen point nine)\nww6u | Therefore, we get (using t from Output thirteen point eight) values of zero point four zero for the covariate, and zero point four eight and zero point one one respectively for the comparison of the thirty-minute group and control, and the fifteen and thirty-minute groups:\nhpi6 | R sub covariate equals the square root of two point two three squared divided by two point two three squared plus twenty-six equals the square root of four point nine seven divided by thirty point nine seven equals zero point four zero. R sub thirty mins vs. control equals the square root of negative two point seven seven squared divided by negative two point seven seven squared plus twenty six equals the square root of seven point six seven divided by thirty-three point six seven equals zero point four eight. R sub thirty vs fifteen mins equals the square root of negative zero point five four squared divided by negative zero point five four squared plus twenty six equals the square root of zero point two nine divided by twenty-six point two nine equals zero point one one. (thirteen point ten)\n4uhb | For the effect of the covariate and the difference between the thirty-minute and control groups the effects are not only statistically significant but also substantive in size. The difference between the thirty and fifteen-minute groups was a fairly small effect.\nepyi | Thirteen point eleven. Reporting results\ny51p | When using covariates you can report the model in much the same way as any other. For the covariate and the experimental effect give details of the F-statistic and the degrees of freedom from which it was calculated. In both cases, the F-statistic was derived from dividing the mean squares for the effect by the mean squares for the residual. Therefore, the degrees of freedom used to assess the F-statistic are the degrees of freedom for the effect of the model (degrees of freedom sub M equals one for the covariate and two for the experimental effect) and the degrees of freedom for the residuals of the model (degrees of freedom sub R equals twenty-six for both the covariate and the experimental effect) - see Output thirteen point six. The correct way to report the main findings would be:\nx95m | The covariate, love of puppies, was significantly related to the participant's happiness, F left parenthesis one, twenty-six right parenthesis equals four point nine six, P equals zero point zero three five, R equals zero point four zero. There was also a significant effect of puppy therapy on levels of happiness after controlling for the effect of love of puppies, F left parenthesis two, twenty-six right parenthesis equals four point one four, P equals zero point zero two seven, partial eta squared equals zero point two four.\nyfum | We can also report some contrasts (see Output thirteen point eight):\nppx4 | Planned contrasts revealed that having thirty minutes of puppy therapy significantly increased happiness compared to having a control, t left parenthesis twenty-six right parenthesis equals negative two point seven seven, P equals zero point zero one, R equals zero point four eight, but not compared to having fifteen minutes, t left parenthesis twenty-six right parenthesis equals negative zero point five four,\nqf11 | P equals zero point five nine, R equals zero point one one. Thirteen point twelve. Brian's attempt to woo Jane\n8oqt | The encounter in Blow Your Speakers had been beyond weird. Jane felt terrible. This Brian guy was so nice to her, and she'd just told him where to go - again! It\n6zah | had been easy to dismiss Brian at first, he'd seemed like a loser, a waste of her time. But there was more to him than that: he'd been working hard to learn statistics, and he'd made impressive progress. She liked how awkward he was around her, and how he always defaulted to talking stats. It was endearing. It could derail her research, though, and he could never know about that. She was a monster, and if he found out the truth it would be another let-down. Best to keep her distance.\n4v5o | The phone rang. It was her brother, Jake. She loved and admired Jake like no one else. Until he left home, he'd been her sanity in the madhouse that they grew up in. Their parents, both highly successful academics, were at home only long enough to pile the pressure on them both to succeed. Jane reacted by spending her youth in books, in a futile pursuit of their attention. Every set of straight A's was met with 'these are just a step towards the exams that really matter, you'll need to up your game'. She was tired of trying to impress them. Jake was her opposite - he'd realized early on that he could never win. He let the pressure roll off him, and left home as soon as he could. But he always looked out for Jane.\nha9e | 'Mum is in hospital,' he said as the blood drained from Jane's legs.\nxrnt | 'I don't care,' she replied, but she did. She also wanted to see Brian, because he was the closest thing she had to a friend in this town.\nc8ra | Thirteen point thirteen. What next?\np1l0 | At the age of thirteen I met my heroes, Iron Maiden, and very nice they were too. I've met them a couple of times since (not because they're my best buddies or anything exciting like that, but over the years the fan club put on various events where you were allowed to stand next to them and gibber like a fool while they humoured you politely). You'll notice that the photo at the start of this chapter is signed by Dave Murray. This wasn't possible because I had my own darkroom installed backstage at the Hammersmith Odeon in which I could quickly process photographs, or because I had access to time travel (sadly), but because I took the photo with me when I met him in two thousand. I recounted the tale of how terrified I had been about meeting him in nineteen eighty-six. If he thought I was some strange stalker he certainly didn't let on. Uncharacteristic of most people who've sold millions of albums, they're lovely blokes.\n```",
