You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

y5r7 | Both the chemistry involved in the decay of compound Q and the proposed formation of an intermediate substrate radical can be investigated through the use of isotopically labeled methane. If we are correct in our proposals that the substrate oxidation chemistry of MMO occurs during com- pound Q decay, and that this chemistry involves complete
lrry | substrate C-H bond cleavage, then a substantial primary kinetic isotope effect in the decay of compound Q should result from deuteration of the methane. In contrast, the concerted reactions proposed in many of the other postulated mechanisms for MMO would not be expected to exhibit large primary KIEs. We demonstrate here that the oxidation of methane does show a large primary isotope effect. Indeed, the KIE is possibly the largest observed for any biological system reported to date, consistent with the hydrogen-atom abstraction mechanism for MMO.
hvhm | EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
863b | Enzyme Preparation, Characterization, and Assay. Bacte- rial growth and purification of MMO from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, as well as enzyme activity assays, were as reported previously (Fox et al., 1989, 1990b). MMOH exhibited specific activity in the range of 600-800 nmol/ min/mg for furan turnover. The temperature for assays was 23 ℃, except in cases where a direct comparison with transient kinetic data was required. In these cases, the temperature was 4 ℃. The buffer for all experiments was 100 mM MOPS, pH 7.7.
fj24 | Chemicals and Standard Procedures. All reagents were the highest grade available and were obtained from Sigma, Aldrich, or EM Scientific. Deuterated gases were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Labs or ICON, and each was shown to be a single isotopic homolog (>99%) by mass spectro- metric analysis. Water was deionized and glass distilled. Anaerobic techniques have been described previously (Fox et al., 1989).
uz3c | Stopped-Flow Absorption Spectroscopy Experiments. MMOH (60 uM, 120 uM active sites) and methyl viologen (10 µM) were made anaerobic in 100 mM MOPS, pH 7.7. Sodium dithionite was added stoichiometrically (2 mol of reducing equivalents/mol of active sites) to reduce MMOH. MMOB was added anaerobically to a final concentration of 120 uM. The enzyme solution was then loaded anaerobically into one stopped-flow syringe. The other stopped-flow syringe was loaded with oxygen-saturated buffer, with or without substrate. GC analysis of CH4- or CD4-saturated buffer or water at 23 ℃ showed the same dissolved methane concentration in all cases within experimental error. The concentration of a saturated solution was 1.5 mM (Merck Index). Single-turnover reactions by MMOH (4 ℃) were followed by using a single-wavelength stopped-flow ap- paratus (Update Instruments, Inc.) at 430 nm.
d5bi | Data Analysis and Simulation. The data were analyzed by using a nonlinear regression fitting program (KFIT, obtained from N. Millar, Kings College) to determine the formation and decay rates as previously described (Lee et al., 1993b). The slope of a plot of the observed rate constant versus substrate concentration is the second-order rate constant for the reaction. The ratio of the second-order rate constants for the reaction conducted with protiated and deuterated substrates gives the KIE. The data were analyzed as a straight line because, for methane and six other substrates examined, the compound Q decay rate is best fit as a linear function of substrate concentration. Over a much wider concentration range, the data may conform to the usual hyperbolic function; however, low solubility of substrates, and the steady decrease in the maximum amount of compound Q that can be observed as the decay rate increases, prevents examination of the kinetics at such high concentra-
ba4l | tions. The data shown for compound Q kinetics with each of the five different isotopic homologs were obtained by measuring the rates of formation and decay of compound Q with at least five repetitions at each of four different methane concentrations. This entire procedure was repeated 2-5 times for each isotopic homolog.
ffx8 | The simulated curves shown in Figure 3 were calculated by assuming the rate of oxidation of a C-H bond in CH4 to be equal to 3.9 s-1, which is equal to 25% of the overall rate of reaction of CH4. The calculated rate for compound Q decay in the presence of intermediately deuterated meth- anes was determined by summing the contributions of the H-abstraction process and the D-abstraction process to give the overall rate using the following equation:
s6su | observed rate = (3.9x)/(S4-") + 3.9(4-x)/(PS3 -* )
y219 | where x is the number of hydrogens of the isotopic homolog, P is the primary isotope effect, and S is the secondary isotope effect (Bell, 1973).
06ht | Product Yield Experiments. Products were recovered from a single turnover of diferrous MMOH. The enzyme con- centration, reduction procedures, and reaction conditions were as described earlier for stopped-flow experiments. The enzyme solution and a mixture of substrate (CH4 and CD4, 640 uM; other isotopic homologs, 1.28 mM) and oxygen (200 µM) were loaded into separate stopped-flow syringes. A mechanical ram was used to push the solutions through a mixer and into a collection vial. The temperature was maintained at 4 °C.
v3r2 | Methanol Derivatization. The alcohol products produced by MMOH were first derivatized by the Schotten-Baumann procedure (Loudon, 1988). The reaction solution following the single turnover was added to CH2Cl2 (50 mL) and then esterified using 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl chloride (2 mmol), N,N- dimethylaniline (2 mmol), and NaOH (2 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 17 h at room temperature. The organic layer was washed with 3 x 100 mL of HCI (1.0 M) followed by 3 x 100 mL of 5% NaHCO3-2 M NaCl, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evaporated to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in 2.0 mL of CH2Cl2. Thin- layer chromatography using silica gel plates and CHCl3 as the mobile phase allowed separation of the methyl ester product at an Rf of 0.5-0.7. The area containing the product was scraped off and eluted with CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 was evaporated to a minimal amount and the product was analyzed by mass spectrometry.
