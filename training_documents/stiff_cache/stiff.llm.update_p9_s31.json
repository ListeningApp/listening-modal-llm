        "content": "qy1i | Seven. The effect of overconsolidation on the secant modulus was found to be highly axial strain level dependent. As has been shown by many researchers, it is insignificant for silica sands at very small strain E subscript a equals one times ten to the negative three percent, increasing thereafter with an increase of the strain and reaching the maximum values at calligraphy E subscript a around zero point zero five to zero point one percent. The influence of OCR on the E subscript sec results are more pronounced for the anisotropically K zero-consolidated specimens than for those subjected to isotropical consolidation.\n1k9e | Overall, the phenomenological examination of the drained triaxial compression tests results gathered for three sands has shown that, in the strain range of zero point zero one to zero point one percent, the soil stiffness under axisymmetric loading conditions exhibits a highly pronounced nonlinearity and is strongly influenced by the test conditions, in particular, the consolidation stress ratio and OCR.\n5bjs | The data presented here provide evidence of the inadequacy of some existing quasilinear fitting equations (e.g., conventional hyperbola) to reproduce the variation of E subscript sec in the strain range of practical interest. Moreover, data presented in this paper can guide practitioners in selecting the equivalent stiffness that can be used for simple calculations using the formula of the theory of elasticity.",
