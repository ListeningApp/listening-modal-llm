You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

8oqt | In contrast to the pro-tumorigenic role of many GPCRs, GPCR-driven signalling has in some cases, been shown to play a tumor suppressive role, highlighting the complexity and the cell- context dependency of these signalling events. This is highly aligned with tumor suppressive roles for heterotrimeric G proteins in certain contexts as well. For example, inactivation of Ga13 signalling, either by inactivating mutations in the Ga13-coupled Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2), or in Ga13 itself have both been identified to enhance tumor progression in diffuse large B cell lymphoma90. Moreover, the Kisspeptin receptor (KISS1R) has been widely
6zah | implicated as a metastatic suppressor in numerous cancer types91,92. Similarly, GPR68 was first found to be a metastatic suppressor in prostate cancer and was found to be significantly downregulated in metastatic tumors; however, further work has shown that GPR68 is highly upregulated in pancreatic cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and represents an emerging drug target in this cancer type93-95 (Figure 1). In another case, targeting of dopamine receptors in cancer has been shown to have highly tumor-type specific effects, where both activation and antagonism have been found to have anti-tumor effects96. However, in the particular case of glioblastoma, targeting of the dopamine receptor DRD2 has shown to be a highly promising drug target, with the compound ONC201 being investigated in clinical trials96,97. Finally, ADGRB1-3, also known as the BAI family GPCRs, are silenced or mutated in numerous cancer types98 (Figure 1). See below (GPCRs and Genome Instability) for more details on the effect of BAI1 loss on genomic instability.
4v5o | Mutations in heterotrimeric G Proteins in Cancer
ha9e | The unanticipatedly high frequency of mutations in GPCRs coupled with their complex expression and mutation patterns in different cancer types highlight the previously underappreciated role of GPCR signalling in cancer. Detailed work on the functional impact of GPCRs in cancer, exploiting novel computational biology pipelines, structure-function predictions, and functional analyses of the impact of cancer-associated mutations in GPCRs will contribute to establishing GPCRs as cancer-specific drivers. In contrast, the presence of hotspot mutations in heterotrimeric G proteins defines them as driver oncogenes in specific cancer types. Here we will summarize the role of heterotrimeric G proteins in cancer and as cancer drivers.
xrnt | Signalling through Gaq G proteins- The GNAQ oncogenes
c8ra | The Gaq family of heterotrimeric subunits, encoded by GNAQ, GNA11, GNA14 and GNA15, and their coupled receptors, are responsible for transducing many of the mitogenic signals initiated by growth factors acting on GPCRs4,99. Members of the Gaq family activate phospholipase-CB (PLCB1-4), which cleaves PIP2 into diacyglycerol and inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate. Generation of these second messengers triggers the mobilization of cytosolic calcium and all together, elicit the activation of numerous downstream signalling events via regulated kinases and transcriptional networks8-11. Mutation of the Gaq subunit into a GTPase defective, constitutively active conformation was originally modelled based on previous studies examining mutations in the ras oncogene100. These Gaq mutants induced malignant transformation in NIH3T3 cells and were found to be tumorigenic in nude mice 100.
p1l0 | Since this original discovery, aberrant Gaq activity has been found to be involved in diverse pathological conditions including congenital hemangiomas, leptomeningeal melanocytic lesions, Sturge Weber syndrome, and recent cancer sequencing efforts revealed that GNAQ and GNA11 are significantly mutated in uveal melanomas (UM) (MutSig2CV q-values = 6.08E-13) (Table S3). More specifically, activating mutations in Gaq or Ga11, predominantly at Q209, are collectively found in >90% of UM where they act as driver oncogenes101-105 (Table 1, Table S3, Table S4, Table S5). The Gaq family is also mutated in roughly 10% of skin cutaneous melanomas (Table 1, Table S5). UM is the primary cancer of the eye in adults, affecting roughly 2500 patients in the US each year106. Nearly 5% of UM patients who lack mutation in Gaq or Ga11, possess mutually exclusive activating mutations in other levels of the Gaq pathway, including in CYSLTR2, a Gaq- coupled GPCR (MutSig2CV q-value = 0.005), or PLCB4, a downstream effector of Gaq, firmly establishing hyper-activation of the Gaq-pathway as the oncogenic driver of UM107,108 (Table S3). UM caused by mutation and hyperactivation of CYSLTR2 remains one of the most striking examples of a GPCR-driven cancer type to date109 (Figure 1).
1i8b | Studies investigating the mechanisms by which aberrant Gaq signalling drives tumorigenesis have revealed that compared to the transient stimulation of second messengers and mitogenic kinases after canonical Gaq stimulation, mutant Gaq requires a protein-protein interaction with the Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) TRIO in order to sustain persistent signalling110. In in vivo UM models, knockdown of TRIO phenocopies reduction of Gaq expression based on cell proliferation assays, tumorigenic potential as well as activation of JNK, p38 and AP-1-mediated transcription110. Remarkably, this signalling circuitry was independent of PLCß, the best-known target of Gaq and led to the activation of YAP, a transcriptional co- activator regulated by the Hippo pathway. The Hippo pathway is a tumor suppressive pathway, broadly involved in cell proliferation and organ size control, and has been found to be frequently altered in cancer111. In UM, YAP activity was demonstrated to be necessary for tumor growth and proliferation112,113. Recently studies have shown that Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), is a central mediator of the Gaq-driven oncogenic signalling circuitry by controlling the activation of YAP, thereby representing a potential therapeutic target for patients with UM114.
