You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

qfmx | In contrast to a rather transparent view of their discourse as simply reflecting internal processes, we see the conversational positioning of maturity as discursive, culturally relevant ways of attending to the edge of disputability that may be heard in talk that is about potentially self-incriminating topics, such as one's interest in sexual or physical attraction. Part of 'doing maturity' in these contexts means orienting openly and clearly to the features of 'heterosexual desire' (so as to appear 'cool' or 'not gay'), but in ways that fight shy of appearing shallow, sexist, ignorant or desperate. Doing 'hetero-normative masculinity' while appearing to be 'mature' about it is thus an evasive, inscrutable and insinuatingly strategic project. Seen this way, our work is consonant with research that has focused on the discursive strategies used to resist the trouble, prejudice or appearance of complicity with 'hegemonic masculinity' in talk (see Bamberg, in press a; Gough, 2001; Speer & Potter, 2000, Wetherell & Edley, 1999). As developmental psychologists, we are interested in such strategies because they form the discursive means that facilitate the radical re-orientation from a 'normatively asexual peer cohort' during childhood into the 'normatively heterosexual' and contested social arrangements that are characteristic of adolescence (Eckert, 1994).
rut3 | A discursive psychological methodology
m3cp | Discursive psychology is a social constructionist approach that applies ideas from ethnography, discourse analysis and ethnomethodology to psychological issues and concepts (Edwards & Potter, 1992; Potter, 1996; Potter & Wetherell, 1987). A discursive approach is concerned with identifying the rhetorical and argumentative organization of discourse. This means paying close attention to the way speakers' accounts are rhetorically and argumentatively organized, often taking the form of contradictory and inconsistent versions of people, motives, states of mind or events. It is with this analytic focus that our approach parts company with the majority of
mq4s | traditional psychological research that attempts to measure adolescents' development of sexual identity through attitude scales and inventories.
95el | One such tradition is the 'masculine gender-role socialization paradigm' that is currently popular within the 'new psychology of masculinity' (see Good et al., 1994; Levant, 1996; Thompson, Pleck, & Ferrera, 1992). This orientation assumes that masculine norms and ideologies are internalized by individuals, and that this internalization often creates negative psychological and physiological effects (or conflict/strain). In a way, the 'new psychology of masculinity' paradigm can be classified as social constructionist, in that it theoretically embraces the broad idea that ideologies and norms are social, cultural and interactive in nature (see Levant, 1996). It does not, however, generally advocate studying such norms and ideologies as they are socially, culturally or interactively constructed. Rather than focusing on the processes of social construction, the empirical focus has been primarily on the product of psychological (not social) construction; that is, on the individualized and internalized 'categorization' and then expression of one's attitudes towards items on questionnaires, items that are ostensibly 'valid' referential mappings of masculine ideologies and norms.
a0a5 | From a discursive perspective, the key problem is that expressing a forced choice or Likert-scale attitude is entirely different than expressing an attitude in daily social interaction. First, questionnaire items tend to reify the issue under scrutiny (sexual/ gender norms) by stabilizing them in the form of relatively stereotypical and arguably facile descriptions that may be easily associated with sexism, shallowness or chauvinism, and thus rejected. Second, the forced choice format systematically strips off the interactive subtleties and rhetorical finessing that are part of the daily expression of attitudes, evaluations and assessments. In a questionnaire, the boys may predominantly disagree with the attitudes that are purportedly associated with the items, especially if those items are measuring something like overt sexism. But in their daily interactions, they may actually put such attitudes to use in myriad ways, constructing them as caricatures, displacing them onto 'other' boys, orienting to them in ironic, tongue-in-cheek ways, or at times even claiming them in order to resist being positioned as effeminate, soft or weak.
gocl | As such, we are aligning ourselves with a discursive approach that examines evaluative expressions as parts of interactive, social and cultural practices, which entails a close scrutiny of how such expressions are put to use, as opposed to speculating about the mental or attitudinal objects that they putatively reflect (Edwards & Potter, 1992; Potter, 1996; Potter & Wetherell, 1987). Rather than seeing attitudes as mentally held, either/or, and slow to move, we see attitudes as talk's business, as partial and shifting devices (or 'topics') that spring up in a constantly shifting interaction that occasions and makes use of these devices, and then moves on (Antaki, 2004; Edwards & Potter, 1992). As a result, the discursive approach we work from is fully interested in the inconsistencies, contradictions and ambiguities that arise as the boys try to find ways to mitigate the interactive trouble and to appear mature in talking about their attraction to girls' looks. Rather than seeing these shifts and equivocations as an analytic nuisance, they are exactly what are most interesting. They offer a way into examining how the boys are bringing off and managing their social identities (Bamberg, in press a). Seen this way, they no longer appear as contradictions or inconsistencies, but rather as openings into which the analyst can delve and see how such multiple attending and rhetorical finessing is used to work up identity claims that do not appear too obvious, challengeable or immature.
