You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures

wtse | Paradoxically, the Chinese preparations for a military intervention were triggered by the North Korean military success during the war's first stage. Being aware of the vulnerability of the KPA because of its long supply lines, on August 5, the Central Military Commission under Mao ordered the PLA to complete war preparations before September 30. During the third week of August, high-ranking officers of the Chinese Operation Office and senior Foreign Ministry officials conducted a series of discussions and concluded that the American amphibious landing and counteroffensive was to be launched soon. Of six potential ports suitable for such a landing, Inchon was the most likely one. This estimate was delivered to the Chinese leaders on August 23, precisely the same day that MacArthur made his final decision to land at Inchon. A senior American civilian official in Japan noted in his memoirs that the fact that Inchon was the site of the planned landing "became almost an open secret in Tokyo." It is possible, then, that besides brilliant strategic thinking, the Chinese also had relevant intelligence information.
bm7g | Mao warned Kim Il Sung about the incoming American Inchon landing, but the KPA avoided taking the necessary measures to meet this threat and continued focusing on the occupation of the Pusan perimeter. 89 The decision to cross the Yalu and meet the UN forces in North Korea, which from the Chinese perspective constituted a preemptive strike, was taken during the first week of October, and the order to 4 "enter Korea immediately" was given on October 8. The crossing of the 260,000-strong force started on the night of October 18-19 and a first, unexpected, clash between a CPVF division and the Seventh Regiment of the Sixth ROK Division took place three days later. According to Chinese sources, during this first campaign the CPVF
jr68 | eliminated about half a dozen ROK battalions as well as some small American forces. Due to insufficient fire power, the CPVF failed in reaching its original mission-annihilation of three enemy divisions."
axix | Following the first campaign, the Chinese generals began preparations for a larger one. In addition to resupplying and enforcing the CPVF, the Chinese generals implemented a deception plan, creating the impression that their forces were weak and were retreating in an unorderly manner to the Yalu. The goal was to lure MacArthur's forces to the north, extending their supply lines. The CPVF also released a hundred POWs, including some Americans, who were told that owing to supply problems, the Chinese forces had to return to China." MacArthur fell into the trap, and on November 25, a day after he had started his main offensive to end the war by Christmas, the CPFV launched a counteroffensive, causing the American army its worst defeat since the 1944 Battle of the Bulge. At its root was a major intelligence fiasco.
05y4 | b. The American surprise
2fb0 | i. The intelligence information and its estimate
s9fn | The poor state of American intelligence prior to the war did not change much after the war had started. This owed not only to the lack of adequate linguists and equipment but also rigid regulations, bureaucratic rivalry, and leadership deficiencies.95 The result during the war's first months was a low level of combat intelligence.
k5r6 | Humint, which was of low quality prior to the invasion, was almost entirely wrecked when the KPA moved south, capturing, killing, or neutralizing whatever networks had been active before the war. Although according to one official history, Willoughby requested the CIA to bridge 4 the intelligence gap at the outset of the war,4 other sources emphasized his attempts to get rid of the CIA and take complete control.95 In any event, CIA and G-2 attempts to infiltrate agents into the occupied territories by line-crossing, parachuting, or boat landing failed. Most of the agents were lost and the information that was brought by the others was old and useless. Consequently, combat information from Humint sources came mainly from interrogations of refugees and of a few KPA POWs." Aerial reconnaissance was mainly used to support air bombings in North Korea and provided no significant support for the UN ground warfare.97
z9v9 | Although AFSA moved to full shifts, Sigint provided only minor support to the fighting forces. During the war's first weeks, much attention was devoted to the Soviets. Only when it became evident that the USSR had made no preparations to intervene were twelve intercept positions transferred from Chinese and Soviet coverage to Korean duties. Here, COMMINT suffered from a shortage of high-quality monitoring equipment and skilled manpower. The entire US military had only 20 Korean-speaking linguists, and non- Americans linguists, primarily former Japanese intelligence officers, who had served in Korea, had to be used."" Willoughby, moreover, regarded his only duty to be providing intelligence to MacArthur.
gpu9 | Consequently, he prevented, despite requests from Washington, the transfer of Sigint units to the Pusan perimeter. He also avoided distributing, allegedly for security considerations, operational intelligence to the Eighth Army, which was defending the Pusan parameter, thus denying its commander, Gen. Walton Walker, the information he needed to carry out his missions. The only Sigint support that the Eighth Army received was from an improvised South Korean unit called Group M. Despite its being plagued by many deficiencies
u5ws | The efforts to monitoring China, primarily its preparations for a massive intervention in the war, went somewhat better, and the source of the failure here lay within the sphere of analysis. Although the CIA had
onkh | lost all its assets in mainland China following the Communist victory there, it succeeded in receiving some relevant information through other sources. On October 19, the same day the PLA started crossing the Yalu, a Hong Kong-based Chinese businessman warned that 400,000 PLA troops had started or were about to start crossing into North Korea.10 CIA officers in Tokyo warned twice of a 300,000-strong PLA force deployed near the Yalu.10 These warnings had no impact on intelligence estimates. MacArthur himself rejected them, and threatened to arrest a CIA officer stationed in Tokyo for warning about a coming Chinese intervention.103
8t55 | Aerial reconnaissance occasionally yielded some useful information. In early September, one warning indicator concerning possible Chinese intervention involved aerial photographs that showed three air-force bases, capable of handling a total of 300 aircraft, had been built in close proximity to the Yalu.104 104 On October 18, aerial photographs showed that close to a hundred Soviet-made aircraft had been deployed in those fields.105 The obvious conclusion should have been that the Chinese were building air support for a potential large-scale confrontation with the UN forces.
