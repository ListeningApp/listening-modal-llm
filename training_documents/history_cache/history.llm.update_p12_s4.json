        "content": "0myz | In the nineteen seventies, the predominant focus on hyperactivity was shifted toward an emphasis on the attention deficit in affected children. In a paper addressed to the Canadian Psychological Association, Douglas argued that deficits in sustained attention and impulse control were more significant features of the disorder than hyperactivity. In addition, these symptoms were the ones showing the best response to stimulant treatment. Douglas' paper was very influential at the time and provoked further research on this issue and finally initiated a complete change in the conceptualization of the Hyperkinetic Reaction of Childhood. \"In nineteen eighty, the importance of attentional problems in the syndrome was recognized-and perhaps exaggerated-by the adoption of a new diagnostic label\" With the publication of DSM-III in nineteen eighty, the American Psychiatric Association renamed the disorder \"Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) (with or without hyperactivity)\". DSM-III took the position that hyperactivity was no longer an essential diagnostic criterion for the disorder and that the syndrome occurred in two types \"with or without hyperactivity\". Deficits in attention and impulse control were, however, considered significant symptoms in establishing a diagnosis. In this respect, DSM-III departed from the \"International Classification of Diseases\" by the World Health Organization, which continued to focus on hyperactivity as an indicator of the disorder. DSM-III developed three separate symptom lists for inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, which were far more specific than previous ones. In addition, DSM-III introduced \"an explicit numerical cutoff score for symptoms, specific guidelines for age of onset and duration of symptoms, and the requirement of exclusion of other childhood psychiatric conditions\".\nxh3i | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (nineteen eighty-seven, revision of the third edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-III-R)\nsyiw | The discussion regarding the importance of certain symptoms continued, and the creation of subtypes of ADD on the basis of the presence or absence of hyperactivity was discussed controversially. When the\nkg3t | concept of ADD was formulated, \"little, if any empirical research on this issue existed\". At that time, it was not evident if the attention deficit of the subtype of ADD without hyperactivity was qualitatively similar to that of the subtype with hyperactivity, or if the two types had to be considered as two separate psychiatric disorders. In order to further improve the criteria, in particular with respect to empirical validation, the revision of the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R) in nineteen eighty-seven removed the concept of two subtypes and renamed the disorder \"Attention deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\". The symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity were combined into a single list of symptoms with a single cutoff score. The symptoms were empirically derived by rating scales and a field trial. The subtype \"ADD without hyperactivity\" was removed and assigned to a residual category named \"undifferentiated ADD\".\nlvae | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (nineteen ninety-four, fourth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV)\no9sc | In addition to the reorganization of the concept of ADD, several studies examined the existence of subtypes of ADD at the end of the nineteen eighties. It was found that children with ADD without hyperactivity differed from children with ADD with hyperactivity in that they were \"more daydreamy, hypoactive, lethargic, and disabled in academic achievement, but as substantially less aggressive and less rejected by their peers\". In addition, some doubts arose as to the central role of a deficit in attention in so-called ADHD. The view emerged that motivational factors and deficits in reinforcement mechanisms were of major importance. Historical interpretations of brain damage or dysfunction were supported by the evidence of structural abnormalities in the brain of children with ADHD as shown with new neuroimaging techniques. Up until the end of the nineteen nineties, most studies \"have implicated the prefrontal-striatal network as being smaller in children with ADHD\". Further research found a genetic component of the disorder. It was finally recognized in the nineteen nineties that ADHD was not exclusively a childhood disorder, which disappeared with age as was previously thought, but rather a chronic, persistent disorder remaining into adulthood in many cases. Before the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) was\n121u | The history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\nzh03 | outlined in nineteen ninety-four, another large field trial was conducted. Three subtypes of ADHD were identified on the basis of structured diagnostic interviews of multiple informants and of validation diagnoses. The previously heterogeneous category of ADHD according to DSM-III-R was consequently subdivided into three subtypes, i.e. a predominantly inattentive type, a predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type, and a combined type with symptoms of both dimensions. By using this categorization, the concept of the two separate dimensions of attention deficit and hyperactivity-impulsivity was reverted and the possibility of a diagnosis of a purely inattentive form of the disorder was reintroduced. The American Psychiatric Association accredited the diagnosis of ADHD in adulthood by including examples of workplace difficulties in the depiction of symptoms. \"Based on a much larger field trial than any of their predecessors, the DSM-IV criteria for ADHD are the most empirically based in the history of this disorder\".\n1mvw | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (two thousand, text revision of the fourth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV-TR)",
