        "content": "y04s | A: If there is any, it is this: serious people are prepared to start at the beginning and go a step at a time, to 'start the journey of a thousand miles with one single step'; people who are not serious are looking for miracles and stimuli and 'advanced work'.\n3n8m | Q: What produces, and what sustains, this unsuitability?\ncaum | A: Vanity, which is why most systems require humility.\nnpun | Q: If most systems require this, why does it not work?\nrj3c | A: Because most systems end up by making imagined humility into a form of vanity, so they end up with vanity just the same.\n5rgk | You can perceive a person's aspiration if it is genuine, because this creates a change in the emanations from such a person.\nxf8w | USELESS PRAYER\n565e | Omar Khayyam said:\nw4zl | They went, and none returned again\nvav7 | To tell you the telling of that beyond\no1cs | You won't gain anything through automatic prayer\nadhe | Prayer is worthless without sincerity and true aspiration.\nbbzd | This second question, about unsuitability, interests me rather more than the first, about 'Quick, rule-of-thumb methods.' Has the enquirer ever asked himself what he could do with such a method?\nxhrf | Q: But surely prayer, properly carried out, can prepare for proper learning?\nzkpf | A: 'Properly learned' is the operative phrase. People who pray and who do not attend to the necessary change in themselves as its basis, are not the same as those who really do pray. People who pray have to be altered by prayer, and this alteration is partly manifested in their behaviour and temperament.\natab | Many Sufi teachers have insisted that disciples observe psychological and social development before even allowing them to pray, or, at least, before acknowledging that they are capable of effective prayer. Khwaja Muinuddin Gharib Nawaz Chishti actually equates prayer with right thought and right action on the ordinary human level:\nj9tq | 'Prayer consists,' he said, 'in hearing the complaints of the aggrieved and to assist them; to help the needy and the oppressed; to feed the people and to set free the captives from captivity. All these things, Gharib-Nawaz emphasised, are of great importance.'\nfvqy | When Criticism can Stop\nvfqb | Q: When do people stop criticising what others are doing?\nwe1w | A: When Jalaludin Rumi started to recite his couplets of wisdom, it is reported, people had not had enough time to form any opinion of him.\nk81g | Some were interested, some were not. Others, following an inevitable human pattern, resented him. They said: 'We hope that you do not think that you are a second Aesop or something.'\nk2jg | WESTERN SAGE\njhhg | According to one sage of the West, criticism has to go through these stages: -\ng8qm | One. It is impossible\nt3iv | Two. It is possible, but it is useless\n4psv | Three. It is useful, but I knew about it all the time.\njm2w | Criticism can then stop.\nyilw | THE SICK MAN WHO CURSED\ng67e | Enduring the criticism of others may be part of doing good to them. You can read in The Boston of Saadi the story of the sick man whom the great Sufi Maaruf of Karkh was helping. He cursed Maaruf, whose wife asked him why he continued to serve one who was so ungrateful.\nanld | Maaruf answered that this patience was part of the help for the sick: the patient, he had observed, could not find rest until after he had been allowed to vent his wrath.\n27s7 | I am not myself much interested in the stopping of criticism. How about interesting oneself in improving the quality of critic-\n8j2x | ism; so that it can be more useful? Much of it is so bad that even undesirable things criticised are not effectively criticised, especially when the critic shows his spleen or bias instead of being constructive.\nl5gt | Sheikh Abdullah Ansari, of Herat, the great Sufi teacher, has rightly said:\nrelm | The evil of another person can be averted:\nxr8d | There is no escape from one's own ...\nrd18 | Information and Experience\nkdwe | Q: Why do you stress the importance of information as well as of experience?\nefmr | A: There is a saying that, according to what a person's mentality is, even an angel may seem to him to have a devil's face.\ngoxa | It is also useful to note that whereas an angel may seem to have a devil's face, and a devil an angel's face, there are other forms of this complaint.\nkxhc | INFORMATION BEFORE OPINION\ntlbz | People tend to form opinions about people, things and ideas, only on the basis of the information and prejudice which they already have. If you show, say, a camera to a child or a primitive man, he might think that it was a monster.\nzfbe | What people need is information, more often than they realise. This is the reason why generations of Sufis have laboured to broaden the basis of information and experience available to man. With information and experience, man may make more reliable judgments about people, ideas and things. The less information he has, the less likely he is to be able to understand. To try to teach anyone who is in a condition of insufficient information is futile, never attempted by real teachers, and wasteful of time and energy to both parties.\n92nl | INSTITUTION WITHOUT INSIGHT\nol2n | 'Halls and colleges and learned discourses and porch and arch, says Hafiz, 'what advantage are they when the wise heart and seeing eye are absent?' And to make real sense of experience, information must be there as well.\n5ho2 | The Teaching is a Matter of Conduct\n1u6m | Q: Can people pursue a form of study in Sufism without being trained and constantly stimulated, as they are in all systems which I have examined?\noe9t | A: This famous saying from our tradition repays the closest possible attention: 'The Teaching is a matter of Conduct'.\n29gd | By acting in a certain manner, a person may be able to give the impression that he is enlightened, studious, worthwhile, valuable or many other impressive things. All teachings, in their lower ranges, seek to teach people to adopt acceptable conduct and behaviour.\ntkgd | CONDUCT, HERE, DOES NOT MEAN CONFORMISM\nzazs | Because of this emphasis upon conduct, misunderstandings arise very easily. People come to imagine that if they seem to be conforming, they are acceptable, or that they are progressing.\nyuw3 | The fact is, of course, that conformism is a part of the civilising of people. If they conform to the rules of the culture which surrounds them, larger numbers of people can associate together more easily. Strife is generally reduced. Communication between people becomes possible when, for instance, they are not all talking at once.\nyoa7 | It may be necessary to conform to certain kinds of expected behaviour in order to learn something. But when this conformism becomes the only, or major, characteristic of the people, the teaching has stopped taking effect. Instead of learning, we have practice: practice of conformism.\n4c4x | Conformism has two possible evils: one. that people will mistake it for 'higher' behaviour; two. that people will believe that all they have to do is to appear to conform, and that as a consequence they will get 'a place in Heaven'.\niil3 | We are all familiar with human systems in which either or both\nsizo | of these deteriorations are evident. They are so persistent, indeed, that conformism may be taken as the outward mark of organisation. But not only need this not be so: it may be positively dangerous to the potential function of the group.\n4z4z | Then why do we say 'The Teaching is a Matter of Conduct'?\ngdvl | KNOWLEDGE AND ACTION ARE RELATED\n0rbh | First, because when a form of conduct is laid down in the Teaching, whether it be doing a task or carrying out a study or exercise, the relationship between mental 'set' and bodily action is specific. It helps the exercise or undertaking to operate correctly.",
