You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

bfax | It is related to the entanglement of formation: for separable states <LATEX>C</LATEX> vanishes, and it increases monotonically toward the limit <LATEX>C = 1</LATEX> for two maximally entangled spin-1/2's [58]. Using the concurrence, we obtain the space-resolved entan- glement distribution between spin pairs in the different phases and present its qualitative distribution by green links in Fig. 5. For a more quantitative analysis, we differentiate between
f2y8 | <LATEX>B = - \quad 3 D / 4 .</LATEX> concurrences of different ranges up to third-nearest neighbor in Table I.
o7qm | For HS states, we find the largest concurrences up to <LATEX>C _ { \mathrm { H S } } =</LATEX> 0.16. Therefore, we use <LATEX>C _ { \mathrm { H S } }</LATEX> as a measure of reference to quantify the entanglement of the remaining ordered states. For the <LATEX>F P</LATEX> states (large magnetic field), we find almost vanishing entanglement in the bulk, indicating that the bulk spins are separable. Small nonzero values of <LATEX>C \approx 0 . 3 5 C _ { \mathrm { H S } }</LATEX> occur at the boundary due to the finite system size and strong DMI. Fi- nally, for the quantum SK states (intermediate magnetic field), we find that the spins inside the skyrmion quasiparticle are only weakly entangled, but we find concurrences <LATEX>C \approx 0 . 8 C _ { \mathrm { H S } }</LATEX> at the outer rim spins of the skyrmion, signaling significant en- tanglement of the quantum skyrmion with the field-polarized environment. Interestingly, both the helical state and quantum skyrmion show long-range concurrences between distant spin pairs beyond next-to-nearest neighbors.
d52l | V. STRUCTURE FACTOR AND NEUTRON SCATTERING CROSS SECTION
qlbb | We compute the Fourier components of the spin-spin cor- relation function as follows,
nhsg | <LATEX>\mathcal{S} _ { \alpha \beta } \left( q \right) = \sum _ { r r ^ { \prime } } e ^ { i q \cdot \left( r ^ { \prime } - r \right) } \langle \widehat { S } _ { \alpha , r } \widehat { S } _ { \beta , r ^ { \prime } } \rangle ,</LATEX> (5)
hy0l | where <LATEX>\alpha ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\beta \in \left\{ x , y , z \right\} ,</LATEX> <LATEX>q = \left( q _ { x } , q _ { y } , q _ { z } \right)</LATEX> a wave vector which is later associated with the scattering vector, and the expectation values of the product of spin operators are evaluated with the ground state obtained by the MPS simulations of small hexagon flakes [Figs. 2(d)-2(f)]. From <LATEX>\mathcal{S} _ { \alpha \beta } ,</LATEX> the elastic mag- netic neutron scattering cross section <LATEX>d \sigma / d \Omega</LATEX> at momentum
4jmz | transfer vector <LATEX>q</LATEX> is given by [59]:
b7cq | <LATEX>\frac { d \sigma } { d \Omega } \left( q \right) \propto \sum _ { \alpha \beta } \left( \delta _ { \alpha \beta } - \widehat { q } _ { \alpha } \widehat { q } _ { \beta } \right) \mathcal{S} _ { \alpha \beta } \left( q \right) ,</LATEX> (6)
0b39 | where <LATEX>\widehat { q } = q / q = \left( \widehat { q } _ { x } , \widehat { q } _ { y } , \widehat { q } _ { z } \right) .</LATEX> Concerning experiments, we emphasize that <LATEX>d \sigma / d \Omega</LATEX> corresponds to a scattering geome- try where the externally applied magnetic field <LATEX>B = B \widehat { e } _ { z }</LATEX> is parallel to the wave vector of the incoming neutron beam, and
qecd | where the detector plane is spanned by the two components <LATEX>q _ { x }</LATEX> and <LATEX>q _ { 1 }</LATEX> of the scattering vector. In the limit of the small-angle approximation, one can assume
1o7p | <LATEX>q _ { z } = 0 .</LATEX> In Fig. 7 we display <LATEX>d \sigma / d \Omega</LATEX> for the helical, skyrmion, and field-polarized states (see Fig. 6 for all components <LATEX>\mathcal{S} _ { \alpha \beta }</LATEX> of the structure factor). The geometry and local polarization of those states is displayed in Figs. 2(d)-2(f). Generally speaking, long-range magnetic ordering is signaled by the presence of Bragg peaks in <LATEX>d \sigma / d \Omega</LATEX> at momentum transfers <LATEX>q</LATEX> correspond- ing to the wave vectors of the ordering. We expect additional diffuse magnetic scattering components in <LATEX>d \sigma / d \Omega</LATEX> rooted in spatial variations of the spin orientation.
