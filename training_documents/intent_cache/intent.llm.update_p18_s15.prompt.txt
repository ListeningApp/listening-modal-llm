You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

hd7d | Sustaining the therapeutic relationship is an ongoing task that does not focus solely on interpersonal events. The therapeutic relationship process that occurs outside of the interpersonal events is the macro dimension of the inter- personal process of therapy.
ehux | Responding to the immediate events that occur during therapy is the micro dimension. Responding to these in- terpersonal events of therapy requires that the therapist detects the occurrence of an event, reads the client's re- action to the event, and decides on an appropriate way to address the event with the client.
poxj | Both the micro and macro scales of therapeutic inter- action play a critical role in the overall process of occu- pational therapy. Moreover, they are interrelated. That is, the nature of the therapeutic relationship has an influence on how the client interprets and how the therapist re- sponds to interpersonal events; and, in turn, interpersonal events and their resolution either enhance or detract from the therapeutic relationship.
2xvb | In some cases, the two scales of interaction are difficult to differentiate. For example, some therapy relationships last only one or two sessions. In these cases, a therapist must work to respond to a client and to interpersonal events with much more vigilance and self-control be- cause a more stable underlying therapeutic relationship does not yet exist. Moreover, the interpersonal events and their resolution during the therapy sessions are the major
m1hx | In most cases, however, therapy continues during a period of weeks or months, allowing the development of some kind of predictable pattern or usual way of interact- ing within the therapeutic relationship. That therapeutic relationship is infused and shaped by interpersonal events that occur in the moment-by-moment therapy process. It is also influenced by the characteristics and behaviors the client and therapist bring to the relationship as well as by the circumstances surrounding the relationship. These circumstances include such factors as the nature and unfolding of the client's impairment and the context (e.g., school, rehabilitation setting, home, work) in which the therapy takes place.
9psh | It is the therapist's responsibility to manage and con- tinually strive to fortify the therapeutic relationship and to seek optimal resolutions to interpersonal events in therapy. The stability and success of a therapeutic rela- tionship cannot be assumed. Rather, it begins early in treatment with attempts by the therapist to build rapport, followed by other efforts to develop a relationship that meets the client's immediate interpersonal needs and is appropriate in terms of the circumstances of therapy and the demands of the treatment setting. Recognizing and sustaining a successful therapeutic relationship might in- clude such things as:
aiqv | Sharing certain interpersonal rituals that facilitate bonding (e.g., paying a visit to a garden or other favor- ite locale within the client's setting each time before the ending of therapy)
4klz | Witnessing the client enjoying or benefiting from therapy
xz5d | Sharing mutual feelings of respect, admiration, or appreciation
erwx | Feeling interested and engaged in the therapy process
ie7i | · Being open and comfortable digressing during therapy for discussion, venting, or advice-seeking about events in his or her personal life (without interfering with progress toward goals)
aksw | Being able to discuss and overcome the interpersonal events that might otherwise challenge the relationship
0fsl | · Having a long-standing private joke with a client
0m3g | Sharing a certain intensity of eye contact that commu- nicates mutual trust
9sp0 | Noticing a certain way a client laughs that conveys her
nbpk | Chapter 3 A Model of the Intentional Relationship 69
xs3r | These are only a few examples among myriad factors that might contribute to a successful therapeutic relationship. It is the responsibility of the therapist to be vigilant to explore, identify, and sustain the factors that contribute to a relationship that supports positive therapy outcomes.
ffuj | This is not to say that the client does not make posi- tive contributions to the therapeutic relationship. In most instances, clients bring important or essential character- istics and behaviors into the relationship. However, the fundamental difference is that it is the therapist who must assume the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the relationship is positive. By assuming this responsibility, the therapist creates a space in the relationship wherein a client can be vulnerable, distressed, frustrated, or angry without fearing that the relationship will be ruptured. Moreover, this does not mean that the therapist assumes an expert or authoritative stance in the relationship. Rather, it means that the therapist must assume responsi- bility for the caring within the relationship.
h7f6 | The enduring aspects of the therapeutic relationship are systematically built and fortified because of naturally occurring variables in the relationship (similar interper- sonal styles or interpersonal chemistry or other optimal circumstances and timing) and because of the therapist's consistent efforts to build the relationship in the face of the inevitable interpersonal events and challenges that occur. If the therapist's efforts to build a relationship are successful and the client is not particularly sensitive, untrusting, or otherwise vulnerable, the therapeutic re- lationship becomes stronger through time and is more likely to withstand interpersonal events that would other- wise challenge or strain the relationship.
t74k | For any number of reasons, however, the therapeutic relationship may not develop adequately to endure threats caused by the interpersonal events that routinely emerge during therapy. Signs that there is difficulty in the ther- apeutic relationship may include, but are not limited to:
qdn7 | · Change in affect, attitude, or interpersonal behavior
dib4 | Becoming disengaged from therapy
yvqj | Appearing or feeling impatient, irritable, or angry
vz2f | Experiencing therapy as "boring"
wyu0 | Questioning the utility of the therapy
s8xw | · Feeling questioning or criticism is excessive
afv1 | Dreading or becoming apprehensive about the next
fwf1 | Having a desire to refer or terminate prematurely
3wck | Developing conflict with the client
jq2u | ·Noticing client's attendance pattern changes or declines
9zf9 | There are several potential reasons that difficulty may emerge within the therapeutic relationship. For example, a client may bring a particular interpersonal history into the treatment relationship that makes it difficult for the therapist to establish rapport in ways that usually work. Conversely, the client may be mistrustful of the thera- pist because of the circumstances under which he is being seen. For example, a client may have been mandated by an insurance company to receive an evaluation for work potential, and the client perceives that the therapist has tremendous power to influence his life (i.e., whether he continues to receive disability support). Alternatively, a therapist may have a negative reaction to a client because the client reminds the therapist of someone with whom the therapist has had a difficult relationship in the past. General sources of difficulty within the relationship may include, but are not limited to:
clwo | Client brings a difficult interpersonal history into the relationship or has an Axis II diagnosis.
aki1 | Circumstances under which client is being seen are threatening or pressured (i.e., an evaluation is being conducted for the purpose of verifying disability to an insurance company).
vf5h | There is a poor match between client's and therapist's interpersonal styles.
l51p | There is an inability to overcome challenges caused by differences in culture, values, or worldview.
s9zz | Client or therapist reminds the other of someone with whom he or she had a negative experience.
x97k | Client or therapist disappoints or fails to meet expectations.
qwix | Client or therapist inadvertently says or does some- thing that is perceived as injurious, and the situation is not processed and resolved.
6lnq | These and other obstacles to a more stable enduring re- lationship with a client are only intensified by inevitable interpersonal events. Examples of events that are likely to further stress an already-vulnerable therapy relationship include such things as a therapist's unanticipated absence for a period of time, a common misunderstanding that
nxb1 | occurs between client and therapist, a comment or ques- tion that is perceived by the client as insensitive or in- appropriate, or an unexpected personal crisis that causes the client to regress or temporarily relinquish treatment goals. Although they are normal and inevitable examples of difficult aspects of therapy, the way in which the ther- apist responds to them is a powerful mediator of the final outcome.
kwpw | Irrespective of the extent to which the therapeutic relationship process is stable and strong, the process of therapeutic responding to interpersonal events is essential to good therapy. If a therapist does not respond adequately to interpersonal events or challenges to the relationship, the process of occupational engagement may suffer, and the therapeutic relationship process quickly erodes.
