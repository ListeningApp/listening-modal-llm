Clinicians report challenges and barriers when encountering infection in SLE as certain infections may mimic a lupus flare. There are no evidence-based practice guidelines in the management of fever in SLE, with suboptimal implementations of evidence-based benefits related to infectious disease control or prevention strategies in SLE. Vigilance in identifying an opportunistic infection must be stressed when confronted by a diagnostic challenge during a presentation with a febrile illness in SLE. A balanced approach must focus on management of infections in SLE, and reduction in the glucocorticoids dose, given the need to control lupus disease activity to avoid lupus related organ damage and mortality. Clinical judgement and application of biomarkers of lupus flares could reduce false positives and overdiagnosis and improve differentiation of infections from lupus flares. Further precision-based risk and screening measures must identify individuals who would benefit most from low dose immunosuppressive therapy, targeted immune therapy, and vaccination programs.\nf2y8 | Plain Language Summary\no7qm | Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus are at considerable risk of serious infections. Clinical providers report an ongoing challenge during an encounter with a febrile illness in SLE patients, by way of the varied types of infections mimicking lupus disease flare. Misdiagnosis of an infection for lupus flare will lead to complications and death if not treated. Lupus patients must seek medical attention when a febrile illness occurs. Providers should initiate prompt antibiotic treatment and reduce the dose of steroids during a febrile illness in SLE. In addition, providers should apply infectious disease controls and vaccine preventive measures during low disease activity state to prevent life-threatening conditions and death.\nd52l | Introduction\nqlbb | Infectious diseases and their causative agents pose considerable challenges for the management of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Despite awareness of factors contributing to increased susceptibility to infections in SLE, and having the knowledge of vaccinations and pre-exposure prophylaxis, infections remain one of the leading causes of death in SLE across all times.\nnhsg | The poor clinical outcome of infection in SLE reflects the complex interplay of infectious pathogens and the highly dysregulated nature of the immune system in SLE. Infections are at times coupled with lupus disease activity states where glucocorticoids and cytotoxic immune suppressive therapy may trigger infections. The major burden is that there are no evidence-based practice guidelines in the management of fever, or evidence-based benefits related to implementation of infectious disease controls or prevention strategies in SLE. In addition, the lack of specific\nhy0l | biomarkers of lupus flare or lupus related infections and the near absence of clear principles on the use of preventive measures with their insufficient evidence are barriers implied in the poor outcome.\n4jmz | To reduce the risk of infections in SLE and their complications, providers should apply strategies of glucocorticoids dose reduction and judicious use of immunosuppressive and targeted biological therapies with treatment to target approaches. Novel therapeutics in SLE, though safer and efficacious in controlling disease activity and in achieving disease remission, must also prevent infections, damage accrual and death.\nb7cq | Importantly, providers should apply diverse therapeutic strategies including general hygienic methods, vaccinations, recognition of latent and opportunistic infections and antibiotic prophylaxis. However, implementation of these measures and their use in clinical practice is inconsistent and rarely applied.\n0b39 | In this manuscript we analyzed the burden, the types of infection, the factors related to higher risk of infection, and highlight certain tools used in predicting infection in SLE. We propose a framework to overcome challenges in the management of infections in SLE patients and explore opportunities that can benefit the therapeutic and preventive plan of care.\nqecd | Methods and Materials\n1o7p | We performed a semi-structured systematic review of the literature of adults with infections in SLE between January nineteen eighty-five and June twenty twenty-two, using search words such as, \"systemic lupus erythematosus\", \"infection\", \"viral syndrome\", \"bacterial infections\", \"fungal\", \"opportunistic infections\", \"parasites\", and \"prevention\" were reported. Sources of literature from which full-length clinical studies in humans were extracted were published in Medline, PubMed Clinical Queries and Embase, Cochrane library, and the database from CINHAL.\ncp13 | The Burden of Infections in SLE\nbgre | Mortality and hospitalization rates related to infections in SLE have increased dramatically over the past decade compared to the general population. Researchers suggest a change in the trend and the pattern in SLE mortality where infection is the biggest reason for mortality compared to lupus related disease activity, lupus nephritis or cardiovascular diseases. Similar observations have appeared in not just the United States, but in Japan, South Korea, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Jamaica, Columbia, Mexico, Chile, Brazil, United Kingdom, Spain, Denmark, France, and Sweden. The impact of infection in SLE is even more pronounced in developing countries.\n57lp | Infections account for twenty percent to fifty-five percent of all deaths in SLE patients and are the leading cause of deaths within the first year after the diagnosis of SLE. Bacterial infections contribute to a higher relative risk of hospitalization which could be serious requiring high level care. Pulmonary infections and septicemia had the largest positive effect on increased mortality in SLE.\nukth | Types of Infections in SLE Bacterial Infections\nkpvt | Around sixty percent to seventy-five percent of all reported infections in SLE are common bacterial infections The systems of respiratory, urinary tract, skin and soft tissue are the most common sites of infection in SLE. Respiratory tract infections are common in hospitalized patients, whereas urinary system, skin and soft tissue infections are more frequent in the outpatient setting.\njie2 | Escherichia coli causing urine tract infections and streptococcal pneumonia causing bronchopneumonia, bacteremia, and sepsis represent the most frequent pathogens. Streptococcal infections are severe in SLE related to reduction in opsonization with complement factor three b inactive C three b compared to other rheumatic syndromes and the healthy population.\nd0ik | Staphylococcus aureus causes skin and soft tissue infections, bone and joint infections, as well as bacteremia. Klebsiella and pseudomonas species may cause urine tract infections related bacteremia in SLE that are associated with shortened survival rate.\n0x0s | Salmonella enterica infections are more frequent among SLE subjects as compared to the general population causing a spectrum of syndromes including gall bladder infection and bacteremia. Atypical presentations of Salmonella species infections in SLE patients include osteomyelitis of long bones, septic arthritis, soft tissue abscess, meningitis, typhoid\n4exe | fever, and sepsis syndrome. Risk factors for salmonella infection in SLE are associated with splenic dysfunction and opsonization defects as well as high disease activity and use of immune suppressive therapy.\n0myz | Mycobacterial Infections\n```",
