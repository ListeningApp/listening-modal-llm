        "content": "mpml | Four point four. Langevin dynamics - one-dimensional case. We present here the numerical results associated with the one-dimensional Langevin dynamics, where the potential energy function is the same as the one used for the one-dimensional overdamped Langevin dynamics case, namely, and the same observable as in Section Four point two. The normalization constants A and B for rho sub one and rho sub two are chosen to be\nimnm | with Z the same normalization constant as in Section Four point two.

The simulations were performed with Beta equals gamma equals M equals one. Note that when computing the response associated with the divergence-free vector field for large values of eta, as presented in Figure five e, the momentum space is truncated to\n4eaf | P sub max equals ten. The results presented in Figure five correspond to the response curves for each of the synthetic forcings discussed in Section three point two point three. Figures five a and five b correspond to the position and momentum components of the modified fluctuation-dissipation forcing presented in Example three point five, respectively, namely\n4b6k | modified curly L sub extra equals negative partial sub q star partial sub q, comma modified curly L sub extra equals negative partial sub p star partial sub p.

Lastly, Figure five e corresponds to the divergence-free forcing.\n1ylw | For both modified fluctuation-dissipation forcings, Figures five a and five b, we see that alpha star does not preserve linearity for a large eta regime, suggesting instead that alpha sub star of epsilon is the better choice for practical applications; the same conclusion was drawn for the modified fluctuation-dissipation forcing for overdamped Langevin in Section four point two. Among the two forcings, it seems better to modify the fluctuation-dissipation in P as the response remains longer in the linear response regime for the optimal value\nwaqw | alpha sub star of epsilon. Both Feynman-Kac forcings showcase great potential in extending the linear regime. Once again, Figures five d and five f suggest that opting for the extra forcing in the P variable is the superior choice.\nnf6a | Lastly, the divergence-free forcing greatly increases the linear regime, as seen in Figures five e and five f. This behavior, as well as the ease to implement it in Monte Carlo simulations, make it is the most appealing choice of forcing, allowing to substantially reduce the variance of the estimator, as discussed in Section four point five. Although the Feynman-Kac extra forcing also demonstrates great potential in extending the linear regime, the challenges associated with its implementation render it an impractical choice.\n5g96 | Four point five. Scaling of the variance. We discuss in this section the scaling of the variance sigma sub R comma eta squared divided by eta squared, with the addition of synthetic forces, and in particular numerically illustrate the potential of synthetic forcings as a tool for variance reduction. See Appendix B for details on the numerical computation of. We emphasize that the bias on the estimator, made precise, is negligible when compared to the variance, hence we concentrate on the variance. We anyway want to remain in the linear response regime so, by construction, the bias should be small.\nd1y5 | Recall from Section two point three, and in particular in Proposition two point four, that the estimator phi hat sub eta comma t defined in has asymptotic variance of order sigma sub R comma eta squared divided by eta squared. Indeed, suggests that this asymptotic variance is of the same order as the one associated with the equilibrium estimator, i.e. sigma sub R comma zero squared divided by eta squared, up to a small bias of order\nrl20 | eta.",
