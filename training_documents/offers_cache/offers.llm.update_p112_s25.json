        "content": "m61m | Whenever trying to close a deal, never discount the main offer. It teaches your customers that your prices are negotiable, which is terrible. Adding bonuses to increase value to close the deal is far superior to cutting prices. It puts you in a position of strength and goodwill rather than weakness.\npnz9 | Presenting Bonuses One-on-One versus Group Selling\n1abn | There are key differences between pitching to a group versus a single person. Group selling is beyond the scope of this book. But I want to at least address when a bonus would be brought up in a one-on-one selling scenario. When selling one on one, you ask for the sale first, before offering the bonuses. If they say yes, then after they have signed up, you let them know the additional bonuses they're going to get. This creates a wow experience and reinforces their decision to buy.\n8un4 | On the other hand, if the person does not buy after the first ask, then you present a bonus that matches their perceived obstacle, then ask again. Don't feel weird about asking again. You simply agree with the prospect, add the bonus, and ask if this consolation was \"fair enough.\" People have a hard time rejecting reciprocity, so adding a bonus to accommodate, then another, then another, and people will feel almost obligated to buy from you.\ns0ti | If you recall from our \"Trim and Stack\" chapter, each of those deliverables is now being weaponized and presented at the perfect time. We're going to provide all these bonuses to them anyways, but it increases the perception of our offer's value by layering these bonuses one at a time.\nyhew | Bonus Bullets\naqjo | That being said, there are a few key things to remember when offering bonuses:\nopdt | One. Always offer them (you can use the bulleted bundle we came up with at the end of Section Three).\nj6d4 | Two. Give them a special name that has a benefit in the title.\nwmtt | Three. Tell them:\nu5uc | a) How it relates to their issue.\n0d2r | b) What it is.\ngly4 | c) How you discovered it, or what you had to do to create it.\nw1gv | d) How it will specifically improve their lives or make their experience.\nf69a | i) Faster, easier or less effort/sacrifice (value equation).\nycgz | Four. Provide some proof (this can be a stat, a past client, or personal experience) to prove that this thing is valuable.\njb3e | Five. Paint a vivid mental image of what their life will be like assuming they have already used it and are experiencing the benefits.\ne580 | Six. Always ascribe a price tag to them and justify it.\nkwv3 | Seven. Tools and checklists are better than additional trainings (as the effort and time are lower with the former, so the value is higher. The value equation still reigns supreme).\nwxdu | Eight. They should each address a specific concern or obstacle in the prospect's mind about why they can't or won't be successful (bonus should prove their belief incorrect).\nzdfh | Nine. This can also be what they would logically realize they will need next. You want to solve their next problem before they even encounter it.\ni1dq | Ten. The value of the bonuses should eclipse the value of the core offer. Psychologically as you continue to add offers, it continues to expand the price to value discrepancy. It also subconsciously communicates that the core offer must be valuable because if these are the bonuses, the main thing has to be more valuable than the bonuses right? No, but you can use this psychological bias to make your offer seem wildly compelling.\nhwux | Eleven. You can further enhance the value of your bonuses by adding scarcity and urgency to the bonus themselves (which takes this technique and puts it on steroids).\n9opd | a) Bonuses With Scarcity\nsco5 | Version One: Only people who sign up for XYZ program will have access to my Bonus Number One, Two, Three that are never for sale or available anywhere else other than through this program.\n8wy0 | Version Two: I have three tickets left to my five thousand dollar virtual event, if you buy this program you can get one of the last three tickets as a bonus.\na505 | b) Bonuses With Urgency\ntv1d | Version One: If you buy today, I will add in XYZ bonus that normally costs one thousand dollars, for free. And I'll do that because I want to reward action takers.\nyuul | c) With hope, you can see the subtle differences. The first two examples aren't constrained by time. They state that if you buy the program you will get things you normally would not be able to. The bonus with urgency is about them buying today, and if they do not buy today, they lose those bonuses. Minor difference, but worth noting.\nn7uk | Advanced Level Bonuses - Other People's Products and Services\naeaj | You can get other businesses to give you their services and products as a part of your bonuses in exchange for exposure to your clients for free. This is free marketing for them and high value products for you at no cost. Businesses will do this because you are going to give their business exposure for free to the highest quality prospects, your customers. As long as they are not direct competitors, you can get some brownie points, secure some future referral IOUs, and make your offer more valuable at the same time. If you secure enough of these relationships, you can literally justify your entire price in the savings and additional true-to-price bonuses.\ntlut | For example - if I owned a pain clinic, I might get a massage therapist to give me one to two free massages to incorporate into my offer. On top of that, I might get:\nizqq | ... a chiropractor to give me two free adjustments. (Value: One hundred dollars)\nr93i | ... a low inflammation food company to give me discounts for their products (fifty dollars savings).\nmilo | ... discounts for braces and orthotics (one hundred fifty dollars savings).\nhs4w | ... a local health club down the street to give me a personal training session for free and a free month of membership to their pool (one hundred dollars value).\nvoba | ... discounts on pharmaceutical drugs from the local pharmacist (one hundred dollars per month in savings).\ntyxu | ... repeat the above for multiple service providers (so perhaps I get ten chiropractors to all give me a free adjustment, now I have ten free adjustments in my bundle).\nq342 | ... Etc.\nau1k | Now if my offer was four hundred dollars, then the value of these free bonuses alone is worth more than the four hundred dollars.\njt2s | As if that weren't already awesome enough, if you really want to be a jedi, negotiate a group discount and a commission to yourself. This is exactly what we did with our supplement company. Our gym owner clients who use our sister supplement company Prestige Labs sponsored athletes get a thirty percent discount on our products, on top of that, the sponsored athlete gets paid forty percent of all sales netted after the applied discount.\np530 | So it's a win-win for everyone. Their clients get it for thirty percent less than our main site. They get paid for giving away exclusive discounts. And we get customers in exchange for the commission paid. Everyone wins.\nzxwg | If you are following along, each of these bonuses can become revenue streams for you indirectly by getting clients to say yes more easily, and directly because you can negotiate that each of these businesses can pay you for the people you send their way.",
