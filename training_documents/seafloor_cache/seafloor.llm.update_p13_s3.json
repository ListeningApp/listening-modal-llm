        "content": "c8ra | are recognized: one chalcopyrite-rich, two zoned with variable proportions of chalcopyrite and sphalerite, three sphalerite-rich chimneys, and four barite-rich and/or silica-altered. Unlike the subseafloor breccia facies, the seafloor chimneys contain only minor anhydrite and gypsum. Different chimney types commonly occur together; however, higher-temperature copper-rich chimneys are more abundant near sites A and D, and lower-temperature barite-rich chimneys are common at site B. Mineralized volcanic breccia was recovered from the base of several chimney complexes, where the chimneys have overgrown volcaniclastic material.\np1l0 | The copper-rich chimneys comprise abundant, massive, coarse-grained chalcopyrite with minor pyrite. Locally, minor iron-poor sphalerite and barite line the chimney conduits. In one sample, trace amounts of microscopic gold are present as inclusions in the chalcopyrite. Distinctly zoned chimneys have layers that are chalcopyrite, pyrite with or without marcasite, and sphalerite rich. Both iron-rich and iron-poor sphalerite occur in different layers. The low-iron sphalerite commonly has inclusions of fine-grained lead-arsenic-antimony sulfosalts (jordanite) and minor galena. Late-stage, coarse tabular barite, amorphous silica, and iron oxyhydroxides occupy open spaces.\n1i8b | The zinc-rich chimneys are most abundant and consist of dendritic sphalerite and barite with pyrite and marcasite. These chimneys lack clearly defined vent conduits but have alternating layers of low- and high-iron sphalerite, similar to beehive chimneys that form by diffuse fluid venting. The low-iron sphalerite commonly contains inclusions of jordanite and galena; fine-grained inclusions of chalcopyrite are present at grain boundaries but are rare. Late-stage tabular barite is followed paragenetically by minor amounts of amorphous silica and trace iron and manganese oxyhydroxides. The barite-rich chimneys also form bulbous and beehive-like structures with variable amounts of amorphous silica filling or lining open spaces.\n5sfj | Chalcopyrite and pyrite show little compositional variation, although arsenic is relatively enriched in both pyrite (up to one point four two weight percent) and marcasite (up to two point seven one weight percent). Mercury is also present above detection limits in pyrite, together with lead and antimony. Iron sulfide contents of sphalerite range from zero point zero two to thirteen point nine eight mol percent, with more than fifty percent of the analyses reporting less than two mol percent iron sulfide. The most iron-rich sphalerite is in chalcopyrite-rich assemblages, and the widest range of iron sulfide values occur in the dendritic barite-rich chimneys. Cadmium (up to two point zero four weight percent), indium (up to one point three one weight percent), gallium (up to one point zero three weight percent), and mercury (up to one point two eight weight percent) are likely present in solid solution in the sphalerite. Cadmium concentrations in sphalerite decrease from an average of zero point three three weight percent in the chalcopyrite-rich chimneys to zero point zero three weight percent in the dendritic barite-rich chimneys, suggesting a strong temperature dependence, which is also reflected in the iron content. Galena contains up to one point two three weight percent silver, mainly in the barite-rich chimneys. The lead-arsenic-antimony sulfosalts have up to eleven point nine one weight percent arsenic and zero point two eight weight percent antimony, which is close to those of the arsenic end member of the jordanite-geocronite series.\nvk4h | Bulk compositions of the seafloor chimneys and mineralized volcanic breccias are listed in Table one.
