You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

xwza | Now suppose both T1 and T2 are positive. Then we get a remarkable consequence: as two systems exchange energy, with each staying in thermal equilibrium at every moment, expected energy can only flow from the system with higher temperature to the system with lower temperature!
kw2g | Puzzle 55. Suppose one or both of the temperatures T1, T2 are negative. How does this conclusion change?
evst | THE THIRD LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS: REVISITED
r4ei | If a system has countably many states, with just one of lowest energy, and thermal equilibrium is possible for this system for some temperature T > 0, then its entropy in thermal equilibrium approaches zero exponentially fast as a function of 1/T as T approaches zero from above.
v3un | In our earlier work on the Third Law, we only studied systems with finitely many states. Later we saw how to compute entropy from the free energy and expected energy. This makes it a bit easier to handle systems with a countable infinity of states. In the following puzzles, which are only for the most devoted readers, let's use these ideas to prove and improve the Third Law for systems with countably many states.
mmh7 | Earlier we worked with temperature, but it's cooler to use coolness. For all the following puzzles, let's suppose we have a system with a countable infinity of states n =1,2, 3, ... with energies En. Also suppose thermal equilibrium is possible for some Bo > 0, i.e., the sum
15mo | Z (Bo) = Lexp(-BoEn) n=1 00
haqw | converges. (Our arguments also apply to systems with finitely many states, where this convergence condition is automatic.)
89i1 | Puzzle 56. Show that the system's partition function, expected energy, free energy and entropy are well-defined for all B > Bo-
gfu5 | Puzzle 57. Show that if we add some constant to the energy of each state
mvzl | Èn = En + c
buwu | we get a new 'shifted' system whose partition function, expected energy, free energy and entropy are related to those of our original system by
zsfu | Ž = exp(-ßc)Z, (Ē) = (E) + c, F = F + c, Š = S
hyvo | for all B > Bo.
5l9v | Now further suppose that our original system has just one state of least energy. Earlier we saw that we could reindex the states so that E1 < E2 ≤ E3 ≤ . . . and En -> +00. The same is true of our new shifted system, and let's choose c = - E1 so that the lowest energy of the shifted system is zero. With this shift we have
6tv1 | 0 = Ễ1 < Ě2 < 3 <...
l79g | and En -> +00.
d8ia | Puzzle 58. Show that for any coolness <LATEX>\beta \geq \beta _ { 0 }</LATEX> we have
v012 | <LATEX>\widetilde { Z } \left( \beta \right) - 1 = \sum _ { n = 2 } ^ { \infty } e ^ { - \beta \widetilde { E } _ { n } } .</LATEX> Using this equation show
crl5 | <LATEX>| \widetilde { Z } \left( \beta \right) - 1 | \leq e ^ { - \left( \beta - \beta _ { 0 } \right) \widetilde { E } _ { 2 } } | \widetilde { Z } \left( \beta _ { 0 } \right) - 1 |</LATEX> and thus
xqom | <LATEX>| \widetilde { Z } \left( \beta \right) - 1 | < \mathrm { c o n s t } e ^ { - \left( \beta - \beta _ { 0 } \right) \widetilde { E } _ { 2 } }</LATEX> for some constant independent of <LATEX>\beta .</LATEX> Use the fact that <LATEX>\widetilde { F } \left( \beta \right) = - \frac { 1 } { \beta } \ln \widetilde { Z } \left( \beta \right)</LATEX> to show that for large enough
mwss | <LATEX>\beta ,</LATEX> <LATEX>| \widetilde { F } \left( \beta \right) | < \mathrm { c o n s t } e ^ { - \left( \beta - \beta _ { 0 } \right) \widetilde { E } _ { 2 } }</LATEX> possibly for a different constant independent of <LATEX>\beta .</LATEX> Using Puzzle 57, conclude that
qba8 | <LATEX>| F \left( \beta \right) - E _ { 1 } | < \mathrm { c o n s t } e ^ { - \left( \beta - \beta _ { 0 } \right) \left( E _ { 2 } - E _ { 1 } \right) } .</LATEX> Voilà! This shows that for a system with countably many states and just one state of lowest energy, if thermal equilibrium is possible at some positive temperature, then the free energy must approach this lowest energy exponentially fast as <LATEX>\beta \rightarrow + \infty .</LATEX> Now let's show something similar for the expected energy. Again we use the shifted system to simplify the calculations. I'll leave more work to you this time.

Using Puzzle fifty-seven, conclude that LaTeX formula: the expected value of E with respect to beta approaches E sub one exponentially fast as LaTeX formula: beta approaches positive infinity. Finally, since
