Griffin and Sayette found that nearly one quarter of heavy smokers smiled and frowned simultaneously for at least three hundred milliseconds while they watched a burning cigarette. Moreover, those who smiled and frowned simultaneously were more likely to be ambivalent about smoking, which was indexed in terms of whether they had had difficulty quitting in the past. These findings provide convergent validity for self-report evidence for mixed emotions.\n8hul | Alternative Interpretations\n87vz | Despite considerable research, whether the experience of valence is irreducible or whether positivity and negativity are separable in experience remains unclear because all available evidence that people can feel happy and sad at the same time is open to alternative interpretations. For instance, Griffin and Sayette did not measure self-reported emotional experience, so it is unclear whether smokers' smiles and frowns reflected mixed emotions of happiness and sadness, as opposed to other positive and negative emotions. Here we outline several alternative interpretations for studies in which self-reports were collected and explain them in more detail as we present studies designed to address them.\nym66 | One pair of alternative interpretations involves limitations in how researchers have measured happiness and sadness. First, although subjects were asked to report how they felt at one particular moment, they may have instead reported summaries of their emotional experience over time. If so, they may have reported mixed emotions when they had in fact merely vacillated between happiness and sadness. We addressed this possibility in one set of studies (Studies One-Three) by placing some people in bittersweet situations and collecting continuous, as opposed to static, measures of emotions. Second, subjects in previous studies completed closed-ended measures of emotion, which raises the possibility that those subjects who reported mixed emotions only because they were explicitly asked whether they felt happy and whether they felt sad. We addressed this possibility in a second set of studies (Studies Four-Six) by placing some people in bittersweet situations and asking open-ended questions, as opposed to closed-ended questions.\nl0a3 | Another pair of alternative interpretations for evidence for mixed emotions involves subjects' expectancies. First, demand characteristics may have led subjects to report mixed emotions because they thought that we expected them to do so. To address this possibility, we led some subjects to believe that we did not expect them to report mixed emotions and collected continuous measures of emotion (Study Two) or open-ended measures of emotion\nu8nw | (Study Five). Second, subjects may have reported mixed emotions only because they held the lay theory that people can feel happy and sad at the same time. To address this possibility, we collected continuous measures (Study Three) or open-ended measures (Study Six) from individuals who did not believe that people can feel happy and sad at the same time.\nl2v9 | Subjects in all studies were told that they were participating in a study of foreign language comprehension and then watched one of two clips from the English-subtitled version of Life Is Beautiful. The bittersweet clip was nineteen minutes forty-three seconds long. During the clip, a character named Guido uses humor to keep his son, Joshua, alive and unaware of their plight while his wife, Dora, is imprisoned elsewhere in the camp. In the final five minutes of the clip, Guido loses his own life to ensure Joshua's survival and Joshua is reunited with Dora. The control clip was nineteen minutes forty seconds long. It begins with Guido and Dora's lighthearted courtship and joyful scenes from Joshua's childhood. It then transitions abruptly to the family's imprisonment, where it paints an unambiguously dreadful picture of their plight and ends with Dora fearing that Joshua is dead.\nafbe | Part One: Vacillation\n78r8 | Emotions can be fleeting. This raises the alternative interpretation for earlier evidence for mixed emotions that subjects merely vacillated between happiness and sadness and, when prompted, reported summaries of their emotions. Determining whether people can feel happy and sad at the same time and, by extension, whether valence is irreducible requires tests of this vacillation hypothesis.\n320g | Schimmack noted that if people in bittersweet situations merely vacillate between happiness and sadness, they should report less mixed emotions when they rate their happiness and sadness closer together in time. His subjects viewed a series of pleasant and unpleasant pictures and then rated the extent to which they were feeling pleasure, displeasure, and twelve other emotions, all of which were presented in a unique random order for each subject. Schimmack's finding that the number of items between the pleasure and displeasure items had no influence on the intensity of subjects' reported mixed emotions provides initial evidence against vacillation.\ntp8g | Carrera and Oceja tested the vacillation hypothesis more directly by collecting continuous measures of subjects' emotional reactions to a bittersweet clip from a film entitled The Son of the Bride. The clip depicted a wedding that was both heartwarming and heartbreaking because the elderly bride had Alzheimer's disease and could not recognize anyone, including the groom. After watching the clip, subjects completed static emotion ratings. Those who reported mixed emotions then drew two curves to chart their recollection of how the intensity of their happiness and sadness changed over the course of the six-minute clip. Carrera and Oceja quantified simultaneously mixed emotions in terms of whether both curves exceeded zero at any point in time. Subjects who watched the bittersweet clip were more likely to report mixed emotions with static ratings than they were to recall that their happiness and sadness occurred simultaneously, but they were nonetheless more likely to recall simultaneously mixed emotions than those who watched a control clip\ngxfd | MIXED EMOTIONS\ns2v1 | intended to elicit happiness and sadness in a sequential, as opposed to a simultaneous, fashion. Taken together, the results indicate that even though some subjects merely vacillated between happiness and sadness, others actually experienced simultaneously mixed emotions.\n```",
