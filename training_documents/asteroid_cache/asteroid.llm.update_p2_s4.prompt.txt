You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

dqlg | Asteroid 4 Vesta is one of the largest rocky bodies in the main asteroid belt. The genetic linkage between Vesta (and its spectral resemblances, V-type asteroids) and howardite-eucrite-diogenite (HED) meteorites has been advocated based on petrographic stud- ies of meteorites and telescopic observations of the asteroid since the 1960-1970s (McCord et al., 1970). Direct observations by the NASA Dawn Mission in 2012 further support the Vesta-HED rela- tionship (Russell et al., 2012; McSween et al., 2013). As members of the HED clan, eucrites are basaltic or gabbroic crustal rocks primarily composed of low-Ca pyroxene, plagioclase, and minor amounts of silica minerals, sulfides, oxides, Ca phosphates, and rare zircons (e.g., Palme et al., 1988; Takeda and Graham, 1991; Metzler et al., 1995; and Yamaguchi et al., 1996, 2009). Based on short-lived radiometric chronometers, previous studies have shown that the initial crystallization of basaltic eucrites occurred within a few million years after the formation of the solar system (e.g., Lugmair and Shukolyukov, 1998; Touboul et al., 2015; Hublet et al., 2017). Most of the basaltic eucrites experienced high-temperature (~900℃) annealing <LATEX>\left( H a b a \quad e t \quad a l . , 2 0 1 4 ; \right.</LATEX> lizuka et al., 2015; Liao and Hsu, 2017). The U-Pb and Hf-W ages of zircons in the basaltic eucrites vary from as old as ~4563-4565 million years ago (Ma) to 4530 Ma (Ireland and Bukovanská, 1992; Mis- awa et al., 2005; Srinivasan et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2013; Roszjar et al., 2016; Liao and Hsu, 2017; Liao et al., 2019), with a weighted mean U-Pb age of 4554 <LATEX>2 \quad M a</LATEX> (lizuka et al., 2015). The eucritic zircons are considered to have crystallized during the initial crust formation and/or the prolonged thermal processes on Vesta. An age of 4563 ± 15 Ma has also been reported <LATEX>i n \quad a \quad m e s o s i d e r i t e</LATEX> (Ireland and Wlotzka, 1992), another meteoriti- cal group that is expected to have a common origin with the HEDs (i.e., Vesta). After a suite of the early processes, most eucrites expe- rienced complicated geologic events including (multiple cycles of) impact brecciation, reheating, and partial remelting. The 40 Ar-39 Ar dating of various eucrites exhibits a large age variation from ~4.5 Ga to 3.5 Ga (review by Bogard, 2011). Recent re-assessments of the 40 Ar-39 Ar plateau ages indicate two groups: an earlier group <LATEX>w i t h \quad 4 0 A r - 3 9 \quad A r</LATEX> plateau ages <LATEX>a t \sim 4 . 5 0</LATEX> Ga and a later group with <LATEX>\mathrm { a g e s } \text { at } \sim 3 . 8 5</LATEX> Ga (Kennedy et al., 2013, 2019). The earlier group may be associated with a large impact on Vesta that resulted in the formation of an ancient basin (possibly Veneneia) (Kennedy et al., 2013, 2019). The timing of this basin-forming or related cat- aclysmic impact on Vesta has also been dated at 4.52-4.53 Ga by other chronological studies (Hopkins et al., 2015; Haba et al., 2019). The later Ar-plateau ages, conversely, are interpreted either as clustering impacts during ~3.85-3.47 Ga or as an "end-tail" of ancient continuous collisions (Kennedy et al., 2019).
p6pq | The U-Pb chronology of Ca phosphates, such as apatite <LATEX>\left[ C a _ { 5 } \left( P O _ { 4 } \right) _ { 3 } \left( F , C l , O H \right) \right] ,</LATEX> is useful. Closure temperatures for radiomet- ric chronometers are known to be quite high for the U-Pb system in zircon, "moderately high" for the U-Pb in apatite, and con- siderably lower for the <LATEX>K - A r</LATEX> system in plagioclase (respectively ~900°C, <LATEX>\sim 4 5 0 ^ { \circ } C ,</LATEX> and ~300℃, assuming typical mineral sizes and slow cooling of 1-100°C/Myr; Cherniak and Watson, 2000; Cherniak et al., 1991; Cassata et al., 2009). Thus, the U-Pb sys- tem in apatite provides a record of "moderately high-temperature" events that were likely missed or overwritten in other radiometric systems. Another Ca phosphate, merrillite [CagNaMg(PO4)7 ], often
zse6 | provides a similar U-Pb chronology, although its closure temper- ature remains to be experimentally determined. The U-Pb age of apatite in a brecciated basaltic eucrite, Béréba, was reported at 4.2 Ga (Zhou et al., 2011); this age was originally interpreted as the beginning of LHB on the asteroid. Liao and Hsu (2017) reported the similar U-Pb ages of 4.2-4.1 Ga from apatite and merrillite in a newly found eucritic impact-melt breccia, Northwest Africa (NWA) 8009. According to their mineralogical and geochemical study by Liao and Hsu (2017), NWA 8009 experienced an abnormally se- vere impact compared to other eucrites, with a peak pressure of ~50-60 GPa and a temperature of ~1160-1200°C. Conversely, the apatite U-Pb age of another unbrecciated eucrite, NWA 6594, recorded an earlier event at 4523 ± 2 Ma (Liao et al., 2019). Liao et al. (2019) attribute this age to a large cataclysmic impact on Vesta, as inferred from other chronologies (Kennedy et al., 2013, 2019; Hopkins et al., 2015; Haba et al., 2019). By extending this line of reasoning to multiple eucrites, the thermal and collisional history of Vesta can be determined and, by implication, that of the other asteroid belt bodies. Here, we present a new U-Pb dataset for several eucritic phosphates, which indicates that their parent bodies suffered complicated thermal/impact metamorphism at a very early stage.
