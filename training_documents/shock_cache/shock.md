## State of Shock: Contemporary Vasopressor and Inotrope Use in Cardiogenic Shock

ABSTRACT: Cardiogenic shock is characterized by tissue hypoxia caused by circulatory failure arising from inadequate cardiac output. In addition to treating the pathologic process causing impaired cardiac function, prompt hemodynamic support is essential to reduce the risk of developing multiorgan dysfunction and to preserve cellular metabolism. Pharmacologic therapy with the use of vasopressors and inotropes is a key component of this treatment strategy, improving perfusion by increasing cardiac output, altering systemic vascular resistance, or both, while allowing time and hemodynamic stability to treat the underlying disease process implicated in the development of cardiogenic shock. Despite the use of mechanical circulatory support recently garnering significant interest, pharmacologic hemodynamic support remains a cornerstone of cardiogenic shock management, with over ninety percent of patients receiving at least one vasoactive agent. This review aims to describe the pharmacology and hemodynamic effects of current pharmacotherapies and provide a practical approach to their use, while highlighting important future research directions.

Cardiogenic shock is a clinical syndrome characterized by insufficient cardiac output to meet basal metabolic requirements, leading to life-threatening end-organ hypoperfusion. The development of cardiogenic shock has downstream effects on the entire circulation, causing tissue hypoxia and injury, inflammation, and vasoplegia as part of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome in many cases. Physiologic compensatory mechanisms include endogenous sympathetic stimulation which augments cardiac output by increasing heart rate and myocardial contractility. In addition to the direct cardiac effects produced by these endogenous compounds, peripheral vasoconstriction serves to increase systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure. These compensatory responses occur at the expense of maladaptive increases in cardiac afterload, myocardial oxygen requirements, and filling pressures, with resulting reductions in coronary perfusion pressure. Therefore,

prompt hemodynamic support is essential to restore cellular metabolism and prevent worsening systemic and myocardial ischemia, which drives the "shock spiral" that in many cases leads to circulatory collapse and death.

The initial goals of therapy for patients with cardiogenic shock can broadly be defined by two overarching principles: first, to rapidly identify and treat the underlying cause of shock (for example, urgent revascularization in acute myocardial infarction related cardiogenic shock) to enable cardiac recovery; second, to improve tissue perfusion and oxygenation through obtaining a minimum acceptable cardiac output and blood pressure, achieved through hemodynamic support strategies that may include the use of vasoactive medications and in select cases temporary mechanical circulatory support. The current review focuses on the pharmacologic hemodynamic supports that can be offered in this clinical context.

## Epidemiology of Cardiogenic Shock

Defining cardiogenic shock has traditionally been challenging, owing to the various clinical, biochemical, and hemodynamic definitions used in the seminal outcome trials and societal guidelines. The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions has recently sought to harmonize these definitions through a pragmatic classification system that can be applied to a range of clinical setting and helps enable the diagnosis of cardiogenic shock across the full clinical spectrum of disease severity, ranging from "at risk" to fulminant circulatory collapse. Importantly, the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions diagnostic and staging system of cardiogenic shock has been validated across multiple clinical subgroups, including cardiogenic shock with and without acute myocardial infarction, patients admitted to intensive care, and those with cardiogenic shock complicating out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The use of a uniform definition for cardiogenic shock and its severity will play a crucial role for future epidemiologic and clinical trials, allowing direct comparison between outcomes associated with specific therapies, systems of care, and treatment protocols.

Despite the challenges with defining and diagnosing cardiogenic shock, it is a common problem in clinical practice with an estimated incidence of four hundred eight per one hundred thousand hospitalizations based on the United States National Inpatient Sample. Acute coronary syndromes are the most common cause of cardiogenic shock, accounting for seventy percent of cases. The management of this cohort of patients is both costly and requires significant health care resource use. The average length of hospital stay ranges between eight point nine and eighteen point six days with an associated cost of treating a patient with acute myocardial infarction related cardiogenic shock in the United States of forty-one thousand seven hundred seventy-four dollars to forty-five thousand two hundred fifty-two dollars. Despite significant improvements over the past two decades in contemporary revascularization techniques and supportive care, one-year mortality rates continue to range between fifty percent and sixty percent.

Although the epidemiology and outcomes of in-hospital cardiogenic shock have been well described, there remains a paucity of data in relation to the incidence, treatment provision, and outcomes of cardiogenic shock in the prehospital environment. A recent population-based cohort study of a large provincial emergency medical services registry demonstrated that the overall incidence of emergency medical services treated cardiogenic shock was fourteen point five per one hundred thousand


## Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock

person-years, with an overall thirty-day all-cause mortality of forty-three point nine percent. Despite large numbers of patients with cardiogenic shock receiving the initial phase of their treatment by emergency medical services, prehospital therapeutic interventions (for example, mechanical ventilation, and vasoactive medications), in addition to many in-hospital interventions, are yet to be proven effective through high-quality observational or randomized data.


## Current Use of Vasoactive Medications in Clinical Practice

The use of vasoactive medications in cardiogenic shock is common. In the intensive care unit setting, twenty-five percent of admitted patients receive at least one vasoactive medication, increasing to greater than ninety percent in patients with cardiogenic shock. Although comparative studies assessing these agents are limited, norepinephrine is increasingly administered for patients requiring hemodynamic support with cardiogenic shock. The requirement for vasoactive medications is independently associated with short-term mortality and a stepwise increase in risk of in-hospital mortality has been observed with increasing number of vasoactive agents administered. Furthermore, a dose-dependent relationship with higher required peak doses to achieve hemodynamic stability is also associated with an increased risk of death. Although the observed excess mortality risk associated with the use of this drug class is of concern, these findings are likely to be confounded by increased illness severity necessitating the use of multiple agents at high doses. Nonetheless, these data underscore the need for further evaluation of the utility of these commonly used medications, compared with alternate vasoactive sparing strategies such as mechanical circulatory support.


## CARDIOVASCULAR PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACODYNAMICS OF VASOACTIVE MEDICATIONS

The study of the physiologic properties of vasoactive medications dates back to eighteen ninety-three, when the English physician George Oliver assessed the effects of various glandular extracts derived from sheep on radial artery vasoreactivity in his son. Evolving from these early experiments, the contemporary conceptual framework for these agents was established and is broadly divided into three categories in accordance with their predominant hemodynamic effects: vasopressors, inotropes, and inodilators. Vasopressors improve perfusion to vital organs by increasing systemic vascular resistance and therefore mean arterial pressure. Inotropes augment cardiac output by increasing myocardial contractility and in many instances heart rate. Inodilators have the

unique mixed effects of inotropy and arterial vasodilation. A summary of the commonly used vasoactive agents is presented in Table one.


## Impact on Hemodynamic Parameters and Cardiac Performance

Conventional descriptions of the agonist-receptor-effector interactions promulgated in traditional pharmacology teaching is primarily based on small studies from the nineteen fifties to nineteen sixties, using variable drug doses and indirect surrogate measurements of in-vivo receptor activity and downstream effects. In these early mechanistic studies, the observed physiologic effects of catecholamine administration in healthy subjects on blood pressure, total peripheral resistance, and heart rate were used to extrapolate specific agonist-receptor-effector biology. However, it is becoming


## Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock

increasingly evident that there is a far more dynamic and nuanced receptor-agonist interplay than previously appreciated.

This complex interaction has been assessed in pharmacodynamic studies in a sheep model where comparable doses of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) were administered, and their doses titrated. Of note, all three drugs significantly and equally increased cardiac output, MAP, and right atrial pressure in a dose-dependent fashion. Similar observations have been made in clinical studies of CS, with the inotrope epinephrine being compared with the vasopressor noradrenaline and producing similar hemodynamic effects. These findings suggest that the arbitrary vasopressor and inotrope definitions for catecholamines, in particular when the term "vasopressor" is used to describe predominantly peripheral arterial vasoconstrictive properties, do not necessarily reflect the true in vivo effects of these agents.


## Myocardial Oxygen Consumption

Although the overarching purpose of vasopressors and inotropes in CS is to improve tissue oxygen delivery, these agents also increase myocardial oxygen demand, which in the setting of a cardiomyocyte oxygen supply-demand mismatch can cause further injury and contractile dysfunction. The energetic requirements of the myocardium is primarily met through oxidative metabolic pathways with less than five percent of ATP derived from glycolytic pathways. Basal metabolic requirements account for ten percent to twenty percent of the total myocardial oxygen requirements, with the remaining oxygen needs determined by variables that include heart rate, contractility, and systolic wall tension. The relative contribution of these variables has been characterized through human and animal models, primarily using exercise to induce increased cardiac work. From these studies, heart rate has been shown to be the greatest contributor to myocardial oxygen consumption. Through augmentation with pacing, it was found that thirty percent to forty percent of the heart's metabolic needs were secondary to heart rate variation. However, this is likely an underestimate of the true impact of heart rate, due to pacing mediated reductions in end-diastolic and stroke volumes, with some estimates of heart rate variation accounting for up to fifty percent to seventy percent of myocardial oxygen demand. The contribution of contractility has been elegantly assessed through several animal and human studies, showing that increased myocardial contractility under physiological stress (exercise) accounts for fifteen percent to twenty-five percent of the oxygen demand. In addition to factors that influence myocardial oxygen requirements, supply is principally governed by the coronary perfusion pressure gradient, perfusion time (which occurs predominantly during diastole and is reduced with increased heart rate), and coronary artery vasomotor tone. Therefore, the interplay between hemodynamic supports, cardiac filling pressures, heart rate variation, and coronary vasomotor tone has the potential to adversely influence myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch in the setting of CS.


## COMMONLY USED VASOACTIVE DRUG CLASSES: PHARMACOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY

Catecholamines

The most commonly administered class of vasopressor and inotropic medications in the critical care setting are the sympathetic amines. These agents produce their physiologic effects through the stimulation of


## Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock

the following receptors; alpha-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, and dopamine receptors. A comparison of the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor pharmacology on vascular smooth muscle and cardiac tissue is presented in Table two and the intracellular signaling effects of catecholamines, in addition to other vasoactive agents, are presented in Figures one and two.

The direct cardiac effects of catecholamines are mediated through the G-protein-coupled beta-one-AR, which comprise eighty percent of the beta-AR population within the left ventricle. Beta-one- AR stimulation augments cardiac output through increased cytosolic calcium cycling and phosphorylation of troponin I, leading to increased myocyte contractility, lusitropy (active relaxation), and positive chronotropy. The second body system affected by catecholamines is vascular smooth muscle. The alpha-one-AR primarily modulates arteriolar smooth muscle tone. Activation of the alpha-one- AR causes increased cytosolic calcium concentrations resulting in smooth muscle contraction and an accompanying increase in systemic vascular resistance and MAP. Conversely, beta-two-AR stimulation activates the inhibitory G-i signaling pathways in vascular smooth muscle, causing vasodilatation.

Norepinephrine, epinephrine, phenylephrine, and dopamine are potent vasopressors and have comparable effects in increasing MAP. However, phenylephrine's exclusive alpha AR agonist activity renders it unable to improve cardiac output and therefore should be avoided as a first-line agent for hemodynamic support in CS. Unlike phenylephrine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, dobutamine, and dopamine (to a lesser extent) all augment cardiac output through stimulation of the myocyte beta one AR. However, in contrast with dobutamine, dopamine, and epinephrine, norepinephrine has the capacity to improve cardiac output, without significantly increasing heart rate, and therefore may limit increases in myocardial oxygen consumption and potentially attenuate vasoactive medication related myocardial ischemia and injury.


## Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors

PDE three is an abundant enzyme in many tissues, including in cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle. PDE three's biological actions include the hydrolysis of CAMP. Therefore, inhibition of PDE three through agents such as milrinone leads to increased cytosolic CAMP levels. Within cardiac tissue, elevated CAMP levels lead to increased inotropy, while vasodilation occurs within blood vessels. These effects serve to augment cardiac output, reduce afterload, and reduce systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. The administration of milrinone, however, should be performed with caution in patients with severe renal impairment, as it is subject to renal elimination and runs the risk of toxic accumulation in this setting.


## Calcium Sensitizers

Calcium sensitizers are a relatively recently developed novel class of inodilators. Levosimendan, a routinely used calcium sensitizer (not routinely available in the United States), has both peripheral vasodilatory effects and enhances myocardial contractility, mediated through vascular smooth muscle potassium channel binding and cardiac myofilament calcium sensitization by calcium-dependent troponin C binding, respectively. Levosimendan has similar hemodynamic effects to that of the PDE three inhibitor milrinone and interestingly has been shown to have significant PDE three inhibiting actions as well. Furthermore, levosimendan has an active metabolite with a half-life of greater than eighty hours, allowing the hemodynamic effects to persist following completion of the initial infusion.


## Arginine Vasopressin Antagonists

Arginine vasopressin (vasopressin), an endogenous nonapeptide hormone, exerts its cardiovascular effects through the activation of G-protein coupled receptors V1a (in smooth muscle) and V2 (in the renal collecting tubules). Activation of the V1a receptor on vascular smooth muscle causes increased cytosolic calcium and resulting vasoconstriction, and the V2 receptor activation leads to water retention via the distal convoluted tubule.

The use of vasopressin in the management of CS is principally mediated through a dose-dependent increase in systemic vascular resistance. It has a limited impact on other hemodynamic parameters including cardiac output and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Vasopressin may also have pleotropic effects that can ameliorate the underlying causes of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome mediated vasoplegia by


## Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock

reducing nitric oxide production and attenuate catecholamine resistance due to adrenergic receptor downregulation. Furthermore, there are emerging data indicating that vasopressin, compared with catecholamines, may result in selective vasoconstriction in the systemic circulation and cause pulmonary arterial vasodilation, thereby reducing right ventricular afterload.


## Guanylate Cyclase and Nitric Oxide Synthase Inhibitors

Methylene blue is a repurposed agent, previously used in the treatment of methemoglobinemia, but has recently generated interest for use in refractory vasoplegic shock. In the setting of CS-related systemic inflammatory response syndrome, methylene blue's therapeutic effects are exerted through the inhibition of nitric oxide mediated cGMP production, resulting in increased smooth muscle vasoconstriction. Methylene blue should be used with caution in patients treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as it may precipitate a serotonin syndrome and also in patients with known glucose-six-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency due to the risk of developing hemolytic anemia.

Current Societal Recommendations for Commencing Vasoactive Medications

Conducting randomized controlled trials in a population with CS has historically been challenging. Current societal recommendations have therefore been

Mediated through the stimulatory Gs component of the beta one adrenergic receptor, activation of the adenyl cyclase pathway occurs with a resulting increase in cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) and subsequent increased intracellular calcium cycling. The altered calcium handling results in a positive chronotropic response, increased myocardial contractility, and lusitropy.

developed using data from small trials of variable quality, meta-analyses, and consensus opinion, resulting in equipoise with respect to the recommended first-line vasoactive agents to be used in the treatment of CS. A summary of the available randomized trial data pertaining to the use of vasoactive medications are presented in Table three. Despite limited high-quality data, French, German, Austrian, and the European Society Cardiology guidelines addressing CS management endorse the use of norepinephrine or dobutamine as the first-line vasoactive medications in CS. In the United States, current guidelines remain less definitive. The American Heart Association's


## Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock

Heart Failure guidelines do not provide clear recommended first-line vasoactive medication, suggesting clinicians use agents that are readily available, easy to administer, and they are familiar. Furthermore, the American Heart Association's Scientific Statements on the contemporary management of CS recommends the use of dopamine or norepinephrine as first-line treatments, whereas the recently published guideline for the invasive management of AMI-CS suggests norepinephrine be used to support blood pressure in the initial stabilization period, unless further chronotropic support is required. These recommendations are summarized in Figure three.

Stimulation of the alpha one adrenergic or vasopressin one receptors causes activation of the Gq (G-protein) subunit, resulting in downstream stimulation of the phospholipase C signaling pathway. Phospholipase C in turn activates inositol one, four, five-triphosphate leading to calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in vasoconstriction. Conversely, beta two-receptor stimulation activates the inhibitory G-protein (Gi) subunit causing vasodilation through increased cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) activation and resulting phospholamban-mediated calcium uptake into the SR. Similarly, activation of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel causes potassium influx that hyperpolarizes voltage-dependent calcium channels, reducing intracellular calcium and vasomotor tone.

## Treatment of Cardiogenic Shock With Associated Hypotension

The initial goal of therapy in patients with CS and associated hypotension should be focused on the restoration of perfusion to vital organs, achieved through augmenting MAP and cardiac output. End-organ blood flow is a direct correlate of MAP, and reduced systolic blood pressure in CS, in particular in the setting of AMI-CS, is independently associated with an increased risk of mortality.

The safety and efficacy of dopamine in CS has been called into question by the SOAP-Two trial. This study compared dopamine and norepinephrine as first-line therapies through a multicenter, ICU-based randomized controlled trial of one thousand six hundred seventy-nine patients with shock of all causes. Although there was no difference in the primary outcome of all-cause twenty-eight-day mortality in this cohort, dopamine was associated with increased arrhythmic events (n equals two hundred seven [twenty-four point one percent] versus n equals one hundred two [twelve point four percent], P is less than zero point zero zero one) and in a prespecified subgroup of two hundred eighty patients with CS there


## Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock

was an increased risk of twenty-eight-day mortality (P equals zero point zero three). Although these findings are hypothesis generating, in the absence of alternate data supporting the use of dopamine, we advocate that noradrenaline should be used in preference to dopamine in the hemodynamic support in patients with CS and hypotension.

There is an emerging body of evidence to support the use of norepinephrine as the initial vasoactive agent for the management of CS with hypotension. OPTIMA double C (Epinephrine Versus Norepinephrine for Cardiogenic Shock After Acute Myocardial Infarction), a small prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled study, sought to compare the hemodynamic effects and tolerability of epinephrine with norepinephrine in AMI-CS. Despite recruiting a total of only fifty-seven patients, there were several valuable insights gained from these data; (one) there were no differences observed in MAP, cardiac index, or stroke volume in patients treated with either epinephrine or norepinephrine; (two) comparable doses of both study drugs were required to achieve a target MAP of seventy millimeters of mercury; (three) epinephrine treatment was associated

with worse metabolic acidosis and increased lactate levels; those treated with epinephrine experienced significantly greater increases in heart rate and a concomitant increase in the cardiac double product, an indirect surrogate of myocardial oxygen consumption, compared with norepinephrine treated patients; and the study was terminated prematurely due to increased rates of refractory CS odds ratio eight point two four developing in the epinephrine-treated arm. Additionally, a meta-analysis that included two thousand five hundred eighty-three patients with nonsurgical CS assessed the impact of epinephrine treatment on short-term mortality outcomes. This study found that epinephrine treated patients had significantly greater adjusted risk of mortality adjusted odds ratio four point seven. Epinephrine's apparent lack of benefit relating to hemodynamic parameters, increased myocardial oxygen consumption, and the potential increased risk of developing refractory CS and death, when compared with norepinephrine, raise concerns about its use as a first-line treatment in CS. However, further data are required to establish norepinephrine's superiority over epinephrine as the first-line therapy in CS with hypotension.


## Treatment Cardiogenic Shock With Preserved Blood Pressure and Low Cardiac Output State

To date there are no randomized studies comparing the safety and efficacy of inotropes with inodilators in CS. There are three commonly administered inodilators


## Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock

in clinical practice, each with a unique mechanism of action; beta one- and beta two-AR agonist, dobutamine; PDE three inhibitors such as milrinone; and the calcium sensitizer, levosimendan (not routinely available in the United States). Although these agents increase myocardial contractility and lusitropy like traditional inotropes, they also have the effect of reducing cardiac afterload through vasodilation. The use of milrinone and dobutamine has recently been compared through the CAPITAL DOREMI (Milrinone as Compared with Dobutamine in the Treatment of Cardiogenic Shock) study, a single-center, double-blinded randomized controlled trial. This study included one hundred ninety-two patients (ninety-six participants in each treatment arm) admitted to ICU with CS and randomized to receive either milrinone or dobutamine. There was no difference in the primary composite outcome of in-hospital mortality, resuscitated cardiac arrest, cardiac transplantation or mechanical circulatory support, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or renal replacement therapy relative risk zero point nine. In a prespecified subgroup analysis, which included sixty-five patients with AMI-CS, there was also no significant difference in the primary composite outcome between agents hazard ratio one point three five. However, the findings from this study should be interpreted with a degree of caution due to its small sample size potentially rendering the trial underpowered to detect the smaller than anticipated treatment effects in both the primary composite and secondary outcomes. Furthermore, its generalizability to other clinical settings may be limited as it was a single-center study conducted in a quaternary level ICU. Nevertheless, considering these findings,

patients who are normotensive and in a low cardiac output state, it is reasonable to consider the administration of either dobutamine or milrinone as a first-line therapy, with the exception of severe renal impairment where dobutamine should be used in preference to milrinone.


## Vasoactive Medications in Refractory Hypotension

The treatment of refractory hypotension in CS represents a significant challenge. In the setting of severe metabolic acidosis, which occurs due to tissue hypoxia and subsequent activation of anaerobic metabolic pathways, both in vivo and ex vivo experimental data has demonstrated reduced vascular and cardiac responsiveness to catecholamines. The relatively preserved vasopressor effects in the setting of acidosis of vasopressin and methylene blue render these drugs a reasonable choice to trial as salvage therapy in cases of catecholamine-refractory vasoplegia.


## A STEPWISE APPROACH TO VASOACTIVE THERAPY IN CARDIOGENIC SHOCK

Presented in Figure four is a proposed stepwise approach for the use of vasoactive agents in CS. In the initial phase of therapy, we suggest that patients should be stratified into two phenotypes, those with hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than ninety millimeters of mercury, MAP less than or equal to sixty-five millimeters of mercury, or greater than thirty-millimeter mercury reduction in MAP from baseline with evidence of hypoperfusion) or low cardiac output (determined clinically, biochemically, or through an invasive hemodynamic assessment) and preserved blood pressure. The algorithm advocates for the initial correction of hypotension, followed by the treatment of the low cardiac output state with the use of inodilator therapy. The timing and role for the use of MCS in this clinical situation remains less certain and is outside the scope of this review. However, persistent severe CS should prompt clinician consideration for MCS therapy at any stage of the proposed treatment pathway. This strategy leverages the emerging data supporting the use of norepinephrine as a first-line therapy, while emphasizing the need for ongoing and repeated assessment throughout the treatment journey to tailor therapy based on the current prevailing hemodynamic status.


## Assessing Response to Therapy and Requirement for Titration of Hemodynamic Supports Invasive Monitoring

Continuous blood pressure monitoring is essential to assess for progression of the underlying disease


## Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock

process and the therapeutic response to vasoactive therapy. The MAP, defined as the average blood pressure during a cardiac cycle, can be equated to the end-organ "perfusion pressure." Accordingly, MAP is often used as treatment target for patients with CS and has been incorporated into the proposed treatment algorithm. The literature guiding specific MAP targets in a population with CS is limited and largely supported by observational data. Nonetheless, current guidelines suggest a target MAP of greater than or equal to sixty-five millimeters of mercury.

The role of invasive hemodynamic assessment with a pulmonary artery catheter is not clearly defined in cardiogenic shock. Although several randomized trials have assessed the use of the pulmonary artery catheter in shock, it is important to note that these studies did not explicitly include patients with cardiogenic shock, nor did they assess the use of pulmonary artery catheter-derived data to guide a treatment algorithm relating to the use of vasoactive agents or mechanical circulatory support. Nonetheless, the use of invasively derived measures of filling pressures and cardiac performance are of increasing clinical interest in the setting of cardiogenic shock. From a left ventricular perspective, in acute myocardial infarction-related cardiogenic shock the cardiac power output (defined as mean arterial pressure minus right atrial pressure multiplied by cardiac output divided by four hundred fifty-one) is a well-defined prognostic marker for short-term outcomes, including mortality. Furthermore, in a population with acute myocardial infarction-related cardiogenic shock, there is evidence suggesting that the cardiac power output can be used to assess the adequacy of hemodynamic support measures, with a cardiac power output greater than zero point eight watts associated with improved outcomes. With respect to the right ventricle, there are several parameters including pulmonary artery pulsatility index (defined as pulmonary artery pulse pressure divided by right atrial pressure), right atrial pressure, and right ventricle stroke work index (defined as stroke volume index multiplied by mean pulmonary artery pressures minus mean right atrial pressure), which have been shown to be predictive of in-hospital mortality in acute myocardial infarction-related cardiogenic shock and decompensated heart failure. In view of the paucity of randomized data supporting the use of the pulmonary artery catheter in cardiogenic shock, there is a considerable need for additional evidence to guide the use of the pulmonary artery catheter in this setting. At present, societal guidelines have insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of the pulmonary artery catheter in this setting; however, upcoming trials including the ongoing pulmonary artery catheter in cardiogenic shock trial will greatly assist with addressing this knowledge gap.


## Biochemical Assessment of Perfusion

Regular biochemical assessment can provide a "window" into the current perfusion status of the patient, in addition to classical clinical signs that may include mentation, skin quality, and urine output. In addition to direct measures of end-organ function and injury, for example dynamic changes in serum creatinine when assessing for renal injury, serum lactate provides an important global measure of tissue perfusion.

Absolute lactate levels have been shown to be a powerful prognostic biomarker in multiple shock states. However, temporal changes in lactate levels may be more meaningful, owing to the highly dynamic nature of these measurements. In a cohort of the Intraaortic Balloon Pump in Cardiogenic Shock Two study, absolute lactate level and clearance at eight hours was an independent predictor of mortality. Furthermore, in the CAPITAL DOREMI study, the time taken for lactate normalization was the most powerful predictor of thirty-day mortality. Serial measurements of biomarkers, in addition to routine clinical examination, can therefore provide clinicians with ongoing feedback about the effectiveness of the initial pharmacologic


## Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock

stabilization on perfusion (in particular for patients with low cardiac output state and preserved mean arterial pressure) and indicate the need for further escalation of therapy with additional pharmacotherapy or potentially mechanical circulatory support.


## FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Addressing a Lack of Randomized Data to Guide the Appropriate First-Line Therapy in Cardiogenic Shock

The challenges of performing high-quality randomized controlled trials in patients with cardiogenic shock have been well described. Furthermore, the external validity and generalizability of the available trial data are a considerable issue as the majority of studies have exclusively recruited patients once they have undergone their initial prehospital and invasive cardiology management and are receiving supportive care within intensive care unit at the time of randomization. Nonetheless, two seminal intensive care unit trials are currently ongoing. First, the CAPITAL DOREMI-two trial is recruiting patients with cardiogenic shock and assigning them to receive either milrinone, dobutamine, or placebo. This study will provide a crucial insight into the role of inodilators in the initial management of cardiogenic shock. Second, LevoHeartShock is a French prospective, double-blind, multicenter randomized controlled trial of patients with cardiogenic shock already treated with noradrenaline or dobutamine and assigned to receive the addition of either levosimendan or placebo. This study will help inform clinicians about the utility of inodilator therapy, compared with traditional catecholamine agents.

Although these intensive care unit-based trials are likely to be instructive, given the high rates of prehospital treated cardiogenic shock, randomizing patients at first medical contact with emergency medical services may enhance the applicability of any findings to a variety of clinical settings. As catecholamines are frequently used as a first-line therapy in cardiogenic shock, a trial assessing the efficacy and safety of this drug class should be considered as an area of priority. Our group is currently seeking to address this clinical question through the PANDA trial (Paramedic Randomized Trial of Noradrenaline Versus Adrenaline in the Initial Management of Patients with Cardiogenic Shock). This study will randomize patients with cardiogenic shock in the prehospital setting to receive either epinephrine or norepinephrine and will be sufficiently powered to detect a difference in twenty-eight-day mortality and therefore guide first-line catecholamine therapy.


## Comparing Mechanical Circulatory Support With Medical Therapy, an Urgent Need for Randomized Data

Mechanical circulatory support use in cardiogenic shock has increased dramatically over the past fifteen years, despite the cost, associated risk of major complications, and limited evidence to support its use. The rationale for the use of these devices is predicated on their ability to restore systemic perfusion, reduce cardiac filling pressures, limit myocardial oxygen consumption, and reduce vasoactive agent requirements. The Impella (Abiomed, Danvers) catheter-based micro-axial flow pump and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation have been readily adopted to provide hemodynamic support and incorporated into a range of cardiogenic shock treatment algorithms. This practice has occurred despite very limited randomized data supporting the safety and efficacy of these treatments, in addition to determining


## Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock

the appropriate timing and clinical indications for the commencement of these invasive therapies. There are several randomized controlled trials ongoing that are seeking to assess the role MCS use with respect to the timing of initiation and their use compared with medical therapy alone. Although these studies will be crucial to inform the in-hospital management of CS, MCS will not negate the need for pharmacologic support in both prehospital and in-hospital environments during the treatment phase before patients are established on MCS and in settings where this technology is not readily available.


## CONCLUSIONS

The use of vasoactive medications in CS is common and underpins the contemporary hemodynamic support strategy for these patients. We have sought to present the unique pharmacology of these medications and provide a pragmatic approach to their use. However, despite the ubiquitous use of these agents in critical care settings, there remains a lack of robust, outcomes-based data, underscoring the need for further high-quality trials to guide future practice.
