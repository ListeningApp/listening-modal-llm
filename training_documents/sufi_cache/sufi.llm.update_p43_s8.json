There were so many important and influential - and moneyed - people who visited the place that I used to wonder why our teacher did not 'professionalise' things, and employ gardeners and so on, rather than having so many people doing things that some of them were manifestly not accustomed to doing.\nyzd8 | I asked him one evening when he called for questions: There are people constantly offering large sums of money to us. Would it not give more opportunities for study if we used this money to run the establishment?\nicj7 | DEVELOPING ONE'S OWN UNDERSTANDING\n9qmz | As is the custom among Sufis, he told me to go away and find the answers myself, and then to come back when I had them, to see whether I was only asking frivolous questions. So I spent three or four weeks on the subject.\n0i7o | First I wrote down all the possible reasons I could think of, then I wandered about looking at the way in which things were being done, studying life through life, until I came up with the answers. They were these, and by giving them to you I am doing you no favour, since if you had worked them out yourself you would have gained more. As it is, I will have to give you the opportunity of learning something equivalent by some other procedure:\ngi46 | Some people offer money as a substitute for action, and those need to learn that they can serve by greater humility. Hence money is not taken from them, in their own interests. Others may give or offer money and it may be accepted, but it is the teacher who decides how it shall be used, and students are not able to suggest a study or organisational programme when they are there to learn.\nwgh3 | Again, having a working framework means that people can learn all kinds of things which cannot be learnt in the ordinary world, and which are vital to their ability to understand concepts and experiences of an extra-dimensional nature. For instance, if you want to get something done in ordinary terrestrial terms, you\n07sg | may have to have a hierarchical system. This, in turn, may allow people to exercise a latent desire for power which may not be indicated in them. How are you to improve such people if you are in fact encouraging that tendency? You have to work with whom you have, and therefore the kind of organisation must afford opportunities for exercising good characteristics and starving negative ones.\nfpt9 | This cannot be done in an atmosphere where matters are run on the fuels (greed, hope, fear) which are essential to compel people to act and keep acting in the outside world. If, again, you take money from certain people, they (not you) may imagine inwardly that they have 'bought' something. This can encourage their desire for preferment. It can also, on the contrary, cause the person to feel that he or she is not pulling his weight and that he has just purchased his passage, as it were. This is not good for anyone either.\nw88n | Further, there are always the people who offer money and when you take it assume that you have used it for yourself. People should not be placed in a position where their worst characteristics, in this case suspicion, are exercised. It is one thing to create a situation where people can observe their own undesirable characteristics working, but it is quite another to produce one in which they have this subconscious canker, perhaps not ever exteriorising it.\nmsxj | That would make such a person worse, not better. That is just as bad as the implied moral blackmail where you appear like a saint, in order to make them feel respect or that they are unworthy. Incidentally, it is for the last-named reason that Sufis refuse to exercise pressure on people by moral persuasion, which accords with modern discoveries in psychology, though historically we find that it was very little understood in most cultures. It still remains the main source of hypocrisy.\no5k9 | Conflicting Texts\nck36 | Question: Some Sufi texts seem to show that a person should be disciplined and dedicated, others that he should be critical and objective. How can these be reconciled?\nd6w7 | ARE ALL LINES STRAIGHT?\n7y7b | Answer: In exactly the same way as, say, mathematics can be reconciled if it is asked 'One book says all right angles are ninety degrees, but Einstein says that there is no such thing as a straight line, all lines are curved, hence there are no right angles'. You are mixing up two treatments of the same subject, treatments which depend upon the area in which you are working or the degree of advancement of the student, or both.\nbb5t | If the student is unable to adopt both disciplined and also critical postures, both linear and holistic thinking, he will not be able to perceive that which is to be perceived. Shabistari makes this point when he teaches that people have to be flexible and to find the path between extremes and opposites: '[The Seeker is] always balanced between rejection and faith.'\nehcp | USE AND ABUSE OF HABIT OF MIND\nhtk2 | Habit of mind is at one and the same time one of the most useful and most useless instruments in approaching problems. If you choose the right approach, you may solve the problem. But if you cannot choose it, and only obey it, you may not be using the best habit for the purpose.\nuttq | The habit which possesses present-day thinking is generally to assume that a disciplined approach will solve all problems. This is run a close second by its opposite: the beguiling but equally partial belief that if discipline is lost, insights are gained. In the story of the moth and the spider, entitled 'Scientific Advance' in my The Magic Monastery, you can see why neither approach when\nhbpe | adopted as certain to provide a solution, will succeed in areas where the mechanical mind or the incoherent one, dominate thinking.\nag8f | The would-be Sufi needs guidance precisely because books, texts, while telling you what is needed, do not tell you when. Think of the proverb: \"Words have to die if humans are to live.'\nsyhi | Self-Deception\n0l9v | Question: Can you mention something hurtful?\nbbwp | Answer: Surely most people can do that.\nd687 | To me, it is hurtful to have to deal with people whom you would like to teach when - pretending to themselves that they seek knowledge - they only want a social community, friendship, 'togetherness', attention and the like.\n2jap | All these things are delightful: and all the more delightful when consciously indulged in, rather than found by means of deception. Deception in this case is pretending to oneself that one is studying when one is seeking stimuli.\nbvr5 | Such people may have the capacity to learn. But they overlay it with shallow aims. They may have been trained to seek smaller satisfactions and to give them grand names. They may, on the other hand, simply be carrying on the demands of babyhood. Rumi said: 'When will you cease coveting nuts and raisins?'\n9epd | The condition can be so well established that people are to all intents and purposes unconscious of its presence.\nyt8f | UNDERMINING LOWER ASPIRATIONS\n5rn1 | Sufis jolt people from this 'sleep'. Such shocks are often experienced as hurtful - until they take effect, when we are always grateful that we have been allowed to encounter them. What is in fact hurtful to humanity does not necessarily feel hurtful at the time. Self-deception is the chief of these.\npv88 | When something real is being studied, lower aims will tend to vanish, and so will the hurtfulness of the effect of the lower preoccupation's being assailed. As Sheikh Gazur-i-Ilahi says, in his Irskadat, if the development by means of the Sufi way is profound enough, defects of thinking vanish, having nothing to sustain them.",
