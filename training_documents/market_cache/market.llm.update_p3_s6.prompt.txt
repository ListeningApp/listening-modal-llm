You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

0myz | In actual fact, research in less developed countries has revealed many of these argu- ments to be fallacious. Far from being ex- cluded and sluggish, the informal land market is quite dynamic, with free exchange (sales) of land and dwelling units (Jones and Ward, 1994). This is because the very infor- mality and poorly serviced nature of the land makes housing affordable in the first place. Moreover, far from being outside the market as some would argue, informal housing is actually firmly commodified within the mar- ket-place, albeit a less regulated one (Burgess, 1982). Nor is it axiomatic that only full legality and secure property titles prime the market-place as McLaughlan and de Soto argue: in both formal and informal land mar- kets regulation and restrictions may also severely inhibit property development, as
xh3i | well as preventing the creation of activities such as renting, the creation of jobs and income-earning opportunities, sometimes re- ferred to by international aid organisations as 'urban productivity' (Ward, 1999). Indeed, greater regulation in the formal market often severely restricts its operation-hence the somewhat perverse and simultaneous argu- ment by these same authors for the need to deregulate. Nor does it appear that legal title per se raises land prices significantly (Jones et al., 1994), although some assert otherwise (see Legoretta, 1994). As for the poor using the property as collateral to secure credit for home improvements, this would appear to be primarily a middle-class projection, since most low-income households eschew formal credit (Riofrio, 1998). Even though NGOs and government departments have moved to- wards micro-credit support in recent years, they often do not require full legal title as a criterion for a loan (Jones and Mitlin, 1999; Cosgrove, 1999).
syiw | This research notwithstanding, within the US and elsewhere many still believe that clean property title is an essential element to effective participation in the market-place. Only by holding legal title to their land can homesteaders become true players and beneficiaries of the market: the nub of the 'Mystery of Capital' extolled by de Soto and his adherents (de Soto, 2000; McLaughlin and de Soto, 1994). They argue that by hav- ing full legal title to their land and home, property values will no longer be depressed by illegality, and lots and homes can be freely traded in the market-place, making people more mobile. In short, regularisation and legalisation enhance bootstraps pro- grammes, foster mobility, help to build wealth and allow people to leverage capital using their property as collateral. However, such broad-brush propositions beg many questions and there is a rising body of re- search that questions these assertions from both the perspective of theoretical logic, as well as empirical practice (Gilbert, 2002; Varley, 2002). At best such assertions are overdrawn and at worst they are gravely misleading.
kg3t | This article analyses the intersection be- tween land titling programmes and land mar- ket behaviour and performance. However, unlike other research that derives almost ex- clusively from less developed countries, this research reports on similar low-income land and housing markets that exist in the US, analysing specifically the phenomenon of peri-urban 'irregular' settlements outside Rio Grande City (RGC), located in Starr County, on the Texas-Mexico border. Drawing upon detailed land market research and survey data collected as part of a formal evaluation of a major land title programme in Rio Grande City, we analyse and track land price changes in several low-income self-managed housing neighbourhoods for the period 1970-2001. This allows us to evaluate the impact of land titling programmes upon a number of possible outcomes for market per- formance: land and home affordability; and the opportunity and extent of wealth creation among impoverished households. The article further explores the apparent determinants of land price differences and changes over time, and compares conventional explanations that attribute land values to variables such as location, level of servicing and settlement layout, with alternative explanations that give greater credence to what we will call 'social determinants' such as the nature of lot sale and development entrained by individual developers, and their social relations with low-income populations.
lvae | At this lowest end of the land market, we conclude that land prices are fixed socially more by the idiosyncrasy of the developer, and not by differences in location or level of servicing. And while it may still be too early to be definitive, the evidence and prima facie findings that we present here suggest that there is little positive direct relationship be- tween land title regularisation, rising prop- erty values and turnover of lots through the market-place. For a raft of other reasons, the market is 'stunted' and, while land titling programmes do change the status of the way in which land is perceived and held by low- income residents, by itself title does little either to enhance directly valorisation and
o9sc | wealth creation, or to shape demand and property transfers. The lack of demand and the minimal opportunities for selling one's lot and home in the market-place, effectively impede any significant opportunities for wealth creation. True, colonia residence of- fers important use value to the populations (i.e. as a place of residence albeit at high social costs), but to date the ability of low-in- come (and now) legal property owners to capture any significant increase in the ex- change value is severely inhibited. And this bears little or no relation to whether or not the property is titled.
121u | Colonias in Texas and the Land Titling Programme in Starr County
zh03 | Before analysing the specifics of land devel- opment and land market practices in the study areas, it is important to outline briefly the nature of irregular settlement develop- ment and self-help in Texas and elsewhere in the US, not least since few researchers are aware of the widespread existence of settle- ments that are so closely akin to their Latin American and Mexican counterparts. In Texas alone, an estimated one-half a million people, almost exclusively of Mexican ori- gin, live in some 1600 plus settlements or colonias as they are more generally known (TWDB, www.twdb.state.tx.us; Ward 1999); while significant additional numbers of peo- ple also live in colonia-type sub-divisions in other border states such as New Mexico and Arizona (Ward and Koerner, 2004). While significantly different in many important re- spects from their Mexican counterparts (not discussed here, see Ward, 2003b, for further details), the formation of these settlements responds to a similar logic-namely, rapid urban and population growth, a context of little or no public housing supply and low state support for other low-income housing opportunities. Although illegal, they are ef- fectively the only route that poor households have if they are to embark upon home-own- ership, build a home and create a family patrimony, all within a context of poverty and low-wage economies, without access to
