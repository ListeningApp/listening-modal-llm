You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

caos | To give a sense of the intellectual climate of those formative years in the education of many of us, I draw on three powerful scholarly statements in the chapters ahead: William McNeill's The Rise of the West (1963), Carlton Coon's The Origin of Races (1962), and Northrop Frye's The Educated Imagi- nation (1963). Even as the European empires were dissolving, these major scholars and educators bolstered the case for a unequaled culture and race, whatever civil rights and political independence might finally be achieved in the world. Taken with Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth, these works make for a fascinating intellectual moment in the legacy of a collapsing imperialism that was as important as the Beatles, dare one say, in the education of the postwar baby boom generation now assuming the reigns of power in the West. At the very least, we need to reconsider how a person coming of age in the West in those years, whether in grade school or graduate school, was raised in the aftermath of colonialism among imperial habits of mind that now need to be identified, as they might still contribute to the educated imagination.
qrvy | To establish the degree to which our current ideas of education may have been influenced by the global forces of imperialism, I lay out, in the follow- ing three historical chapters, the different ways in which imperialism was bent on taking a knowing possession of the world, on setting that world on pub- lic display for the edification of the West, and on developing the principal forms of schooling that might serve both colonial state and colonized native. Having secured education's historical place in imperialism, I then begin a de- tailed treatment of five of the academic disciplines that have become staples of the school curriculum: history, geography, science, language, and litera- ture. Each of these subject areas is accorded its own chapter (chaps. 5-9), which is devoted to identifying traces of the colonial imagination that form part of how we have learned to divide the world. Each chapter begins with the subject's historical formation within the age of empire, pauses over the form this legacy took during the early 196os, and then takes a close look at the lingering elements of this legacy in today's classrooms, whether in America, Britain, Canada, or elsewhere.
pn9j | Education remains a voyage of discovery, a journey in search of a larger world. So it is that the philosopher Ernst Cassirer insists, in his discussion of Rousseau, that the student "understands the world only inasmuch as he ac- quires and conquers it step by step" (1989, p. 119). That the age of exploration furnished the commonplace metaphors of educational rhetoric is obviously, for me, more than an imaginative borrowing. Imperialism was an educational venture that captured and captivated the imagination of the West. From its interests in tourism to interior design, the West still lives within the spell of the imperium, and what follows in this book is a disquisition on what it

When Toni Morrison opened her Massey lectures on American civilization at Harvard in the year of the Columbus quincentenary, she described her hope to "draw a map, so to speak, of a critical geography and use that map to open as much space for dis- covery as the original charting of the New World-without the mandate for conquest" (1992, p. 3). In this way, we need to grow curious about what we have made of the world, beginning with a critical geography of our own map- coloring and -labeling days in school that did so much to define our place in the world. We owe students today an account of the historical divisions out of which we have fashioned ourselves as educated people, even as we work to- gether to move beyond our current understanding of an inexorably divided world.
