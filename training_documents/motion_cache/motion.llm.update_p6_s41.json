CR three BP-Based Equations: CNERM and CLERM\n7imw | If the CR three BP is considered, then the computation of the angular velocities simplifies as follows:\nlf1t | One) A sub l over i equals A sub l over m plus A sub m over i (as for the elliptic case);\ntze7 | Two) dot A sub l over i bracket L equals dot A sub l over m bracket L minus A sub l over m times dot K sub m. Three) W sub l over m is given by Equation thirty-one, but with double dot R bracket M as in Equation thirty-three according to the CR three BP;\nryvv | Four) Left bracket at left bracket M right bracket E quad I S quad given quad B Y right. Equation thirty-two, with the CR three BP simplified jerk\nzdrh | Double dot R bracket M. The set in Equation thirty-five with the CR three BP simplifications will be referred to as circular nonlinear equations of relative motion (CNERM),\nosmo | whereas the set in Equation thirty-six under the same simplifications as circular linear equations of relative motion (CLERM).\n0b8v | V. Equation Sets Comparison\nfucs | A. Reference Mission Scenario\nyply | To assess and compare the accuracy of the derived equation sets, we considered a reference target orbit inspired by the HLEPP study. The study considers a human-assisted robotic mission on the lunar surface, where rovers are tele-operated by astronauts on board a station in lunar orbit, the DSG. Access to the station by vehicles incoming from both the Earth and the lunar surface is one of the most critical aspects of the mission. The study of the relative dynamics for this scenario, and the design of maneuvers for rendezvous and docking with the DSG will provide a step forward in the overall mission design.\n75n5 | The candidate family of orbits for the DSG is the Earth-Moon L one NRHO. An example of NRHO belonging to the south subfamily is shown in Figure three. The orbit was provided by ESA.\nec91 | In Figure three the region of the orbit suitable for rendezvous, as suggested, is highlighted. To identify the rendezvous region, the mean anomaly of the NRHO must be introduced:\nwul6 | M of one equals two M-\n4rhy | where, in analogy to the Keplerian orbits, t is the time from the periselene passage, and T is the orbit period. For the orbit in Figure three, the average period is T equals six point nine eight six seven days. The periselene is defined as the point where the orbit crosses the x-z plane of the Moon frame closest to the Moon, whereas the aposelene is defined as the point crossing the same plane farthest from the Moon. The analysis of the stable and central manifolds of the orbit as a function of the mean anomaly was used to identify the recommended rendezvous region M in the range of eighty to two hundred eighty degrees. In this region the existence of the central manifolds enables the design of hovering or station keeping trajectories that can be exploited in the waiting for the clearance for the final approach.\n092d | B. Simulations Setup\n94ul | The equation sets defined in Section four point C were tested and compared, in order to assess their accuracy for different initial spacecraft separations.\n0vdu | Spacecraft motion was simulated according to the ER three BP. The reference scenario discussed in Section five point A was used as a benchmark, and the presented NRHO orbit was chosen for selecting target initial states with respect to the Moon.\na230 | The three simplified equation sets previously defined, namely, the ELERM, the CNERM, and the CLERM, were implemented in MATLAB Simulink twenty fourteen B. The ENERM set was not included in the comparison because for the ER three BP it corresponds to the exact description of the relative motion. Two relative motion equation sets based on the two-body problem were also considered, in order to understand their applicability to restricted three-body scenarios:\ndvoe | One) the linear equations of relative motion (LERM):\n677t | x equals p of one minus two x minus twenty-one of two minus two\n5hk6 | Eight\nviei | y equals negative j y p\nrk0j | Two equals two left bracket x minus x right bracket plus j squared one plus two\nc6x9 | e) Hill's equations\ng5at | e) Hill's equations\nre3j | where p equals x i plus y j plus z k, p is the target orbit semilatus rectum, and f denotes the true anomaly rate. Both p and f were computed from the target initial position and velocity vectors as follows:\n6z45 | p equals h of p, j equals h of t o times h of t o squared\n20af | where h of t o equals norm r of t o cross r of t o\nhuae | Two) the Hill's or Clohessy-Wiltshire equations:\nrblh | x equals two n z j equals negative n squared y\ngl5i | z equals negative two n x plus three n squared z\nx0yg | where n is the orbit mean anomaly, given by n equals two x over T, with T period of the NRHO orbit.\nmjt8 | Two different Monte Carlo simulations were performed to assess the accuracy of the equation sets. The distance test analyzes the accuracy as the initial relative separation increases. In particular, for each target initial condition, a given number of relative distances were chosen. For each one, a random initial relative position vector with norm equal to the chosen distance was computed, and the equation sets were propagated. Relative velocity was kept fixed to zero for all the simulations. Conversely, in the speed test a set of initial relative speed was chosen, and associated relative velocity vectors were generated randomly. In both tests, target initial conditions were chosen in terms of mean anomaly M along the NRHO orbit. The equation sets were tested over an interval of twelve hours. MATLAB solver settings are listed in Table one. Monte Carlo test parameters are given in Table two.\nhtcn | e) Hill's equations\n86d4 | The following performance indexes were defined to compare the equation sets:\nz7qp | One) the maximum distance and speed errors over the simulation interval:\n6t1g | e v equals max norm p of t minus hat p of t\ncpls | e p equals max norm p of t minus p of t, t in the range from t o to t f\nm50n | t in the range from t o to t f\neztf | where the hat denotes the relative position and velocities computed by the tested equation set, whereas the quantities without hat denote the true values.\nbwsu | Two) the aggregative performance index:\noqod | number\ntey0 | V equals max norm p of t minus hat p of t, t in the range from t o to t f\nghiv | xi n p\no5ts | where n is the NRHO mean motion. This index, used allows to characterize the overall accuracy of the set. The index V has\nhd7d | dimension of length by adimensionalizing time in the relative velocity using the orbit mean motion.\nehux | C. Distance Test Results",
