        "content": "b7cq | Recruitment dynamics in the coastal stock of Pacific hake are characterised by episodic strong year classes, which can vary in number by as much as two orders of magnitude or more relative to weak year classes. The occurrence of these dominant year classes appears to be largely independent of spawning stock size, so a reliable stock-recruitment relationship has been difficult to establish. Varying levels of mortality during the pre-recruit period is a common explanation for similar recruitment dynamics in other species.\n0b39 | Hollowed et al. found that Pacific hake appeared to respond more strongly to inter-annual variability than to decadal climatic variability. Strong year classes often occurred in years with unusually warm surface temperature anomalies in coastal waters north of the tropics, 'Niño North' conditions that do not always correspond to El Niño events. The frequency of these conditions will affect the size and variability of the coastal Pacific hake stock.\nqecd | Individual growth of Pacific hake can also be quite variable. Helser et al. examined length-at-age data from the acoustic and bottom trawl surveys and found that both of the van Bertalanffy growth parameters K, Brody growth coefficient, and L, asymptotic size, declined for individual cohorts from the early nineteen seventies and the mid-nineteen eighties and subsequently increased again. Temporary decreases in parameter estimates could be due to warmer waters and reduced productivity following the nineteen seventy-seven regime shift,\n1o7p | Biology, fisheries, assessment and management of Pacific hake\ncp13 | increased competition due to strong year classes, or both. Individual growth was depressed during the nineteen eighty-three to nineteen eighty-four El Niño, perhaps due to reduced euphausiid abundance.\nbgre | Nine point four Fisheries\n57lp | The fishery for the coastal population of Pacific hake occurs along the coasts of California, Oregon and Washington in the United States and British Columbia in Canada, typically from May through December. The primary fishery is conducted with mid-water trawls over bottom depths of one hundred to five hundred meters; Pacific hake are also caught incidentally in other coastal fisheries. Catch averaged two hundred twenty-two thousand tons per year during nineteen sixty-six to twenty twelve, with nearly three-quarters of that catch coming from the U.S. waters. Recent coast-wide catches have been greater than the long-term average, averaging two hundred forty-three thousand tons per year during two thousand eight to two thousand twelve.\nukth | Pacific hake were caught incidentally in commercial fisheries targeting more valuable species dating from the late nineteenth century but were discarded or processed into animal food and fishmeal until the nineteen sixties. Annual landings never exceeded a few hundred tons during this period. In nineteen sixty-four, the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service demonstrated the potential for large catches of Pacific hake, up to thirty tons in a single half-hour trawl, off Washington and Oregon using state-of-the-art depth telemetry systems on mid-water trawlers. The domestic fishery in the United States grew from less than five hundred tons in nineteen sixty-four to about nine thousand tons in nineteen sixty-seven, although these levels were not sustained afterwards due to lack of profitability.\nkpvt | Foreign fleets noticed the increased harvest opportunity, and in nineteen sixty-six, factory trawlers from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics began harvesting\njie2 | Hakes\nd0ik | Pacific hake. Japanese vessels, whose primary target was Pacific Ocean perch, Sebastes alutus, also harvested Pacific hake in the late nineteen sixties. Vessels from Poland, the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and Bulgaria joined the fishery for Pacific hake in the nineteen seventies. Foreign annual catch of Pacific hake from nineteen sixty-six through nineteen seventy-nine averaged one hundred sixty-seven thousand tons.\n0x0s | Joint venture fisheries commenced in nineteen seventy-eight and completely supplanted the foreign fishery by nineteen eighty-nine in the United States and nineteen ninety-two in Canada. The entry of domestic motherships and catcher-processors into the U.S. Pacific hake fishery in nineteen ninety accelerated the change to a wholly domestic U.S. fishery that took the entire catch by nineteen ninety-one. The domestic Pacific hake fishery in Canada developed at a slower pace in the absence of these larger domestic processing vessels and remains largely a domestic shoreside fishery, with a small joint venture fishery in most years.\n4exe | Nine point four point one Management strategy and challenges\n0myz | Since implementation of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act in the United States and the declaration of a two hundred-mile fishery conservation zone in Canada in the late nineteen seventies, annual harvest quotas have been the primary management tool used to limit the catch of Pacific hake. Scientists from both countries collaborated through the Technical Subcommittee of the Canada-U.S. Groundfish Committee, and there were informal agreements on the adoption of annual fishing policies. During the nineteen nineties, however, disagreements between the United States and Canada on the allotment of the catch between the U.S. and Canadian fisheries led to quota overruns. This, coupled with the decline of abundant year classes from\nxh3i | Biology, fisheries, assessment and management of Pacific hake\nsyiw | the mid-nineteen eighties, led to Pacific hake being declared overfished, below twenty-five percent of average unfished spawning biomass, in the United States in two thousand two. The strong nineteen ninety-nine year class was subsequently observed in the acoustic survey and fisheries, and a new assessment and abundance estimate led to the stock being declared rebuilt in two thousand four.\nkg3t | The allocation issue was resolved with the development and eventual implementation of the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada on Pacific Hake or Whiting, the Treaty, which was signed in November two thousand three. The Treaty specifies a process for developing annual stock assessments and total allowable catch, including a default harvest rate of F-forty percent and fixed allocations of seventy-three point eighty-eight percent and twenty-six point twelve percent for the United States and Canada, respectively. The Hake Treaty established a Joint Management Commission that decides the annual total allowable catch. Joint Management Commission decisions are guided by the terms of the Treaty and the Joint Management Commission's three advisory bodies consisting of the Joint Technical Committee, the Scientific Review Group and an Advisory Panel. The Joint Technical Committee conducts the annual stock assessment and develops potential yield amounts for Joint Management Commission consideration. The Scientific Review Group assures the technical integrity of the stock assessment and the assessment's potential yield estimates. The Advisory Panel is composed of hake industry participants from the United States and Canada, who provide their perspectives about the fishery.",
