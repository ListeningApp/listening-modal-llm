You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

km8w | Aaron Lazare (1979, 1989), an early colleague at Massachusetts General Hospital, talked about two kinds of loss that are directly related to this concept of disenfranchised grief. Socially negated losses are those losses that society treats as nonlosses. An example of this would be pregnancy loss, either spontaneous or induced. The second kind of loss related to disenfranchised grief would be socially unspeakable losses. These are specific losses about which the mourner has a difficult time talking. Common examples would be death by suicide and death by AIDS. Both of these losses carry some stigma in the broader society. One intervention that can be helpful to those experiencing these types of losses is assisting them in talking about them and exploring their thoughts and feelings about the death. Re-enfranchising suggestions for these types of losses can be found in Chapter 7 of this volume.
wzno | Introduction
xagm | CONTINUING BONDS
iwn5 | Attachments to the deceased that are maintained rather than relin- quished have been called continuing bonds. This is not an entirely new concept. Shuchter and Zisook (1988) noted that widows in their sem- inal conjugal bereavement studies in San Diego maintained a sense of their loved ones' presence for several years after the death. In the Harvard Child Bereavement Study, Silverman, Nickman, and Worden (1992) observed ongoing connections with the deceased parent among a large number of these bereaved school-age children. For most it was a positive experience; for some it was not. The book by Klass, Silverman, and Nickman titled Continuing Bonds: New Understandings of Grief (1996) pulled together information from our study and several others to pro- mote the notion that some people stay connected with the deceased rather than emotionally withdrawing, as was the notion previously pro- moted by Freud (1917/1957).
uooz | This new concept was not embraced by all and questions soon arose as to whether continuing bonds can be adaptive for some and maladaptive for others. Are continuing bonds actually associated with a healthy ongoing life? A lot of this controversy is based on the lack of good research evidence for the efficacy of continuing bonds. As more research is done, some of these questions will be resolved. Essentially, the questions center around four main issues: (a) What types of bonds are the most helpful in the adaptation to loss? These would include objects from the deceased (linking and transitional objects, keepsakes), a sense of the deceased's presence, talking to the deceased, introjecting the deceased's beliefs and values, taking on characteristics of the deceased, and the like (Field & Filanosky, 2010). (b) For whom are continuing bonds helpful, and for whom are they not? This necessitates the identification of subgroups of mourners; the concept should not be applied to everyone. One promising approach to this is to look at the mourner's attachment style in relationship to the deceased (Field, Gao, & Paderna, 2005). In the case of anxious attachments that can lead to chronic grief, holding onto the deceased may not be adaptive. Some mourners need to relinquish and move on (Stroebe & Schut, 2005). (c) In what time frame are continuing bonds the most adaptive and when are they less adaptive-closer to the loss, farther from the loss? (Field, Gao, & Paderna, 2005). (d) What is the impact of religious and cultural differences on maintaining healthy bonds? This would include beliefs and rituals that promote a connection and memorialization of the deceased cross-culturally in various societies (Suhail, Jamil, Ovebode, & Ajmal, 2011; Yu et al., 2016). More on bonds can be found in Chapter 2.

jfsr | MEANING MAKING
u15r | Meaning reconstruction and meaning making, concepts introduced and promoted by psychologist Robert Neimeyer, have been an important emphasis in the field over the past 20 years. He sees meaning reconstruc- tion as the central process faced by bereaved individuals. This reconstruc- tion is primarily accomplished through the use of narratives or life stories. When unanticipated or incongruous events such as the death of a loved one occur, a person needs to redefine the self and relearn ways to engage with the world without the deceased. The person cannot return to a pre- loss level of functioning but learns how to develop a meaningful life with- out the deceased loved one (Neimeyer, 2001). This is central to my third task of mourning, in which the mourner must learn to adjust to a world without the deceased. Death can challenge one's assumptions about the world (spiritual adjustments) and one's personal identity (internal adjust- ments). Bereaved individuals have serious questions such as: "What will my life look like now?" "What did the deceased's life mean?" "How can I feel safe in a world such as this?" and "Who am I now that this death has occurred?" (Neimeyer, Prigerson, & Davies, 2002).
lq35 | I think it is important to note, however, that some deaths do not challenge personal meaning making in any fundamental way. Davis, Wortman, Lehman, and Silver (2000) conducted research on two differ- ent bereaved populations and found that 20% to 30% of the bereaved individuals appeared to function well without engaging in the process of meaning making. Of those who searched for meaning, fewer than half of the individuals found it even over a year after the death. Those who did find meaning, however, were better adjusted than those who searched and didn't find it. But, interestingly, for some, the quest to understand continued even after meaning was found.
3g9w | Neimeyer (2000), commenting on the Davis research, makes note that the majority in the studies were struggling with meaning making and these should be helped with this process. But, he cautions the coun- selor about initiating this process if it does not occur spontaneously. He concludes his comments with an important distinction: meaning mak- ing is a process, not an outcome or achievement. The meanings associ- ated with death loss are constantly revised. We see this clearly in our work with bereaved children, who, as they age and pass through new developmental stages, ask: "What would my parent be like now?" and "What would our relationship be like now that I am graduating college, getting married, etc .? " (Worden, 1996a). More on meaning making as a task of mourning can be found in Chapter 2.
d09o | Introduction
ylhz | RESILIENCE
a3td | When Phyllis Silverman and I studied 125 parentally bereaved chil- dren over a 2-year period after the death, we noted that children fell into one of three groups. The first was the group of children (approx- imately 20%) who were not doing well during the 2 years after the death. Since our research grant came from the National Institute of Mental Health for a study intended to identify bereaved children at-risk and prevent problem outcomes, this group became a major focus of our study. Could we identify at-risk children early after the loss so that early intervention might be offered to prevent later neg- ative sequelae from the death? However, we also noticed a second smaller group of children who seemed to be doing very well, and we identified them as resilient children. Their academic performance, social life, communication about the deceased, self-worth, sense of control, and healthy identification with the deceased parent were all on the high side. The third and largest group was the group making do during the first 2 years of bereavement (Silverman, 2000; Worden, 1996a).
ex5k | Thanks to the work of George Bonanno (2004, 2009), we have begun to look at resilient bereaved individuals. These are people who adapt well to the loss and are not in need of either counseling or ther- apy. I think this focus is overdue.
9d4o | In Arizona, Irwin Sandler, Sharlene Wolchik, and Tim Ayers (2008) have added to our thinking on resilience. Like me, they pre- fer the term adaptation to recovery. Those mourners who make a good or effective adaptation to the loss have made a resilient adaptation. Sandler's group has identified both risk and protective factors in their study of parentally bereaved children and their families that lead to a good (resilient) or a less good adaptation to the loss. By focusing on positive as well as negative outcomes, a resilient approach goes beyond the narrower focus of pathological outcomes. It is interest- ing that the risk and protective factors found in Arizona families are similar to those Silverman and I found in the Boston study. Multiple factors at both the individual and social environmental levels are at work here, so Sandler's group calls their theory a contextual framework on adaptation. Individuals are seen as nested within families, which are in turn nesting within communities and cultures. This fairly new research and thinking on resilience in bereavement holds promise for our understanding of grief and loss. More on this can be found in Chapter 3.

5esx | TRAUMA AND GRIEF
m5ka | Like depression and grief, trauma and grief share many of the same behavioral features. A number of articles discuss how they are similar and how they are different. There are some, like Rando, Horowitz, and Figley, who would subsume all grief under trauma, but I find this a stretch. I prefer the model offered by Stroebe, Schut, and Finkenauer (2001), which makes the following three distinctions. The first is trauma without bereavement. Here the person experiences a traumatic event that gives rise to trauma symptoms leading to a diagnosis of PTSD or acute stress disorder, mostly depending on the time frame. Other symptoms of depression and anxiety may lead to a comorbid diagnosis. In this first distinction, the traumatic event has not led to any deaths and the person is dealing with one or more of the classic trauma symptoms (intrusion, avoidance, hyperarousal) without bereavement. Bereavement without trauma is the second distinction. Here the person has experienced the death of a loved one without experiencing trauma symptoms associated with the event. If there are complications after the loss, one of the com- plicated mourning categories would apply to this complication. The third category could be called traumatic bereavement. Here the person experiences a death and there is something about the death itself (often violent deaths) or something about the person's experience of the death (often related to an insecure attachment or conflicted relationship with the deceased) that gives rise to symptoms associated with trauma.
byu8 | Two questions emerge in any discussion of traumatic bereave- ment. First, which is the most important in defining traumatic bereave- ment-the circumstances of the death or the reaction of the mourner? Second, in the treatment of traumatic bereavement, which symptoms should be addressed first-the trauma symptoms or the grief symp- toms? Traumatic stress interferes with grief over loss; grief interferes with trauma mastery (Rando, 2003). Many believe that the trauma symptoms must be dealt with first before the grief can be addressed.
76b0 | There have always been people who have been exposed to vio- lent deaths, but the number of violent events seems to have increased during the past 15 years. The recent rash of mass shootings and multi- ple terrorist activities around the world, including September 11, 2001, illustrate the pervasiveness of violence in our society. Such violent events will continue to expose more people to both trauma and bereave- ment. We need more research on grief and trauma, including research on which interventions are most effective (Rynearson, Schut, & Stroebe, 2013). We also need to educate the media that interventions done in the days following a school shooting are not grief counseling but rather crisis

xnth | intervention, and there are major differences between the two in goals and techniques. More on this can be found in Chapter 3.
vafm | SOME CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
2zmw | Let me conclude this introduction with something that causes me concern: the failure of both clinicians and researchers to recognize the uniqueness of the grief experience. Even though the mourning tasks apply to all death losses, how a person approaches and adapts to these tasks can be quite varied. A one-size-fits-all approach to grief counseling or grief therapy is very limiting (Caserta, Lund, Ulz, & Tabler, 2016).
bf9k | When I was a graduate student at Harvard, Professor Gordon Allport had a strong impact on my thinking. Allport (September 1957, lecture notes) would tell students, "Each man is like all other men; each man is like some other men; and each man is like no other man." Allport was affirming his longtime professional interest in individ- ual differences-an interest that led to his collaboration with Robert White on the longitudinal case studies of men called Lives in Progress (1952). These studies affirm both the similarity and uniqueness of each person.
otkr | If we were to translate Allport's dictum into the field of bereave- ment, we would say, "Each person's grief is like all other people's grief; each person's grief is like some other person's grief; and each person's grief is like no other person's grief." Over the last 35 years, we have tended to lose sight of the uniqueness of the grief experience in our clin- ical and research undertakings. I always liked Alan Wolfelt's (2005) idea of companioning the bereaved individual. In this approach, the counselor comes alongside the mourner and they share their personal experiences in a way that can be helpful for both. I worry that in our rush to formu- late a DSM diagnosis for complicated (traumatic, prolonged) grief, we may focus too much on "Each person's grief is like some other person's grief" and lose sight of the uniqueness of grief, the fact that each per- son's grief is like no other person's grief. I have affirmed in each edition of this book that every person's experience of grief is unique to him or her, and people's experiences shouldn't be saddled with the term abnormal grief. I much prefer the term complicated mourning, which affirms some kind of difficulty in the mourning process that brings the person to the attention of the mental health worker.
ibgs | Affirmation of the uniqueness of grief is not a new emphasis in the field of bereavement. Colin Parkes (2002) said, "From the start, Bowlby and I recognized that there was a great deal of individual variation in
colo | Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy
d6r4 | the response to bereavement and that not everybody went through these phases in the same way or at the same speed" (p. 380).
9mrz | An interesting affirmation of the uniqueness and subjective qual- ity of grief comes from an fMRI study of grief by Gundel, O'Connor, Littrell, Fort, and Lane (2003). After investigating the grief experience in the brains of eight women, they concluded that grief is mediated by a distributed neural network that subserves a number of neural pro- cesses affecting various parts of the brain and its functions, including affect processing, mentalizing, memory retrieval, visual imagery, and autonomic regulation. This neural network may account for the unique, subjective quality of grief, and this finding provides new leads in our quest to understand the health consequences of grief and the neurobi- ology of attachment.
pk06 | I believe that the mediators of mourning outlined in detail in Chapter 3 hold the key to understanding individual differences in the mourning experience-the adaptation to loss from death.
