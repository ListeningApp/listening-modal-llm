o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

pbea | par
ccpt | Gas, and Gas-driven signalling also plays a critical role in stem cell populations, where it has been found to suppress self-renewal. In contrast to the pro-oncogenic effects of GOF mutations in Gas, in some stem-like cell states, Gas has a tumor suppressive role where LOF mutations, or Gas deletion has been found to drive tumor initiation and progression by de-repression of the Sonic Hedgehog and Hippo pathways142,143. In particular, the loss of GNAS, or low Gas expression is tightly linked to poor overall survival in a subset of aggressive medulloblastomas (MBs) with alterations and activation of SHH signalling, and in neuroblastoma144. Strikingly, deletion of GNAS in neural stem/progenitor cells consistently leads to MB-like tumors in mice by derepressing SHH signalling thus contributing to the development and malignancy of SHH- associated MB tumors144. In epidermal and hair follicle progenitor cell populations, conditional deletion of Gas leads to rapid formation of BCC by repressing PKA-mediated inhibition of SHH and YAP signalling78. Of note, activation of Gas in epithelial stem cells leads to exhaustion of hair follicle stem cells and subsequent hair loss, demonstrating the cell-context specific impact of Gas signalling78.
0fpw | Mutations in genes encoding Gai/o proteins in cancer
dqn8 | Pente
cop0 | The Gai/o subfamily of G proteins elicit signalling through a broad range of effectors, including activation of MAPK and PI3K signalling. In opposition to Gas signalling, Gai inhibits adenylyl cyclase, leading to a decrease in cAMP145. This was originally discovered through studies examining the mechanism of action of Islet Activating protein (IAP), also known as pertussis toxin, as it was isolated from Bordetella pertussis. IAP was found to release inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and enhance receptor mediated cAMP generation. Multiple groups studying the substrate of IAP found that IAP ADP-ribosylated Gai, thereby inactivating it, and enhancing adenylyl cyclase activity146-148. Similar to other G proteins, constitutively active mutants of Gai have been shown to possess the ability to transform cells and are known proto-oncogenes 149,150. Cancer derived activated mutants of GNAO1, encoding Gao, have also been found to promote oncogenic transformation and anchorage-dependent growth when expressed in cells151.
lhkq | In particular, hotspot activating mutations in GNAI2, which has been termed as the gip2 oncogene, has been found in several tumor types, including ovarian and adrenal tumors, and has been shown to underlie a dysfunctional state in a subset of growth hormone-secreting pituitary

y2qo | adenomas; however the small number of patients with this particular disorder have limited efforts to study the effect of germline GNAI variants and warrant further investigation 152-154. Strikingly, GNAI2 is in the top 1% of copy number gains in brain, central nervous system, and kidney cancers suggesting there could be a larger role for Gai-driven signalling39. In particular, many GPCRs that are well established as drivers of metastasis, such as CXCR4 (see below) couple to Gai. Aligned with this, GNAI2 (encoding Gai2) has been found to be highly amplified in breast invasive carcinoma52.
1piq | rtic Remarkably, Gai/o-coupled receptors are the most commonly deleteriously mutated class of GPCRs across cancers47. Coupled with this, inactivating mutations in Gai/o coupled receptors have been found to be mutually exclusive with activating mutations in Gas, suggesting that they lead to the same functional outcomes, converging on increased cAMP activity47. Indeed, a large subset of GPCRs mutated in GI-tract cancers are Gai coupled, and the Gai/o subfamily of G proteins are altered at similar frequencies in GI cancers to the Gas subfamily; however, the functional significance of their mutations have not yet been comprehensively tested52 (Table 1, Table S5). Aligned with the recurrent incidence of Gas-pathway activation in GI cancers, upregulated cAMP/PKA activity may be a common mechanism of tumorigenesis in these tissue types, and warrants further investigation, both from a signalling and clinical perspective.
7fqw | Mutations in genes encoding Ga12 proteins in cancer
rhaz | The Ga12 subfamily of G proteins is comprised of two a subunits, encoded by GNA12 and GNA13. Expressed in almost every tissue type, Ga12 and Ga13 play critical roles in cell proliferation and cytoskeletal remodelling, including cell polarity, cell adhesion, migration, and invasion 155,156. The Ga12/13 subunits were originally discovered based on their amino acid sequence similarity to other Ga subunits and determined to be unique based on their insensitivity to pertussis toxin157. Wild-type (WT) Ga12 was identified from a sarcoma-derived cDNA library screen to cause transformation of NIH3T3 cells, representing the only G protein subfamily whose overexpression is sufficient to be transformative without mutation158. The transforming ability of WT Ga12 was found to be dependent on the presence of serum; however, mutation of GNA12 leading to expression of an activated, GTPase deficient Ga12 was found to be potently transforming, and eliminated serum-dependence for transformation159-161. Similar work demonstrating the potent transforming activity of Ga13 led to the designation of GNA12 and GNA13 active mutants collectively referred to as the gep oncogene 160,162.

wtfz | Ga12/13 have since been widely explored as drivers of cellular transformation, cancer progression and metastatic potential in a variety of cell types 163-166. Signalling driven by Ga12/13 is largely mediated via the RhoGEF family, including p115RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF and Leukemia- associated RhoGEF (LARG) to mediate signalling to Rho167-172. Initial studies on the mechanism by which active mutant of Go12 was fully transforming in fibroblasts demonstrated that Ga12 strongly stimulated transcriptional activity through the c-fos promoter element and the serum response element (SRE), which was dependent on Rho173. Further work has revealed that Ga12/13 can signal through multiple effectors including ß-catenin, Radixin, and MAPK among others155,174-176. All together, these signalling pathways regulate a diversity of cancer-related transcriptional networks and cellular functions, including the activation of AP-1, STAT3, and YAP155,177-180

1k9e | Induction of aberrant Ga 12/13 driven signalling by overexpression or mutation of Ga12/13 or of Ga12/13 coupled GPCRs such as protease activated receptor 1 PAR-1 (F2R), or thromboxane A2 receptor TA2R (TBXA2R), have been shown to be transforming, and significantly increase the invasive ability of different cancer types163,164,181-184. Of interest, Ga12/13, Ga12/13-coupled GPCRs and their effectors including Rho, are overexpressed in several cancer types including breast, prostate, and hepatocellular carcinomas185-187. In particular, GNA13 is upregulated in several solid tumors and its expression levels have been found to modulate drug resistance in squamous cell cancers, such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)188-190. GNA12 also exhibits significant copy number gain in ovarian cancer, which is a cancer type characterized by generally few driver mutations52.
5bjs | conted It is well established that several receptors for bio-active lipids including LPAR and S1PR (S1PR2-5), and chemokine receptors including CXCR4 can couple to Ga12/13 and are involved in the metastatic potential of cancers155,187,191. Either overexpression of these receptors, or their cognate ligands can create an oncocrine feed forward loop promoting proliferation and migration of cancer cells. Consistent with this, blockade of Ga12 signalling using breast cancer mouse models has been found to significantly reduce the metastatic ability of 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells, and significantly increase the metastasis-free survival of mice 163.
uodj | Interestingly, the Ga13/RhoA signalling axis has been found to have a tumor-suppressive role in a wide range of hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies including Burkitt's lymphoma, and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)192-194. COSMIC analyses have revealed that GNA13,

b2lm | and its downstream effector RhoA are significantly mutated in these cancer types with mutations distributed across the gene body as compared to easily recognizable hotspot mutations, which tend to be activating in nature195,196. Across TCGA PanCancer studies, GNA13 appears to have a potential hotspot mutation at R200, although it has not been formally tested and annotated as such by OncoKB197 (Figure 2D). This cluster of mutations appears exclusively in bladder urothelial carcinomas, where GNA13 is significantly mutated (MutSig2CV q-value = 0.003); however, the function is currently unknown47 (Table S3). Ga12/13 has been well-studied in the context of DLBCL where it is mutated in 7.32% of patients in TCGA (Table 1, Table S5). In particular, GNA13 is the most frequently mutated gene in germinal center derived B-Cell lymphomas, caused by aberrant expansion and dissemination of a subset of B cells that are highly regulated and tightly confined to germinal centers in lymphoid tissues198,199. Mutations in upstream effectors, including the Ga12/13 coupled including Sphingosine-1-phosphate-receptor- 2 (S1PR2), and P2RY8, a putative Ga12/13-coupling orphan GPCR, or in downstream effectors, including ARHGEF1 have also been found90,198,200 (Table S1).
ti7f | Indeed, functional characterization of the most commonly detected Ga13, RhoA, and lymphoma associated S1PR2 mutants showed significantly reduced signalling and downstream transcriptional activity, which could be rescued by expression of wild-type proteins in vitro and in Vivo90,198. The mechanism by which inactivation of the Ga13 signalling pathway promotes development of lymphoma has not been fully characterized; however, several studies have found that suppression of the Ga 13/RhoA axis leads to an increase in phosphorylated-AKT in B cells 198. Consistent with this, elevated pAKT levels can be detected in immunohistochemistry of DLBCL tumors, and high pAKT is associated with poor survival in DLBCL patients, suggesting that targeting the PI3K/AKT pathway may be a viable treatment option for patients with Ga13 loss201.
oksu | Mutations affecting GBy and RGS signalling in cancer
wtow | Functional participants of G protein signalling, including Regulator of G protein Signalling (RGS) family proteins and By subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins can also play pro-oncogenic roles by modulating or potentiating G protein-driven signalling202. RGS family proteins are physiological inhibitors of G proteins through their intrinsic GTPase-accelerating protein (GAP) activity, enhancing GTP hydrolysis by the Ga-subunit, and promoting the reassembly and deactivation of the heterotrimeric G protein complex5. Recent pan-cancer analyses have revealed transcriptomic dysregulation and hundreds of mutations in RGS proteins, enriched for those leading to loss of function, thereby promoting G protein activity via a previously unanticipated tumor suppressive

nwfz | role, and mechanism of G protein signalling potentiation203,204. For example, RGS7 is recurrently mutated in ~13% of melanomas, where it promotes anchorage-independent growth, migration and invasion205 (Table S4). Similarly, a close homolog RGS6, has been found to possess tumor suppressive functions in breast and bladder cancers 206,207.
nvfy | Currently, 5 GB subunits and 12 Gy subunits have been described, which can dimerize in numerous unique By combinations. Once activated by GTP binding, the Ga subunit dissociates from GBy dimers, enabling GBy dimers to regulate distinct signalling axes including the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways2,208-211. Recurrent, activating mutations in GB proteins, GNB1 and GNB2 have been discovered in multiple cancers, namely in haematological malignancies where they induce aberrant activation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways212 (Table 1, Table S4, Table S5). Strikingly, expression of patient-derived GNB1 mutants were found to be transforming in vivo by induction of myeloid and B cell malignancies in mouse models213. Of note, distinct mutations tend to cluster within cancer types based on cell lineage, suggesting that there may be lineage- dependent cellular predispositions determining the impact of specific Gß mutations.
mror | GBy subunits have been also been found to drive cell migration and metastasis. Along with PIP3, GBy can directly bind to and synergistically activate the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) PREX1, which is a stimulator of the small GTPase RAC214-216. In addition, GBy have been found to activate different PI3K isoforms, primarily PI3Kß and PI3Ky, through interaction with both p110 and p101 catalytic subunits of PI3K to transduce signalling217,218. Of note, expression of GBy has been shown to be necessary for the transforming capacity of PI3Kß, where binding-defective p110 mutants have been demonstrated to significantly attenuate the transforming potential and GPCR-driven chemotaxis of cells219,220. In line with these findings, expression of this mutant in breast cancer cells significantly inhibited extravasation, matrix-degradation and macrophage- stimulated invasion of tumor cells, highlighting the potential role of GBy in paracrine signalling between tumor and immune cells221,222. In this context, there is an emerging body of literature demonstrating the importance of Gßy signalling in tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancer, in part by modulation and promotion of a pro-metastatic tumor microenvironment223,224
