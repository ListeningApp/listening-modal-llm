You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

We used a two- staged approach, first modelling the presence/absence of jellyfish strandings with individual environmental variables, and then we applied a backward and forward stepwise regression in SYSTAT to choose the best set of predictive variables. Descriptive measures of goodness of fit provided from the analysis for each variable (log likelihood, receiver operating character- istic (ROC) analysis, McFadden's <LATEX>\rho ^ { 2 } ,</LATEX> Cox and Snell <LATEX>\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }</LATEX> and Nagelkerke <LATEX>R ^ { 2 }</LATEX> were used to determine the variables which provided the highest level of predic- tion. The models with multiple predictors were compared using log likelihood, Aikaike's information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to determine the best model selection. The use of AIC and BIC is considered more rigorous that likelihood analysis alone in evaluating logistic regres- sion models and their use is described by Neath & Cavanaugh (2012). We have had to ignore the possibility of autocorrelation in the daily observations of stranding events, and we did not account for the circular nature of wind and current direction data (e.g., <LATEX>5 ^ { \circ }</LATEX> is closer to 355° than is 340°). However, we do not think this would have had a large bearing on the analyses, at least for the wind direction as just two values were from the northeast direction (i.e., between <LATEX>0 ^ { \circ }</LATEX> and 90°). Current directions were more uniformly distributed around the compass.

qws8 | Location, occurrence and timing of swarms and beach strandings
877u | Observations and locations of known swarms and beach strandings of C. mastigophora are shown in Fig. 1ii and summarised in Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM) Table 1. The earliest swarm recorded in the region was in August 1976 when the power plant at Cape Lambert (near Karratha, see Fig. 1ii) was forced into an emergency shutdown when the intake pipes became clogged with red jellyfish (Marsh & Slack-Smith, 2010) (see also ESM Table 1). The largest swarm is likely to have been in April 2000 when high densities of C. mastigophora were observed from the air stretching over 1,200 km from Ningaloo (Fig. 1ii) south to Rottnest Island (Marsh & Slack- Smith, 2010, see also ESM Table 1). Photographs of
rzhj | the recent swarms, at Cable Beach (Fig. 2iii) and 80 Mile Beach (Fig. 2iv) in 2012 and in the water column at Ningaloo in 2013 (Fig. 3), are shown. With the exception of the 1976 swarm, the swarms were recorded from two regions: near Broome on the Dampier Peninsula and elsewhere in the southern Kimberley region in 2006 (September/October), 2010 (April), 2011 (September to November) and 2012 (late August to November) and further south of Exmouth and Ningaloo in 1987, 2000, 2007, 2010, and 2013 (always in April/May for these large swarms). Except for the observation of high densities of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigo- phora offshore of the Dampier Peninsula in April 2010, all swarms in the northern region have been in the late August/September to November period and those in the more southern region occur in April and May. Some non-serious stings to swimmers on Cable Beach in 2011 and 2012 were treated by one of us (TT; see ESM Table 1). It is difficult to compare the size and significance of swarms between years; however, observations recorded in daily log books by life guards at Cable Beach show 2006 and 2012 as the largest strandings, with swarms in the intervening years not of comparable size.
bfax | During 2012, numbers of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora built up from 12 August with the first significant strandings on 27-29 August, becoming more dense from 12 to 15 September (Fig. 2i). The beach was closed to swimmers on 12 September. On subsequent days, when jellyfish were present in large numbers, although the beach was not closed, life guards continued to patrol and advised visitors of the hazard of swimming with the jellyfish. Life guards treated 396 minor stings in September and 336 in October. The last significant stranding was on 17 October, and <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora were uncommon by 23 October. The jellyfish were present throughout this period, but the very large strandings of many thousands of individuals occurred on 12, 13, 14, 15, 28, 29 September and 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17 October (Fig. 4). On days in-between, there were fewer jellyfish washed up but very high densities were being seen offshore. Log book records of the Broome Shire Life Guards and our own observations confirmed very high densities offshore of Cable Beach on 3 September and at the mouth of Dampier Creek in Roebuck Bay on 17 September; jellyfish were still very abundant offshore of Gantheaume Point on 19 September and another large influx was observed offshore of Cable Beach observed on 28 September. In the days following 12 September
f2y8 | and as late as 20 September, when we (JK, DB) used a vehicle to visit beaches along the coastline to about 60 km north of Broome, small numbers of jellyfish could be observed along the Dampier Peninsula but campers and tourists we interviewed reported no large strandings. We (TT) found jellyfish stranded in large numbers from Gantheaume Point as far north as Coconut Wells on 8 October. They may have occurred further north as this was as far as observations were made at that time.
o7qm | Oceanographic information in relation to jellyfish strandings in 2012
d52l | Tide range varied from 1.25 m to 9.82 m during the period 24 August to 20 October. Of the 19 days with significant jellyfish strandings, there were 9 days (47.4%) that occurred when the tidal range was <5 m although only 18 days (31.0%) of all days during the same period had tidal ranges <5 m. This

nhsg | association was not significant (P = 0.061, x2 statis- tic = 3.522, 1 d.f.). However, tide range <5 m that occurred 1 and 2 days prior to the stranding days were both significantly associated with stranding events (P = 0.013, x2 statistic = 6.158, 1 d.f. for both 1 and 2 day lags). This result indicates that strandings were significantly more likely to follow days of small tidal range than those of larger tidal ranges. However, as shown in Fig. 4, not all stranding events occurred on days which followed smaller than average tide ranges.
