You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

As expected, a clear transcriptomic signature of both the flesh firmness type I and the flesh crispness type I hybrids was the 2.18- to 56.19-fold high expression of cell wall degradation-related genes. These genes included MdBGL (MD00G1075400 and MD11G1023900), MdBGAL (MD15G1220900 and MD15G1221000) and MdBGLU (MD03G1215300) (Figure S6a,b; Tables S4 and S5). On the contrary, the expression of four cell wall-associated genes was significantly higher (2.26- to 9.10-fold difference) in flesh crispness retainable type III and type II hybrids than in crispness unretainable type I hybrids, that is MdPGIP12 (MD05G1002900), MdGLCAT14B (MD02G1033100), MdGWD1 (MD16G1097800) and a cellulolyase gene (MD17G1249600) (Figure S6b; Tables S4 and S5).
pn9j | Several ethylene-related DEGs were detected between flesh firmness type III or type II and type I hybrids. The expression of MdZAT12 (MD01G1123300 and MD07G1192900), MdERF110 (MD15G1334900) and MdACO1 (MD15G1205100) was 0.01- to 0.48-fold lower in type II and type III hybrids (Figure S6a; Tables S4 and S5). Similarly, the expression of MdACO2 (MD05G1354000), MdACO3 (MD02G1050800), MdEIN3 (MD15G1441000) and MdERF98 (MD06G1208700) was signifi- cantly low (0.01- to 0.47-fold difference) in flesh crispness retainable type III and type II hybrids (Figure S6b; Tables S4 and S5). A group of ethylene response genes, however, was expressed more actively (2.02- to 2514.55-fold difference) in firmness type III and type II hybrids than that in firmness type I hybrids, such as MdAGL24 (MD15G1384500), MdACO4 (MD16G1019900), MdACO4-like (MD16G1019800), and MdALD1 (MD15G1412200 and MD15G1412400).
1pmc | High expression (2.95- to 37.14-fold difference) of some auxin- related genes, MdSAUR71 (MD10G1202100), MdSAUR40 (MD01G1106100) and MdARGOS (MD02G1000700), was observed in flesh firmness type I hybrids (Figure S6a; Table S4). In addition, a group of genes involved in abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA) synthesis, transport, and response were differentially expressed between hybrid types of flesh firmness or crispness (Figures S6-S8; Tables S4 and S5). There were also DEGs detected between flesh firmness type III and type II hybrids, such as jasmonate (JA)-related genes (MD07G1242100, MD07G1243000, MD07G1244000 and MD07G1244600) (Fig- ure S6a; Tables S4 and S5). In summary, the above DEGs indicated the cell wall degradation, ethylene biosynthesis and signalling of ethylene, and other phytohormone were involved in flesh firmness and crispness retainability.

hntf | firmness or crispness retainability, respectively. Then, 87 and 58 genes were selected according to the parental re-sequencing and RNA-seq data. These genes were functionally associated with fruit ripening and senescence (Table S6). From the QTL regions of F- F03.1/C-F03.2 and F-Z16.2, two ERF genes, MdERF3 (MD03G1194300) and MdERF118 (MD16G1043500), were pre- dicted as candidate genes for both flesh firmness and crispness retainability (Figure S5a,b; Table S6). MdERF3 and MdERF118 were also DEGs (Table S3).
99fo | Validation of candidate genes MdERF3 and MdERF118, and their interaction
y5r7 | An 8-bp deletion (CTTAACTG) from -323 to -330 (Del323) prior to the ATG codon of MdERF3 of 'Red Fuji' was detected and validated using Sanger sequencing (Figure 2a). The Del323 genotypes of 'Red Fuji' and 'Zisai Pearl' were heterozygous Del323:del323 and homologus Del323:Del323, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis predicted that this deletion might damage the DOF5.3 binding motif.
lrry | The expression of MdERF3 in 'Red Fuji' and three flesh firmness and crispness retainable hybrids (01-067, 11-169, and 17-138) with Del323:del323 genotype was significantly higher (2.1- to 2.9-fold difference) than that in 'Zisai Pearl' and three flesh firmness and crispness non-retainable hybrids (12-190, 17-103, and 14-107) with Del323:Del323 genotype during 6 to 18 weeks of cold storage (Figure 2b).
hvhm | ß-Glucuronidase (GUS) staining of transient transformed tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves and the relative expres- sion of GUS in MdERFpro-Fdel323:GUS and MdERF3 pro-Fdel323- 2:GUS indicated that both the presence of Del323 from 'Zisai Pearl' and truncating off the corresponding fragment from 'Red Fuji' destroyed the promoter activity of MdERF3 (Figure 2c,d). In transgenic apple calli, the relative promoter activity was signifi- cantly lower in MdERF3 pro-F:GUS (Del323) than in MdERF3 pro -F: GUS (del323) (Figure 2e,f).
863b | Bioinformatics analysis predicted that MdERF3 may bind to the GCC-box or DRE motif on the promoter of genes such as MdPGLR3, MdPME2 and MdACO4 (Figure 2g). MdPGLR3, MdPME2 and MdACO4 were predicted as candidate genes from QTLs F-F03.4, C-F02.1 and F-Z16.1, respectively, and all these three genes were DEGs for flesh firmness and crispness retain- ability (Table S6). Yeast one hybrid (Y1H) assay confirmed that MdERF3 efficiently bound to the promoters of MdPGLR3, MdPME2 and MdACO4 (Figure 2g). The relative expression of MdPGLR3, MdPME2 and MdACO4 was significantly inhibited in MdERF3 overexpressing lines, but was induced significantly in RNAi lines (Figure 2h,i). These data demonstrated that MdERF3 might negatively regulate the transcription of MdPGLR3, MdPME2 and MdACO4.
fj24 | MdDOF5.3 was predicted to be located near QTL F-Z11.1 (Table S6). Y1H revealed that MdDof5.3 bound to the promoter of MdERF3 (del323) of 'Red Fuji' containing the CTTAACTG element, but did not bind to MdERF3 (Del323) of 'Red Fuji' (Figure 3a). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) further confirmed the interaction between MdDOF5.3 and the promoter of MdERF3 containing the CTTAACTG element (Figure 3b). In 35S:MdDOF5.3 and MdERF3 pro-F:GUS (del323) co-transformed tobacco leaves, the MdERF3 promoter activity was higher than that co-transformed with a <LATEX>M d E R F 3 _ { p r a } - F : G U S</LATEX> (Del323) (Fig- ure 3c). These results indicated that Del323 of MdERF3 com- pletely perturbed the binding of MdDOF5.3 to the CTTAACTG motif of MdERF3 promoter.
uz3c | MdERF3 was then transiently overexpressed via Agrobac- terium-mediated infiltration or silenced via pTRV virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). Compared to that with the PRI101 empty vector transformants control, a significant increase in MdERF3 expression and distinct changes in fruit skin colour were observed in 'Golden Delicious' apples five days after transient transforma- tion with PRI-MdERF3 (Figure 3d,e). However, both flesh firmness and crispness of PRI-MdERF3-transformed apples were relatively lower than that of PRI101 control (Figure 3f,g), which may be attributed to natural fruit senescence. The apples transformed with pTRV-MdERF3 displayed more yellowing of the skin (Figure 3d), reduced MdERF3 expression, and an especially lower flesh firmness and crispness five days after infiltration (Figure 3e- g). These data further confirmed that MdERF3 contributed to post-harvest flesh firmness/crispness retainability.
d5bi | A 3-bp deletion (GTT) at -229 to -231 (Del229) upstream of the ATG codon of MdERF118 was detected in 'Zisai Pearl' (Figure 4a), which disrupted the RAVL1 binding CAACA motif and reduced the expression of MdERF118 in flesh firmness and crispness non-retainable Del229:del229 genotypes (Figure 4b). The GUS staining intensity, GUS gene expression in tobacco, and transgenic apple calli indicated that the presence of Del229 or truncating off the corresponding motif reduced the promoter activity of MdERF118 (Figure 4c-f). Y1H and transgenic apple calli lines confirmed that MdERF118 might negatively regulate the transcription of MdPGLR3 and MdACO4 (Figure 4g-i).
ba4l | MdRAVL1 was predicted from QTL F-Z16.2 (Table S6). Y1H, EMSA and transient co-transformed tobacco showed that MdRAVL1 bound to the promoter of MdERF118 (del229) but not MdERF118-D (Del229) (Figure 5a-c). 'Golden Delicious' apples transiently overexpressing or VIGS MdERF118 further confirmed the contribution of MdERF118 to flesh firmness/ crispness retainability (Figure 5d-g).
ffx8 | The yeast two hybrid (Y2H) assay revealed the protein-protein interaction between MdERF3 and MdERF118 (Figure 5h). Then, a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay in N. benthamiana leaves further verified that MdERF3 interacted with MdERF118 in the nucleus (Figure 5i).
s6su | QTL-based GAP modelling and simulative selection
y219 | An SNP marker was selected from a candidate gene predicted from each of the 56 QTLs, including MdERF3 and MdERF118 (Figure S4; Table S7). The genotypes of hybrids in the training population for the 56 QTL-based markers were listed in Tables S8 and S10. The marker effects varied from 0.155 months (SNP10070698) to 2.59 months (SNP9127269), and from 0.21 months (SNP10070698) to 3.24 months (SNP23366479) for flesh firmness and crispness retainability, respectively (Tables S9 and S11).

jc47 | The genomics-predicted value (GPV) of flesh firmness retain- ability of 473 hybrids and GPV of flesh crispness retainability of 394 hybrids were shown in Tables S8 and S10, respectively. Relatively high prediction accuracy was obtained as 0.5712 and 0.6585 for the retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively (Figure 6b,c). The fivefold cross-validation exhibited an average prediction accuracy of 0.5541 and 0.6018 for flesh firmness and crispness retainability, respectively (Tables S12 and S13). In a simulative selection, when flesh firmness retainability GPV criterion was set as 5.0 months, the selection rate was 2.54% and the efficiency was 100% (12/12), which indicated that the observed phenotype value (OPV) of all the 12 selected hybrids was equal to or longer than 5.0 months (Table S14). When the GPV criterion for flesh crispness retainability was set as 5.0 months, the selection rate was 3.48% and the efficiency was 64.29% (Table S15).
