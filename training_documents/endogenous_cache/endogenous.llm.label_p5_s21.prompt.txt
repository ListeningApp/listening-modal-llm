You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

p2n3 | 184 neuroproteasome (Fig 1D). We fail to detect cytosolic proteins such as Actin in our surface
ohh7 | 185 fraction, validating our surface-labeling approach, and fail to observe FLAG expression in 20S-
vbni | 186 FLAG mice without Cre (Fig 1D). By blotting using an antibody which detects six of the seven
dgcw | 187 alpha subunits of the 20S proteasome including a7, the subunit coded for by Psma3, we can
gvwz | 188 clearly distinguish the modified a7 subunit overlaying with the FLAG signal, denoting
sk5m | 189 modification of the endogenous protein (Fig 1D). Next, we used surface biotinylation to assess if
qws8 | 190 our transgenic system was functional in primary cultures. Primary neurons from 20S-FLAG mice
877u | 191 were cultured and transduced with AAVs to express Cre recombinase at days in vitro (DIV) two
rzhj | 192 and then processed for surface biotinylation at DIV14 (Fig S1E). We did not detect FLAG
bfax | 193 without AAVs to express Cre, supporting our conclusion that the 20S-FLAG transgene is 194 inducible and not leaky.
f2y8 | 195
o7qm | 196 Next, we purified FLAG-neuroproteasomes to determine their composition. First, we prepared
d52l | 197 plasma membranes from 20S-FLAG/Baf53b-Cre brains and then gently extracted membrane
qlbb | 198 proteins. We find our membrane preparations were enriched in membrane proteins such as
nhsg | 199 GluR1 and depleted of cytosolic proteins like Actin (Fig S1F). We affinity isolated FLAG-
hy0l | 200 neuroproteasomes from the membrane fraction as well as cytosolic FLAG-proteasomes and
4jmz | 201 subjected both to quantitative tandem mass tag-based mass spectrometry analysis. As expected,
b7cq | 202 we find common signatures of 20S subunits between both cytosolic proteasomes and
0b39 | 203 neuroproteasomes and a significant depletion of 19S subunits in the neuroproteasome isolations.
qecd | 204 This is consistent with a lack of cytosolic subunits in our membrane preparations and validates our previous findings(3-5). We identified 64 proteins enriched in the neuroproteasome isolations 206 which are depleted in the cytosolic fraction. This revealed significant enrichment of the GPM6
1o7p | 205
cp13 | 207 glycoprotein, which we previously described(3) (Fig 1E), and a surprising and strong enrichment
bgre | 208 of ApoE and the ApoE receptor Lrp1 (Fig 1E, Table S1). We do not observe other ApoE receptors, such as ApoER2, VLDLR, and LDLR in this analysis. We first validated these proteomic data by affinity isolating FLAG-neuroproteasomes as well as cytosolic FLAG-
57lp | 209
ukth | 210
kpvt | 211 proteasomes and then immunoblotting these samples. Here, we validate our proteomic data by also identifying robust co-purification of ApoE and Lrp1 with the FLAG-neuroproteasome (Fig 1F).

4exe | 215 ApoE isoforms differentially modulate neuroproteasome surface localization in vivo
0myz | 216
xh3i | 217 ApoE can be expressed as one of three isoforms in human: ApoE4, ApoE3, and ApoE2, each of 218 which differs by only one or two residues. We next tested whether ApoE isoforms could
syiw | 219 differentially modulate neuroproteasome localization and function. We obtained human ApoE
kg3t | 220 isoform knock-in (KI) mice, where the entire coding region for the Apoe gene was replaced with
lvae | 221 a cassette encoding the three human Apoe loci, generating a fully humanized ApoE protein(52).
o9sc | 222 These mice therefore only express the ApoE2, ApoE3, or ApoE4 isoforms. hApoE-KI mice were
121u | 223 perfused and then hippocampus and primary motor cortex (PMC) were microdissected and
zh03 | 224 subjected to surface biotinylation and immunoblotting. We chose a limited survey of regions
1mvw | 225 based on their differential susceptibility to accumulate pathological hallmarks of AD
6d4s | 226 (hippocampus>PMC)(53, 54). We found a strong reduction of neuroproteasome surface
mqah | 227 localization in the hippocampus of ApoE4-KI mice, compared to ApoE3-KIs or ApoE2-KIs,
xxr8 | 228 measured by surface signal of 20S subunit ß5 (Fig 2A). We observe a significant difference
rl4j | 229 between ApoE3 male and female mice, where female ApoE3 mice have 50% fewer surface-
vz32 | 230 localized neuroproteasomes than male ApoE3 mice in hippocampus (Fig 2A). We find this
ncb0 | 23 noteworthy in the context of the extensive literature on the influence of biological sex on AD
8mp0 | 232 pathogenesis(36, 55-58). When we monitor neuroproteasome localization in the PMC from the
xjyk | 233 hApoE-KI mice, we find that neuroproteasome surface localization in ApoE4-KIs is reduced
mt0f | 234 compared to ApoE2-KIs and we observe a trend, but no significant change in ApoE4-KI
awab | 235 compared to ApoE3-KI (Fig S2A). These data may be attributable to differences in ApoE
ixcc | 236 expression in different brain regions(36, 52, 59), a dimension which we have not systematically investigated.
8p6h | 237
pmgl | 238
90no | 239 Given the region-specific effect of ApoE isoforms on neuroproteasome expression in vivo, we
jt0y | 240 approached the effect of ApoE isoforms and ApoE receptors in a more defined and tractable
qb7o | 241 primary neuronal culture system. Lrp1 was the only ApoE receptor that we identified in our neuroproteasome IP/MS dataset and we also found ApoE isoform-dependent modulation of Lrp1
oae5 | 242
s0fl | 243 levels (Fig S2B). Instead of testing the role for Lrp1 specifically, we tested the role for ApoE
43ia | 244 receptors in modulating neuroproteasome localization using the well-established pan-ApoE
3g2y | 245 receptor antagonist Receptor-associated protein (RAP) (60-62). We chose this strategy because 246 Lrp1 knockouts still contain small amounts of Lrp1 remaining in sporadic sets of neurons and
gc7v | 247 because of detrimental effects on neuronal health following Lrp1 knockdown(63, 64). We used a
wqfv | 248 variant of RAP (stable RAP) which contains a stabilizing mutation to protect against pH-induced 249 denaturation and maintains a higher percentage of internalized Lrp1, and presumably other ApoE
j30a | 250 receptors as well(60) (Fig 2B). We incubated primary neurons with purified stable RAP and
7bdk | 251 measured surface protein levels using surface biotinylation and immunoblotting. We find that stable RAP rapidly decreases the surface localization of Lrp1, as expected (Fig 2C). We also
fim0 | 252
ojro | 253 find that stable RAP reduces surface localization of neuroproteasomes (Fig 2C). These data 254 served as the first demonstration that ApoE receptors, such as Lrp1, can regulate
l6t9 | 255 neuroproteasome localization.
1ujy | 256
qzor | 257 ApoE is a lipoprotein, and in the brain is thought to be released by glia in the lipid-bound
a0by | 258 form(36, 52, 65, 66). We therefore next leveraged the primary culture system to determine
u1ky | 259 whether extracellular ApoE could modulate neuroproteasome localization and if the lipidation of 260 ApoE was important for this modulation. We generated primary neurons from either 20S-FLAG
htm9 | 26 transgenic animals or WT animals and conducted imaging and biochemical experiments to
8hul | 262 measure neuroproteasome localization. We conjugated recombinant ApoE isoforms with a
87vz | 263 mixture of POPC and Cholesterol (PC) and purified ApoE lipoproteins, referred to as PC-
ym66 | 264 ApoE2, E3, and E4. These lipoproteins were validated by SEC and negative stain EM (Fig S2C)
l0a3 | 265 and have been demonstrated to resemble the endogenous ApoE lipoproteins observed in the
u8nw | 266 brain(67). DIV13 primary neurons from 20S-FLAG transgenic mice were incubated with
l2v9 | 267 unconjugated or PC-conjugated ApoE for 24 hours and then subjected to surface biotinylation.
afbe | 268 We find that PC-ApoE, and not the unconjugated versions, modify neuroproteasome surface
78r8 | 269 localization with the rank order PC-ApoE4<Vehicle,PC-ApoE3<PC-ApoE2 (Fig 2D). We find
320g | 270 no change in other membrane proteins such as GluN1, which has previously been shown not to
tp8g | 27 change in an ApoE isoform-dependent manner(68, 69). The lipoprotein-dependent effect on
gxfd | 272 neuroproteasome localization requires ApoE, as the addition of just the liposomes without ApoE 273 does not modify neuroproteasome localization (Fig 2D). We find similar results in primary WT neurons, suggesting that the observed ApoE-isoform dependent effect on localization is not an artifact of the FLAG epitope tag on neuroproteasomes (Fig S2D).

9g22 | 277 FLAG-neuroproteasomes are a useful tool to measure the surface localization of
41fx | 278 neuroproteasomes and we next took advantage of the epitope tag to test whether ApoE isoforms
7um8 | 279 modified the subcellular distribution and localization of neuroproteasomes in intact neurons. We
uow2 | 280 used antibody feeding onto live neuronal cultures from the 20S-FLAG mice transduced with
iat7 | 281 AAVs to express Cre(70, 71). No staining was observed using secondary alone controls (Fig
ywwr | 282 S2E) or when feeding an antibody against intracellular protein MAP2 (Fig S2F). After live cell
0i6j | 283 anti-FLAG antibody feeding, neurons were fixed, permeabilized, and stained for total
87cq | 284 intracellular MAP2 to label dendrites. Consistent with this approach being a robust measure of
0qs3 | 285 neuroproteasome localization (Fig S2G), we observed punctal neuroproteasome localization 286 when feeding anti-FLAG antibodies, of which more than 90% was within 2 um of the MAP2
z8f7 | 287 signal. We observe significant overlap of surface FLAG signal with MAP2-positive protrusions that resemble dendritic spines (Fig 2E). We observe that PC-ApoE2 increases neuroproteasome surface localization by nearly twofold and that PC-ApoE4 reduces neuroproteasome surface
7w7j | 288
51vd | 289
baj1 | 290 localization by nearly threefold compared to PC vehicle or PC-ApoE3 controls (Fig 2E). In total,
n1wo | 291 these data recapitulate the observations from the hApoE-KI mice and support our hypothesis that extracellular ApoE isoforms can influence neuroproteasome localization and function.

rsbu | 294 Neuroproteasome localization is reduced in vulnerable brain regions in the human brain and is further reduced by ApoE4 genotype
magd | 295
tb74 | 296
8l69 | 297 We next tested whether ApoE-dependent mislocalization of neuroproteasomes is observable in 298 postmortem patient tissues. For these analyses, we studied a cohort of 19 individuals (14
1jyv | 299 ApoE3/3 and 5 ApoE4/4) from the Massachusetts General Hospital Brain Bank. The ApoE3/3
olce | 300 subgroup was subdivided into 5 negative diagnoses and 9 positive diagnoses for AD. Sex was
erx1 | 301 evenly distributed in samples except for the ApoE4 cases which were all male. This design
b3bt | 302 allows us to compare the effect of AD on neuroproteasome localization as well as the effect of
0w8m | 303 ApoE genotype on neuroproteasome localization. We obtained material from the Brodmann Area
vcu3 | 305 (BA4 - primary motor area) and BA7 (parietal associative area). We analyzed these regions as a means of untangling how neuroproteasome localization changes in a limited survey of severely pathologically affected (BA7) versus less affected (BA4) regions of the brain. Tissue from BA7
hjzj | 304
j79f | 306
6tbv | 307 contained severe tangle and amyloid pathology as well as neuronal loss whereas tissue from BA4
xb13 | 308 had moderate amyloid pathology but not tangle accumulation or neuronal loss. For simplicity,
cxqi | 309 we will refer to BA7 as tissue with severe pathology and BA4 as tissue with mild pathology. We
qfmx | 310 fractionated these samples to remove nuclei, mitochondria, and cytosol, enriching for plasma
rut3 | 312 membranes and detergent-insoluble proteins. We monitored the success of our fractionation
m3cp | 311
mq4s | using LLVY-based proteasome activity assays out of the supernatant of our washes and
95el | 313 continued washing our plasma membrane preparations until cytosolic proteasomes were undetectable (Fig 3A).
a0a5 | 314
gocl | 315
ob1z | 316 We then subjected plasma membrane/aggregate fractions to quantitative TMT proteomics
m4cb | 317 analysis. TMT proteomics enables unbiased quantification of the proteome and the ability to
m61y | 318 make quantitative comparison across samples. We compensated for brain region and individual
u2ob | 319 variability in two ways: by first normalizing protein loading into the mass spectrometer and then
2gnm | 320 normalizing the collected data against the total TMT signal per patient sample. This total TMT
emgw | 321 signal normalization provides the highest confidence metric for protein abundance normalization
xaqt | 322 across all samples. Given the number of samples, we combined three TMTpro 16-plex
5rcb | 323 experiments with a shared internal standard which enabled quantitation across TMT experiments.
524j | 324 We first performed a series of quality control checks to ensure that these data provided reliable
xd3m | 325 and reproducible measures. First, these data validate our plasma membrane enrichment protocol 326 - we find a significant enrichment for membrane-bound and membrane-associated proteins and a strong depletion of cytosolic proteins, including the 19S cap (Table S2). Second, consistent with previous global proteomic analysis from AD brains, we find a significant increase of C4b(72),
8qb6 | 327
wkbn | 328
ftfg | 329 AnxA1(73), Gpnmb(74), and Tau (Mapt)(75) in AD brains compared to unaffected controls (Fig
7xi5 | 330 3B). Third, we also find a significant decrease in Vgf(76) and Slc30A3(77) consistent with 331 previous AD global proteomic datasets (Fig 3B). We expect to find aggregated proteins using 332 this protocol since our plasma membrane enrichment method would also isolate large aggregates 333 such as aggregated Tau in the AD brain.
w8r5 | 334
ybik | 335 After validating our approach, we next analyzed the effect of AD on neuroproteasome
gii5 | 336 localization, measured by the relative quantity of 20S proteasome subunits in our quantitative
q5eu | 337 mass spectrometry dataset. First, in comparing AD samples to cognitively normal controls, we
a7ao | 338 find a striking reduction in nearly every 20S proteasome subunit in the plasma membrane
29a3 | 339 fraction from BA7 tissue (Fig 3B, Table S2). We next sought to determine whether ApoE
sb1e | 340 genotype influenced neuroproteasome localization in human tissue. Given the significant effect
w2yn | 341 of AD on neuroproteasome localization, we constrained the analysis only to the effect of ApoE 342 genotype on neuroproteasome localization by comparing the ApoE4/4 AD cohort against the
ap6l | 343 ApoE3/3 AD cohort. We observe a clear trend of reduced 20S proteasome subunits in the
iest | 344 membrane fraction in the ApoE4 genotype compared to ApoE3 genotype in the BA7 vulnerable 345 brain region (Fig 3C, Table S2).
cox8 | 346
ppqi | 347 To validate our proteomics data, we monitored surface localization of neuroproteasomes by
oxou | 348 immunoblot analysis. We controlled for sample loading by normalizing against Kv1.2, a protein
495n | 349 whose expression has been reproducibly demonstrated as unchanged in the AD brain(78-80).
awri | 350 While this strategy is required for loading controls by immunoblot, these loading controls line up
bl28 | 351 with the normalization strategy for mass spectrometry based on the total amount of TMT signal
