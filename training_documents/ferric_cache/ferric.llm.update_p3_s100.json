Analysis of the timecourse for cWP-bound oxy-AspB formation and decay at four hundred forty nanometers required fitting to a three summed exponential. A single rate of formation approximately twenty-eight point one per second and two decay phases (two point two and zero point zero four per second) represent the primary decomposition of the oxy-ferrous species to the initial LS-species and the subsequent slower generation of the enzyme-substrate complex. Evaluation of the kinetics of oxy formation and decay with varying oxygen concentrations show that only the first kinetic phase (oxy-formation) is oxygen-dependent as expected, while the latter phases are independent of oxygen concentration. Further comments on the assignment of each of these phases are provided in the Supporting Information Methods.\n68xu | The direct transition of ferric to a pure LS species is atypical for substrate-bound CYPs and suggests a process that is more complex than autoxidation. Nonetheless, we have previously observed similar behavior in the hydrogen peroxide-dependent CYP OleT. In that case, autoxidation, which ultimately\nhd35 | furnishes hydrogen peroxide, can react with the ferric-heme to initiate catalysis. However, AspB is unable to effectively metabolize cWP using a peroxide-shunt pathway, and the inclusion of catalase did not alter the kinetic behavior for oxy-decomposition, unlike what was found for OleT. Another notable deviation from typical CYP behavior is seen when comparing the decay rates of the oxy-complex for the substrate-bound and free enzyme. In the absence of the substrate, AspB-oxy decays directly back to the ferric resting state. For many CYPs, a bound substrate typically extends the lifetime of the first dioxygen intermediate, occasionally upward of one hundred-fold, thus allowing second electron transfer event to occur and minimizing the generation of reactive oxygen species. However, there is no significant difference in the decay rate constants for AspB decomposition in the presence or absence of the substrate (two point two plus or minus zero point three per second for substrate-free oxy).\n2zpk | N-Methylated Substrate Derivative Stabilizes the Oxy Complex. We synthesized a substrate derivative where the indole nitrogen was methylated, termed N1-methyl cWP, as computational studies by Sherman and colleagues have suggested that DKP-dimerization by AspB may be afforded by primary indole N-H abstraction. AspB displayed very similar binding characteristics and maximal spin-state conversion with N1-methyl cWP. The crystal structure of N1-methyl cWP-bound AspB was solved to one point eight six Angstrom resolution. As in the crystal structure of AspB bound to cWP, two molecules of N1-methyl cWP are found bound in the active site in close vicinity to the heme cofactor. The first substrate molecule, shown in blue, displays some minor structural differences from that of the native substrate. This substrate molecule loses some of the concavity seen with the native substrate, and the DKP nitrogen is no longer within hydrogen bonding distance of the heme propionate group as is seen in the crystal structure with cWP. Nonetheless, the introduced methyl-group is oriented roughly four Angstroms from the heme-iron in a position that would appear primed for oxidation (e.g., hydroxylation followed by spontaneous demethylation) by an activated oxygen species if it was generated. The second substrate molecule, shown in light green, binds very similarly to what was observed in the crystal structure of the native substrate. High-performance liquid chromatography characterization of AspB turnover with N1-methyl cWP revealed that the substrate analog was highly inhibitory and only produced a very minor amount of a demethylated dimerized product with an m over z equals five hundred seventy-nine.\nepu7 | As AspB appears unable to effectively metabolize the N-methylated substrate despite a similar binding mode, we compared the spectral and kinetic characteristics for oxy-AspB decay in the presence of N1-methyl cWP. Dramatically different kinetic behavior was observed, as the oxy-complex decayed directly to a mixture of ferric HS/LS states with a composition that was identical to the resting substrate-bound state with clearly defined isosbestic points for the transition. While the formation of AspB-oxy was significantly faster in the presence of N1-methyl cWP (two hundred thirty-eight per second) with an on rate for oxygen binding roughly three-fold higher than with cWP, the decay kinetics were much slower than cWP and dominated by the amplitude of the slow phase. The rates of both decay phases closely resembled formation of the E-S complex monitored at three hundred ninety nanometers, unlike what was observed with cWP. Thus, alteration of the indole\n7od1 | moiety of the substrate reverts AspB to the typical autoxidation behavior characteristic of most CYPs.\n0bqy | Provision of a Second electron Is Not Required for Catalysis. Taken together, the unusual behavior for the decay of the AspB-oxy complex in the presence of cWP as well as the inverse kinetic solvent isotope effect on product formation prompted us to examine the possibility that the generation of CYP-I may not be required for catalysis. The dithionite-reduced E-S complex was exposed to oxygen, and samples were then analyzed for product formation. It is unlikely that excess dithionite would be able to effectively reduce the oxy complex, as CYPs prototypically require an allosteric effector role provided by a biological redox partner for efficient second electron transfer. Nevertheless, we further excluded this possibility through the removal of excess dithionite by anaerobically desalting the E-S complex following reduction such that only one electron equivalent was provided. Irrespective of this chromatographic step, we observed the efficient formation of a product with identical retention time, UV-absorption profile and mass over charge as",
