You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

jc47 | Although a similar pattern for stability within the inter- nalizing and externalizing subgroups was observed earlier, the homotypic continuity we observe is lower than previ- ously reported [7]. Most notably, a larger number of chil- dren from the internalizing and externalizing subgroups in early or late childhood transitioned to the no problems group over time, suggesting that for many children symptoms of psychopathology during childhood are a transient phase of development. The differences in homotypic continuity might reflect actual differences between the samples used, but are also likely to be partially dependent on the differences in how psychopathology is reported on the CBCL used here and the Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA) used in earlier work [27]. Whereas the CBCL is a continuous measure of psychopathology, the DAWBA is a structured
ko3c | clinical interview to diagnose psychopathology. Because of our use of continuous measures, the internalizing and externalizing subgroup consists of children with mostly subclinical symptoms. Possibly, homotypic continuity is higher for those with clinical diagnoses than for those with subclinical symptoms. It would thus be interesting to study whether the initial level of symptoms is predictive of the likelihood that children have persistent problems in a sample enriched for children with subclinical and clinical levels of psychopathology.
xek3 | Consistent with earlier literature and the conceptualiza- tion of the DP, we found that the prevalence of the dysregu- lation profile is highest in late childhood, after which there is a decline into adolescence [28]. Regarding the development of DP symptoms, we show that those children who already exhibit internalizing or externalizing symptoms are most likely to transition to the DP. However, similar to earlier work, and in line with decreasing prevalence of DP with age, few children transition to the DP after late childhood. Those who are in the DP in early adolescence largely origi- nated from the externalizing and DP subgroups. Notably, the homotypic continuity of the DP decreases between late childhood and early adolescence. Together with the decrease in prevalence, this implies that, for most individuals, psycho- pathology becomes more clustered within the internalizing or externalizing domain. Despite this decrease in homotypic continuity, our results support the evidence that the DP is an at-risk state for persistent psychopathology, in which the risk of persistence increases with the age at which the DP is exhibited [2, 3, 5]. Where between early and late child- hood, 23% of those children that are in the DP transitioned to the no problems group, only 9% of children in the DP transitioned to the no problems group between late child- hood and early adolescence. Thus, children exhibiting DP symptoms in late childhood are an optimal target for future intervention studies, as those children are likely to benefit most from early treatment.
bbpr | The strengths of our study include the large sample size and the longitudinal design embedded within a population- based cohort. Moreover, using data-driven approaches, namely LPA and LTA, we were able to separately measure psychopathology in a more integrated way, compared to assessing individual traits that are likely correlated. Despite these strengths, this study should be considered in light of some limitations. First, we included parental report of child behavior only, other informants (self-report, teacher report) may provide other valuable insights into the development of childhood psychopathology. Unfortunately, we do not have parallel repeated measures of other informants. Second, at T1, the CBCL version 1.5-5 was used, where for those that were older than 5 years of age at assessment, the CBCL ver- sion 6-18 would have been more appropriate. At the time of data-collection the decision to use the version 1.5-5 was
5zyf | made to maintain consistency with earlier waves of data- collection not included in the current study. Third, at T2, fit indices provided almost equal support for a four and five profile fit (Supplementary Table 2). However, after visual inspection of the profiles that emerged from our LPA with 5 subgroups, the additional subgroup seemed to be a mix of children with internalizing problems and children with the DP (Supplementary Fig. 1). This was further supported by the results that we obtained from rerunning the LTA with 5 profiles at T2. Most children that were included in the additional fifth profile transitioned to either the internalizing subgroup or the DP at T3 (Supplementary Table 7).
9own | We present both the prevalence and characteristics of psychopathology subgroups and the stability and change that children exhibit in their behavioral development across childhood and adolescence in a large, longitudinal population-based study. Our findings suggest that for many children, internalizing and externalizing problems can be considered a transient phase of development, but that for externalizing problems the predictive value of persistent problems increases with age. Children classified in the DP in late childhood are much more likely to have psychopa- thology later and the divergence to more specific patterns of psychopathology begins in early adolescence.
bqfb | Summary
wwdt | In summary, we assessed both the stability and nature of change in symptoms of psychopathology from childhood into early adolescence. Using data-driven methods, latent profile analysis (LPA) and latent transition analysis (LTA), we estimated psychopathology subgroups and the transi- tion probabilities between the different psychopathology subgroups and the no problems subgroup. Similar to earlier work both within our sample and in other samples [6, 7, 13], we identified four behavioral subgroups; including 'no prob- lems' (T1: 85.9%, T2: 79.0%, T3: 78.0%), 'internalizing' (T1: 5.1%, T2: 9.2%, T3: 9.0%), 'externalizing' (T1: 7.3%, T2: 8.3%, T3: 10.2%) and a 'dysregulation' profile (DP) (T1: 1.7%, T2: 3.5%, T3: 2.8%). Many children who were clas- sified in the internalizing and externalizing subgroup tran- sitioned to the no problems subgroup later in development. However, those classified in the DP in late childhood were likely to have persistent psychopathology, with 91.4% being in either the internalizing, externalizing or DP subgroup in early adolescence. This supports evidence that, for some children, internalizing and externalizing problems can be a transient phase of development, whereas the DP is a severe at-risk state for persistent psychopathology.
