You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

a0mb | Physical Factors
ki8m | Any animal that is to be an effective pollinator must have the ability to passively pick up pollen as its body moves past the anthers of a flower that it visits and carry that pollen to another flower. Normally this will be aided by the animal being a good physical fit in terms of size and shape, so that in alighting on the flower surface, or when inserting its tongue or beak of appropriate length, some specific part of its body touches the anther. Additionally pollen pickup and car- riage will be aided if the animal has appropriate sur- face structures; pollen adheres well to feathers, fur, and hairy or scaly surfaces in insects but does not get transported well on shiny or waxy surfaces (and may even be damaged by certain surface secretions). Hence a small shiny beetle taking some nectar by crawling into the lower surface of a large tubular corolla where the anthers are in the corolla roof may well be a regu- lar visitor to that flower but is unlikely to be an effec- tive mover of its pollen; in effect, it is acting as a "cheat" as far as the flower is concerned and may be termed an illegitimate visitor.
km8w | Behavioral Factors
wzno | Different animals land on and forage at flowers in very different fashions. There are many aspects of behavior that will affect whether a given animal is going to be a good pollinator. Pollinators will seldom have a com- plete perception of all the aspects of plant presentation mentioned above, but they will respond to at least some of them in ways that are useful to the plant:
xagm | 1. Their choices of places and times to visit, and ex- actly which flowers to visit, will be critical. Visits occurring before dehiscence (the splitting of the anthers to reveal the pollen) or after pollen deple- tion are normally of no value to the flower in ful- filling its male role, and visits before or after the stigma is receptive to incoming pollen are of no value to the flower in its female role.
iwn5 | 2. Their handling of the flowers affect their pollen pickup and deposition characteristics; ideally they should receive pollen at a specific site on their bodies, and one that is also a good site for subse- quent deposition of that pollen onto a stigma.
uooz | 3. Their handling time per flower affects how many flowers are visited in a given time.
pxbq | 4. Their speed and directionality of movement be- tween plants affect pollen dispersal.
jfsr | 5. They should not be too efficient at grooming off the pollen, or indeed at eating it.
u15r | 6. Their flower constancy, that is, the likelihood that they will move to another flower of the same spe- cies, is perhaps most critical. If they innately or by learning prefer a particular flower phenotype, their high constancy will usually ensure that they move neatly and sequentially among conspecific flowers, not wasting pollen by depositing it in the wrong species. Constancy to a flower (considered in detail in chapter 11) gives economies to the vis- itor also; it may minimize travel distances, han- dling times, and learning effort and maximize pol- len packing.
lq35 | Behavioral factors such as these are often the key to being a good pollinator and of course are affected by the animals' abilities to learn as they become more ex- perienced as foragers. The ability to form a search im- age or to respond consistently to other cues, associat- ing particular signals with the presence of food, hones their foraging ability and can cement their relation- ships with particular flowers. Hence later chapters of this book, in considering particular groups of animals that visit flowers, include careful consideration of their sensory and learning capacities.
3g9w | Physiological Factors
d09o | Animals have differing physiological strategies and constraints, and these too can affect their energetic needs and thence their flower-visiting patterns, as will be discussed in chapter 10. Most animals (including nearly all invertebrates, and therefore many of the in- sect flower visitors) lack elaborate internal physiologi- cal regulatory systems, and their thermal balance and water balance are strongly influenced by environmen- tal conditions. They cannot function if they are too hot or too cold or are short of water, and must forage in times and places that provide suitable microclimates, using the sun's radiation to warm up by basking, or shady places to cool down again, and seeking (usually) sites that are relatively humid. However, birds and bats are physiologically more sophisticated and can regu-

a3td | late their body temperature and water balance more precisely; they generate heat internally through their own metabolism (endothermy) and regulate their own body fluids with efficient skin exchanges, respiratory controls, and excretory organs. They can in principle forage at almost any time and in any habitat, though they may still conserve their own energy by picking more equable sites.
ex5k | The distinction does not lie exactly between the vulnerable invertebrates and the highly regulated birds and mammals, however. It is now clear that a rather small proportion of insects can also show endothermy, at least some of the time when they need to warm up in the absence of solar inputs (chapter 10); this applies especially to most bees, a few hoverflies, some large moths, and some beetles, occurring more sporadically in other groups. It is perhaps no coincidence that endo- thermic abilities in insects are most common in the flower-visiting groups, which have access to ready fuel supplies in the form of nectar but which may also need to compete for that nectar in the cool of early mornings or at dusk.
9d4o | Given the list of factors that can turn a visitor into a good pollinator, two obvious points should emerge:
cjq2 | 1. A great many of the animals that go to flowers for a short drink of nectar may be rather poor at pollinat- ing that flower. Those with a poor physical fit, those that cheat, and those with little or no flower constancy are likely to be especially ineffective.
5esx | 2. Of all the visitors, bees are likely to be especially good as pollinators. They rely solely on flowers for food, both as adults and as larvae, and so must visit more flowers than any other animals. Their sizes, hairy surfaces, and variably long tongues, their excellent learning abilities, communication systems and floral constancy, and their endothermic capacities all equip them to visit flowers efficiently (from their own per- spective) and effectively (from the plant's point of view). Although they are sometimes described as pol- len wasters (because they, or rather their offspring back at the nest, eat so much of the pollen that they pick up), they are by far the most important pollinators in most ecosystems, and they do achieve high pollen export from visited flowers (Harder and Wilson 1997); plants have adapted over evolutionary time to make
m5ka | 8 . Chapter 1
byu8 | best use of them by providing more than enough pol- len to cater for their needs and ensure that sufficient pollen still commonly reaches other flowers.
76b0 | 5. Costs, Benefits, and Conflicts in Animal Pollination
zxz6 | Plants with hermaphrodite flowers benefit greatly be- cause a single animal visit can allow both pickup of pollen and its deposition on a stigma, fulfilling both the male and female functions of that flower at the same time. Animals benefit greatly by finding easily acquired foods, both sugary (nectar) and often also proteinaceous (pollen). Pollination by animals may therefore be a mutualism, of benefit to both partici- pants, but it is not altruistic; for the animals, pollina- tion of the flowers they forage at is almost always just an irrelevant by-product. In fact the plant and animal have a conflict of interest, often with adaptation and counteradaptation going on from both sides through evolutionary time to try and get a bigger share of the benefits. So the situations that we see now are the end products of the long and sometimes quite duplicitous associations of flowers with animals.
xnth | The plant ideally wants a visitor that is cheap to feed, alighting only briefly, moving on rapidly to an- other plant, and being faithful to its chosen plant spe- cies; so ideally, the forager should be chronically un- derfed and continuously on the move. But (again ideally) the animal would prefer to be as well fed and lazy as possible, getting as much food as it can from one flower with minimum energy expenditure, being relatively sedentary, and then moving on to any other nearby flower with copious nectar, whatever its spe- cies (although we already noted that some degree of fidelity may improve its foraging efficiency).
vafm | Hence, although there are obvious benefits to both partners, there are potentially clear costs as well. The plant has to invest in attractants (its carbon and nitro- gen resources are used to make flamboyant petals, pig- ments, and chemical scents), as well as mere rewards. If the plant reduces its rewards too far, the animal may not get enough food and will give up on that species. The plant generally also has to compete with other plant species for pollination, to obtain a share of the "good" pollinators, so it cannot afford to skimp on its offerings too much if it is growing within a reasonably diverse plant community. Many plants also have to
2zmw | offset the additional costs of animal exploiters: those visitors who take rewards without pollinating (thereby cheating, chapter 24) and the flower eaters (florivores) or foliage herbivores also attracted by the pollination cues (chapters 25 and 26). For the animals, there may be costs linked to carrying the pollen they have inad- vertently picked up (sometimes it is very unwieldy and can interfere with their wings or legs or sense organs), which may favor animals trying to cheat, and there may be costs also from the potential risks of predation or parasitism at flowers, since enemies can use them as a place to find prey or hosts reliably (chapter 24). There are also costs arising from the tendencies of the plants to cheat (chapter 23) by offering no real reward and sometimes by trapping the animal.
bf9k | 6. Why Is Pollination Worth Studying?
otkr | Pollination ecology can provide almost unparalleled insights into evolution, ecology, animal learning, and foraging behavior (fig. 1.2). It is perhaps the best of all areas to see and understand some basic biological pro- cesses and patterns; studies that deal exclusively with pollination biology have often had major impacts on general ecological and evolutionary theory.
ibgs | Pollination interactions often show us evolution by natural selection in action almost before our eyes and provide some very clear-cut examples of adaptive ra- diation and, perhaps, of plant speciation. They are particularly useful for studying coadaptations (co- evolution), because such interaction often involve rel- atively few organisms interacting with relatively high interdependence and incorporating the most funda- mental of phenomena (reproduction for the plant, food supply for the animal). There are selection pressures on each side of the partnership, offering hopes that ef- fects at the basic level of male and female gene flow can be quantified, sometimes (in crop pollination espe- cially) on a time scale that can be detected within one scientist's period of study.
colo | In terms of ecology, the study of pollination sheds light on how different organisms interact and affect each other, especially the competitive effects of plants upon each other, and on the various levels of interac- tions of plants with pollinators, including resource al- location, competition, exploitation, and simply cheat- ing. In the last two decades there has been an increasing stress on community-level interactions in pollination

9mrz | biology, now seen as an especially useful (because highly quantifiable) arena for more general work on community structures (J. Thomson 1983); so this book inevitably considers the community ecology of polli- nation, especially in later chapters.
pk06 | Pollination biology also gives exceptional insight into the ecology of reproductive strategies and the complexities of sex and reproduction. Flowers usually are hermaphrodites, but they have many ways of orga- nizing their sex life sequentially or spatially to maxi- mize their reproductive output and fitness. This book contains rather little coverage of plant reproductive strategies beyond the basics, because the field has now become dominated by theory and modeling, and the topic has also been extensively and recently reviewed in other works (e.g., Harder and Barrett 2006).
7wn9 | In the realm of animal behavior some key influ- ences can be especially easily measured and manipu- lated with flower visitors, and it is no accident that much of the key work on visual discrimination, learn- ing behaviors, and above all optimal foraging has used pollinators, especially bees. Optimal diet theory can model how animals should behave in an environ-

caos | ment offering different proportions of alternative prey as potential food items of differing value (also taking into account factors such as conspicuousness and dif- ferent variances). The theory predicts that a range of outcomes from complete specialization on one kind of prey item to complete generalization on all possible items is to be expected, even from the same animal, as the prey parameters are varied. Substituting "flower" for "prey item" (and with the immense advantage of very easily quantified caloric rewards from nectar), it is not unexpected that pollinators similarly turn out to show almost the full range of possible foraging behav- iors. Furthermore, they have proved ideal subjects with which to develop foraging models that can take into account different constraints on the foraging animals, whether from different physiological limits or from different cognitive skills. Learning ability is especially needed where resources are of intermediate predict- ability (Stephens 1993): that is, too unpredictable over one or a few generations for fixed behavior patterns to be favored, but not so greatly unpredictable that an in- dividual cannot track the changes. This exactly applies to floral resources, so that we should expect flower

pn9j | visitors from any taxon to be good learners. Fortunate- ly this is also readily tested with real or model flowers where just one trait at a time can be varied or associa- tions of traits compared; again, social bees are ideal animals to work with, reliably emerging from their nests and traveling straight to the flowers provided, then displaying clear choices between alternative flowers.
1pmc | For all these reasons, and with the added concern over human-induced effects on pollinator services in rela- tion to biodiversity and to crops, interest in pollination ecology has burgeoned in the last ten to fifteen years, and the subject is attracting strong interest beyond the traditional academic centers of the developed world, giving us valuable insights into more varied habitats in Asia, Africa, and South America and into a greater di- versity of interactions. Increasingly these systems are being modeled, and our preconceptions (of these and of other kinds of mutualisms) are being challenged. But
