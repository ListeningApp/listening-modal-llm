You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

nav4 | (ii) How does processing change with context?
gem8 | We also can ask how processing changes in different contexts. Let us return to the Kosslyn et al. (1998) study of mental rotation, summarized above. In that paper, we collapsed over counterbalancing orders for the two types of stimuli, Shepard & Metzler (1971) shapes and drawings of hands. We later realized that there were ample subjects in each group (those receiving hands stimuli first and those receiving Shepard & Metzler stimuli first) for an analysis of each group separately. The most interesting finding here concerned the areas activated while subjects performed the Shepard & Metzler task. When the Shepard & Metzler task was the first one that the subjects

k78w | received, we found that the inferior parietal and dorso- lateral prefrontal cortex were activated, as well as the right angular gyrus. However, when the subjects received this same task just after having performed the hands task, we found strikingly different results. Not only were over ten areas activated, but many of these areas had previously been found to be involved in motor control. Perhaps most strikingly, we found activation in the primary motor cortex itself, area Ml. When we looked only at the data for the Shepard & Metzler task performed after the hands task, the data were in many ways similar to those for the hands rotation task itself.
g9du | Our interpretation of these, admittedly preliminary, results is that subjects could mentally rotate the Shepard & Metzler figures in two ways: they could imagine holding them and visualizing what would be seen if they twisted the forms around (i.e. a motor strategy, as has previously been documented (see, for example, Parsons 1987 a,b; Wexler et al. 1998)), or they could imagine that an external force caused the rotation. Apparently, depending on what the subjects had just done, they were biased to adopt one or the other strategy. Note that this interpretation in turn leads to additional studies, including purely behavioural ones. For example, if subjects did in fact use different strategies, different patterns of response times and errors should arise (see Parsons 1987a,b); in addition, we would expect interfer- ence if subjects are asked to rotate a knob the opposite way to which they are rotating their images (see Wexler et al. 1998). Thus, the neuroimaging results serve to generate testable hypotheses, which in turn will lead to additional findings that will influence our interpretation of those results.
f682 | If our present interpretation of these neuroimaging findings is correct, these results are sobering: subjects have always been doing something before coming in the laboratory. Moreover, slight differences in the way in which a task is described or the instructions are couched could have large effects on how the subjects approach a task. If so, then we would expect to see many apparently contradictory results in the literature, where different findings emerge from the 'same' task. A walk through a poster session at a neuroimaging meeting will probably suggest that this fear may be well grounded. To address this issue, we must first discover whether the central assumption is correct: differences in context (including instructions) can lead to large differences in performance. If so, we must next take care to replicate precisely other laboratories' experiments before varying the design in any way; otherwise, we shall never know exactly which features of the results reflect which differences in the design (including context, in the broadest sense).
li1k | (iii) How does processing depend on the goal and the prior sequence of processing?
pbea | Whether a particular process or structure will be invoked depends on the goal of processing and the specific processing that has already taken place. Thus, the last set of questions of this type addresses the principles by which specific sets of processes and structures come to work together. A crucial aspect of these questions focuses on temporal sequencing: When are processes evoked relative to each other? This type of question cannot be answered

0fpw | with PET, and at present probably cannot be answered easily with fMRI. However, if data from individual trials are time-locked with the onset of stimulus, and enough trials are collected, it is possible that slight differences in the rise time of the haemodynamic response can be captured by fMRI. At present, the best way to collect data about the temporal course of large-scale neural processing (i.e. the activation of processes and structures of the sort discussed here) involves combining PET or fMRI with electrical or magnetic measures, such as MEG. However, the linkage between the different types of data is by no means straightforward. Electrical measures are notoriously poor in their spatial resolution, and thus it is difficult to bring them into registration with data from PET and fMRI. And although MEG has high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution, it is limited to detecting signals from the sulci (because of the local geometry of the neural architecture that gives rise to magnetic signals). Another promising technique is to use TMS to disrupt processing in specific areas (first identified via fMRI or PET) at specific intervals after a stimulus has been delivered (see, for example, Ganis et al. 1999)
dqn8 | This sort of research depends strongly on prior research of the sort outlined in the first section of this paper; without a road map of areas that underlie performance of a class of tasks, one cannot know where to look for temporal signals or where to disrupt processing. At the time of this writing, this approach is in its infancy.
cop0 | 4. CONCLUSIONS
lhkq | I have tried to convey two overarching messages. First, the demonstration that a particular pattern of brain activity accompanies the performance of particular kinds of tasks is not, in and of itself, of great interest. Such data are only interpretable in the context of theories, which typically lead to specific hypotheses. Second, such theories can best be refined via a continual interplay between behavioural and neuroimaging studies, with results in each domain informing theory and further investigation in the other.
82ju | I have suggested that there are two general classes of questions that one can currently use neuroimaging to address: (i) how information processing gives rise to a particular ability, and (ii) when such processing is evoked. In addition, there are typically multiple sub- questions that one can ask within each general class. However, in every case there are crucial caveats. The interpretation of neuroimaging data is arguably more complex than the interpretation of behavioural data. One needs to be concerned not only about the nature of the task itself but also about the relation between perfor- mance and the underlying physiology. This job is all the more complex because we do not know whether increased rCBF (in PET) or signal strength (in fMRI) indicates excitation or inhibition, and we do not know the precise relation between these measures and cognitive work; moreover, this relation itself might be different for processes that have been used more or less frequently. Furthermore, the current resolution limitations prevent us from knowing how a given process actually works; we are stuck at the level of 'black boxes'.
y2qo | Nevertheless, neuroimaging is a valuable tool for those interested in the nature of mental processes. It can provide converging evidence that has several strengths. First, it provides additional information about the under- lying mechanisms themselves, about how different processes and structures work together. Second, such data are not easily explained as an artefact of experimental demand characteristics or the like; people rarely know how to manipulate voluntarily the level of rCBF in specific ROIs. Third, such data hold promise of providing a 'common language' for much of psychology. To the extent that we identify processing with brain regions, we then begin to see how a given process participates in conferring different abilities; this will provide crucial insights into what they have in common. Last, neuro- imaging offers a potential bridge between psychology and biology, and then in turn to biophysics and genetics. This is no small feat; if we can find a way in which to benefit by even a small amount from the bounty in those fields, we shall benefit greatly.
1piq | To ask questions well, we must rely on theories. One source of inspiration about how information processing is implemented in the brain comes from animal models (see, for example, Lueck et al. 1989). However, such models are inherently limited; non-human animals lack the rich conceptual and linguistic processing of humans (and probably even have restricted emotional reactions compared with us). An additional source of inspiration are the effects of brain damage on human behaviour and cognition. In both cases, facts about neuroanatomy, parti- cularly connectivity between areas, should have a crucial role in theory development. However, in the end we must pull ourselves up by our bootlaces. We must devise theories, test them, revise, and test again, keeping our eyes open for the unexpected all the while, just as in any other branch of science.
7fqw | Neuroimaging is an enormously exciting field because of the possibility of new discoveries about fundamental relations between mind and brain, and the chance to make concrete what have hitherto been very abstract ideas. However, if we are to do this correctly, we must know what questions we are asking and just how far we can go in answering them with these techniques. Simply finding that certain areas of the brain are active when someone performs a task is not enough.
