        "content": "gvwz | MPS are constructed to target states of small entropy by truncating the reduced density matrix to a dimension dim left parenthesis rho sub A right parenthesis is less than or equal to M, which yields an upper bound for the entanglement entropy of an MPS state, widetilde S equals ln M, a quantity on the order of one to ten for typical simulations. The bulk of FP states can be approximated by product states of sin negative one-half particles aligned to the axis of the magnetic field, and for those states, one finds S approximates zero up to small finite-size corrections. In contrast, for systems hosting a single quantum skyrmion, we obtain values for the entanglement entropy in the range zero point two is less than S is less than zero point seven, which demonstrates the presence of significant entanglement in the spin negative one-half quantum skyrmion and indicates that they cannot be expressed as a classical product state. Finally, in the HS phase, we find the strongest entanglement left parenthesis zero point seven is less than S right parenthesis. While we focus mainly on skyrmions with ferromagnetic exchange interaction left parenthesis J is less than zero, right parenthesis we find strong signatures of skyrmions and skyrmion lattices for antiferromagnetic exchange left parenthesis J is greater than zero right parenthesis as well. However, this phase differs from the ferromagnetic skyrmions and skyrmion lattices, most apparently in the entanglement, which is significantly larger. We postpone a detailed investigation of quantum skyrmions and skyrmion lattices for antiferromagnetic exchange couplings to future work.\nsk5m | The von Neumann entropy targets quantum correlations between a bipartition of the system but does not provide local information about the entanglement between individual spin one-half pairs. To access the spatial distribution of entanglement, it is therefore more convenient to calculate the concurrence C sub r sub one r sub two, defined for two lattice sites at positions r sub one and r sub two. For a generic state it can be expressed through the root of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian matrix R sub r sub one r sub two equals rho sub r sub one r sub two widetilde rho sub r sub one r sub two, where rho sub r sub one r sub two equalsmathrm tr sub r notin left bracket r sub one, r sub two right bracket left parenthesis rho right parenthesis is the reduced density matrix of the two sites r sub one and r sub two, and widetilde rho sub r sub one r sub two equals left parenthesis sigma sub y otimes sigma sub y right parenthesis rho sub r sub one r sub two sup asterisk left parenthesis sigma sub y otimes sigma sub y right parenthesis is a rotation of this reduced density matrix.

Using the concurrence, we obtain the space-resolved entanglement distribution between spin pairs in the different phases and present its qualitative distribution by green links in Figure five. For a more quantitative analysis, we differentiate between\nrzhj | B equals negative three D over four. concurrences of different ranges up to third-nearest neighbor in Table one.",
