You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

vmnz | · The Marks card (3) includes the controllers that are used to mark color, size, text label, and shape. In addition to this, the level of the Detail and Tooltip controllers allows you to control the appearance of the visualization. You can change the mark type for each individual axis as well as control the size, color, label, and shape. (Since the Marks card is critical to the function of the visualization, we will describe it in depth in the next section).
82g8 | . The Filters shelf (4) is where you put fields that you want to use to limit the values included in your visualization. After dragging a field onto the Filters shelf, you can select values in the dialog box of that data element's Filters shelf.
l3g2 | Chapter 2
5ah7 | . The Pages shelf (5) allows users to progress through your visualization based on the fields that you put on it. For instance, you can use a date field on the Pages shelf, and your users can click on changes over time without having to manually select the subsequent values.
cq8x | Using the Columns and Rows shelves
dxup | As discussed earlier, the fields that you place on the Columns and Rows shelves will appear either on the x and y axis, or the row or column headers of the visualization respectively. The following are a few new concepts related to the uses of these shelves:
0xhz | . Once a field is on the shelf, it is referred to as a pill, or an active field
thwq | · A pill on a shelf has a context menu
nmx1 | The context menu can be opened by clicking on the small arrow that point downwards.
ng95 | · Instances of fields that are discrete will appear in blue, and continuous fields will appear in green. The following is a description of both these fields:
ldw4 | ° Discrete fields have specific values, and the range of values is finite
gynb | ° Continuous fields, on the other hand, have an infinite range of values with infinite possibilities
yp2i | . The Information Lab blog does a great job explaining the differences in Tableau Public; you can have a look at the explanation by visiting http: / / www.theinformationlab.co.uk/2011/09/23/blue-things-and-green- things/
gm15 | . In case you have multiple pills on a shelf, the discrete pills appear first because they are used to group fields, and the continuous pills appear second because they are used to measure fields
uwgf | Tableau Public Interface Features
ai15 | The following screenshot shows an example of a basic graph that we created:
heo3 | In order to create the graph shown in the preceding screenshot, we will perform the following steps:
u2cj | 1. Drag Flight Date to the Columns shelf from the Dimensions pane.
aq9q | 2. Choose WEEKDAY as the part of the data that we want to show.
dc5c | 3. Add a set that we created that groups airlines by the criteria that we established.
9diq | Chapter 2
c10k | 4. When we drag the Flight Date field and the set to the Columns shelf, they both appear in the column headers. Drag the Delay minutes from the Measures pane to the Rows shelf.
f8yn | 5. When you do this, it defaults to aggregating as a SUM. Click on the Context menu of the pill and change the aggregation to Average.
ahrs | Next, we will discuss how to use the Marks card to add color and labels.
k7hf | Using the Marks card
wl64 | Another Tableau invention is the use of cards. Cards are containers for various controllers: which are dialogs in the Tableau workspace that allow various data elements and components to be configured. The most important card is the Marks card, which is in the most current version of Tableau Public. It has combined various controllers into one.
qrks | The Marks card is a compact yet highly functional area of the worksheet view that contains different controllers for data element chart properties (these data points on a chart are called marks). To use the Marks card, drag and drop data elements onto a corresponding shelf (such as Colors, Label, and Size). This will change the chart visualization by changing the chart mark properties.
m9te | The different controllers on the Marks card, which are commonly referred to as shelves, include the following:
qpsk | . Colors: This changes the colors of marks in the chart (such as bar or line colors). In our example, the Set that shows whether an airline is in the top five worst airlines according to their average delay time is on the Color shelf.
sx3l | · Size: This configures the sizes of data points or elements in charts.
zm2g | · Label/Text: This adds a label to the chart for data points, bars, groupings, or lines. In our example, the percentage difference in average delay time between the top five worst airlines and all the others is on the Label shelf.
ui7p | Tableau Public Interface Features
ubys | . Details: This adds details to the chart or data points, allowing you to keep the main structure of the chart. However, it further categorizes it in detail and with more granularity. For example, if we add Unique Carrier to the Detail shelf, our visualization will aggregate the average departure time by day for each Unique carrier, which means that there is now a bar segment for each carrier, and the story that our graph tells will change dramatically, as shown in the following screenshot:
hphn | . Tool Tip: This allows you to add context and calls to action, which are critical for telling stories because they instruct users how to progress to the next step and they better illustrate how a data point relates to a user's interests.
ves3 | · Shape: This sets the data point shape in the chart visualization.
h4py | . Path: This is typically used for routes on a map. This controller allows a path to be sequentially built and placed on a map visualization. This is commonly seen in tornado and hurricane tracking maps visualizations.
p612 | Chapter 2
2ll3 | Once a field is on a shelf on the Marks card, it shows up under the shelves with a small icon for the shelf type followed by the field name, as shown in the following screenshot:
roki | You can change the shelf on which a field is placed by clicking on the small icon and then selecting the shelf to which you'd like to move the field, as shown in the previous screenshot.
xzvf | The Filters and Pages shelves
vw6g | The Filters shelf is where you drag fields to limit the data points that your users see in your visualization. When you drag it to the Filters shelf, Tableau Public will prompt you to filter a field according to its type.
5ltn | You can also filter a visualization based on the inclusion in a Data set. If you want to show the filters to users, you can right-click on the fields in the data window to Show Quick Filters as well. We will describe filtering in depth in future chapters.
vqad | In the following screenshot, we have added WEEK(Flight Date) to the Pages shelf. The controller appears here. We can set the speed at which the visualization changes. In the Tableau Public desktop client, the visualization will progress sequentially once you click on the Play button. However, online, it will not progress automatically. Your user will need to click on the Play button to proceed.
2xj0 | Tableau Public Interface Features
567t | Since the functionality is limited online and that is where your users will interact with your work, we will condense the discussion of the Page shelf:
sk0p | The workspace control tabs of Tableau Public
vwq7 | The tabs at the bottom of the Tableau Public screen are either sheet or dashboard tabs. The tabs with a series of rows and a column on them are sheet tabs, where you can design objects that fit on one sheet. The tabs with a rectangle divided into four quadrants are dashboard tabs, where you can add one or more sheets in order to form a unified dashboard. When you click on one of the new (blank) worksheet or dashboard tabs, that tab opens and names the sheet or dashboard the next sequential name, such as Sheet 3 or Dashboard 2. The sheet or dashboard is blank when you first open a new tab.
beyn | Chapter 2
jwlq | A dashboard is really just a group of worksheets on the same page. You can assemble a dashboard after creating the various component worksheets that it will contain. Dashboards are assembled and configured by using the Dashboard tabs in Tableau Public, which are available in the lower row of the tabs in the Tableau Public interface.
