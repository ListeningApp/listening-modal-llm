You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

caos | Self-Esteem and Behavior Plasticity
qrvy | Research on self-esteem as a main effect has yielded weak and inconsistent results. To address this issue, Brockner (1988) developed behavior plasticity theory. This theory proposes that self-esteem moderates the rela- tionship between situational factors and individual behav- ior such that those with low self-esteem are more respon- sive to external cues (situational factors) than those with high self-esteem. Brockner gave three reasons for this relationship. First, low self-esteem individuals are less certain of their own beliefs and behaviors and are more influenced by their environments. Second, because low self-esteem individuals are dependent on others for posi- tive feedback, they respond to others by conforming in an attempt to gain approval. Finally, low self-esteem indi- viduals are especially sensitive to negative feedback. They tend to overgeneralize, apply the feedback broadly, and change their behavior in a variety of situations. In con- trast, those with high self-esteem are less influenced by situational factors and are more likely to exhibit behav- ioral autonomy.
pn9j | Many studies have demonstrated that self-esteem mod- erates the relationship between events and circumstances in the workplace. (e.g., Brockner, Derr, & Laing, 1987; Greenhaus & Badin, 1974; Korman, 1966, 1970; Pierce, Gardner, Dunham, & Cummings, 1993; Tharenou & Harker, 1984; Weiss & Knight, 1980). Mossholder, Be- deian, and Armenakis (1981, 1982), for instance, demon- strated that self-esteem moderated the relationship be- tween peer-group interaction and performance/tenure/ stress such that those with low self-esteem were more responsive to the elements in their work environment.
1pmc | Overall, the literature on self-esteem suggests that low self-esteem individuals tend to be more responsive to a
5z6q | variety of organizational stimuli including peer-group in- teraction, evaluative feedback, socialization, leadership influence, role strain, and work layoff. In contrast, those with high self-esteem are less responsive to external cues and influence. Applying this logic to our study, we hypoth- esized that self-esteem would moderate the link between situational factors and voice behavior. Individuals with low self-esteem should be more responsive to the contex- tual influence of group size and style of management ( self- vs. traditional management). More specifically, those with low self-esteem would be more sensitive to the diffusion of responsibility that typically occurs in large groups. They would feel less involved, less influential, and would be less willing to engage in challenging behavior such as voice. Thus, low self-esteem would enhance the negative relationship between group size and voice.
yeoh | Likewise, we hypothesized that the predicted relation- ship between style of management and voice will be stronger for those with low self-esteem. That is, those with low self-esteem will be more responsive to the personal responsibility, job complexity, and accountability of self- managed work teams and this will enhance their willing- ness to be proactive and exhibit voice. On the basis of the above we hypothesized the following:
b8hf | Hypothesis Sa. Voice will be an interactive function of self- esteem and group size such that the negative relationship between group size and voice will be stronger ( more nega- tive ) for individuals with low self-esteem relative to those with high self-esteem.
hntf | Hypothesis 5b. Voice will be an interactive function of self- esteem and self- versus traditional management such that the relationship between self-management and voice will be stronger (more positive) for individuals with low self- esteem relative to those with high self-esteem.
99fo | Satisfaction With the Group and Behavior Plasticity
y5r7 | Although behavior plasticity theory was developed by Brockner (1988) specifically to explain self-esteem by situational factor interactions, it also seems reasonable to propose that satisfaction may have plasticity characteris- tics. That is, just like for self-esteem, we suggest that satisfaction with the group will moderate the relationship between situational factors and individual behavior.
lrry | Satisfaction is based on individuals' assessment that they are fulfilling important values (Locke, 1976). Satis- faction with the group implies that individuals believe they are fulfilling their values, in part, through the group. They are attached to the group, the group is important to them, and they are willing to reciprocate by taking the time to develop and express ideas for change. Their behav- ior, therefore, is a function of their own values and their preference for fulfilling these values through their group.

fj24 | VOICE IN WORK GROUPS
uz3c | As such, they should be less sensitive to contextual factors and should not increase or decrease their voice in response to those factors. That is, highly satisfied group members will engage in voice regardless of the situation.
d5bi | In contrast, those who are less satisfied are also less attached and less dependent on the group. Their behavior in the group is not based on fulfilling their values through group involvement. Instead it is more a function of the characteristics of the situation. That is, situational factors are more salient to individuals who are less satisfied with their group and their behavior is more "plastic." There- fore, we expected individuals with low satisfaction to be more responsive to the conformity pressure, feelings of anonymity, and diffusion of responsibility that are charac- teristic of large groups. Similarly, we expected individuals with low satisfaction to be more responsive to feelings of accountability and personal responsibility that are charac- teristic of self-managed groups. In essence, we propose that low satisfaction magnifies the relationship between situational factors and voice. That is, low satisfaction strengthens the negative relationship between group size and voice and the positive relationship between style of management and voice. Accordingly, we hypothesized the following:
ba4l | Hypothesis 6a. Voice will be an interactive function of satisfaction with the group and group size such that the negative relationship between group size and voice will be stronger (more negative) for individuals who are less satisfied with their group relative to those who are more satisfied with their group.
ffx8 | Hypothesis 6b. Voice will be an interactive function of satisfaction with the group and self- versus traditional man- agement such that the positive benefit of self-management on voice will be stronger (more positive ) for individuals who are less satisfied with their group relative to those who are more satisfied with their group.
s6su | Summary
y219 | Consistent with the notion that voice in work groups is a function of more than just satisfaction, we have used theory and related empirical findings to hypothesize rela- tionships for two person-centered constructs ( satisfaction with the group and global self-esteem), two situational constructs (group size and style of management), and their interaction in expanding our understanding of the antecedents of voice. In the next section, we report a study that assessed these hypotheses using a construct valid measure of voice behavior.

jc47 | quently, we collected data from individuals in a broad range of jobs in a variety of organizations. This allowed us to rule out the possibility that results might be unique to a particular type of job or organization and would support generalization to a broad range of settings. We considered 74 firms in the Midwest as possible data collection sites and assessed each on four char- acteristics (likelihood of being able to study multiple groups from the same organization, likelihood of being able to study groups in which jobs were interdependent, likelihood that a personal contact would be willing to endorse the study, and our subjective assessment of the probability of successfully collect- ing data in the organization). On the basis of this analysis we contacted 44 firms and 21 (48%) agreed to participate, provid- ing us with access to 95 work groups that met our criteria for inclusion. We excluded temporary groups (i.e., task forces and committees ) and groups with low task interdependence where work was performed primarily by individuals working alone (i.e., bank tellers, research scientists with individual account- ability for projects, and sales personnel with individual incentive programs ). In summary, groups in the study were of an ongoing or permanent nature and composed of at least three employees in interdependent jobs who reported to the same supervisor. The resulting convenience sample consisted of data from 597 employees, their peers, and their supervisors from 95 work groups (median group size = 8) from 21 organizations. The data on voice behavior and respondent demographics were originally collected for cross-validation purposes as part of a larger con- struct validity study (Van Dyne & LePine, 1998). For the current study variables, we obtained complete data on 441 employees and conducted our analyses on these responses.
ko3c | Data were collected from employees in group meetings held at company facilities during normal working hours. Participants were told that their individual responses would remain confi- dential and that they could withdraw from the study at any time. Respondents completed questionnaires in the presence of a researcher and other group members to assure that all partici- pants were exposed to the same stimuli, had the same back- ground information on the study, and completed their question- naires under the same circumstances. On average, employees were 36 years of age and were employed by their organizations for 7 years. Women made up 54% of the sample and 44% had at least some college education. Respondents were all full time and 65% held manager or professional jobs.
xek3 | To ensure a stringent assessment of our hypotheses, we as- sessed voice 6 months after we obtained data on the predictors. Time 1 data collection included employee and supervisor ques- tionnaires. At Time 2, 4 peers rated each employee's voice behavior. Prior to the data collection meetings, group supervi- sors provided the researchers with names of all group members. We excluded temporary workers and employees who had been group members less than 3 months to ensure that group members had adequate knowledge to assess voice behavior. We prepared peer rating questionnaires in advance, by writing a specific peer's name on the top of each subsection of the peer report instrument. In groups that contained 5 or fewer employees, each group member described all peers. In groups of more than 5, we randomly selected which 4 peers' names were written on each questionnaire. We did this to avoid potential selection bias that might have occurred if respondents chose specific peers.

bqfb | This also provided a balanced design where each individual was described by an equal number of peers. The primary advantage of using peers as raters is that in most interdependent work groups there is daily interaction among peers that allows them to observe a wide range of behaviors under different circum- stances. Peer ratings, therefore, should be more reflective of behavior than self ratings ( which may be subject to self-presen- tation bias) and supervisor ratings (which may reflect atypical impression management behaviors; Eastman, 1994).
wwdt | Measures
mn1r | Voice. We measured voice at Time 2 with Van Dyne and LePine's (1998) 6-item scale, which itself was based on a modi- fication of the Van Dyne, Graham, and Dienesch (1994) Advo- cacy Participation Scale. Item anchors were 1 = strongly dis- agree to <LATEX>7 = \mathrm { s t r o n g } b</LATEX> agree. Items were prefaced by "This particular co-worker" and ended with (1) "develops and makes recommendations concerning issues that affect this work group"; (2) "speaks up and encourages others in this group to get involved in issues that affect the group"; (3) "communi- cates his/her opinions about work issues to others in this group even if his/her opinion is different and others in the group disagree with him/her"; (4) "keeps well informed about issues where his/her opinion might be useful to this work group"; (5) "gets involved in issues that affect the quality of work life here in this group"; and (6) "speaks up in this group with ideas for new projects or changes in procedures." We used the mean of the peer ratings to operationalize voice. Internal consistency and interrater agreement for the scale were high <LATEX>\left( \alpha = . 9 5 \right. ,</LATEX> mean
5vqw | <LATEX>r w g _ { 0 } = . 8 8 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. S D = . 2 0 \right) .</LATEX> Satisfaction with the group. We assessed satisfaction with the group with four items based on Kunin's (1955) Faces Scales. For each item, employees circled the number of the face <LATEX>\left( 1 = b i g \right.</LATEX> frown to <LATEX>\left. 7 = b i g \quad s m i l e \right)</LATEX> that best represented their feelings as a member of the work group. Example items include "Consider this work group. Select the face which best expresses how you feel about this work group here" and "Consider your co-workers. Select the face which best expresses how you feel about your co-workers here." Cronbach's alpha was .86.
meyw | Global self-esteem. We measured global self-esteem using Brockner's (1988) 17-item scale <LATEX>\left( 1 = n e v e r \right.</LATEX> to <LATEX>7 = a \ln a y s .</LATEX> Participants were asked to think of their overall life experiences and then indicate the extent to which they believed in statements such as "How often do you feel that you have handled yourself well at a social gathering?" and "How often do you have the feeling that you can do everything well?" Cronbach's alpha was .89.
2e62 | Situational measures. Supervisors provided information on group size (number of employees in the group) and style of management <LATEX>\left( 0 = t r a d i t i o n a l , 1 = s e l f \right) .</LATEX> Because the general context of work can effect attitudes and behavior, we controlled for the firm type <LATEX>\left( 0 = m a n u f a c t u r i n g , \right.</LATEX> 1 = nonmanufacturing) and firm size (number of employees in the organization).
75y3 | Demographic control variables. Employee questionnaires included demographic information that we used as controls in our analysis. Ascribed demographics included age (in years), gender <LATEX>\left( 0 = f e m a l e , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. 1 = m a l e \right) ,</LATEX> and ethnicity <LATEX>\left( 0 = n o n - W h i t e , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. 1 = W h i t e \right) .</LATEX> Achieved demographics included education
s2g2 | <LATEX>\left( 0 = \right.</LATEX> no college, 1 = at least some college), group tenure (number of years in the group), and job status <LATEX>\left( 0 = \mathrm { s u p p o r t } \right.</LATEX> staff, <LATEX>1 =</LATEX> manager or professional).
