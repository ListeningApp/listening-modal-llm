You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

oc99 | Different transformation-based unsupervised methods have been introduced. Some of them are kernel- and graph-based methods. Lately, rMKL-LPP (regularised multiple kernel learning for Locality Preserving Projections) (Speicher and Pfeifer, 2015) was implemented for clus- tering analysis. It used an individual kernel for each omics along with a graph embedding framework to identify biologically meaningful sub- groups for five different cancer types. Similarly, PAMOGK (Tepeli et al., 2019) is developed for integrating multi-omics data with pathways using graph kernel, SmSPK (smoothed shortest path graph kernel). It used somatic mutations, transcriptomics and proteomics data to find subgroups of kidney cancer.
gipz | Meta-SVM (Meta-analytic SVM) is proposed by Kim (Kim et al., 2017), which integrates multiple omics data and able to detect consensus genes associated with diseases across studies such as breast
b4wj | cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Recently, NEMO (NEighbor- hood based Multi-Omics clustering) (Rappoport and Shamir, 2019) is introduced which uses an inter-patient similarity matrix-based distance metric for evaluating the input omic datasets individually. These omics matrices are then combined into one matrix and then analysed using spectral-based clustering. It can work on partial data sets (no imputation needed), where measurements are only available for a subset of omics data.
5xlt | 5. Application of integrative methods in multi-omics studies
9bz4 | The availability of high-throughput omics provides a unique op- portunity to explore the complex relationships between different omics and phenotypic targets instead of mono-omics evaluation. This section describes various multi-omics studies which deployed methods investi- gated in the previous section. Table 8 summarises different phenotypic target-based, multi-omics studies published and tabulates them across the span of 7 main omics namely, genomics, transcriptomics, metab- olomics, proteomics, glycomics, lipidomics and epigenomics. Genomics is further divided into gene expression, DNA methylation, somatic point mutation and copy number alteration. Similarly, transcriptomics is further classed into lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) and microRNAs (mRNA and miRNA). The various multi-omics studies are broadly

pujl | grouped based on the target and the corresponding ML method used.
3rqe | It is evident from Table 8 that most of the multi-omics studies focus on different forms of cancer. In particular, the presence of many multi- omics studies related to the breast (Chen et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2017; List et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2016; Nam et al., 2009) and ovarian (Anděl et al., 2015; Mankoo et al., 2011; Paik et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2014) cancer highlights the research thrust by the scientific community in these domains.
nsi3 | Many intra-omics studies have successfully explored the integration of gene expression and DNA methylation. LASSO methods have been used for this particular integration by Taskesen (Taskesen et al., 2015) and Lee (Lee et al., 2017) for acute myeloid leukaemia and breast cancer respectively. LASSO has also been employed for cancer prognosis (Zhao et al., 2015). Similarly, mRNA - miRNA integration was investigated using Neural Fuzzy Network for colorectal cancer (Vineetha et al., 2013), SVM for pancreatic cancer (Kwon et al., 2015), and RF for cardiac tissue ageing (Dimitrakopoulos et al., 2014) and ovarian cancer (Anděl et al., 2015) respectively. SVM has also been used for oral squamous cell carcinoma study by integrating different transcriptomics namely mRNA, miRNA and IncRNA (Li et al., 2017).
nil3 | Metabolomics and proteomics have been integrated using RF for analysis of prostate cancer (Fan et al., 2011) and thyroid functioning (Pietzner et al., 2017). Similarly, metabolomics is integrated with mRNA for studying ulcerative colitis (Bjerrum et al., 2014) and cancer survival (Kim et al., 2014). On the other hand, glycomics and epigenomics have only appeared once in the multi-omics context (along with mRNA and metabolomics) and used by Zierer (Zierer et al., 2016) for the study of age-related comorbidities using a graphical variant of RF.
