You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

lhkq | I t is hard to know what to do about a world beset by struggles of ethnic na- tionalism, hardening of racial lines, and staggering divides between wealth and poverty. For my part as a teacher, I have to wonder at what we are to teach the young about such a world. How do we help them understand why differences of color and culture, gender and nationality continue to have such profound consequences? It won't do to fall back on the old lessons, to tell stu- dents that such differences are simply a fact of life, to tell them that the sus- picion and distrust with which these differences are often regarded are the product of sheer ignorance. They are unlikely to be reassured that only for want of an education much like the one they are receiving, the world suffers such discord and division. They might, however, appreciate how this faith in education would help teachers through their own day.
82ju | Perhaps it is time to turn the tables on education in trying to make sense of this divided world. After all, our schooling has not been so much the great redeemer of prejudices as the tireless chronicler of what divides us. Education is no small player in giving meaning to these differences. We are schooled in differences great and small, in borderlines and boundaries, in historical strug- gles and exotic practices, all of which extend the meaning of difference. We are taught to discriminate in both the most innocent and fateful ways so that we can appreciate the differences between civilized and primitive, West and East, first and third worlds. We become adept at identifying the distinguish- ing features of this country, that culture, those people. We are educated in what we take to be the true nature of difference. Yet if education can turn a studied distance between people into a fact of nature, education can also help
y2qo | us appreciate how that distance has been constructed to the disadvantage of so many people. What has been learned can be learned again, and the time is right for such a project.
1piq | On June 30, 1997, the already wasted British Empire could be said to have gasped its last. Making a good show of closing one of history's great acts. Great Britain ceremoniously returned Hong Kong, the last of its major colo- nial outposts, to China. The territories were restored to China after I58 years of occupation, having been ceded to Britain following the infamous Opium War that revealed, among the many guises of British imperialism, the em- pire's role as drug pusher. Of course, the events of that final day in June were largely symbolic, as the sun had set on the British Empire long before the British government offices turned out the lights for the final time. Most of the attention was spent on what China would do with this cosmopolitan, in- ternational city. The whole thing might have been mistaken as a celebration of imperialism's accomplishment. Britain's foreign secretary during those final years, Douglas Hurd, boasted, "What we gave back at midnight on June 30 was one of the miracles of achievement in the modern world. Achievements, I hasten to add, not primarily by the British but by the people of Hong Kong" (1997).
7fqw | Although minor British colonies remain to this day, from Bermuda to the Falkland Islands, the empire was not to survive the century it began at the height of its powers, when it spanned roughly a quarter of the globe in population and land mass. Britain was the largest of a series of European em- pires that in the last five centuries managed to annex the Western Hemi- sphere, foster a global slave trade, divide the African continent, and create a revolution in the arts and sciences. What so recently came to an end on Hong Kong Island in the South China Sea, in the colony that hung on the lip of the great divide between East and West, is something we will have to live with well into the next millennium. The empire is no more, in fact. Long live the Empire.
rhaz | In more than one sense, the educational project of postcolonialism in the West is only beginning. Although the process of decolonization began in earnest after the Second World War with the repeated successes of the inde- pendence movements, the West has barely begun to see beyond the divisions generated by the same sensibilities that drove imperial expansion over the face of the globe. This book on education at empire's end examines one powerful source of those divisions. It is about imperialism's influence on the educated view of the world that the West cultivated during the era of empire. We need to learn again how five centuries of studying, classifying, and ordering hu- manity within an imperial context gave rise to peculiar and powerful ideas of
wak1 | race, culture, and nation that were, in effect, conceptual instruments that the
wtfz | West used both to divide up and to educate the world. This can help us un- derstand why the rather inept explorer and missionary David Livingstone in- sisted on having a magic lantern among the scientific instruments, clothing, and other supplies hauled by his twenty-seven porters: it wasn't enough for him to attempt to fill in the European map of Africa; he had also, as one bi- ographer puts it, "to blind his African audiences with science and Christian- ity" (T. Holmes, 1993, p. 75).
qy1i | Given the enormity of imperialism's educational project and its relatively recent demise, it seems only reasonable to expect that this project would live on, for many of us, as an unconscious aspect of our education. After all, the great colonial empires came to a reluctant end only during the years when I and the rest of the postwar generation were being schooled. It may take gen- erations to realize all that lies buried in this body of knowledge as a way of knowing the world. In attempting to make a small contribution to that proc- ess, this book has postcolonial, or, perhaps more precisely, postimperial pre- tensions, even as it maintains a decidedly Eurocentric focus on the West's educational project for the world. But then, such a contribution seems to me to be the responsibility of one who has been so thoroughly shaped by this legacy and whose work as a teacher has been to be part of its shaping of others.
1k9e | I have to say that this concern with imperialism's educational project has also fostered in me an appreciation for imperialism's learned achievement. There can be little question of the scientific value of James Cook's expeditions to the Pacific and Darwin's voyage on the Beagle for fields as diverse as ento- mology and astronomy. This is not, however, all that their endeavors have to teach us. And I now realize that for every Cook and Darwin, there were thou- sands of other earnest and adventurous souls gathering pieces of what was seen as the great jigsaw puzzle of nature. What comes, we now have to ask, of having one's comprehension of the world so directly tied to one's conquest of it? Much of the knowledge achieved through conquest and colonization was understood to legitimate the political and cultural domination of imperial- ism. The resulting perspective on the world formed an educational legacy that we have now to reconsider. We cannot readily sort through and discard the
5bjs | WHERE IS HERE?
uodj | colonially tainted understandings we carry, without devoting attention to how our view of the world has been shaped by imperialism's educational proi ects, which included fostering a science and geography of race; renaming a good part of the world in homage to its adventurers' homesick sense of place- and imposing languages and literatures on the colonized in an effort to teach them why they were subservient to a born-to-rule civilization.
