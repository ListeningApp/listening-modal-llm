You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

lvae | Cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 inhibition and analgesic efficacy of dipyrone at different doses or meloxicam in cats after ovariohysterectomy
o9sc | Abstract
121u | Objective To evaluate the cyclooxygenases (COX) inhibi- tion, adverse effects and analgesic efficacy of dipyrone or meloxicam in cats undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy.
zh03 | Study design Prospective, blinded, randomized, clinical study.
1mvw | Animals A total of 30 healthy young cats.
6d4s | Methods The cats were randomly assigned to three post- operative groups: D25 (dipyrone 25 mg kg 1 every 24 hours), D12.5 (dipyrone 12.5 mg kg every 12 hours) and M (meloxicam 0.1 mg kg every 24 hours). In the first 24 hours, the drugs were administered intravenously (IV), and then orally for 6 (dipyrone) or 3 days (meloxicam). Pros- tanoids thromboxane B2 and prostaglandin E2 concentra- tions served as indicators of COX activity and, with physiological variables and pain and sedation scores, were measured for 24 hours after first analgesic administration. Rescue analgesia (tramadol, 2 mg kg-1 IV) was provided if Glasgow feline composite measure pain scale (CMPS-Feline) ≥5. Laboratory tests included symmetric dimethylarginine and adverse effects were evaluated regularly up to 7 and 10 days after surgery, respectively. Parametric and nonpara- metric data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests, respectively (p < 0.05).
mqah | Results In the first half hour after analgesic administration, COX-1 activity was close to zero and remained significantly lower than before drug administration for 24 hours in all groups. The inhibition of COX-2 activity was significant for 30 minutes in all groups and up to 4 hours in group M. No
xxr8 | alterations in laboratory tests or significant adverse effects were observed. Pain scores and need for rescue analgesia did not differ statistically among groups.
rl4j | Conclusions Dipyrone at both doses and meloxicam pro- vided a nonselective inhibition of COX-1 and -2 activities and effective analgesia without causing significant adverse effects or laboratory tests alterations.
vz32 | Clinical relevance Dipyrone at both doses provides equally effective analgesia without causing adverse effects in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy.
ncb0 | Introduction
8mp0 | Dipyrone, also known as metamizole, is a drug used in some European and Latin American countries for its analgesic, antipyretic and spasmolytic effects (Levy et al. 1995). Although introduced in pharmacotherapy in 1922, the mechanism of action is not yet completely understood (Kötter et al. 2015). Previous studies have reported its action on different receptors: stimulation of the arginine-NO-cGMP pathway (Duarte et al. 1992); central action through inhibi- tion of cyclooxygenase-3 (COX-3) (Chandrasekharan et al. 2002); endogenous opioid system (Vazquez et al. 2005); in- hibition of COX-1 and COX-2 (Hinz et al. 2007) and endoge- nous cannabinoid system (Escobar et al. 2012).
xjyk | Dipyrone may be a safe choice compared with opioids and non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, dipyrone has been withdrawn from the market in several countries
mt0f | because it has been associated with agranulocytosis in humans (Kötter et al. 2015). Studies investigating this association are heterogeneous and some results carry significant biases, such as small sample size, presence of comorbidities and the combination of dipyrone with other drugs (Andrade et al. 2016). The esti- mated mortality from agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, anaphylaxis and gastrointestinal complications after short-term dipyrone use is reported as similar to that of paracetamol and lower than that of diclofenac and aspirin (Andrade et al. 1998).
awab | In veterinary medicine, literature on this drug is sparse. Pharmacokinetics studies of dipyrone (25 mg kg 1) adminis- tered by various routes in cats (Lebkowska-Wieruszewska et al. 2018) and dogs (Giorgi et al. 2018) have been published. Clinical studies have demonstrated analgesia efficacy from dipyrone in several scenarios in dogs (Martins et al. 2010; Imagawa et al. 2011; Flôr et al. 2013; Teixeira et al. 2013; Zanuzzo et al. 2015a). Only one published study was identified that used dipyrone for pain management in cats. In that study, dipyrone (25 mg kg every 24, 12 or 8 hours for 5 days) combined with tramadol (2 mg kg every 8 hours) adminis- tered intravenously (IV) after ovariohysterectomy provided effective postoperative pain management with no significant adverse effects, biochemical alterations or erythrocyte oxida- tion (Teixeira et al. 2019).
ixcc | In domestic animals, there are no reports of significant adverse effects or laboratory tests alterations associated with dipyrone, and a study reported no renal, hepatic, bleeding time or bone marrow function alterations in dogs (Sarchahi et al. 2017). Regarding gastrointestinal effects, no pathological changes in the gastrointestinal tract of control rats or rats with preexisting induced gastric ulcers were observed after dipyrone administration (Berenguer et al. 2002). In addition, there are reports of increases in gastric mucus and gastric prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (Batu & Erol 2007) and less gastric PGE2 reduction than from piroxicam or celecoxib (Berenguer et al. 2002). However, the mechanisms of a protective effect by dipyrone on the gastric mucosa are still unclear (Collares & Troncon 2019).
8p6h | The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dipyrone on COX-1 and COX-2 activities, to assess postoperative pain in cats undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy after IV administration of dipyrone or meloxicam during the first 24 hours and to identify any adverse effects occurring in 7 or 4 days after surgery with dipyrone or meloxicam, respectively. Our hypothesis was that dipyrone may inhibit COX with few adverse effects and provide postoperative analgesia similar to meloxicam.

oae5 | Animals
s0fl | A total of 30 female domestic cats undergoing ovariohyster- ectomy were studied. All animals were deemed healthy and with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I based on medical history, physical examination, complete blood count (CBC) and serum chemistry tests. Acclimatization occurred in two visits at the hospital before the beginning of the study, when animals were also introduced to the envi- ronment, cage, observers and sedation and pain assessment tools. Exclusion criteria included excessive fear or aggressive- ness, signs of pre-existing pain, pregnancy, underlying diseases and recent use of anti-inflammatory drugs.
