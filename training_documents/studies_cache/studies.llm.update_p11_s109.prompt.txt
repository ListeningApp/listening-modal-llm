You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

b7cq | A strong integration of SES research with societal issues (Turner et al. 2016) affirms calls for the development of stronger science- society interfaces (Fischer et al. 2015, Tengö et al. 2017) to guide research, knowledge cocreation, and decision making (Turner et al. 2016). However, as many researchers have recognized, taking a knowledge coproduction approach to understanding SES and supporting policy and decision making can be demanding. Aside from the time required to establish relationships with knowledge partners, particularly when operating in transdisciplinary teams that seek evidence from multiple knowledge platforms (Tengö et al. 2014, 2017), challenges also arise from the inherent methodological pluralism that characterizes the SES research field (Turner et al. 2016, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Preiser 2018). Furthermore, if we accept that seeking evidence from multiple knowledge traditions (Tengö et al. 2014, Díaz et al. 2015a, b) represents a more ethical approach to understanding SES, we have to be cognizant of the fact that much of our current academic knowledge for understanding SES has been generated in the Global North (also see Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018). This

qecd | Many different methods from a variety of disciplines inform SES research
1o7p | That methods from many different disciplines are used in SES research is perhaps intuitive, but our study provides a strong empirical validation of this statement, and by virtue of our typology, an accessible overview of the kinds of methods that are used in the field. Our study identified 311 methods (reduced from an initial list of 632) that we grouped into 27 categories, or types, of methods that are commonly used in SES research, providing empirical support for the notion of methodological pluralism in SES research.
cp13 | Within the place-based studies that we analyzed, we found that spatial mapping and analysis, historical profiling and reconstruction, interviews, and futures analysis were most commonly used (Fig. 7). The use of these methods may be partly driven by the most common SES research topics, including policy, trade, conservation, adaptation, and land use change (Fig. 6b) because they are the most common methods we found to be used to investigate these topics (Table 3). Interestingly, interviews and participatory data collection were much more commonly used than ecological field data collection (Fig. 7), but this may because ecological field data collection methods are often not articulated in the abstracts of, for example, papers that assess land use change. Economic and other decision-support methods were also quite widely used, including impact analysis, livelihood and vulnerability analysis, and decision analysis. This provides further support for the importance of the increasing emphasis on the science-policy interface and knowledge coproduction in SES research. In contrast, state-and-transition analysis, systems scoping, and games were much more rarely used. These are methods that are particularly well suited to the study of SES (Schultz et al. 2007, Janssen et al. 2010, Provencher et al. 2016, Edwards et al. 2019), but may not have been as well-represented in our dataset on account of their categories containing fewer specific methods, a general limitation of our study.
bgre | Our typology of methods spanning different disciplines can provide some orientation to early-career researchers to navigate the methodological pluralism that characterizes the SES field. For new researchers entering the field, a key challenge relates to knowing which methods could be used to investigate a particular SES research question (Haider et al. 2018). Our list of method categories offers researchers a manageable overview of potential tools they might employ in their research, and provides a foundation for scholarly engagement around methodological integration.
57lp | Methods used in SES research account for the underlying characteristics of CAS to varying degrees
ukth | To gain deeper insight into the suitability of methods used in SES research in accounting for the CAS nature of SES, the authors used a thought exercise to map the different method typologies onto the six organizing principles of CAS, as identified by Preiser et al. (2018; Table 4). There are obvious limitations to such an approach, most notably that our assessment was limited by the knowledge of the author team about different methods and the contexts in which they are applied. Nevertheless, the exercise yielded several insights that could be explored in future research on the nature of SES research.
kpvt | A number of the methods highlighted in our review, such as network analysis and agent-based modeling, are particularly well suited to explore relationality in SES (Preiser et al. 2018). Both network analysis and agent-based modeling are used extensively in SES research (Fig. 7), and offer integrative frameworks that capture relations and connectivity, can help to develop rich pictures, and deal with heterogeneity and redundancy (Janssen et al. 2006, Bodin and Crona 2009, An 2012, Filatova et al. 2013). Agent-based modeling and network analysis are process- orientated models that rely on decentralized control and automata to detect and create emergent patterns, and so do well to account for the adaptive and self-generating organizational capacities of CAS.
jie2 | Generally, the methods used in SES research have been sensitive to the context-dependency of SES challenges, probably helped by the notion that SES research has emerged from place-based local- scale studies (Colding and Barthel 2019). Many methods used in anticipatory future studies are adept at adapting frameworks to context, and specifically focus on anticipating adaptation and change (Berkhout et al. 2002, Carpenter et al. 2006, Shaw et al. 2009, Sheppard et al. 2011). These methods, and other participatory research methods that gather multiple evidence- based knowledge (Tengö et al. 2014) can help with observer- dependent framing (Shirk et al. 2012)
