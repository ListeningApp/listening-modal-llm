You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

In contrast, volcaniclastic-dominated strata have high permeability and porosity, promoting lateral fluid flow, wide- spread mixing with seawater, and broadly stratiform alteration zones. There are numerous examples of ancient volcanicla- stic-hosted VMS deposits, including the Mattabi deposit in the Sturgeon Lake Caldera Complex, Canada (cf. Franklin et al., 1975; Morton and Franklin, 1987; Holk et al., 2008), the Horne and Bouchard-Hebert deposits in the Noranda mining district, Canada (cf. Gibson et al., 1993; Galley et al., 1995), the Boundary deposit in the Newfoundland Appalachians, Canada (cf. Piercey et al., 2014), and the Rosebery deposit in the Mount Read Volcanics belt of western Tasmania (cf. Large et al., 2001). In these deposits, the massive sulfide ore- bodies occur as stratiform lenses that are interpreted to form in whole or in part below the seafloor. Underlying the massive sulfide lenses, stringer mineralization is vertically restricted, occurring as semiconformable zones of disseminated sulfide mineralization. In the immediate footwall of the VMS depos- its, zones of diffuse pipe-like alteration occur along synvolca- nic faults, consisting of extreme leaching, silica mobility, and Fe metasomatism (e.g., Morton and Franklin, 1987). Typical alteration assemblages are sericite and chlorite, occurring as matrix cement and pervasive replacement of glass-rich clasts (e.g., Gifkins and Allen, 2001). These diffuse pipe-like zones merge outward into more widespread semiconformable alter- ation zones (e.g., Franklin et al., 1975). The geometry of these zones can be distinguished using oxygen isotope mapping, where increasing 818O values of altered rocks are associated with decreasing temperatures of hydrothermal activity (e.g., King et al., 2000; Holk et al., 2008). Importantly, silicified horizons tend to form near the seafloor, acting as imperme- able caps that isolate high-temperature circulation from shal- low, low-temperature hydrothermal regimes (e.g., Franklin et al., 1981; Galley, 1993). This highlights the importance of early hydrothermal processes, such as silicification, in con- trolling the pathways of subsequent fluid flow (cf. Gibson et al., 1983; Skirrow and Franklin, 1994). While hydrothermal fluid flow regimes and associated alteration processes are well studied in the ancient rock record, these processes are largely unknown in modern settings due a lack of seafloor drilling to investigate the third dimension of these systems.
kjoa | The Tinakula seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposit is the first identified modern analog of a mafic volcaniclastic-domi- nated deposit of the type described by Morton and Franklin (1987). It is located in the Jean Charcot troughs in the northern New Hebrides back arc, centered at 167°36'50"E/12°12'10'S (Fig. 1). This part of the Jean Charcot troughs is characterized by enhanced magmatism where regional structures, including the EW-trending Tikopia fracture zone, extend into the back arc (Fig. 1A). The transition from the arc to the back arc is marked by an abrupt change from tectonic extension associated with normal faulting to magmatic-tectonic extension where dike-fed lavas have erupted along linear fissures (Fig. 1B). Unlike hydrothermal systems in many deep back-arc basins, which are localized along mid-ocean ridge-type spreading centers (e.g., Hannington et al., 2005), hydrothermal activity
wb1c | at Tinakula is focused along a row of young mafic cinder cones on the flank of the Starfish stratovolcano (Figs. 1B, 2). Cin- der cones are common volcanic landforms but have not been widely described on the modern seafloor. These features form from the buildup of volcanic tephra associated with Strombo- lian-style eruptions (i.e., fire-fountaining; cf. Cashman, 2004). Submarine pyroclastic deposits associated with fire-fountain- ing eruptions have been described in the ancient rock record (e.g., Mueller and White, 1992). This style of eruption may be more common in arc-proximal settings where mafic magmas have higher water contents compared to those in other tec- tonic settings (e.g., Gill et al., 1990).
ak13 | In this paper, we present a comprehensive three-dimen- sional study of an actively forming massive sulfide deposit, with seafloor and subseafloor components, in a nascent back- arc setting dominated by bimodal mafic volcaniclastic rocks. We investigate how features of the volcaniclastic substrate have influenced the mineralization and alteration at Tinakula, including the possible roles of boiling, fluid mixing, duration of hydrothermal activity, host-rock compositions, and mag- matic contributions to the hydrothermal system.
