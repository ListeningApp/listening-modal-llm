o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

qrvy | Viruses can also exploit host GPCRs to promote viral pathogenesis and survival by expressing virally encoded GPCR agonists or antagonists in order to modulate host cell signalling. For example, KHSV encodes multiple viral cytokines, which have significant sequence similarity to host chemokine agonists and antagonists and can bind to host GPCRs to mediate functions such as chemotaxis of immune cells, and resistance to apoptosis25,36,37. Alternatively, these proteins can bind to and inactivate host-produced ligands in order to shut off or abrogate host immune response38.

1pmc | The Mutation Spectrum of GPCRs in Cancer
5z6q | The generation of vast cancer sequencing resources including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) have revealed that GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins are collectively mutated in roughly 20% of all cancers, spanning across numerous tumor types39-42. This is aligned with mutation frequencies of some of the most well-studied cancer-related pathways, including the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/RAS/MAPK and p53 pathways, which are mutated at 46% and 29% of all cancers

b8hf | respectively43. Despite this staggering number, the biological function and consequence of many of these GPCR and heterotrimeric G protein mutations are as of yet largely unknown due to the numerous factors that influence the prediction of cancer-driving mutations. For example, the contribution of gene length must be weighed against the number of mutations in a given gene. Coupled with this, many of the mutations in GPCRs are not isolated to hotspot residues, further hindering efforts to predict their signalling and cellular impact and potential role in cancer. As a result, it has been difficult to infer the biological contexts in which mutations in GPCRs have cancer-driving effects as compared to passenger mutations with little functional impact. Towards this end, there have been numerous recent advances in cancer genomics and methodology aimed at identifying significantly mutated genes, and their associated biological consequences. For example, the MutSig suite of tools builds a model based on several characteristics, including the mutation burden of a gene relative to the background mutation rate (BMR) of each tissue, mutation clustering within a gene and potential hotspots, and the evolutionary conservation of mutations44. These features are then integrated to obtain gene-level mutation significance44,45. For our analysis (Table S3) we have included data generated using MutSig2CV, which refines the BMR predictions by incorporating parameters of mutational heterogeneity such as DNA replication timing and transcriptional activity45. To complement measurements of mutation significance, other approaches have been used to predict the pathogenicity of mutations in cancer, including investigating phylogenetic conservation, allele frequency, proximity to specific genomic features, mapping mutations to protein domains, and assessing patterns of mutual exclusivity with other mutations46. In tandem, the integration of rapidly growing mechanistic data are beginning to shed light on the molecular basis of how cancer-associated mutations may be playing a role, including the systematic mapping of cancer-related alterations on a pathway level43.
hntf | Of particular relevance to GPCR-driven signalling, structure-function analyses of mutations in GPCRs have begun to provide insight on these observations and a new framework of the functional impact of GPCR mutations is emerging. Projection of cancer-related mutations for TSHR, for example, have revealed an accumulation of mutations clustered at the cytoplasmic tail of helix 6, suggesting that in the absence of a physical hotspot mutation, structural motif hotspots may be more prevalent manifestations of cancer-associated GPCR mutations39. Indeed, our recent pan-cancer analysis of functional somatic mutations in gene families has demonstrated significant enrichment of mutations in a handful of highly conserved regions of GPCRs that regulate GPCR function and activation. These include mutations localized to the DRY motif, which mediates the inactive conformation of class A GPCRs, with particular emphasis on

y5r7 | recurrent mutations in DRY arginine, in addition to the nPxxY motif, both of which are critical regulators of GPCR activation. Mutations in these positions show statistically significant mutual exclusivity between motifs, as well as with activating hotspot mutations in the Ga subunit further supporting the functional significance of these structure-based predictions47. DRY arginine mutations are also mutually exclusive with many common mutant oncogenes that are downstream of GPCR-mediated signalling cascades, including AKT E17K, PIK3CA E545K and JAK2 V617F47. In many cases where the full G-protein-coupling repertoire of GPCRs has not been fully elucidated, recent efforts to systematically predict the G protein-coupling selectivity of GPCRs via functional interaction studies have provided novel insights into these coupling determinants and the subsequent implications both from a structural, and signalling perspective48. Integration of this information with other data types including aforementioned mutation and structure-function analyses will continue to widen and clarify our view of the impact of cancer- associated mutations in GPCRs.
lrry | Broken down phylogenetically, the adhesion and glutamate GPCR are highly mutated families of GPCRs in cancer; however, their role in cancer is not well defined39. Adhesion GPCRs (aGPCRs) are named as such due to the extended extracellular N terminus containing structural domains such as thrombospondin repeats, and leucine-rich-repeats (LRRs), which participate in a variety of protein-protein interactions and can mediate adhesion to cellular matrix proteins49. The aGPCR subfamily is widely mutated among cancer types in TCGA and a number of aGPCRs are involved in angiogenesis, metastasis, and other critical components of cancer initiation and progression50,51 (Figure 1). Among them, GPR98 (ADGRV1) is the most frequently mutated GPCR across all cancer types. In particular ADGRV1 is mutated in roughly 45% of skin cutaneous melanoma, and is the longest GPCR by amino acid length; however, not much is known regarding its functional impact52 (Table S1). ADGRE5, also known as CD97, was the first aGPCR to be linked to cancer, as its expression was found to be a sensitive marker of dedifferentiation in thyroid carcinomas53,54. While ADGRE5 expression was nearly absent in normal thyrocytes, its levels increased in correlation with thyroid tumor stage53,54. Its over- expression has since been identified in several other cancer types including pancreatic, gallbladder, and esophageal carcinomas, and is linked to metastatic aggressiveness in gastric, colorectal cancers, and particularly in glioblastoma55. Glioblastoma in particular, is known to develop extensive intratumoral hypoxia, and GPR133 (ADGRD1) has been implicated to be critical for glioblastoma growth under hypoxic conditions56.

863b | Glutamate receptors, which bind glutamate as their ligand, have primarily been studied for their roles in the central nervous system but are becoming increasingly implicated in cancer57,58. A pan-cancer analysis of somatic mutation patterns revealed a number of significantly mutated GPCRs, including GRM842. In another case, a GPCR-targeted mutation analysis of melanomas revealed that GPR98 (mentioned above) and GRM3, a metabotropic glutamate receptor, were the most frequently mutated genes59. Expression of patient-derived GRM3 mutants in melanoma cell lines significantly increased anchorage-independent cell proliferation, as well as cell migration in vitro and in vivo metastatic rate59 (Figure 1). Similarly, ectopic expression of GRM1 and GRM5 have been found to induce spontaneous formation of melanoma in transgenic mouse models suggesting a role for GRMs in driving melanoma initiation60-62. Glutamate and other amino acid- binding GPCRs, such as the taste receptors TAS1R1, and TAS1R3, can also act as nutrient sensors that survey the tumor microenvironment and extracellular milieu to assess nutrient availability. Under times of nutrient stress or deprivation, these GPCRs can regulate the activation of autophagic programs that enable cancer cells to persist63,64.
fj24 | One of the most prominent GPCRs implicated in neoplastic growth is the Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor (TSHR). TSHR is coupled primarily to Gas and to a lesser extent Gaq, and is a key regulator of thyroid cell function, growth and hormone metabolism65. Mutations in TSHR have been found to lead to numerous thyroid diseases, including hyper- and hypo- thyroidism and hyperfunctioning thyroid adenomas66. Strikingly, activating mutations in TSHR are the predominant cause of solitary toxic thyroid adenomas, accounting for roughly 60-80% of all cases, and are found in roughly 30% of thyroid adenomas among other cancers67,68. Aligned with this, activating mutations in GNAS and TSHR are commonly found in differentiated thyroid carcinomas67,69,70 (Figure 1).
uz3c | TSHR and other hormone GPCRs, such as G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER1, also known as GPR30), luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR), follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GNRHR), and their cognate hormone ligands, are known to play multiple roles in modulating the tumor microenvironment and promoting tumor proliferation particularly for cancers with hormonal involvement such as thyroid, breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. Indeed, prostate cancer induced by injection of testosterone was one of the earliest indications that hormone dynamics could control the initiation of cancer71.

ffx8 | actions of classical estrogen receptors (ERs), GPER has been shown to mediate both transcriptional and rapid signal transduction events upon estrogen binding, activating the EGFR/MAPK pathways and resulting in the activation of c-fos regulated transcriptional networks in multiple tissue types72,73. Interestingly, GPER has been shown to cooperate with ERa to promote mitogenic effects in a cell-context dependent manner, highlighting the multifaceted nature of estrogen signalling in cancer74. Evista (raloxifene), which is FDA approved for the prevention of breast cancer in post-menopausal women, targets ERs, while also modulating GPER activity. Other hormone-binding GPCRs have been successfully targeted in oncology, including the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRH). Degarelix, a well-tolerated GnRH antagonist, has been used for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer by rapidly suppressing levels of gonadotropins, testosterone, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in patients75. The profound efficacy of degarelix as a first-line monotherapy for the management of prostate cancer is a remarkable testament to the druggability of GPCRs and their use in oncotherapy.
s6su | Another seven-transmembrane receptor frequently mutated in cancer is Smoothened (SMO), which drives activation of the transcription factor GLI76,77. SMO is negatively regulated by the twelve-transmembrane receptor patched (PTCH); however, this inhibition is relieved upon binding of PTCH to hedgehog family members, including sonic hedgehog (SHH)76. Mutations that result in the activation of the PTCH-SMO-SHH signalling axis have been found to drive sporadic basal cell carcinomas (BCCs)78,79 (Figure 1). As of yet, the potential role of heterotrimeric G proteins in the signalling capacity of SMO have not been fully clarified77. Studies have found that in some cell contexts, Gai and Ga12 are involved in activation of the pathway; however, the dependency of SMO on G protein coupling for its roles in cancer initiation and progression is not well understood and requires further investigation80-82.
y219 | The Frizzled family of seven-transmembrane receptors (FZDs) are also heavily involved in cancer, as transducers of the Wnt signalling cascade83. Wnt signalling can drive the activation of several transcriptional networks, primarily ß-catenin and has been described to play a role in numerous cancer types, with emphasis in colorectal cancer83,84. Indeed, the Frizzled family of GPCRs is collectively mutated in >15% of colon adenocarcinomas in TCGA (Figure 1, Table S2). FZD6 in particular is significantly mutated in colon adenocarcinoma (MutSig2CV q-value = 0.05) (Table S3). There is mounting evidence supporting the G protein coupling of Frizzleds as a critical component of the Wnt signalling pathway85-87. For example, inhibition of Goo and Gaq has been found to disrupt Wnt-mediated stabilization of ß-catenin and teratocarcinoma stem-cell

xags | While the complexity of the mutational landscape of GPCRs in cancer, which we refer to as the onco-GPCRome, is daunting, some interesting tissue-specific patterns are now emerging that may help explain their direct biological impact. Indeed, recent cross-cancer analysis of GPCR mutations in human malignancies has revealed that gastrointestinal (GI) cancers harbor the highest number of mutated GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins, irrespective of the mutational load of these cancers52. This is coupled with the recent finding that a significant portion of mutated GPCRs couple to Gas and Gai/o, more specifically, an enrichment of activating mutants of Gas-coupled receptors, and deleterious (inactivating) mutants of Gai/o-coupled receptors47. Together, these mutation patterns converge on the oncogenic impact of elevated adenylyl cyclase activity and production of cyclic AMP (CAMP), which is stimulated by Gas and inhibited by Gai/o, suggesting a prominent role for enhanced cAMP signalling in cancer. The CAMP signalling network is involved in different aspects of tumorigenesis, and these findings establish a functional link between the mutation patterns in GPCRs and their candidate role as cell-context specific oncodrivers, with emphasis on GI cancers, including colorectal, stomach, and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. GPCRs are also known to possess copy number variation (CNV) or gene expression alterations, leading to their aberrant expression in numerous cancer types, representing a mutation-independent, and potentially targetable mechanism by which they can drive oncogenic signalling networks52,89. Indeed, 28 out of 33 TCGA cancer cohorts have been found to have CNVs in GPCR and heterotrimeric G protein genes that are significantly correlated with the mRNA expression patterns of each respective gene52. The tissue, cell type, and even tumor stage-specific nature of these alterations further emphasize the complex and dynamic molecular forces underlying GPCR signalling in cancer. These mechanisms can contribute to diverse aspects of tumorigenesis, which will be discussed in greater detail below.
