        "content": "dqlg | Asteroid Four Vesta is one of the largest rocky bodies in the main asteroid belt. The genetic linkage between Vesta (and its spectral resemblances, V-type asteroids) and howardite-eucrite-diogenite meteorites has been advocated based on petrographic studies of meteorites and telescopic observations of the asteroid since the nineteen sixties to nineteen seventies. Direct observations by the NASA Dawn Mission in twenty twelve further support the Vesta-HED relationship. As members of the HED clan, eucrites are basaltic or gabbroic crustal rocks primarily composed of low-calcium pyroxene, plagioclase, and minor amounts of silica minerals, sulfides, oxides, calcium phosphates, and rare zircons. Based on short-lived radiometric chronometers, previous studies have shown that the initial crystallization of basaltic eucrites occurred within a few million years after the formation of the solar system. Most of the basaltic eucrites experienced high-temperature (approximately nine hundred degrees Celsius) annealing. The uranium-lead and hafnium-tungsten ages of zircons in the basaltic eucrites vary from as old as approximately four thousand five hundred sixty-three to four thousand five hundred sixty-five million years ago to four thousand five hundred thirty million years ago, with a weighted mean uranium-lead age of four thousand five hundred fifty-four million years ago. The eucritic zircons are considered to have crystallized during the initial crust formation and/or the prolonged thermal processes on Vesta. An age of four thousand five hundred sixty-three plus or minus fifteen million years ago has also been reported in a mesosiderite, another meteoritical group that is expected to have a common origin with the HEDs (i.e., Vesta). After a suite of the early processes, most eucrites experienced complicated geologic events including (multiple cycles of) impact brecciation, reheating, and partial remelting. The forty argon-thirty-nine argon dating of various eucrites exhibits a large age variation from approximately four point five billion years to three point five billion years. Recent re-assessments of the forty argon-thirty-nine argon plateau ages indicate two groups: an earlier group with forty argon-thirty-nine argon plateau ages at approximately four point five zero billion years and a later group with ages at approximately three point eight five billion years. The earlier group may be associated with a large impact on Vesta that resulted in the formation of an ancient basin (possibly Veneneia). The timing of this basin-forming or related cataclysmic impact on Vesta has also been dated at four point five two to four point five three billion years by other chronological studies. The later argon-plateau ages, conversely, are interpreted either as clustering impacts during approximately three point eight five to three point four seven billion years or as an \"end-tail\" of ancient continuous collisions.\np6pq | The uranium-lead chronology of calcium phosphates, such as apatite, is useful. Closure temperatures for radiometric chronometers are known to be quite high for the uranium-lead system in zircon, \"moderately high\" for the uranium-lead in apatite, and considerably lower for the potassium-argon system in plagioclase (respectively approximately nine hundred degrees Celsius, approximately four hundred fifty degrees Celsius, and approximately three hundred degrees Celsius, assuming typical mineral sizes and slow cooling of one to one hundred degrees Celsius per million years). Thus, the uranium-lead system in apatite provides a record of \"moderately high-temperature\" events that were likely missed or overwritten in other radiometric systems. Another calcium phosphate, merrillite, often\nzse6 | provides a similar uranium-lead chronology, although its closure temperature remains to be experimentally determined. The uranium-lead age of apatite in a brecciated basaltic eucrite, Béréba, was reported at four point two billion years; this age was originally interpreted as the beginning of Late Heavy Bombardment on the asteroid. Liao and Hsu reported the similar uranium-lead ages of four point two to four point one billion years from apatite and merrillite in a newly found eucritic impact-melt breccia, Northwest Africa eight thousand nine. According to their mineralogical and geochemical study by Liao and Hsu, NWA eight thousand nine experienced an abnormally severe impact compared to other eucrites, with a peak pressure of approximately fifty to sixty gigapascals and a temperature of approximately one thousand one hundred sixty to twelve hundred degrees Celsius. Conversely, the apatite uranium-lead age of another unbrecciated eucrite, NWA six thousand five hundred ninety-four, recorded an earlier event at four thousand five hundred twenty-three plus or minus two million years ago. Liao et al. attribute this age to a large cataclysmic impact on Vesta, as inferred from other chronologies. By extending this line of reasoning to multiple eucrites, the thermal and collisional history of Vesta can be determined and, by implication, that of the other asteroid belt bodies. Here, we present a new uranium-lead dataset for several eucritic phosphates, which indicates that their parent bodies suffered complicated thermal/impact metamorphism at a very early stage.\np2n3 | Two.
