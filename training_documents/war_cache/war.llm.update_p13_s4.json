But the ways in which modern bureaucracy and science readily put themselves at the service of such an ideology prompted Zygmunt Bauman to assert that the Holocaust, and modern genocide more widely, 'arose out of a genuinely rational concern, and . .. was generated by bureaucracy true to its form and purpose'. It is an overblown claim. It would be a mistake to substitute the instrument for the ideological driving force as the determinant of the Holocaust. And there was little that was bureaucratically rational about some - perhaps most - other instances of twentieth- century genocide. But it is surely correct to claim that without the bureaucracy which is a hallmark of modernity 'the Holocaust would be unthinkable'. When Bauman interprets the Holocaust as 'an element of social engineering, meant to bring about a social order conforming to the design of the perfect society', he touches on a further important strand of the modernity of political violence: its connection with modern utopias in which it is assumed that perfection can be brought about on this earth and by secular means, the ultimate replacement of God by man as the arbiter of life and death. But, again, it would be as well not to concentrate exclusively on political violence as modernity in the sense of a rational pursuit of the perfect society. Much of the violence and killing - including that by the Nazis - used nothing more modern than a rifle, while the phenomenal killing-rate in the Rwandan genocide depended in good measure on weapons no more sophisticated than machetes. The modernity of the killing methods, in other words, was related to the modernity of the state directing them. But what were crucially modern were the ideologies underpinning the methods - the actual cause of the violence and killing. And the most important - and lethal - of these has probably been that of integral nationalism, usually demanding ethnic exclusivity.\nv3r2 | The unbelievably benign decades after nineteen fifty in much of Europe certainly marked the sharpest of contrasts - even allowing for Bosnia and Kosovo - with the apocalyptic first half of the century. A major factor was, of course, the absence of all but regional\nnv42 | war (and that not before the nineteen nineties). With Europe bled white and divided between the victorious superpowers of the United States and the USSR, both interested in their different ways in dominating their respective halves of the continent, the massively destabilising forces of the years immediately following the First World War could never replicate themselves. The cold war itself, for all its inherent dangers, served as an integrating and stabilising element. A second factor of the utmost importance, again in contrast to the nineteen twenties and nineteen thirties, was the onset of an era - Hobsbawm's 'golden age' - of unprecedented prosperity. Sometimes we do learn from history, if not always very well. Even in the nineteen thirties, some far-sighted thinkers had seen that tariff barriers hindering the distribution of wealth in Europe, and notably the German claims on a share of that wealth, were asking for trouble. The abolition of tariff barriers, internationalisation of trade within western Europe through the establishment of a common market, and the huge surge in prosperity produced by the post-war consumer boom laid foundations in western Europe on which inter-governmental economic and political co-operation could build - a framework of co-operation likely to prevent political disorder leading to the collapse of state systems and to limit the dangerous growth of extremist movements. A third factor, at least in western Europe, was the absence of the ethnic tensions which had been such a source of violence between the wars. The heated issue of Germany's eastern borders, with the violence the disputed territories had provoked before nineteen thirty-nine, was effectively resolved with the massive and brutally executed ethnic cleansings in eastern Europe between nineteen forty-five and nineteen fifty, and the extension of Soviet control and huge repressive power deep into the territory of Germany itself. Some flashpoints of violence remained. No longer integral nationalism with all its evils, but now breakaway nationalism posed a problem in some places. Northern Ireland and the Basque country have stayed regions in which breakaway nationalist tendencies and political intransigence have produced endemic anti-state violence - mercifully, perhaps now at last calming in Ulster. However, these have been - in a broad European context - peripheral rather than central problems. And they have not generated major violence - at least contrasted with the first half of the century - by the states targeted by the forms of terrorist actions and guerrilla warfare. In general, levels of violence by the state itself throughout western Europe have been low because state-control mechanisms have become more effective, and, especially, because the conditions which prompted such extreme violence in the inter-war period have been largely absent.\nxags | In most of eastern Europe the heavy hand of Soviet rule contained for four decades the ethnic tensions and violence which had poisoned this part of the continent before the Second World War. In Yugoslavia, Tito's clever mix of repression and integration had the same effect. Where anti-Soviet insurgency forced its way through, as in East Germany in nineteen fifty-three, Hungary in nineteen fifty-six, and Czechoslovakia in nineteen sixty-eight, it was fairly rapidly quelled and repressive calm restored. It was only once drab containment disappeared with the sudden collapse of the Soviet bloc in nineteen eighty-nine to nineteen ninety that ethnic tensions and accompanying violence in some areas of the former USSR, notably the Caucasus,\njc47 | War and Political Violence in Twentieth-Century Europe\nko3c | surfaced with vehemence and are far from quietened even now. In ex-Yugoslavia, the destabilisation after Tito's death in nineteen eighty led by the end of that decade to the stirrings of new and violent nationalism, especially among the Serbs, who used nationalist myth to justify modern ethnic cleansing of a most vicious kind in Bosnia, then in Kosovo. Appalling and terrible though this resurgence of ethnic violence within Europe was, it was a spectacular eruption in one region rather than the symptom of a general problem. The proto-genocidal climate and actions of the inter-war period have been generally absent in eastern and central Europe. The remarkable thing is how non-violent the transition since nineteen ninety to new socioeconomic structures in these regions of the continent has proved. The lack of resistance to change by the moribund old order provides part of the explanation for this. The diminished framework for ethnic conflict within the former communist states - even with the two big exceptions of Chechnya and ex-Yugoslavia - coupled with the absence of any clear alternative ideology to that of triumphant, western capitalist liberal democracy, once the organisational and mobilising potential of communism had been removed or emasculated, is a further significant factor.\nxek3 | In other parts of the world, the second half of the twentieth century could hardly be described as benign. Violence towards civilian populations, usually in the context of war, whether from bitter civil conflict or invasion by neighbours related to unresolvable territorial disputes, has been endemic and huge in scale. In the nineteen sixties and nineteen seventies alone, 'massive massacres amounting to genocide' - a phrase used in a speech in nineteen seventy-nine to Amnesty International - took place, according to one listing, in eleven countries, including the mega-horror of Cambodia. The single example of Rwanda in nineteen ninety-four is sufficient to remind us that genocide spawned by war is by no means confined to a more distant past. The inescapable dangers of the Kashmir and Palestinian conflicts at the present time are there for all to see. And, though Europe is not a direct participant in these conflicts, today's global politics - and perhaps also a lingering historical sense of some moral responsibility - means that it is both involved and affected.\n```",
