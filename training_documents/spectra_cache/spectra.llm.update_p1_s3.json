Total light power of sonoluminescence and the yield of hydrogen peroxide increased in the order helium less than argon less than krypton less than xenon. The peak position of the hydroxyl radical at three hundred ten nanometers did not depend on the dissolved gas, but in the region two less than three hundred ten nanometers the light emission had maxima at two hundred sixty-two, two hundred sixty-eight, two hundred fifty, and two hundred forty-two nanometers for helium, argon, krypton, and xenon, respectively. The intensity of this part of the spectra increased in the same order. The results show that sonoluminescence is a kind of luminescence, and the source of sonoluminescence is not blackbody radiation or electrical discharge.\n1jyv | Introduction\nolce | Acoustic cavitation in liquids is accompanied by a number of effects, one of which is the light emission-sonoluminescence. This peculiar phenomenon has been the subject of many experimental and theoretical investigations over the past few decades, but it still remains to be poorly understood.\nerx1 | A few hypotheses have been proposed on the mechanism of sonoluminescence and sonochemical reactions. All of them are based on the formation, growth, and implosive collapse of cavitation bubbles as the source of the phenomenon. Noltingk and Neppiras proposed that sonoluminescence arises from blackbody emission of the adiabatic collapsed cavity. Recently, Hiller, studying the spectra of water sonoluminescence from a single nonlinearly pulsating cavitation bubble, suggested sonoluminescence to be blackbody radiation with temperature of heated bubble content of twenty-five thousand kelvin. Atchley found that the temperature inside a collapsed cavity can exceed sixteen thousand two hundred kelvin.\nb3bt | An electrical discharge inside or outside the bubble has been proposed several times for the explanation of sonoluminescence.\n0w8m | Some researchers believed that the generation of a shock wave inside the collapsing bubble is the source of sonoluminescence, and recently it was found experimentally that sonoluminescence arises when the speed of a bubble compression exceeds the speed of sound in the gas. However, the results of Atchley show that it is not necessary, and a speed of one hundred thirty meters per second is enough to produce sonoluminescence from a single nonlinearly pulsating cavitation bubble.\nvcu3 | A hot-spot chemiluminescence model is based on the opinion that the emission arises from active species that are formed by high temperature inside the cavitation bubble. Taylor and Jarman proposed that sonoluminescence is partly chemiluminescent in its nature and partly due to emission of heated gas.\nhjzj | Thus, many hypotheses have been proposed, and there is no generally accepted one.\nj79f | Spectral investigations of sonoluminescence were carried out in several papers. It has been shown that dissolving in liquid gases essentially changes the sonoluminescence intensity and spectra. The spectra of sonoluminescence of water saturated with oxygen, nitrogen, or their mixture are difficult to interpret because of the large number of emitting light particles, which\n6tbv | can be formed by the chemical reactions inside the cavitation bubble. On the other hand, the sonoluminescence spectra of noble gas-saturated water were studied insufficiently, and the interpretation of them is not still realized. This work is devoted to the studies of sonoluminescence spectra of water saturated with helium, argon, krypton, and xenon gases. A preliminary report of this work has been published.\nxb13 | The objectives of this paper are to reconsider the possible mechanisms of sonoluminescence and to present the sonoluminescence spectra of noble gas-saturated water and to interpret them. We conclude that sonoluminescence is not a blackbody radiation or electrical discharge and is a kind of luminescence. The changes of sonoluminescence spectra in the order of inert gases from helium to xenon are explained by the difference in noble gas characteristics and the peculiarities of the conditions inside the bubble when sonoluminescence occurs.\ncxqi | Methods\nqfmx | The details of experimental arrangement and procedure are presented in the previous paper.\nrut3 | Distilled water was sparged with a suitable noble gas for one hour before ultrasonic irradiation and in the course of spectra acquisition in a zero point five liter glass vessel placed in a thermostated water bath. The liquid was continuously rotated through the irradiation cell by using a peristaltic pump. Ultrasonic irradiation of water was carried out at three hundred thirty-seven kilohertz with total absorbed power of ultrasound fifteen point five watts checked calorimetrically. The temperature inside the cell was controlled by a thermistor and maintained at twenty-one plus or minus zero point five degrees Celsius. It was necessary from one to two hours for stabilizing the transducer output and for the liquid-gas system to achieve the equilibrium, as we worked at high enough intensity of ultrasound and with the cavitation field. After that time the spectra were a little modified because of the instability of cavitation field dynamics. To overcome this problem, spectra were collected and averaged from four to ten separate ones.\nm3cp | The ends of irradiation cell were fitted with the piezoceramic transducer and quartz window, respectively. The resulting sonoluminescence passed into a monochromator with the grating twelve hundred rulings per millimeter, which was blazed at two hundred fifty nanometers. The detector was a photomultiplier tube calibrated in two hundred to eight hundred nanometer intervals. The relative response function of the detection system was determined by a thirty watt deuterium lamp with measured spectral irradiance. Total sonoluminescence light power was obtained without a monochromator\nmq4s | when the ultrasonic cell was coupled directly with the photomultiplier tube. The resultant output of the photomultiplier was compared with that from a calibrated beta-light source with known spectral irradiance which gave three point seven times ten to the power of nine photons per second in the four hundred to six hundred nanometer interval. We did not use deuterium lamp or beta-light source data for the measurement of the spectral irradiance of sonoluminescence because of the big value of errors in both these cases. So sonoluminescence intensity is given in Figure one in relative units. The total light power of sonoluminescence is listed in Table one.\n95el | Spectra were collected with two nanometer increments in the two hundred twenty to five hundred nanometer interval as it is well-known that there are not any particular lines or bands in the region of the wavelengths higher than five hundred nanometers for the sonoluminescence spectra of distilled water. Ten measurements were acquired in each point and averaged. It was necessary around twenty minutes to get one spectrum. Separate spectra were smoothed by a method of successive iterations and averaged by four to ten values.\na0a5 | The noise level was measured and subtracted from the spectra. The signal-to-noise ratio depended on the sonoluminescence intensity and was deteriorated with the decrease of the wavelength. The lower value of signal-to-noise ratio was in the case of helium-saturated water approximately twenty at a maximum three hundred ten nanometers and approximately five at two hundred twenty nanometers. However, a typical value of the signal-to-noise ratio was much higher. For example, for argon-saturated water signal-to-noise ratio was more than one hundred at the maximum and approximately twenty at two hundred twenty nanometers.\ngocl | The yield of hydrogen peroxide was measured by the potassium-iodine colorimetric procedure after suitable time of irradiation of water in the cell with the inlet and outlet ports locked. These experiments were made simultaneously with total sonoluminescence light power measurements. The initial rates of hydrogen peroxide formation were determined as the slopes of the yield time curves.\n```",
