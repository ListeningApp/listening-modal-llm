The first indication of hydrothermal venting in the Jean Charcot troughs was a methane anomaly detected in the water column near the Starfish seamount during the KAIYO eighty-nine cruise. This anomaly was investigated on the SOLAVENTS cruise, which recovered fresh and\nmj9m | Research cruises in the late nineteen eighties to early nineteen nineties provided most of the geochemical data that we now have for the Jean Charcot troughs, but\n94h3 | Bathymetry\n9jx1 | MINERALIZATION AND ALTERATION OF THE TINAKULA SMS DEPOSIT\nc3lz | altered rhyodacite samples by dredging and recorded a number of temperature anomalies in the water column near the seafloor. Additional cruises in the area included the SEAPSO Leg two cruise, a GLORIA side-scan sonar survey, and the SOPACMAPS cruise. More recent work has been aimed at exploration for SMS deposits. The Tinakula deposit was discovered by Neptune Minerals, Incorporated, in September twenty eleven during the ASHR Leg two cruise aboard the MV Dorado Discovery. It is located in the Temotu Province within the exclusive economic zone of the Solomon Islands, approximately eight hundred ninety kilometers east-southeast of Guadalcanal. The discovery was initially made by locating the source of a seafloor-hugging hydrothermal plume, followed by dives with a remotely operated vehicle, which located sulfide chimneys. Additional mapping, ROV grab sampling, and shallow drilling occurred during four subsequent twenty eleven to twenty twelve cruises.\n8bwk | Host Rocks, Volcanology, and Structure\nez9s | The Tinakula SMS deposit is located at depths of one thousand seventy to one thousand two hundred four meters below sea level on the flank of the Starfish stratovolcano. The geology of the Tinakula area has been interpreted from seafloor observations and sampling during ROV dives,\nmqot | drill core logging, and analysis of newly acquired high-resolution (twenty centimeters) bathymetry. The bathymetry details reveal a strong structural control on volcanic and hydrothermal features.\noc99 | Volcanoes in the Tinakula area are composed of basaltic andesite (fifty-three point four to fifty-seven point three weight percent silicon dioxide) and dacite (sixty-three point zero to sixty-seven point nine weight percent silicon dioxide) and include composite cones, cinder cones, and the submarine equivalent of maars (craters without cones). The morphologies of these edifices are broadly similar to those of subaerial volcanoes, but the edifices are consistently smaller than their subaerial equivalents. In the central part of the map area, the volcanic cones are aligned along a large (approximately one point six kilometers long) north-south-trending fissure. The southern part of the fissure is dominated by a large composite cone with bimodal lava flows and blocky volcanic talus. This is followed northward by a nine hundred meter-long row of cinder cones, on which the deposit is centered, and two small maar-like craters at the northern end of the fissure. The volcanic material making up the cinder cones consists of variably altered basaltic andesite with vertical and lateral facies variations over several meters, including changes in clast size, shape, composition, and degree of sorting. The breccia facies include the following: (one)\ngipz | MINERALIZATION AND ALTERATION OF THE TINAKULA SMS DEPOSIT\nb4wj | monomict breccia characterized by clasts with glassy curviplanar margins, flow-banded phenocrysts, and local jigsaw-fit textures; (two) monomict breccia composed of vesicular volcanic clasts associated with variable amounts of juvenile clasts, glass shards, and crystal fragments and rare blocks or bombs; and (three) polymict breccia associated with mass-flow bedforms with rounded to subangular clasts, ranging from relatively unaltered to completely clay altered clasts. The predominant facies is massive to crudely bedded monomict breccia (lapillistone) with clasts containing up to twenty percent vesicles (uniformly distributed) and no evidence of welding. Basaltic-andesitic lava flows were the last products to be erupted along the row of cinder cones at Tinakula. These facies are consistent with cinder cones on land, which form via Strombolian-type eruptions, progressing from cone-building activity to lava flows during the waning stages as the magma loses most of its gas. Cinder cones of the type at Tinakula are generally considered to be monogenic, having formed during one eruptive cycle over a period of days to months.\n5xlt | Dark-colored mafic(?) volcaniclastic sediment covers most of the map area around the Tinakula deposit, interpreted to be fallout from nearby eruptions. The material ranges from coarse sand- to pebble-sized, with a few larger volcanic fragments or bombs (with elongate vesicles and quenched margins) and no fine ash-sized fraction. The sediment ranges in thickness from one point five to greater than eight meters and is massive to crudely bedded with weak grading. Abundant ripple marks are observed in the sediment, with large-scale dunes (up to seven meters wide and one hundred twenty-four meters long) visible in the bathymetric data.\n9bz4 | Two large (fifty-five to eighty-seven meter tall and three hundred twenty-seven to five hundred twelve meter wide) composite cones with dacite lava flows in the northwest corner of the mapped area appear to be unrelated to the central fissure. Large dacitic lava flows in the southwest corner of the map have a distinctly different morphology, with sinuous ridges that are characteristic of channelized flow. The relative ages of the flows are interpreted from ROV dive observations of sediment thickness, with higher degrees of sediment associated with older relative ages. The ages of these flows relative to other eruptions in the area are unknown.\nyfv2 | Deposit Geology",
