You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7c6p | Introduction
d1ee | Are we obligated to treat clients whose behaviors and atti- tudes may not be desirable or acceptable to us? To what de- gree should we try to do so before we decide to refer out? What attitudes and abilities explain the difference between a therapist who can interact successfully with a wide range of clients and one who attempts to do so but has less suc- cess with more challenging or disengaged clients? One key consideration in defining interpersonal excellence has been mentioned in the previous chapters; it is the willingness to pursue an empathically based understanding of each cli- ent. This allows therapists to accurately identify the critical interpersonal characteristics and events that are likely to complicate the therapeutic relationship. With respect to abilities, the primary means by which therapists may enact an empathic understanding of the client's interpersonal characteristics and events is by adjusting the enactment of his or her interpersonal styles (therapeutic modes) to best meet the needs of the client in a given moment.
itx4 | Initial Self-Assessment
vwrs | Before continuing, please turn to the end of this chapter and complete the Self-Assessment of Modes, Version III. This assessment is provided for you to begin to gain a greater understanding of the modes you might tend to utilize most frequently in a practice situation, and it is highly recommended that you complete this assessment before reading any fur- ther. This questionnaire is presented in Exercise 4.1 in the Exercises section. After responding to the questions in the exercise, you should continue read- ing the chapter. After reading the chapter, it is recom- mended that you score your responses to Exercise 4.1, complete the Personal Modes Profile, and then com- plete Exercise 4.2. It is recommended that you not score your responses until you have finished reading the chapter.
xjkw | CASE EXAMPLE 4.1 Margarita's Daughter
wght | Kamisha, an experienced occupational therapist certified in hand therapy, is assigned to work with Margarita Ramos. Ms. Ramos has recovered enough from her injury, described in Chapter 1, that she is now ready to begin working on the passive range of motion in her hand. Kamisha prefers the Tyromotion Amadeo® as a central approach for persons with Ms. Ramos' type of injury. The Amadeo® is an interactive technology that uses magnets to guide the hand in ways that increase range of motion. This technology has the capacity to accommodate passive stretching exercises as well as more interac- tive game work requiring clients to use the muscles in their hands. Kamisha enjoys the Amadeo® because it allows her to record the client's progress and grade the exercises according to the client's self-reported pain tolerance, overall development of range of motion, muscle strength, and control.
3lgb | For her first appointment, Kamisha encounters Ms. Ramos and her daughter in the waiting room. Kamisha introduces herself, deliberately making eye contact with Ms. Ramos, who remains seated.
ttwt | Kamisha: "Hello, Ms. Ramos, I am Kamisha, the occupational therapist who will be working with you to strengthen and rehabilitate your hand."
x5l2 | Before her mother can respond, Margarita's daughter rises quickly, towering over Kamisha, and shakes her hand firmly and rapidly, saying,
ilrs | Dr. Ramos: "Hello, Tamisha (mispronouncing her name), I have learned that you are a certified hand therapist. That's great (wearing an incongruent smile). I'm Dr. Ramos, Margarita's daughter. You can call her Margarita. I will be taking her to her appointments, when I can, and my mom has al- ready signed a HIPAA release allowing me to have access to all information pertinent to her care."
0a03 | Without thinking twice about it, Kamisha responds: Kamisha: "I always appreciate it when family members are involved in a client's care (empathizing mode). I am very pleased to meet you both. I look forward to our work together" (encouraging mode).
auae | Together, the three of them proceed into the upper extremity laboratory. Kamisha begins the session by explaining the role of the occupational therapist and by orienting Margarita to the various exercises and activi- ties that will occupy a good portion of her time during the next several weeks and by asking Margarita if she has any questions about the process. Outside of a con- cern about costs, which her daughter quickly resolves, Margarita does not have any questions. Kamisha continues the session by asking Margarita several questions about her various roles and daily activities as a spouse, parent, worker, and homemaker. When Margarita occasionally has difficulty expressing herself in English, her daughter speaks spontaneously on her behalf, sometimes embellishing the responses beyond what Margarita actually says. Though Kamisha has an average proficiency in Spanish, she is not very com- fortable speaking it, so she allows Dr. Ramos to con- tinue to take charge of the translating.
5b6y | After several questions, Margarita pauses, and, in Spanish, asks her daughter why Kamisha is asking so many personal questions. According to the IRM, this represents an interpersonal event (reluctance). Instead of asking Kamisha the same question, Dr. Ramos abruptly interrupts Kamisha and states that the questions are making her mother uncomfortable (another interpersonal event, resistance). Kamisha apologizes and asks Margarita, directly, if she wants her to stop asking the questions (collaborating mode). Margarita responds, again, by wanting to know why Kamisha is asking these questions. Kamisha then explains that her goal is to learn about her daily activ- ities so as to customize the treatment to the greatest extent possible. Margarita looks curious, so Kamisha continues to explain, maintaining eye contact with Margarita (rather than with her daughter):
1y10 | Kamisha: "The more relevant the treatment ac- tivities are to what you actually do in your daily life, the more likely it is that the home exercises I recommend will be more transferrable and suc- cessful in the long run" (instructing mode).
6mnx | Although Margarita appears to accept this expla- nation, her daughter does not. Dr. Ramos makes the following comment and abruptly leaves the room.
tynp | Dr. Ramos: "I understand that the chitchat is im- portant for your rapport-building, but my Mom's hand is the real priority, here. I want her to have as much time on the Amadeo® as possible." (speaking to her mother) "Mom, just have me paged when you are ready for your ride home."
ob0u | Taken aback, Kamisha pauses to collect her thoughts. At this point, Dr. Ramos has left the room, and Kamisha turns to Margarita to say: Kamisha: "Ms. Ramos, I respect your daughter's de- sire to ensure that you receive the best care possible (empathizing mode). Once I fully understand the occupations that are most important to you, I will make sure that you spend time on the Amadeo® and that you receive the high standard of care that I give to all of my clients" (instructing mode).
50o1 | It is becoming clear to Kamisha that Margarita's daughter places a high value on information-seeking and has a high need for control (a client interpersonal char- acteristic, in this case, attributable to the client's family member). The case example illustrates how Kamisha ef- fectively used the empathizing, encouraging, collaborat- ing, and instructing modes to address the interpersonal events that emerged during Margarita's first session.
