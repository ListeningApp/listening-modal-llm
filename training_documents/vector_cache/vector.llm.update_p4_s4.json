Although, the anterograde transport of GDNF to the substantia nigra may not be as effective on functional restoration as compared with retrograde transport, it may be beneficial not to overexpress proteins in stressed substantia nigra dopamine neurons in patients.\ny5r7 | Three. AAV to Target Substantia Nigra\nlrry | Taking into consideration the special characteristics of substantia nigra dopaminergic cells, targeting these neurons with AAV vectors can be challenging. For example, if a promoter driving a gene of interest is giving exceptionally high expression levels, this can naturally cause excessive protein accumulation and lead to further stress on the cells. Safe transduction of the dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra is an important aspect in therapeutic approaches, and there have been several studies testing AAV preparations to target substantia nigra dopamine neurons. It has been demonstrated that injection of AAV-GFP to the substantia nigra of rats showed long lasting expression in both the nigral areas, up to twenty-five months, and striatum, up to eighteen months. Similar results have been obtained in mice, with various vector serotypes able to label the whole substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, as well as the striatum. In regards to AAV-GFP and dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, studies in rats have shown that several different vector preparations carrying GFP are able to transduce TH-positive neurons effectively in the substantia nigra as well as in fibres of the striatum. Transduction efficiency of AAVs in substantia nigra neurons has also been tested successfully in monkeys, a relevant model when considering the clinical implication of viruses since the size differences between the rodent, primate, and human brain need to be taken into account, particularly concerning spreading. As such, studies have shown that injecting AAV-GFP to the substantia nigra of monkeys results in efficient transduction of the neuronal and dopaminergic cells of the substantia nigra. It is clear that choosing the virus serotype is dependent on the species and the areas or neurons that need to be transduced; therefore, selecting the correct preparation for one's experiment will depend on these factors. It is also evident that it is possible to transduce TH neurons in the substantia nigra with AAVs successfully.\nhvhm | In relation to neurotrophic factors, though they are usually given to the striatum, a study compared striatal and nigral delivery in rats where the AAV-NRTN was given simultaneously with the six-OHDA lesion. This was performed with an idea that enhancing the survival of the substantia nigra neurons by nigral AAV-NRTN injection may induce greater protection of the connecting striatal fibres. Indeed, the results showed that targeting both the striatum and substantia nigra was the most effective strategy. However, in the case of therapeutic proteins, the overall detrimental effects of overexpression of transgene or RNA can be hidden by the positive effect of the therapy itself. Specifically, using only a non-AAV control may not show the damaging effects. Moreover, caution should be exercised when trying to overexpress any proteins in dopamine neurons, as this can induce stress response pathways affecting their functions and survival. As a way to overcome the detrimental effect\n863b | of constitutive protein overexpression or to regulate signalling of neurotrophic factors that are known to be very potent, regulated vectors have been developed. A destabilizing domain that can be regulated with trimethoprim has been effectively used with AAVs carrying GDNF. A single AAV vector for tetracycline-regulated expression with rtTA has also been used for GDNF transgene expression in Parkinson's disease models. Mifepristone-controlled vectors have also been shown to restore motor function in the six-OHDA rat model of Parkinson's disease. The mifepristone-regulated vectors are based on binding to a human progesterone receptor, fused to a human p sixty-five transactivation domain and a yeast Gal four DNA-binding domain. As endogenous neurotrophic factors are biologically active at very low doses, these regulated approaches could be used for neurotrophic factor therapies and may be safer options for targeting substantia nigra dopamine neurons. However, similar to the regulated vectors that express any other foreign protein, there is caution to be considered since there are indications of astrocyte expression-mediated toxicity and a widespread inflammatory response caused by non-self transgenic protein overexpression.\nfj24 | Four.
