  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

5gui | ABSTRACT
82qc | Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) denotes the initiation of gene expression after fertilization. It is part of the complex oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET) in which a highly specialized cell - the oocyte - is fertil- ized and transformed into a zygote that gives rise to an embryo that will develop into a newborn. From the perspective of gene expression, the OET reflects reprogramming of germ cell gene expression into the new developmental program of the zygote. This reprogramming occurs at transcriptional and post- transcriptional levels. This review will discuss selected aspects of mammalian ZGA, highlighting shared features and evolved differences observed in commonly investigated mammals and non-mammalian model animals.

tzt3 | ultimately give rise to a new organism while the exchange the cell-governing system has to occur without disturbing cell's reg- ular business. The information for this logistical challenge is stored in ~108-109 nucleotides of nuclear DNA and the instructions con- tained therein must be executed in a zygote within a specific time frame. In highly complex human societies, changes in governing systems are accompanied with different degrees of chaos and anar- chy before new governing systems establish their control. This anthropomorphic perspective highlights how effectively natural selection has optimized the oocyte-to-embryo-transition (OET) so that its logistics1 is executed in a timely and orderly fashion.

qvnu | The initiation of animal development varies. The egg size, yolk distribution, cleavage pattern, and gene activation are among the notably diversified features. Yet, at least three themes appear com- mon across the animal kingdom: rapid cell cleavage, "maturation" of chromatin structures, and a delayed onset of zygotic transcrip- tion (for a review of diversity of OET, see, for example, [1]). This review will focus on mammalian ZGA and examine commonalities and differences among mammals and other animals.
kggw | There are over five thousand extant species of placental mammals representing clades, that radiated primarily after the Cretaceous-Paleogene event 65-66 million years ago [2]. Two mammalian model systems have been studied the most: Homo sapiens and Mus musculus, the latter being the most experimen- tally manipulated mammalian species. However, extant mammals exhibit extreme diversity in size, habitat occupation, and locomo- tion adaptation [3]. Mammalian radiation did not occur at the same pace in terms of speciation and genome evolution; Mus musculus belongs to a group that radiated extensively [4]. The mouse genome evolved faster than that of larger mammals such as humans or bovine because it could produce more generation cycles per a given unit of time. This should be kept in mind when interpreting mouse model data because many traits observed in mice could repre- sent recently evolved characteristics rather than common ancestral traits present in all mammals.
xrd1 | 2. Early development in animals - the placenta
5746 | Initiation of development in placental mammals differs from other animals such as Caenorhabditis, Drosophila, zebrafish, Xeno- pus or chicken where the fertilized egg will exclusively give rise to a gastrulating embryo. In non-mammalian models, the initial cleav- age typically employs rapid cell cycles (sea urchin or Drosophila~10 min, zebrafish ~15 min, Xenopus ~35 min [5]) with little if any tran- scription of the genome (reviewed in [6]). Different mechanisms may regulate the delayed onset of ZGA (reviewed in [7,8])
7toz | Zygotic cleavage in early mammalian development may not be a homologous process to cleavage in non-mammalian species. In mammals (mice, humans, bovine), the initial rate of cleavage is slow while extraembryonic and embryonic lineages are not yet sep- arated. By the time the first cleavage of mouse zygotes is complete, the above-mentioned non-mammalian models have developed far beyond gastrulation (Fig. A). Accordingly, it was proposed that early mammalian development should be aligned with early development of other animals by gastrulation (and not fertiliza- tion) to account for the rapid cleavage non-mammalian metazoan zygotes, which appears rather homologous to the accelerated peri- gastrulation cycles in placental mammals [6]. According to this model, fertilization in mammals occurs at a comparatively ear- lier stage in oocyte development with added cleavage steps before extraembryonic and embryonic lineages are separated [6]. Thus, mammalian preimplantation development should be considered a derived characteristic that evolved in ancestors of placental mam- mals as an adaptation of terrestrial life.
j346 | 3. Early development in mammals and animals - the time issue
v8uq | Numerous experiments in different model systems indicate that zygotic gene products become essential for development only at specific stages that vary among the studied animals. For example, transcriptional inhibition in zebrafish or Xenopus embryos results in gastrulation defects, but does not prevent cleavage [9,10]. In Drosophila, absence of transcription will prevent cellularization, but preceding cell cycles will occur [11]. Consequently, analysis
x972 | of RNA synthesis showed that zygotic transcription appears with a species-specific delay after fertilization (reviewed in [8]).
cwrw | While the very first transcripts may be difficult to detect, the first major wave of RNA synthesis and transcript accumulation occurs at a specific stage of development. The first major surge in RNA synthesis is traditionally denoted the major ZGA wave and is char- acterized by a global change in gene expression that is essential for continued development. Importantly, some RNA synthesis, tradi- tionally denoted minor ZGA, can be detected prior to major ZGA (reviewed <LATEX>\left. i n \left[ 1 \right] \right) .</LATEX> However, this traditional distinction has been undermined by next generation sequencing (NGS) methods, which show that transcription at many loci expressed during major ZGA is also detectable at earlier time points.
4i0e | ZGA timing was proposed to be controlled by nucleo- cytoplasmic ratio changes during cleavage where the geometric increase of genomic DNA titrates transcriptional repression [10], a notion supported by experimental data in zebrafish embryos [12]. More recently, it has been proposed that the concentration of non-DNA bound core histones determines the time for the onset of transcription. The reduction in nuclear histone concentration that coincides with genome activation does not affect nucleosome density on DNA, but would allow transcription factors to compete successfully for DNA binding [13].
h2l3 | Major ZGA in mouse embryos occurs at the 2-cell stage while in other mammals it is delayed several divisions (4-16-cell), although more sensitive NGS data suggest that transcription initiates earlier [14,15]. In terms of major ZGA among mammals, mice are "early genome activators" while humans and bovine are "later genome activators". It is likely that the early genome activation in mice is a derived characteristic while humans and bovine represent a more ancestral state. However, the early/late distinction is relative. Mice undergo major ZGA after the first cleavage (~19 h after fertilization) <LATEX>\begin{array}{} { \text { but at a } m } \\ { \text { Xenonus } \left( \right. } \end{array}</LATEX> much later time than major ZGA occurs in zebrafish (~4h), (~ 6h), or Drosophila (~2.5h) [8]).
dfzb | It is important to highlight that mammalian OET needs only a few replication cycles for ZGA to reprogram embryonic cells to pluripotency. This contrasts with the time and large number of replication cycles needed for artificial establishment of pluripo- tency in cultured cells [16]. In fact, it has been noted that the number of cell divisions is a key parameter driving epigenetic reprogramming to pluripotency [17]. As mentioned above, other animals (whose development is often deterministic) have multiple cleavages in a short time prior to ZGA while mouse zygotes undergo major ZGA after the first cleavage. Mammalian cell biochemistry is presumably not much different from that of invertebrates. Thus, the "a few days, a few cleavages" mode of OET in mammals appears to be a unique mode of the initiation of development. Only by better understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms can we hope for further improvement in our ability to reprogram cell-fate. Of importance are the replication-dependent and independent chro- matin changes in 1-cell and 2-cell mouse zygotes.
u6ty | 4. Chromatin dynamics during ZGA in mice
awvu | While there is a complex relationship between chromatin struc- ture, transcription, and post-transcriptional processing, repro- gramming gene expression is a matter of the ability of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to access promoters, which is based on chromatin structure and available transcription factors. Chromatin is extensively remodeled between the 1-cell and 2-cell stages (reviewed in [18-20]). Importantly, both parental genomes remain separated in female and male pronuclei that do not fuse in the 1- cell zygote. Instead of fusing, nuclear envelopes of pronuclei break down during the first cleavage and embryonic nuclei accommodat- ing both parental genomes form in 2-cell blastomeres. Reviewing

(B) Comparison of NGS data for total RNA and polyA RNA [65,99]. Each point represents relative exon reads per million per kilobase (FPKM) value of the ratio between fertilized and unfertilized eggs. Red points represent genes proposed to represent the conserved core of minor ZGA genes for humans and mice [15]. Note an apparent shift in relative polyA RNA abundance upon fertilization, which could be interpreted as transcriptional activation, but likely reflects changes in polyadenylation because the NGS data does not indicate a relative increase in total RNA.
h27a | in detail the contribution of chromatin to OET is beyond the scope of this work, which will focus just on two key aspects of chromatin structure: (i) the protamine/histone exchange after fertilization, (ii) dynamics of chromatin on the eve of ZGA.
pdjh | 4.1. Protamine/histone exchange
xmgs | In contrast to the maternal genome, which maintains nucleosome-based chromatin structure with global histone mod- ification patterns similar to those of somatic cells (reviewed in [18]), paternal chromatin undergoes major remodeling because the elementary protein component of the sperm chromatin are protamine molecules. Consequently, paternal histone mod- ifications are essentially erased together with the nucleosomal chromatin structure during spermatogenesis in a process of protamine/histone exchange (reviewed <LATEX>\left. \mathrm { i n } \left[ 2 1 , 2 2 \right] \right) .</LATEX> Importantly, <LATEX>1 - 1 0</LATEX> of histones are retained in the mouse and human sper- matozoa, respectively [23]. These residual histones carry specific modifications and thir retention does not appear random [23]. The H3K4me2 (active) mark was found in promoters of genes involved in spermatogenesis and cellular homeostasis, while the H3K27me3 (repressive) mark was associated with developmental promoters. It was proposed that residual histones contribute to paternal het- erochromatin formation in human zygotes [24]. However, other studies suggested that nucleosome retention is predominantly associated with gene deserts and not developmental promoters (summarized in [25]). Therefore, the significance of nucleosome retention for OET remains unclear.
bd9h | Upon fertilization, protamine/histone exchange takes place in reverse in order with help from the histone chaperone HIRA to establish nucleosome chromatin structure of the paternal genome [26]. The consequence of the protamine/histone exchange is that the paternal genome initiates its journey at the beginning of development with "naïve" nucleosome chromatin structures. This correlates with the bulk of initial RNA synthesis in mouse zygotes which takes place in the male pronucleus (Fig. A).
m047 | 4.2. Chromatin dynamics
gy8c | Chromatin dynamics is a broadly used term covering changes of covalent modifications of DNA and histones as well as DNA acces- sibility and higher order chromatin organization into chromatin domains (topologically associating domains - TADs). Because this review focuses on transcriptional aspects of the genome activation, it will only highlight selected aspects of chromatin dynamics.
y4mj | The most common covalent mammalian DNA modification is 5-methyl cytosine (5mC) (reviewed, for example in [27]). It is a classic epigenetic mark that does not alter DNA sequence, but can carry heritable information (for further reading see [28]). While there is an ongoing debate regarding causes and consequences of DNA methylation with respect to regulation of transcription [27], DNA methylation has been generally associated with transcrip- tional silencing and genome maintenance through repression of parasitic sequences.
vpgq | DNA methylation in the mammalian germline undergoes two reprogramming events, in which existing DNA methylation is largely eliminated (reviewed in [29]). In mouse zygotes, maternal and paternal genomes show two distinct demethylation patterns upon staining with a 5mC-recognizing antibody. The paternal genome rapidly loses 5mC signal (6-8 hours after fertilization) while the maternal genome gradually reduces methylation dur- ing cleavage-stage development [30,31]. The overall loss of DNA methylation is associated with reduction of repressive chromatin. The molecular mechanism of 5mC loss entails oxidation into 5- hydroxymethyl cytosine (5hmC) by TET dioxygenase and base excision repair (reviewed in [32]). Active paternal DNA demethy- lation in the zygote is found in many mammals, but is not entirely conserved [33-35] and is incomplete [36]. Apart from imprinted loci, which retain their parent-of-origin methylation pattern in imprinting control regions, intracisternal A-particle (IAP), an active murine endogenous retrovirus also remains methylated despite global demethylation [37].
