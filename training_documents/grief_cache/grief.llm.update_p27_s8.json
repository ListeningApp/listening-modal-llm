Even when the death is expected and follows a progressive deteriorating illness, when the phone call finally comes, it can still cause the survivor to experience shock and disbelief.\n9vl6 | Yearning\nc2fd | Yearning for the lost person is what the British call pining. Parkes has noted that pining is a common experience of survivors, particularly among the widows he studied. Yearning is a normal response to loss. When it diminishes, it may be a sign that mourning is coming to an end. When it does not come to an end, it may be a clinical sign indicating complicated mourning. See Chapter five for a discussion of prolonged grief as one of the complications of mourning, and the place of yearning in its diagnosis.\njzvp | Emancipation\nf71y | Emancipation can be a positive feeling after a death. I worked with a young woman whose father was a real potentate, a heavy-handed,\n31e1 | Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy\n40ry | unbending dictator over her existence. After his sudden death from a heart attack, she went through the normal grief feelings, but she also expressed a feeling of emancipation because she no longer had to live under his tyranny. At first, she was uncomfortable with this feeling, but later she was able to accept it as the normal response to her changed status.\nd1j2 | Relief\nwstc | Many people feel relief after the death of a loved one, particularly if the loved one suffered a lengthy or particularly painful illness. \"The knowing that his suffering, both physical and mental, is over helps me cope,\" said one elderly widow. This can also occur when the death involves a person with whom the mourner has had a particularly difficult and often lifelong relationship. Sometimes relief is the reaction following a completed suicide after a long series of suicide attempts. However, a sense of guilt often accompanies this sense of relief.\nba1e | Numbness\nen95 | It's also important to mention that some people report a lack of feelings. After a loss, they feel numb. Again, this numbness is often experienced early in the grieving process, usually right after the person learns of the death. It probably occurs because there are so many feelings to deal with, that to allow them all into consciousness would be overwhelming, so the person experiences numbness as a protection from this flood of feelings. Commenting on numbness, Parkes and Weiss have said, \"We found no evidence that it is an unhealthy reaction. Blocking of sensation as a defense against what would otherwise be overwhelming pain would seem to be extremely 'normal'\".\nl3do | As you review this list, remember that each of these items listed represents normal grief feelings and there is nothing pathological about any one of them. However, feelings that exist for abnormally long periods of time and at excessive intensity may portend a complicated grief reaction. This is discussed in Chapter five.\nu9bo | Physical Sensations\n7avo | One of the interesting things about Lindemann's paper is that he describes not only the emotions that people experienced, but also the physical sensations associated with their acute grief reactions. These sensations are often overlooked, but they play a significant role in the\nuzo6 | Attachment, Loss, and the Experience of Grief\n89b4 | grieving process. The following is a list of the most commonly reported sensations experienced by the people we see for grief counseling:\n5f7e | Hollowness in the stomach\nh83u | Tightness in the chest\nkjoa | Tightness in the throat\nwb1c | Oversensitivity to noise\nak13 | A sense of depersonalization: \"I walk down the street and nothing seems real, including me.\"\ns7el | Breathlessness, feeling short of breath\n0lfu | Weakness in the muscles\ncnjl | Lack of energy\nrtdl | Dry mouth\nnorp | Many times, these physical sensations are of concern to the survivor, and he or she may come to the physician for a checkup. If so, physicians need to inquire about deaths and losses as part of their diagnostic evaluation.\nchx3 | Cognitions\nsfcf | There are many different thought patterns that mark the experience of grief. Certain thoughts are common in the early stages of grieving and usually disappear after a short time. But sometimes thoughts persist and trigger feelings that can lead to depression or anxiety.\nnuxs | Disbelief\numx0 | \"It didn't happen. There must be some mistake. I can't believe it happened. I don't want to believe it happened.\" These are often the first thoughts to occur after hearing of a death, especially if the death was sudden. One young widow said to me, \"I keep waiting for someone to wake me and tell me I'm dreaming.\" Another said, \"The passing of my husband came as a shock although he had been sick for some time. You are never quite ready for it.\"\no306 | Confusion\nqm1b | Many newly bereaved people say their thinking is very confused, they can't seem to order their thoughts, they have difficulty concentrating, or they forget things. I once went out for a social evening in Boston and took a cab home. I told the driver where I wanted to go and sat back while he proceeded down the road. A little later he asked me again\nn9ms | Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy\nicdp | where I wanted to go. I thought maybe he was a new driver and did not know the city, but he commented to me that he had a lot on his mind. A little later he asked again and then apologized and said that he was feeling very confused. This happened several more times, and finally I decided it would not hurt to ask him what was on his mind. He told me that his son had been killed the week before in a traffic accident.\nwtse | Preoccupation\nbm7g | Preoccupations can be obsessive thoughts about the deceased. These often include obsessive thoughts about how to recover the lost person. Sometimes preoccupation takes the form of intrusive thoughts or images of the deceased suffering or dying. In our Harvard Child Bereavement Study, surviving parents with the highest levels of intrusive thoughts were those who unexpectedly lost a spouse with whom they had a highly conflicted relationship. Rumination is another form of preoccupation. People engaging in ruminative coping think persistently and repetitively about how bad they feel and about the circumstances that precipitated their feelings.\njr68 | Sense of Presence\naxix | This is the cognitive counterpart to the experience of yearning. The grieving person may think that the deceased is somehow still in the current area of time and space. This can be especially true during the time shortly after the death. In our study of bereaved children, eighty-one percent of the children felt watched by their dead parent four months after the death, and this experience continued for many of the children sixty-six percent two years after the death. Some found this sense of presence comforting, while others did not and were scared by it.\n05y4 | Hallucinations\n2fb0 | Hallucinations of both the visual type and the auditory type are included in this list of normal behaviors because hallucinations can be a frequent experience of the bereaved. They are usually transient illusory experiences, often occurring within a few weeks following the loss, and generally do not portend a more difficult or complicated mourning experience. Although disconcerting to some, many others find these experiences comforting. With all the interest in mysticism and spirituality, it is interesting to speculate whether these are really hallucinations or possibly some other kind of metaphysical phenomenon.\ns9fn | Attachment, Loss, and the Experience of Grief\n```",
