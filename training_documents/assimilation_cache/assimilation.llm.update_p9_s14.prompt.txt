You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

2nib | The data influence only the forecasting and filtering means but not the variance ma- trices which, in principle, can all be computed in advance. In practical applications, the problem of computing or estimating the covariance matrices becomes important. For those <LATEX>i</LATEX> for which no observations are available, the filtering distribution and the forecast- ing distribution agree.
naev | The basic reanalysis Algorithm 20.2 can also be rewritten in terms of matrix opera- tions for this situation [121].
7h0h | 20.6 - Numerical Example
a64c | The following numerical example illustrates the results of Kalman filtering and reanalysis. The example uses the one-dimensional process model <LATEX>x _ { i } = \alpha x _ { i - 1 } + \xi _ { i }</LATEX> for <LATEX>i = 1 , \ldots , 3 0 ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>\alpha = 0 . 8</LATEX> and
gi7n | <LATEX>\xi _ { i } \sim N \left( 0 , q ^ { 2 } \right) , \quad q = 0 . 4 .</LATEX> The value <LATEX>x _ { 0 }</LATEX> is drawn from a standard normal distribution. A typical sequence is plotted in black in Figure 20.2. The data model is <LATEX>y _ { i } = b _ { i } x _ { i } + \zeta _ { i } ,</LATEX> where
3pn1 | <LATEX>\begin{array}{} { \zeta _ { i } \sim N \left( 0 , r ^ { 2 } \right) , \quad r = 0 . 1 ; \quad h _ { i } = \left\{ \begin{array}{} 0 . 1 , \quad i = 1 1 , \ldots , 2 0 , & \\ 1 , \quad i = 1 , \ldots , 1 0 , 2 1 , \ldots , 3 0 . & \end{array} \right. } \end{array} ,</LATEX> The data model is set up so that for <LATEX>i = 1 1 , \ldots , 2 0 ,</LATEX> there is a period of "low observability." Figure 20.2 shows a single realization of the true process, the filtering estimates, and the reanalysis estimates. It is clear that these estimates are not the same. As expected, all estimates are much closer to the true values where

Forecasting standard deviations are always larger than

During the interval of low observability (i = 11, ... ,20), all these standard deviations are larger. Also plotted in the same figure (thin lines) are the forecasting errors x; - xili-1 (black), filtering errors x; - Xii (blue), and reanalysis errors x; - XIN (red) for a single realization.
ed6e | 20.7 . Extensions
6qqm | The Kalman filter and reanalysis algorithms have theoretical and practical limitations if the error distributions are not Gaussian or if the process model is nonlinear. In the latter case, even Gaussian errors typically become immediately non-Gaussian, and biases (sys- tematic errors) appear. Another practical difficulty arises because in weather forecasting or climate science temporal and spatial features may lead to state variables with millions of components, with error covariance matrices with 1012 or more entries.
onum | 20.7.1 - Extended Kalman Filter
3iir | Nonlinear process and data models are often handled by linearization. The resulting al- gorithm is known as the extended Kalman filter. In essence, it uses the nonlinear process model (without noise terms) to compute the forecasting estimate and uses linearization about the most recent filtering estimate to compute the forecasting covariance and the gain matrix. The filtering estimate and its covariance are then computed from these quantities more or less in the same way as in Algorithm 20.3. This approach works well in engineer- ing applications with a modest number of process variables but quickly becomes infea- sible in high-dimensional situations. Variational methods for data assimilation that were mentioned earlier can avoid these difficulties but do not readily produce an assessment of errors.
7a0a | 20.7.2 - Ensemble Kalman Filter
o1qp | The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKf), introduced in the 1990s, uses stochastic simulation techniques known as Monte Carlo methods; [21] is a review article by one of the inventors of EnKf. The archetypical use for a Monte Carlo approach is the computation of an expected value & F (X) of a random variable X with density fx(x). Formally, the definition is &F(X) = [ F(x)fx(x)dx, where the integral is over the space in which X takes its values. Numerical computation of the integral is essentially impossible if the dimension of X exceeds 10 or so. In a Monte Carlo approach, one draws m independent random samples x(1 : m) from the distribution of X and approximates the expected value,
jrik | F(x(i)). (20.22)
xv78 | By the law of large numbers, the right-hand side converges almost surely to the correct expected value as m -> 0, and the speed of convergence can be determined (it is always slow).
sdks | For a simple version of EnKf, we assume a nonlinear process model,
y8fb | (20.23)
521q | where the M; are functions from the range of the X(i) to itself. All other assumptions are left unchanged-the model errors ; are Gaussian, there is a linear data model (20.17),
yogo | Chapter 20. Data Assimilation
2285 | and the background state is Gaussian, X(0) ~ N(u,2). Suppose we are given an estimate & ;_ 1|i-1 of the filtering mean at i-1, an estimate [ ;_ ][-] of the filtering covariance matrix at this time step, and an estimate N($ ;_ ][-], [-][-1) of the distribution of X(i -1)|y(1 : i -1). For the simulation, draw m independent samples x. Xi-1|i-1 (j =1, ... , m) from this distribution, propagate them forward with the process, and add simulated model errors n; ~ N(O, Q;) that have the same distribution as the model errors &; at this time step. The result is an ensemble of simulated forecasts,

7zvp | The forecasting estimate is now computed as the sample mean of this ensemble,
