You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

1x9z | People become deranged by following what they assume to be spiritual ways, by trying to do what is not only impossible but absurd.
4235 | I would list the harping on the fear of death rather than equally upon its importance as a transition-phenomenon, and also the misguided search for 'security' of implanted obsession (often believed to be faith but in reality only dogmatism) as the two most frequent causes of the sorrow and trouble to which you refer.
8xlb | There are two quatrains in Persian by the eminent Ustad Khalilullah Khalili, a great contemporary Sufi, on this. Just com- pare his emphases with the contextless ones which so many people imagine to be spirituality.
j21f | DEATH AND MOUNTAINS
jftb | In the first* he says:
gj9e | 'I fear not death, for it is my helper ... It took my forefathers to their destination: This elegant and easy-paced conveyance of mine!
12a1 | In the other, he speaks of conditioning, crystallised into stupefy- ing but useless rigidity, as a mountain, and the flexibility of the understanding Seeker as a bird: in an observation of the bird to the mountain:
ucuv | O Mountain! High and mighty, reaching into the skies. How you seem absorbed in self-regarding. Although only a small bird, yet I am free To dance on a flowerhead, while your feet are in chains .. .**
2tn9 | Shock-Teaching
0g39 | Q: Could you tell us a Sufi shock-teaching technique?
3qn6 | A: Sufi teaching techniques strongly feature the challenging statement, made in order to cause a multiple effect upon the hearer.
65yq | Mansur Hallaj, notoriously, said: 'I am God!' for precisely this reason.
p4rq | If someone in the West says, in slightly more contemporary language: 'Hitler was a great man!' the shock of this will cause the hearer to react, instantly .* In some people it will make them realise for the first time what it is like to hear such a statement, what the people who used to say this were like. It will also cause some to realise that, perhaps, the question as to Hitler's greatness or otherwise is irrelevant to their own situation. It will make some realise that they are obsessed by this 'greatness' or otherwise, revealing how their opinions can be triggered by the use of a phrase. In some it will show how almost any sequence of words can be used to 'programme' people and to cause 'belief or 'opposi- tion'.
33o8 | This is the technique sometimes used by Omar Khayyam and his school.
fopo | Unless this is understood, of course, Khayyam cannot be under- stood, because some academics take his words at their face value. When he says: 'Every violet is a beauty-mole from some former beloved', they must imagine that this is reincarnation or poetic imagery, when it is in fact 'shock'. The theory of reincarnation was a heresy in his culture.
b12h | The Sufi literature is full of this kind of experiential teaching-
vk7m | material. Its presence effectively filters out the superficial and the shallow.
39f8 | People are conditioned to like certain remarks and to dislike others. This is almost always useful, until one gets to the point where hypocrisy takes advantage of the prevailing postures and enables people to manipulate situations and evade reality. Again, there are examples available in every culture in which people are not permitted by convention to say certain things which are true, because if they do they are regarded as immodest, boastful or hostile to others. This sort of preservation of the status quo may be good or it may be bad. Sometimes it produces 'tunnel vision *.
upcg | In order to act upon such situations, or to point out the limita- tions of coercive custom, some of the greatest Sufis have not shrunk from risking the most extreme opprobrium. I do not think that their contribution in this respect has yet been equalled.
qzb9 | SILENCE AND SPEECH
acan | One good example is found in Hujwiri's Revelation of the Veiled (Nicholson's translation, 1911):
j623 | 'I have read in the Anecdotes that one day when Abu-Bakr Shibli [one of the most eminent of the ancient Sufis] was walking in the Karkh quarter of Baghdad he heard an impostor saying: "Silence is better than speech".
d7ly | 'Shibli replied: "Thy silence is better than thy speech, but my speech is better than my silence, because thy speech is vanity and thy silence is an idle jest, whereas my silence is modesty and my speech is silence."
plf9 | Anyone who imagines that Shibli was acting in this way because he had a bad temper, or that he was impatient or straying beyond modesty is in need of such Sufi shock-teaching, since such an individual would not yet have learnt that there is a possibility that someone whom he regards (through conditioning) as out of order may in reality be uttering what is in fact an exact description of prevailing circumstances.
vk11 | The main objection to supposedly immodest words is that they have a bad effect upon the person who speaks them, or teach
jj0l | observe.' to be 'immodest' and not humble. In the case of such a person as Shibli, his status was (and is) such that the former is not possible, and the latter interpretation could not occur: since Shibli was known to be wholly veracious.
qdqt | This attitude may seem odd to people not accustomed to it. 'Oddness of appearance is not contradiction of fact' as the saying goes.
6h7m | It is conditioning, as much as ignorance, which perpetuates the ignorance of humanity stressed by Khalili* when he speaks of the world and humanity's place in it:
b6vb | Performers and spectators of the arena are we Bewildered at our work and at the world's We, little playthings in the hand of Time: Made to dance each time its tune is played!
c5h2 | Emotional Expectations
eccu | Q: Why docs a Sufi group go on, sometimes for years, reading books, meeting and apparently not getting anything done, without any measurement of its progress, and without a sense of how things are going?
rtpq | A: Such a group has to 'wear out' emotional expectations. It also has to provide circumstances in which the irrelevant and customary associations, characteristics brought in from other systems may be displayed and observed, so that everyone can see what is central and what is not. If the members of the group are not seeing these things, it is not a Sufic group at all. Much of its visible work is that of a 'preparatory group'. This does not mean that it might not be extremely important: for where else are you going to obtain this opportunity of living through and observing your reactions and those of others, outside of social groupings where the lessons are either obscured or twisted to provide super- ficial, tribal-type, conclusions?
po9y | If you refer again to the published narratives which illustrate the coming-together of people, the effect of interchanges to show up unworthy or irrelevant behaviour or the uselessness of facile inter- pretation, you will find the material against which you can check the behaviour of people in such a group, if you are in one.
