In a spirit identical to the renormal- isation group but in the much simpler setting of one just degree of freedom, we can define a modified generating functional\nv5pj | Z sub k of J equals integral dx e to the power of negative two V of x over Upsilon minus one-half R of k x squared plus Jx\ntrab | with an additional quadratic term controlled by an arbitrary function R of k of a parameter k, satisfying limit as k approaches zero R of k equals zero, giving back the original Z of J. Correlation functions are generated by W sub k of J equals ln Z sub k of J via\ngrxs | chi sub k equivalent to the expectation value of x sub k equals the partial derivative of W sub k of J with respect to J, the expectation value of x squared sub k minus chi sub k squared equals the partial derivative squared of W sub k of J with respect to J squared\nu9dn | et cetera. In the limit k equals zero and after setting J equals zero the usual predictions of the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution are recovered.\nt25w | The source J has been considered as an external, inde- pendent variable controlling expectation values such as chi and higher correlators. One could also consider chi as the independent variable, solving chi equals the partial derivative of W with respect to J for J of chi and defining the effective potential U of chi via a Legendre transform\nx62u | Gamma sub k of chi plus W sub k of J equals J chi minus one-half R of k chi squared\naoc8 | Gamma of chi equivalent to two U of chi over Upsilon\n3mdu | The partial derivative of Gamma sub k with respect to chi equals J sub k minus R of k chi\nm04v | implying that the minimum of the effective potential de- fines the equilibrium expectation value of x (at J equals zero and\n3aip | k equals limit d k equals zero). Generating function W sub k of J on k can be easily obtained as\nq3gu | The partial derivative sub k W sub k of J equals negative one-half partial derivative sub k R times the quantity partial derivative squared W sub k of J with respect to J squared plus the quantity partial derivative W sub k of J with respect to J squared\ntxab | which is an \"RG equation\" for W sub k of J. We can also obtain an equation determining how Gamma sub k of chi runs with k. Recip- rocally, taking chi independent variable, J becomes the derivative function of chi and k. Taking a k derivative of (A6) at fixed chi we obtain\ndov0 | The partial derivative sub k Gamma sub k of chi equals one-half partial derivative sub k R times the partial derivative squared W sub k with respect to J squared\nxd5o | To express the right-hand side in terms of Gamma sub k of chi, consider the first relation of (A3). Taking a chi derivative we find\n3gny | The quantity partial derivative squared Gamma sub k with respect to chi squared plus R times partial derivative squared W sub k with respect to J squared equals one\nws73 | Hence, the \"RG flow\" of Gamma is determined by\nvyos | The partial derivative sub k Gamma sub k of chi equals one-half partial derivative sub k R times the quantity partial derivative squared Gamma with respect to chi squared plus R to the negative one\nw4hq | Note also that, at\nghbe | k approaches zero the expectation value of x squared minus chi squared equals Upsilon over two partial derivatives with respect to chi squared U of chi sub eq\n1lkf | and hence the variance at equilibrium is determined by the curvature of the effective potential around its minimum.\n```",
