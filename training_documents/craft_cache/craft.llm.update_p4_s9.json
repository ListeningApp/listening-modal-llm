        "content": "uooz | One common feature of the articles with multiple formal propositions is that in all of them the propositions are labeled as such (P one, P two, etc.) in the relevant figure. This is immensely helpful for guiding the reader through the propositions and for linking the text to the figure. Even in articles without propositions, figures and tables are well integrated with the text. As one is constructing a paper, it is important to visualize the final published piece, with the tables and figures embedded adjacent to the ideas being ex-\npxbq | plained. This requires conscious effort, since when we prepare manuscripts for submission, we append the figures and tables to the end of the document, which may make it more likely that they are treated as afterthoughts (i.e., out of sight, out of mind). Effective authors not only use figures and tables that correspond to the text (e.g., same construct labels) but also actively integrate them (e.g., by giving an overview or by referring to them periodically in the text). While it is true, as Sutton and Staw noted, that \"diagrams are not theory,\" these accessories can be powerful tools for clarifying and enhancing the theoretical ideas in a paper.\njfsr | CONCLUSION\nu15r | The purpose of this exercise is not to provide an exhaustive review on the subject, nor is it to recommend a particular template for theoretical articles for AMR. Indeed, as the ten Best Articles illustrate, there is no single, most-preferred way to write a paper for AMR. Just as good theoretical contributions can emerge from a range of disciplinary and epistemological camps, good manuscript craftsmanship emerges from conscious attention to a variety of structural elements. The point is to illustrate that with relatively little effort invested (e.g., downloading and studying a handful of papers), one can learn a lot about how successful authors leverage the structure of a manuscript to aid in effectively communicating their theoretical contribution. Aspiring authors may also want to examine the structure of other AMR articles that they especially like or often cite, which \"means looking at-rather than through-our more persuasive writings.\"\nlq35 | In a theoretical paper the author is faced with a mixed blessing: greater freedom and page length within which to develop theory but also more editorial rope with which to hang him or herself. Consequently, structure and writing are arguably even more critical for the success of this type of work than for an empirical paper. As we have seen from this selective review of award-winning articles published in AMR, there is no \"one best way\" to structure a theory paper. What these pieces do share in common is the thoughtful and careful matching of manuscript form and structure to the theoretical purpose of the paper, which enables the reader to see\n3g9w | clearly through the window to the big ideas beyond.",
