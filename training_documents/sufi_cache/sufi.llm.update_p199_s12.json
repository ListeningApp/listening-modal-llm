        "content": "5176 | It is for such reasons as these that spiritual teachers have traditionally followed secular jobs or been administrators or skilled in many crafts: they are teaching through a variety of methods. Only their spoken teaching, or their gymnastic or prayer teachings, however, are recognised as teaching of a higher kind by external thinkers. As a result, most of what they have been doing is not recorded or regarded as extraneous or irrelevant.\n7m3r | Just as the random collections of people and tension, anxiety, reward and punishment and the application of dogmas and fixed techniques produce conditioned people and rigid or mechanical institutions so - in the 'organic' field of what we call evolutionary philosophy - the community with the right elements (people, time and place, for example) comes into living being and grows in a\n63ep | special manner undreamt of by the stilted formal thinker and the wild emotionalist alike.\nts0t | The foregoing explains how, if we pause to think for a moment, metaphysical teachers have operated systems which, far from being limited to the simple techniques and doctrines attributed to them, have necessarily consisted of an amazingly comprehensive design.\nw1nk | Only parts of this design have the tenacity to remain in ordinary transmission. Like driftwood, they are continually thrown up, or used again and again, long after their real use (as parts of their original ship) has vanished.\na1t2 | It therefore becomes seemingly paradoxical (though only because people approach things from a consistently naive viewpoint) that many of the essential parts of higher knowledge would never be recognised as such by those types who tend to regard themselves as students of metaphysics.\npry5 | A 'tall, tired, tinker, totally tattered, trying to tinker a ten-penny tin teakettle' is just as likely to be a spiritual teacher as the saint with the halo drawn by some pious but unregenerate individual.\nn2xe | He is far more likely to have something worthwhile to communicate, certainly, than the metaphysician who regards him as a tinker alone because he is not familiar with the terminology of this ritual or that.\nz3xf | Unless this lesson is learnt, in one manner or another—and it has many forms—study and practice alike, formal or otherwise, are bankrupt except for the purpose of keeping people occupied: whatever they may think, or may be told, that they are doing.\n4t2v | It is interesting to note how traditional warnings against random groupings actually work out to be justified when one observes them. Saadi said, in a famous passage, that one dog will pollute a whole pool of rosewater. But as near as we can get to describing what happens in a randomly-collected study group is the fact that differing demands of the members from the group prevent its members - individually and collectively - from understanding and concentrating upon important and quite subtle concepts which need much attention and few distractions.\n8g72 | Husri, quoted by Hujwiri, says: 'The Sufi's existence is devoid of non-existence, and his non-existence lacks existence.' Such an\nu8ab | idea needs concentration. Even a single individual finds it hard to hold it in the mind, mainly because of himself being so filled with thoughts and ideas. With a group it is even more difficult.\ncbmm | SPECIAL HARMONY\nbxk6 | The group must be able to develop a perception of the meaning of the following condition, again from Hujwiri: 'The condition of mortality of the Sufi should be in abeyance, and his sensations should vanish, and his relationship with anything should cease, so that the secret of his existence may emerge, and his separate parts be unified with his essence, his real self, and that he should persist in being.'\nivs7 | In practice, let alone in theory, groups of people are not usually interested in arriving at such states, even though they may imagine themselves to be mystics or esotericists.\nr75j | There are many people going around, nowadays they can easily be found, who have tried to live in randomly-collected groups, and have failed. They then look for other groups, or try to further their spiritual or psychological development in some other way.\ndxhe | It is, however, easy to see why they have failed: they have not been prepared to prepare for such an experience. They either felt that they were ready for the experience; or else that membership of such a group would give them what they needed.\nzdcm | Such an attitude is quite understandable, and exists in any situation where there is a shortfall of information, however much goodwill there may be. They have perhaps forgotten the second line of the proverb:\n5sgo | Put your dough into the oven when it is hot:\nqoi8 | After making sure that it is in fact dough.\nk88z | The Value of Question and Answer Sessions\n39t9 | Q: Can you say something about the special needs of 'Time, Place and People', and the value of question-and-answer sessions and their limitations?\nomls | A: If you place great reliance upon the technique of group-meetings with question-and-answer periods, you may make progress, but at a certain point it will stop.\nb2sg | This is because any teaching which does not use all kinds of procedures (exercises, study-tasks, theory and practice and so on) in due proportion will inevitably arrive at a point where some people have obtained as much as they can from each procedure and thereafter will go 'downhill' as far as their development is concerned.\ne1mw | Neither can this question of due proportion be understood by people (teachers or pupils) who are not on a stabilized higher level of consciousness. There is no intuition, no delegation of authority, no painstaking research, no seniority in years, no other factor, which can substitute for the knowledge of what procedure to apply, with whom, in what manner, unless that special attunement is there.\n2p6m | To carry on in defiance of this fact produces social or imitative-academic groupings. They can call themselves what they like: they will not progress except socially.\nt0bx | The same is true of bodies of people stabilised upon the performance of ritual, commemorative procedures or stereotyped phraseology, however hallowed by tradition.\n7cac | The existence of so many bodies of teaching, in so many cultures and epochs, with so many different outward forms is a manifestation of original groups which were tailored for the community of that place, that time, that teacher.\nde53 | Of all human activities the one involving studies beyond ordin-\nhpzb | ary perceptions must above all be projected in accordance with time, place and people: the last includes the direction of the effort, as is well illustrated by this story:\nqwiz | IF YOUR HANDS ARE FULL\n4jms | Terribly afraid one dark night, Mulla Nasrudin travelled with a sword in one hand and a dagger in the other. He had been told that these were a sure means of protection.\n3k7u | On the way he was met by a robber, who took his donkey and saddlebags full of valuable books.\n9qsy | The next day, as he was bemoaning his fate in the teahouse, someone asked:\n0tu9 | 'But why did you let him get away with your possessions, Mulla? Did you not have the means to deter him?'\nu6l1 | 'IF my hands had not been full,' said the Mulla, 'it would have been a different story.'\nvoa6 | The use of the story, of course, is to indicate that people may have a transmitted formula ('weapons are a defence') without the ability to understand how to employ it.\nr53k | Like Nasrudin, they go through the motions, merely carrying the instruments . . .\nv4y3 | The unusual tenacity of replication of mere form which is to be observed in religious transmission is evidence of human determination, not of effective content.\nqgd5 | The ancient Chinese, Babylonian and Egyptian civilisations, as social examples, for instance, endured for thousands of years not because they were especially good and true and necessary; but because they were promoted and maintained by determined men and women, and because there was in addition a quota of inertia in them which prevented laudable change. They did not develop beyond a certain stage.",
