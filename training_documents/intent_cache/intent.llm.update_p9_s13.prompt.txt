You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

k38m | As explained in Chapter 1, one of Vera's most salient interpersonal characteristics is her high need for control. Vera attempts to direct the therapy session from the moment she meets Erika. She asks Erika numerous questions testing her expertise in the area of cancer and insists on talking about cancer treat- ment and rehabilitation. Moreover, she occasionally confronts Erika when she does not hear an opinion that aligns with her own. A second characteristic is Vera's hyperverbal communication style. This char- acteristic presents itself in Vera's constant talking during her interaction with Erika. A third charac- teristic is Vera's capacity for trust. She is equivocal about Erika's credibility and capacity to serve as her occupational therapist. This drives her to behave in an almost interrogational manner. Although we only have a single interaction during which to ascertain whether these characteristics are situa- tional or enduring, we do know from Chapter 1 that Vera has also been described by her friends as being driven, skeptical, a talker, and strong minded. These characteristics may serve Vera in most contexts, but they have emerged as being problematic for both Vera and Erika during their initial meeting.
nkj9 | enduring characteristics are more deeply rooted, typically emerge repeatedly through time, and comprise an inter- personal profile that is idiosyncratic to the client.
35a8 | Because they coexist in each client, situational and en- during characteristics are mutually informative. Behavior that reflects one's acute emotional reaction to a stressful event may temporarily attenuate, alter, or intensify one's interpersonal behavior in what are usually more stable categories. For example, a client who normally responds to a challenging situation adaptively may become irritated when the therapist recommends a more challenging ac- tivity if, earlier in that day, the client underwent a pain- ful biopsy and then discovered she did not have enough money to cover the insurance copay fees upon leaving the physician's office. Irrespective of whether an interpersonal characteristic is situational or enduring, characteristics that are more challenging to work with make it difficult for clients to engage in occupations as planned. The ratio- nale for distinguishing the two categories of interpersonal characteristics is to help inform therapists' understand- ing of the client in stressful and nonstressful situations so therapeutic responses can be appropriately tailored and modulated. Both situational and enduring client charac- teristics and how to assess them are described in more detail in Chapter 5.
337o | Interpersonal Events of Therapy
cuth | An interpersonal event is a naturally occurring commu- nication, reaction, process, task, or general circumstance that occurs during therapy and that has the potential to detract from or strengthen the therapeutic relation- ship. The therapist's ability to recognize the interper- sonal event when it occurs and respond therapeutically determines
09z2 | Whether additional interpersonal events will follow, possibly prompting an interpersonal event cascade
13fv | The effect that the event, and its resolution (or non- resolution), will have on the overall relationship with the client
v5pj | The IRM describes 12 types of interpersonal events that will inevitably occur during therapy, depending on the cli- ent, the therapist, and the therapeutic context. Table 3.2 presents the different event categories (along with exam- ples of what would require the therapist's closer attention).
trab | In the case example at the beginning of this chapter, the many nonverbal cues evident during the inter- action between Mr. Johnson and Rigel were significant moments during Mr. Johnson's commu- nication and may be interpreted as interpersonal events. Additionally, when Mr. Johnson mentioned to Rigel that it wasn't his fault that their interaction the day before was not productive, another inter- personal event occurred: an intimate self-disclosure. Mr. Johnson admitted to Rigel that he was respon- sible for the interaction having gone poorly.

xd5o | The therapist's behavior (e.g., the therapist makes a suggestion or asks a question that the client perceives as intrusive or emotionally difficult)
