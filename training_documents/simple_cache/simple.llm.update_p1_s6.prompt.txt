You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

m4ju | Implementation science made too simple: a teaching tool
a0mb | Abstract
ki8m | Background: The field of implementation science is growing and becoming more complex. When teaching new learners, providing a clear definition of implementation science and a description of "its place" among related fields can be difficult. The author developed a teaching tool using very simple language to help learners grasp key concepts in implementation science.
km8w | The teaching tool: The tool consists of a slide (visual aid) which provides simple and jargon-free definitions of implementation science, implementation strategies, and implementation outcomes, as well as a description of how implementation science relates to "effectiveness" research focusing on clinical/preventive interventions.
wzno | Conclusion: The tool could be useful to new students in the field, as well as other scholars or stakeholders in need of a brief and plain language introduction to key concepts in implementation science.

jfsr | Introduction
u15r | Implementation science can be complicated and at times even overwhelming. While the field is still considered "young," implementation scientists have been hard at work developing frameworks, testing implementation strategies, and establishing implementation outcome measures. As a re- sult, learners participating in introductory didactics on imple- mentation science are often confronted with a dizzying array of information and recommendations to consider when thinking about or planning an implementation study. For example, Tabak et al. [1] identified 61 dissemination and/or implementation theories/frameworks/models available to help craft an implementation study. Just one of those frame- works, Damschroder et al.'s [2] widely used Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), offers 39 implementation factors to consider. Powell et al. [3] concep- tualized 73 discrete implementation strategies available for consideration when developing an implementation interven- tion. Proctor et al. [4] offer 17 potential outcome domains to consider for an implementation study, and the Society for Implementation Research Collaboration has compiled a re- pository [5] of over 400 implementation-related measures.
lq35 | I have been teaching and lecturing in this field over 15 years, and I have presented the above information,
3g9w | and more, many times to learners in my own graduate implementation science course and in various seminars/ workshops at other institutions. As a director of an aca- demic center focused on implementation research, I have also provided dozens of consultations to re- searchers from other fields who are interested in explor- ing how best to implement interventions they have developed and tested. Recently, I have been searching for a way to quickly capture the essence of what imple- mentation science is, what it is trying to do, and how it relates to the "clinical" or "effectiveness" research that often precedes it, without intimidating jargon. In my own course, I was getting the sense that I needed to start off, in the very first session, with a simpler definition and explanation than what I had been using. In consul- tations, I realized that I needed a simple way of defining and differentiating implementation science from what those scientists had already been doing. Over about a year's time, I experimented with using very (very) simple language to get these points across. My goal was to keep it to one slide, and Fig. 1 shows the slide I have been using for the past 2 years.
d09o | The teaching tool
ylhz | Central to the logic inherent in the slide is the notion of an intervention/practice/innovation, referred to as "the thing," whose implementation is in need of support. After I introduce "the thing," I then explain that effect- iveness research (which most of my students and consul- tees are already familiar with) is focused on whether "the thing" works-meaning that receiving it results (or not) in positive impacts on clinical/prevention/whatever out- comes. Next, I explain that implementation science/re- search focuses on how best to "do the thing." This is my attempt at boiling down a more detailed definition [6] into the simplest and most basic of language. Next, I

byu8 | introduce the notion of implementation strategies, which I frame verbally as the interventions that implementation scientists develop and test to improve uptake of "the thing." In keeping with the theme of using very simple language, I refer to implementation strategies on the slide as the stuff we do to try to help people and places to "do the thing." Lastly, I introduce the notion that im- plementation science has its own primary outcome mea- sures, distinct from the clinical/preventive outcomes used in effectiveness research. I refer to those outcomes as measures of how much and how well they (implemen- ters) "do the thing." Verbally, I explain that these mea- sures are focused on the extent (how much) and the quality (how well) of implementation.
76b0 | Discussion
zxz6 | Since using the slide and the concepts of the thing and do the thing repeatedly in teaching, consultations, and every- day conversations, my students and local colleagues have adopted this terminology. After using the slide in numer- ous presentations at other institutions over the past 2 years (mostly centered on effectiveness-implementation hybrid designs, wherein this language can be especially helpful), many colleagues have used the slide and/or its concepts in their own teaching. For example, colleagues used these concepts during workshops/presentations at the 11th Annual Conference on the Science of Dissemination and Implementation in Health in Washington DC, December 2018 [7], and the Implementation Science Masterclass at King's College, London, July 2019 [8]. This article is my attempt to share the slide and concepts as teaching tools more widely.
xnth | I wish to be clear that the slide, as is, has its limita- tions. It ignores the concept of de-implementation. It has an implicit focus/bias on interventional implementa- tion science. And it certainly lacks detail. While that is
vafm | also perhaps its greatest strength, it is worth noting that the slide does not "speak for itself." I recommend it be presented by someone with expertise in implementation science who can provide context and linkage to the more "science-y" terms we normally use when describing and defining our science.
2zmw | Conclusion
bf9k | Given the complexity of implementation science, provid- ing a clear definition of it and a description of "its place" among related fields can be difficult. I developed this tool to assist my own teaching of students and other scholars new to implementation science. It has been use- ful in that regard. Further, the concepts of the thing and do the thing have also been helpful in providing a quick explanation of implementation science to non-scientists. So, feel free to try these ideas with others outside aca- demia as well.
