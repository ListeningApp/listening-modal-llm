Having a therapeutic style that feels consistent with one's day-to-day personality is referred to as an integrated use of self.\nppkp | Assessing Mode Use\n8br6 | To date, nine assessments of mode use based on the IRM have been developed. One of these assessments is featured in this chapter: The Self-Assessment of Modes, Version Three. The Self-Assessment of Modes, Version Three, consists of nine different clinical scenarios, each portraying a client or caregiver facing a dilemma. Four possible therapeutic responses (i.e., modes) are presented beneath each clinical scenario. Respondents are required to rank-order the responses from one to four based upon the degree to which they agree with the given response.\nde3k | Exercises for Learning and Reflection\n2kb3 | One. Please complete Exercises Four point one to Four point three. Reflect upon your responses.\nlqcx | Two. Provide a description of each of the six modes.\n3h7w | Three. Why is it important to clearly differentiate between each of the six modes when communicating with a client?\nth5p | Four. Define the three types of suboptimal mode use. Why is it important to differentiate mode use and suboptimal mode use?\nb7nk | Exercise Four point one\ncbb5 | Self-Assessment of Modes Questionnaire, Version Three\n5qcf | This assessment is designed to allow you to identify whether you have a dominant way or central set of ways of responding to various interpersonal events that arise in therapy. Please do not think too hard about the responses and respond as if you were facing the situations described in real-time practice. All responses represent plausible therapeutic actions, and there are no incorrect responses.\n8u2c | For every scenario, please rank-order each of the four response options according to the extent to which you would view the option as being consistent with your predominant (i.e., usual) way of interacting. Please rank the general idea or feeling you have about the response, even if the way that the example is worded is not identical to what you would actually say. Your numeric rankings should adhere to the following scale:\nc1e3 | One equals highly consistent with how I would usually respond.\n7pez | Two equals very consistent with how I would usually respond.\nqs5t | Three equals moderately consistent with how I would usually respond.\nen4s | SUMMARY\ncsb5 | The \"cautions\" section under each of the interpersonal modes reveals one of the hidden secrets of therapeutic use of self-that no therapist is perfect. There is no way to escape the caveats and downsides that go along with any therapeutic mode or set of modes. Additionally, no one is immune from communicating the modes suboptimally from time to time. One key to the intentional use of self is to familiarize oneself with the caveats to each of the modes that are part of one's therapeutic style. The more you develop an ability to draw on as many modes as necessary and appropriate for a given client, the more likely you are to avoid overutilizing one style at the expense of using a more appropriate or more indicated style for that client.\ni096 | Please note that you may only assign a number once; please do not assign the same number to more than one response option. It is recognized that your actual response may depend on information that is not available in the case description. The point of this questionnaire is not to ascertain a correct response but to ascertain the one that is most representative of your interpersonal style. Please do not dwell on the options for too long. Instead, choose the response that would be the easiest, most natural, or most typical for you in each situation.\ntlzt | Please see the following example, where, in this case, option D is the response most consistent with the respondent's usual way of interacting:\n6iyf | One. You are working with a ninety-two-year-old retired steelworker who has always performed his own handiwork around the house. He is receiving postsurgical therapy for a shoulder injury that he endured after a fall from a stepstool while changing a light bulb in his home. When the client is not in the room, his family members tell you that this is not the first accident that he has had doing handiwork. They add that, recently, he has become more accident-prone while completing tasks that should be done by hired workers. The client's family is concerned about his safety. They feel that he does not listen to them when they ask him to call a hired worker instead of performing household duties on his own. The family reports that the client is otherwise safe when not engaging in household tasks. Please rank-order each response to the family according to the following scale:\no1nk | One equals highly consistent with how I would usually respond.\nmnaf | Two equals very consistent with how I would usually respond.\n0yxe | Three equals moderately consistent with how I would usually respond.\nerre | Four equals slightly or not at all consistent with how I would usually respond.\n835g | Two. You are working with a forty-two-year-old engineer specializing in geomechanics. Work has always been one of the most gratifying things in his life. He is receiving occupational therapy following a spinal cord injury. Because of the injury, the client now requires a special form of powered mobility that traverses different types of terrain in order to complete fieldwork assignments. However, neither his employer nor his insurance company is willing to cover the cost of the equipment, arguing that the powered mobility that he currently uses should be adequate. The client tells you that this specialized power mobility is vital to his ability to complete his work. He adds that his current chair frequently gets stuck, limiting his timeliness, efficiency, and overall productivity. Please rank-order each response according to the following scale:\nx3l9 | One equals highly consistent with how I would usually respond.\nd2fj | Two equals very consistent with how I would usually respond.\ngeyi | Three equals moderately consistent with how I would usually respond.\n2181 | Four equals slightly or not at all consistent with how I would usually respond.\n9ubl | Three. You are working with a seventy-four-year-old homemaker and accountant from a rural community. She has invested her entire life in raising a family while simultaneously operating a successful part-time tax-assistance business from home. Until now, she has been in perfect health and has never experienced any injuries or impairments. Newly referred for rehabilitation and having successfully accomplished all of the activities thus far, she is clearly frustrated and demoralized over the difficulty that she is having making a toilet transfer. After two transfer attempts, she tells you that she knows she cannot do it, and that she is going to end up in a nursing home. She is concerned that she won't be able to return to her home, where she has lived for thirty years. Most individuals with her level of impairment are eventually able to return to independent living and are able to make the transfer. Please rank-order each response according to the following scale:\no8pj | One equals highly consistent with how I would usually respond.\n27b9 | Two equals very consistent with how I would usually respond.\n09xa | Three equals moderately consistent with how I would usually respond.\nyi97 | Four equals slightly or not at all consistent with how I would usually respond.\n4zj7 | Four. You are working with a studious and well liked thirteen-year-old client with cerebral palsy you have worked with for the past two years. She tells you she is feeling hurt and betrayed by something she overheard one of her friends say to another peer at school today in reference to her disability. Because of the presence of many bullies and a lack of appropriate disciplinary oversight, her school is a socially tough environment for many students. Though she is quite gregarious and popular with most of her peers, this is not the first time that she has been hurt by jokes and disparaging comments by peers and\n3wgh | others in public through the years. Please rank-order each response according to the following scale:\nuvo3 | One equals highly consistent with how I would usually respond.\nyjbv | Two equals very consistent with how I would usually respond.\n```",
