The mixture was dried in an oven overnight at one hundred degrees Celsius followed by annealed in argon atmosphere under eight hundred degrees Celsius at a heating rate of five degrees Celsius per minute for two hours. The as-obtained samples were diluted with deionized water until pH reached seven and dried at eighty degrees Celsius. The samples were denoted as FC-zero-eight and FC-one-eight. The yield of FC-one-eight was almost fifty-two point five percent. For comparison, FC-one-eight-HCl was prepared by etching FC-one-eight with concentrated HCl and washed with deionized water to neutrality and dried at eighty degrees Celsius.\nqws8 | Two point four Characterizations\n877u | The main text of the article should appear here with headings as appropriate. A series of measurements were conducted to determine the structure of the products. The crystal structure was determined by powder X-ray diffraction with a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with copper Ka radiation at a wavelength equals zero point one five four zero six nanometers at forty kV and forty mA were recorded in the range of twenty equals ten to seventy. The morphological morphology was measured using a scanning electron microscope at five kV and a transmission\nrzhj | electron microscope operating at two hundred kV. Raman spectra were recorded from one thousand to two thousand five hundred per centimeter on a microscopic confocal Raman spectrometer using a five hundred thirty-two nanometer YAG solid-state laser. The chemical composition of the sample was verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis was conducted by five hundred micrometer beam spot of an Escalab two hundred fifty X i electron spectrometer\nbfax | from Thermo Scientific Ltd, aluminum Ka was used as the monoenergetic X-ray source, and the energy step size was set at zero point zero five zero electron volt. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area was determined by a nitrogen adsorption method using an automated surface area and pore-size analyzer. The pore size distribution was calculated according to a quenched solid density functional theory theory.\nf2y8 | Two point five Electrochemical tests\no7qm | The electrochemical properties were measured by a three-electrode system with a platinum foil as counter electrode and mercury oxide electrode as the reference electrode. A six molar potassium hydroxide aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. The working electrode was prepared by mixing active materials, carbon black and PTFE at a weight ratio of eight to one to one in ethanol solvent. The slurry was mixed by ultrasonication for two hours and then loaded on graphite paper followed by vacuum drying at seventy degrees Celsius for twenty-four hours.\nd52l | The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge curves were performed on an electrochemical workstation at a voltage range from negative one point two to negative zero point three volts. The specific capacitance C was obtained from cyclic voltammetry curves using the following relationship:\nqlbb | C equals I times delta t divided by m times delta V\nnhsg | where I is the discharge current in amperes, m is the active material mass of the working electrode in grams, delta V is the window voltage in volts, and delta t is the discharge time in seconds.\nhy0l | The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was carried out on an electrochemical workstation at an open circuit potential and a frequency range from ten to the negative two to\n4jmz | ten to the five H z.
