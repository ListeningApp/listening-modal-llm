You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

xagm | The Making of Rendanheyi
iwn5 | Not satisfied with past achievements, Haier's senior management had the ambition to become the global industry leader and to create a truly innovative global company that competes on the basis of new product innovations. In 2005, Yang Mianmian, group president at the time, said, "We are number three in the world for white goods, we want to be number one."22 Around that time, Zhang first used the word "Rendanheyi," which was aimed at achieving (in Zhang's words) "zero distance to the customer," whereby the entire corporate structure is

jfsr | Note: ZZJYT = zi zhu jing ying ti, translated as "independent operating unit; SBU = strategic business unit; KPI = key performance indicator.
u15r | dedicated to serving customers, giving them personalized products and services, by creating independent entrepreneurial units that operate as small quasi-inde- pendent firms (within the boundaries of the company) and have market rela- tionships among themselves.
lq35 | Key to the development of Rendanheyi was the spirit of curiosity and experimentation that originated with Zhang Ruimin-the central change agent. Rendanheyi essentially includes a collection of organizational practices that have evolved over time (see Table 1 for Rendanheyi's key characteristics). From 2005, Haier went through a ten-year period of intensive experimentation with organi- zational structure and performance management. During 2005-2009, Haier estab- lished strategic business units and implemented new IT solutions and performance measures to connect the organization to customers. In 2009, Haier announced its strategic transformation from being exclusively a manufacturing company to becoming a service-oriented company, meaning that it considers manufacturing as only one means of satisfying customer needs.
3g9w | In 2010, Haier established the first ZZJYT, which operated like a virtual team (i.e., its offices were not necessarily physically close) with typically ten to 20 employees from different functional and hierarchical levels, brought together for the project. ZZJYTs enjoyed operational autonomy, including recruiting employ- ees for the team, setting compensation rules, and determining bonus payments. But Zhang was not satisfied with the performance of ZZJYTs, as he felt that they presented "a closed mechanism" without sufficient involvement of outsiders. He

ylhz | CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW 61(!)
a3td | also felt they hindered faster entrepreneurial development because employees were still paid a basic salary (even though bonuses were added to it) and lacked sufficient autonomy.
ex5k | In 2014, the entire corporate structure was re-organized, breaking the organization into a network of independent micro-enterprises called "xiaowei" to replace the ZZJYTs. The owner-CEO of a xiaowei (typically 6-8 members, but it can be larger) has a small ownership stake (some xiaowei are majority Haier- owned, but some xiaowei are not, and Haier is currently requiring "continuous dilution" of its holdings). The owner-CEO operates as an entrepreneur with abso- lute autonomous decision making (including all contracting, budgeting, and recruitment decisions). The performance of a xiaowei is measured against a com- bination of financial key performance indicators (KPI) and user value added. The remuneration of xiaowei members no longer depends on a salary and is entirely tied to performance. Going beyond the ZZJYT, the xiaowei leader has total auton- omy, like a CEO of an independent company, and is not subject to headquarters approval of any decisions. A xiaowei is not forced to use internal suppliers. Furthermore, the xiaowei are actively encouraged to seek the involvement of external partners and partial external funding for projects.
9d4o | The xiaowei naturally vary greatly in terms of their function. Around 200 xiaowei are direct, user-facing micro-enterprises developing, for example, new white goods products, entirely new products such as water purification equip- ment, and financial products. They actively use numerous online platforms with millions of customers participating in the process of designing, producing, and using Haier products, while keeping the platforms open to external entrepreneurs to join as partners. Most of the other xiaowei are "node micro-enterprises," which provide products and services to user-facing micro-enterprises (for example, xiao- wei of road transport providers and supply chain xiaowei of factory workers).
cjq2 | The corporate headquarters provides support for all of these xiaowei, allo- cates corporate resources, and sets the strategic direction for the entire organization. The corporate headquarters fulfills the conventional strategy-setting headquarters functions and provides corporate services such as HR and marketing through dedi- cated platforms. However, it is also partly organized as a xiaowei. For example, the corporate legal team operates as a xiaowei that can draw up standard contracts between other micro-enterprises for a fee, while a xiaowei of the communications department develops a cartoon series to help increase merchandise sales and gener- ate additional revenues (Table 2 contains a simplified organizational structure).
5esx | The latest iteration of Haier's management practice has been labeled "Rendanheyi 2.0" and is close to Zhang's vision of Haier's organizational form in the twenty-first century. Rendanheyi is, therefore, a platform management inno- vation, that is, it contains a number of specific, interrelated practices. In a histori- cal perspective, this is a logical third phase in Haier's development as a management innovator. In the first phase, prior to Rendanheyi, the company primarily copied management practices developed elsewhere (such as Business Process Engineering), with varying degrees of success. In the second phase, Rendanheyi

76b0 | 1.0, the company first created some of its own stand-alone management practices. Now, with Rendanheyi 2.0, Haier is successfully creating a number of inter-linked practices. Haier is likely to continue to create specific new practices under the Rendanheyi platform.
zxz6 | It may be somewhat premature to discuss the effectiveness of Rendanheyi, in particular, the effectiveness of xiaowei that have only been in existence since 2014. However, the success of Rendanheyi can possibly be gleaned from Haier's growth in profit margins. When Rendanheyi was first introduced in 2005, Haier Group's profit margins were estimated at below 3% to 4% compared with 6% to 8% for rivals such as Whirlpool. In 2015, the net profit margin of Qingdao Haier Co. Ltd. (one of two listed Haier Group companies) was 5.7% compared with Whirlpool Corp.'s 3.9%. And with Rendanheyi 2.0, Haier Group's profits increased 12.8% to 20.3 billion yuan (US$2.9 billion) between 2015 and 2016, while the group's revenue rose 6.8% to 201.6 billion yuan (US$29.3 billion). A key element of Rendanheyi 2.0 has been the Internet platforms that connect Haier with its users-the volume of transactions on such platforms rose 73% to 272.7 billion yuan (US$39.6 billion) between 2015 and 2016.
xnth | Nonetheless, Haier has largely been unable to diffuse Rendanheyi across its global subsidiaries. In the United States, for example, larger micro-divisions called "platforms" have been created instead of xiaowei, and-in contrast to xiaowei in China-every employee was part of several platforms, and remuneration was not entirely based on platform performance. In Russia, the top management team formed a xiaowei along the Chinese xiaowei lines; however, rank-and-file employ- ees continued to work in a hierarchical organization without forming ZZJYTs or xiaowei. Low adoption levels outside China raise important questions about the applicability of Rendanheyi in different national contexts, which underlines the importance of understanding how context matters for management innovations.
vafm | How Context Mattered to Haier's Rendanheyi
2zmw | In our research, we used the six categories mentioned earlier, that is, three categories in the environmental context and three categories in the organi- zational context.

otkr | CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW 61(1)
ibgs | Environmental Context
colo | The three categories of environmental context are the competitive, tech- nological, and institutional environments-all of which are characterized by increasing VUCA forces that have affected the development of Rendanheyi.
d6r4 | Competitive. Haier has been operating in a VUCA environment for more than a decade. The competitive environment for Haier has become more uncer- tain since the early 2000s. Foreign rivals such as Panasonic, Sanyo, Whirlpool, Bosch-Siemens, and Electrolux already entered the Chinese market in the 1980s and 1990s. But it was in the early 2000s that Chinese white goods manufactur- ers came under considerable competitive pressure from foreign competitors in the Chinese market. In December 2001, China formally joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) and opened the white goods sector to competition. The previous sales quotas on white goods were scrapped, and foreign manufacturers were allowed to also engage in distribution and service activities in the Chinese market. The most important foreign home appliance brands (with the notable exception of GE) started manufacturing and R&D activities in China. Whirl- pool (which previously withdrew from China) re-entered the Chinese market in 2002 through strategic partnerships with local firms Gome and Suning, while other foreign rivals also expanded their presence in China.
9mrz | With increased volatility from domestic competition, Chinese white goods firms experienced production overcapacity for the first time as the market share of foreign firms in refrigerators quickly went up from 26% to 31%, and in washing machines from 31% to 38%, within a year. A fierce price war broke out. Domestic competition from foreign rivals and lower margins pushed Haier to expand glob- ally to counter foreign rivals on their home turf in the United States and Europe. In anticipation of China's WTO membership, Haier opened manufacturing and R&D centers in Italy and Germany (2001) and established a U.S. factory (2002).
pk06 | As Haier became a truly global company with presence in more than 100 countries, it faced a more complex environment consisting of many different mar- kets, all with unique market characteristics and consumer preferences. It also faced further uncertainty due to slower demand and greater competition amid the global recession and a sharp decline in China's property market. Haier's senior management believed that its workers were not productive enough compared with global competitors.
7wn9 | The development of Rendanheyi 2.0 coincided with slower growth rates in China's economy, which declined in each consecutive year from 10.6% in 2010 to 6.9% in 2015, while total investment in China's economy declined from 47.9% of GDP in 2010 to 44.7% in 2015.23 As an additional burden, the value of the Chinese currency has steadily appreciated, from 8.2765 yuan per U.S. dollar to 6.1248 yuan per U.S. dollar between the start of 2005 and the start of 2015.
wcd0 | There were also signs that the white goods sector would become more consolidated. In 2005, Whirlpool acquired Maytag, once considered one of the most admired premium brands. China's entry into the WTO and greater global

qrvy | competitive uncertainty persuaded Zhang that Haier needed to reinvent itself and become a user-oriented organization. Today, we know that fears about global con- solidation were justified as a merger wave has swept through the white goods industry. In 2016, Whirlpool purchased Indesit, Midea bought Toshiba's white goods business, Arçelik took over Dawlance, Bosch bought out its partner Siemens, and, in 2017, Haier completed a US$5.6 billion takeover of GE's white goods busi- ness. Competitive pressures were, therefore, also a driver for Haier to start intro- ducing Rendanheyi.
pn9j | Technological. The white goods sector was traditionally a slow-moving, mature industry. But there was increasing ambiguity about the directions for future con- sumer demand, amid booming e-commerce, demand for niche products, and a shift toward a customized user experience. Zhang was an early web enthusiast. When he conceived his early ideas on Rendanheyi around 2005, he assumed that the Internet would change the relationship between companies and cus- tomers. Zhang recognized that the Internet brought about (in his own words) "zero-distance access to information," meaning customers can get information more quickly than companies. In his view, this required a shift from mass pro- duction to mass customization. When the ZZJYT model was introduced around 2010, Zhang developed a vision of complementary physical and virtual networks and envisaged that Haier's online platforms should be used as vehicles for close collaboration with users to develop new products and to provide a customized user experience.
1pmc | Zhang was influenced by authors such as Don Tapscott and Jeremy Rifkin, who painted a picture of communications-driven technological revolutions in the business world.24 He invited many such authors to visit Haier in the Qingdao headquarters. When the "Maker Movement" (related to digital fabrication) sur- faced, Zhang invited the editor-in-chief of Wired Magazine Chris Anderson in for talks and workshops, identifying everyone as a "maker" on their business cards and job descriptions. Zhang became convinced that technology would fundamen- tally alter the basis of competition in future, moving from competition between close-ended hierarchical companies toward competition between open online platforms that can link companies with users and external partners to jointly cre- ate value. One of Zhang's favorite quotes is "the world is your R&D department," which suggests that R&D resources can be acquired through collaboration with users, through collaboration with external partners, or through purchases from third parties. He made a distinction between a traditional "customer" for a one- time money transaction, and a "user" for continuous interaction and participa- tion. Zhang wanted to create a community of users.
5z6q | Zhang also observed technological advancements made by other compa- nies. He was particularly impressed by Apple's iPad, which became "magical" once app designers were invited in to populate the iPad boxes with their ideas, and once Apple's customers could personalize their iPads with the variety of apps becoming available, in the process transforming each iPad into a truly unique device. Zhang argued that the iPad was a "platform" for expressing and realizing
yeoh | CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW 61(1)
b8hf | the dreams of other ecosystem players-app designers and users-and that Haier could similarly be transformed into a platform for the dreams of others, and, in the process, would become faster, more open, and without boundaries.
