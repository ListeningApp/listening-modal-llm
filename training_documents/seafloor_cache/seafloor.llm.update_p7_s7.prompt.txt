You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

pujl | The Tinakula SMS deposit consists of a series of over 900 chimneys and mound complexes distributed over a strike length of ~1,050 m along the row of cinder cones and com- posite cones (Fig. 2). The chimneys and mounds are located mainly at the tops and along the flanks of the cinder cones, as well as inside the summit craters (Fig. 5). They also occur in the center of each of the maar-like craters in the north. West of the row of cinder cones, over a strike length of ~400 m, the chimneys and mounds are not spatially associated with observable volcanic features at the seafloor but instead appear to occur along two partially buried northeast-southwest and northwest-southeast structures (between sites F and D and between sites F and E; Fig. 2).
3rqe | The chimneys at Tinakula are <1 to 15 m high (typically 2-8 m) and include typical multispired sulfide structures with central vent orifices (Fig. 6A, B) and, more commonly, chim- neys with irregular morphologies (bulbous, drooping, with smooth or popcorn-textured outer surfaces; Fig. 6C, D). The
nsi3 | bulbous chimneys lack central orifices and have a morphol- ogy similar to those of beehives or flange-type chimneys (e.g., Koski et al., 1994; Zhu et al., 2007). The chimneys are com- monly surrounded by sulfide talus and grow on top of low- relief hydrothermal mounds that typically rise ~2 to 3 m from the seafloor. The extent of these mounds is largely unknown due to burial by volcaniclastic sediments, but they appear to make up the bulk of the mineralization at the seafloor, accounting for about two-thirds of the total amount of iden- tified massive sulfide. Individual chimney mound complexes can be traced for up to 70 m on the seafloor. Where exposed, the mound material is distinctly laminated with layers of bar- ite and sulfide minerals up to 0.5 m thick, and they have unex- pectedly smooth surfaces (Fig. 6C). The layered barite-sulfide mounds are most similar to features described by Hein et al. (2014) from the East Diamante caldera in the Mariana arc. The sulfide deposits are mostly inactive, and the surrounding volcaniclastic sediment is widely indurated and locally miner- alized (Fig. 6D). Active venting is limited to a few sites with shimmering water at the base of chimneys or along fractures in the indurated sediments, associated with bacterial mats (Fig. 6A). Venting of white to gray smoke from chimney spires is rare (Fig. 6B). Fe-Mn oxides are widespread along fractures in the seafloor, extending up to 100 m away from the chim- ney complexes and mounds (Fig. 2). Abundant <1-m-tall Fe and Mn oxyhydroxide chimneys and silica-rich chimneys are associated with bacterial mats (Fig. 6E) and occur along the fractures (Fig. 6F).
nil3 | The surface expression of hydrothermal precipitates cov- ers ~77,000 m2, including ~ 13,800 m2 of active chimneys and mounds, 51,800 m2 of inactive chimneys and mounds, and 9,300 m2 of partially buried chimneys and mounds (Fig. 2). Areas of low-temperature venting, dominated by Fe and Mn oxides, occur over an additional 130,000 m2 (91,000 m2 of Fe oxides and 38,000 m2 of Mn oxides), although these areas commonly overlap those of the chimneys and mounds. The area of subseafloor sulfide mineralization is not completely known, so the full size of the deposit could be much larger. The areal extent of this deposit is significant compared to others discovered along mid-ocean ridges and along arcs and back-arc basins; fewer than 10% have dimensions larger than 5,000 m2 (Hannington et al., 2010). Modern sulfide deposits with comparable sizes (by area) include the Solwara 1 deposit in the Eastern Manus basin (90,000 m2) and the Mir zone, Ashadze-1, and Ashadze-2 deposits on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (50,000 m2 each) (Hannington et al., 2010, 2011). It should be emphasized, however, that the large areal footprint of the Tinakula deposit may not necessarily correlate with a large tonnage of massive sulfide.
