Building these components often requires extensive domain expertise and may contain brittle design choices. In this paper, we present Tacotron, an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model that synthesizes speech directly from characters. Given text, audio pairs, the model can be trained completely from scratch with random initialization. We present several key techniques to make the sequence-to-sequence framework perform well for this challenging task. Tacotron achieves a three point eight two subjective five-scale mean opinion score on US English, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. In addition, since Tacotron generates speech at the frame level, it's substantially faster than sample-level autoregressive methods.\npk06 | INTRODUCTION One\n7wn9 | Modern text-to-speech pipelines are complex. For example, it is common for statistical parametric text-to-speech to have a text frontend extracting various linguistic features, a duration model, an acoustic feature prediction model and a complex signal-processing-based vocoder. These components are based on extensive domain expertise and are laborious to design. They are also trained independently, so errors from each component may compound. The complexity of modern text-to-speech designs thus leads to substantial engineering efforts when building a new system.\nwcd0 | There are thus many advantages of an integrated end-to-end text-to-speech system that can be trained on text, audio pairs with minimal human annotation. First, such a system alleviates the need for laborious feature engineering, which may involve heuristics and brittle design choices. Second, it more easily allows for rich conditioning on various attributes, such as speaker or language, or high-level features like sentiment. This is because conditioning can occur at the very beginning of the model rather than only on certain components. Similarly, adaptation to new data might also be easier. Finally, a single model is likely to be more robust than a multi-stage model where each component's errors can compound. These advantages imply that an end-to-end model could allow us to train on huge amounts of rich, expressive yet often noisy data found in the real world.\ncaos | Text-to-speech is a large-scale inverse problem: a highly compressed source, text, is decompressed into audio. Since the same text can correspond to different pronunciations or speaking styles, this is a particularly difficult learning task for an end-to-end model: it must cope with large variations at the signal level for a given input. Moreover, unlike end-to-end speech recognition, text-to-speech outputs are continuous, and output sequences are usually much longer than those of the input. These attributes cause prediction errors to accumulate quickly. In this paper, we propose Tacotron, an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model based on the sequence-to-sequence with attention paradigm. Our model takes characters as input and outputs raw spectrogram, using several techniques to improve the capability of a vanilla sequence-to-sequence model. Given text, audio pairs, Tacotron can be trained completely from scratch with random initialization. It does not require phoneme-level alignment, so it can easily scale to using large amounts of acoustic data with transcripts. With a simple waveform synthesis technique, Tacotron produces a three point eight two mean opinion score on a US English evaluation set, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness.\npn9j | Two RELATED WORK\n1pmc | WaveNet is a powerful generative model of audio. It works well for text-to-speech, but is slow due to its sample-level autoregressive nature. It also requires conditioning on linguistic features from an existing text-to-speech frontend, and thus is not end-to-end: it only replaces the vocoder and acoustic model. Another recently-developed neural model is Deep Voice, which replaces every component in a typical text-to-speech pipeline by a corresponding neural network. However, each component is independently trained, and it's nontrivial to change the system to train in an end-to-end fashion.\n5z6q | To our knowledge, Wang et al. is the earliest work touching end-to-end text-to-speech using sequence-to-sequence with attention. However, it requires a pre-trained hidden Markov model aligner to help the sequence-to-sequence model learn the alignment. It's hard to tell how much alignment is learned by the sequence-to-sequence per se. Second, a few tricks are used to get the model trained, which the authors note hurts prosody. Third, it predicts vocoder parameters hence needs a vocoder. Furthermore, the model is trained on phoneme inputs and the experimental results seem to be somewhat limited.\nyeoh | Char two Wave is an independently-developed end-to-end model that can be trained on characters. However, Char two Wave still predicts vocoder parameters before using a Sample RNN neural vocoder, whereas Tacotron directly predicts raw spectrogram. Also, their sequence-to-sequence and Sample RNN models need to be separately pre-trained, but our model can be trained\nb8hf | from scratch. Finally, we made several key modifications to the vanilla sequence-to-sequence paradigm. As shown later, a vanilla sequence-to-sequence model does not work well for character-level inputs.\nhntf | Three MODEL ARCHITECTURE\n99fo | The backbone of Tacotron is a sequence-to-sequence model with attention. Figure One depicts the model, which includes an encoder, an attention-based decoder, and a post-processing net. At a high-level, our model takes characters as input and produces spectrogram frames, which are then converted to waveforms. We describe these components below.\ny5r7 | Three point one CHBG MODULE\n```",
