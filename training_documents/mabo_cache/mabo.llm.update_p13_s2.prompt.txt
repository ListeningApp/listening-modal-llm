You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

xaqt | In Defence of Mabo
5rcb | The comments of Dawson J in his lonely dissent in Mabo also give some support to the claim that the High Court, in this case, intruded im- permissibly into the legislative province. After concluding that any tradi- tional land rights of the Australian indigenes had long since been extin- guished,82 Dawson J wrote:83
524j | Accordingly, if traditional land rights (or at least rights akin to them) are to be afforded to the inhabitants of the Murray Islands, the responsibility, both le- gal and moral, lies with the legislature and not with the courts.
xd3m | Similarly, in the context of Australia's history of European settlement, Dawson J concluded:84
8qb6 | There may not be a great deal to be proud of in this history of events. But a dispassionate appraisal of what occurred is essential to the determination of the legal consequences, notwithstanding the degree of condemnation which is nowadays apt to accompany any account. The policy which lay behind the legal regime was determined politically and, however insensitive the politics may now seem to have been, a change in view does not of itself mean a change in the law. It requires the implementation of a new policy to do that and that is a matter for government rather than the courts. In the meantime it would be wrong to attempt to revise history or to fail to recognize its legal impact, how- ever unpalatable it may now seem. To do so would be to impugn the founda- tions of the very legal system under which this case must be decided.
wkbn | WHAT IS THE SEPARATION OF POWERS DOCTRINE?
ftfg | In its most basic formulation, the separation of powers doctrine prohibits one single branch of government (the parliament, executive and judici- ary) from exercising the powers of another branch of government. The three traditional branches of government are essentially regarded as sepa- rate in function. In this respect, the Australian Constitution is much in- fluenced by its American counterpart, in turn affected by the philosophi- cal teachings in vogue at the time when the United States Constitution was written.
7xi5 | In the context of the United States, James Madison wrote:85
w8r5 | The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self- appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyr- anny.
ybik | Such a sentiment was stated in its purest form by the Supreme Court of the United States in Springer et al v Government of the Philippine Islands:86
gii5 | ... unless otherwise expressly provided or incidental to the powers conferred, the legislature cannot exercise either executive or judicial power; the execu- tive cannot exercise either legislative or judicial power; the judiciary cannot exercise either executive or legislative power.
q5eu | That the doctrine of separation of powers has relevance to the Aus- tralian Constitution cannot be denied. However, it is significant that in the Constitution, the executive powers (although nominally vested in the Queen and exercisable by the Governor General) were, from the start, to be administered by the Queen's Ministers of State. Those Ministers were required by the Constitution to secure a seat in Parliament no later than three months after their appointment as such.87 The significance of this requirement is that it is indicative of a rejection of a strict separation of powers doctrine in Australia.
a7ao | The high watermark of the separation of powers doctrine in Australia was the Boilermakers' case.88 In that case, it was held that the Federal Par- liament could not, by legislation, confer upon a federal court both judi- cial and non-judicial functions. To purport to do so was inconsistent with the provisions of the Australian Constitution and also with the very struc- ture of the Constitution. Upon this basis, the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration could not validly exercise both judicial and non-judicial pow- ers. The outcome of the decision was the division of those functions re- spectively between the Industrial Court (from which has grown the Fed- eral Court of Australia) and the Conciliation and Arbitration Commis- sion (from which has grown the Industrial Relations Commission of Aus- tralia).
29a3 | The decision of the High Court of Australia in Boilermakers' was af- firmed by the Privy Council. Their Lordships observed:89
sb1e | ... in a federal system the absolute independence of the judiciary is the bul- wark of the constitution against encroachment whether by the legislature or by the executive. To vest in the same body executive and judicial power is to remove a vital constitutional safeguard.
w2yn | The context of the Boilermakers' decision is important. It was decided at a time when the declaratory theory of judicial function was almost universally accepted in Australia. Any notion that the judges invented the law was strongly rejected. Dixon CJ asserted that the law would have no meaning as a discipline if there were not pre-existing norms which the
ap6l | judge merely had to find and then to apply. Such a task might be difficult and, at times, taxing. But aided by 'strict and complete legalism', the ap- plication of logical rules and analogous reasoning, the relevant principles of law would always be found.90
iest | While this declaratory theory of strict and complete legalism is still probably accepted by many in the general community and by politicians in Australia, it is a view which is now held by very few Australian and English judges. Lord Reid, in 1972, denounced such a view as a 'fairy tale' in which we did not believe 'any more'.91
cox8 | An assertion that a court has breached the separation of powers doc- trine by creating law which was more properly the domain of parliament is closely linked to the criticism of the judiciary for being too creative in the particular case. Such an assertion typically calls for a return to greater judicial restraint.
ppqi | SEPARATION OF POWERS, JUDICIAL RESTRAINT AND THE HIGH COURT
oxou | For the purist, the strict separation of powers doctrine requires absolute judicial restraint. The classical theory of judicial restraint dictates that the judges do not have regard to 'changing economic, social and political ideas' in the exercise of their judicial power,92 'unless [such considera- tions] are specifically commended to the court's attention by the legisla- ture'.93 Strict adherence to the notion of judicial restraint is given consid- erable weight by two undeniable factors: first, the judiciary's exercise of a power legislative in character is illegitimate as the judiciary lacks account- ability and therefore democratic authority to make radical new laws. Sec- ond, the judicial process is inapt to provide the appropriate consultative processes which significant reform or change in the domain of the legis- lature requires.94
495n | In recent years there has been a slow, but steady, drift in Australia away from the strict theory of judicial restraint. The exact limits of judi- cial creativity are yet to be defined - assuming that the boundary could ever be defined with precision. In Caltex Oil (Aust.) Pty Ltd v The Dredge 'Willemstad',95 Stephen J in the High Court of Australia recognised that 'policy considerations must no doubt play a very significant part in any judicial definition of liability and entitlement in new areas of the law'.96
awri | However, he warned that to 'apply generalized policy considerations di- rectly ... instead of formulating principles from policy and applying those principles ... is ... to invite uncertainty and judicial diversity.'97
bl28 | Deane J in Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Co. Inc. v Fay98 expressed what he took to be the correct approach to be adopted when a judge is invited to change the existing common law and to adopt a new approach. He said:99
d5bz | There are three main reference points to which regard should be paid in de- ciding whether the United Kingdom doctrine should be accepted as the law of this country. They are legal principle, decided authority and policy.
