        "content": "jxk6 | There are many ways to design local currency. In the United States, communities select designs to reflect their goals and values, while operating within the boundaries of state and\nfugp | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT\nznlx | federal policy. There are four basic types: one, proxy; two, fiat; three, local exchange and trading systems, or LETS; and four, time banking. To better understand the effects of policy on local currency, a brief description of each type is provided.\nyf7f | Proxy currencies are pegged to, backed by, and exchangeable for the national currency. They stimulate the local economy through supporting buy local campaigns and raise awareness of local businesses. They have been promoted as a way to increase the tax base and create jobs. The BerkShares currency in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, is a proxy currency. One-hundred BerkShares can be purchased for ninety-five U.S. dollars at participating local banks. BerkShares are recognized by local businesses as having the same value as a U.S. dollar, an incentive which provides a built-in discount for patrons using BerkShares.\nlhgm | Local Fiat Currencies are not backed by a currency or commodity. They are put into circulation through member enrollment, no-interest loan programs, or other agreed upon conditions. The worth of a fiat currency is established by the willingness of users to agree to it as a means of exchange and a measure of value. Local fiat currencies can give unemployed and underemployed individuals increased earning, and thus spending, opportunities. In addition to stimulating the local economy, they help promote community values. For example, they can be issued to participants in health promotion events, community arts projects, environmental cleanup activities, or any type of activity that the community chooses to sponsor. The Equal Dollars currency in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is a local fiat currency. Equal Dollars are issued when members create accounts and volunteer with local service organizations. They can be spent at an online\n9pr0 | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT\n2phz | marketplace, farmers' market, consignment store, community bicycle program, and other local businesses. Equal Dollars provides low-income individuals with access to necessary goods and services while supporting human service organizations, promoting healthy behaviors, and stimulating the local economy.\n6bw5 | Local Exchange and Trading Systems, or LETSs, are mutual credit systems used for the exchange of goods and services. Though not common in the United States, LETSs are perhaps the most prevalent type of local currency in the world. Upon joining a LETS, members have an account balance of zero. At the point of purchase, the buyer's account is debited and the seller's account is credited for the purchase amount in the currency of the system. Fourth Corner Exchange, a for-profit LETS in Bellingham, Washington, coordinates trades using Life Dollars. It has a social justice-based mission and has facilitated the exchange of over one point four million dollars of goods and services since its inception in two thousand four. Green America Exchange is run by a non-profit association of three thousand socially and ecologically conscious business members. It uses \"Trade Dollars\" and a system of buyer and seller ratings and reviews.\nn0yi | Time banking systems are similar to LETSs, but instead of an exchange currency, the unit of account is time. Members offer and seek services in a directory and exchange hours of service throughout the network. In time banking systems, every member's time is valued equally. This egalitarian system is intended to support the core economy of home, family, neighborhood and community and values domestic and service work. Time banking builds relationships and helps people with low incomes. Time banks are prevalent in the United States. In two thousand nine, the City of\nkd51 | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT\n15ob | Montpelier, Vermont, spearheaded the creation of the REACH, Rural Elder Assistance for Care and Health, Care Bank which focused on personal health and wellness services for elders in the community.\nzxxt | Policy Environment for Local Currency in the United States\n0pqj | Although many citizens may be unacquainted with local currency, many forms of it are legal in the United States. Federal law permits private entities to issue currency; however states and local governments are not allowed to create currency. This is unfortunate for local currencies because municipal governments have staffing, community relationships, citizen communications, infrastructure, and experience in navigating federal regulations and are well positioned to be successful currency managers. Urban geographer Michael Pacione argues that \"currency issued by a public authority, such as a municipal government, is ... likely to attract a high level of credibility particularly if it can be used to pay fees and taxes.\"\nrmbb | Designed as a socially responsible public good, a local currency may be administered by a tax-exempt non-profit organization. Operating as a recognized non-profit organization is beneficial in terms of federal policy. For local fiat currency systems that are not pegged to the U.S. dollar, operating as a non-profit allows the currency organization to be exempt from the Securities Act of nineteen thirty-three. Without this exemption, currency organizations would have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, abide by disclosure, privacy, and other administrative requirements, and pay related fees. For time banks and LETS, the IRS has provided private guidance that operating as a non-profit is a condition which might help ensure a time bank is not considered a \"barter exchange,\" thus avoiding additional ten ninety-nine-B reporting responsibilities under the U.S.\nmkac | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT\nphvu | Treasury regulations. Though nonprofits may gain trust and promote community values, without sufficient resources they may face difficulties in administering local currencies. In fact, nonprofit currency managers often rely on volunteer staffing and tend to use word-of-mouth advertising rather than employing more professional marketing methods.",
