        "content": "spl6 | A corollary to this principle is that clients may change through time in their desires for the therapeutic relationship. The following are some examples. A client who at first desires a more hierarchical and therapist-structured relationship following a traumatic event resulting in impairment may wish for a more collaborative relationship later during the course of therapy. A long-term client seen first as a child may wish to achieve more distance as he or she comes into adolescence. A client who previously insisted on a highly collaborative relationship may, following an exacerbation of an impairment or symptom or during a crisis, need an empathic and supportive relationship. Such changes in a client's desires for the therapeutic relationship may reflect such factors as responses to stress, personal growth, or natural development. They must be respected and accommodated by the therapist.\n7wzm | Principle Eight: Activity Focusing Must Be Balanced With Interpersonal Focusing\ne9xj | One way to determine what a client needs from the therapy relationship is by evaluating his or her preference for interpersonal interaction during therapy. Not all clients benefit from the same level of emotional intensity or closeness in the therapeutic relationship. For this reason, interpersonal self-discipline is required on the part of the therapist to ensure that activity focusing must be well balanced with interpersonal focusing in occupational therapy.\n9vl6 | Activity focusing refers to strategies of responding to interpersonal events that emphasize \"doing\" issues regarding \"feeling\" or \"relating\" issues. Interpersonal focusing refers to strategies that emphasize the latter more so than doing issues. The difference can be illustrated through the following examples. Let us say a client becomes upset, frustrated, or fearful when trying a new activity. Activity focusing would involve modifying the activity or the environment or encouraging a client to try another activity. By contrast, interpersonal focusing would involve addressing the client's emotional reaction to what the therapist is saying or doing. In this instance, it might mean interrupting the activity to discuss the client's emotional reaction to therapy, or it may involve strategic questioning that reveals the client's inner feelings about the activity or to the overall therapy approach.\nc2fd | This balance between activity focusing and interpersonal focusing varies from client to client depending on the client's progress in therapy, expectations from therapy, construal of the relationship, and reactions to the therapist. To accomplish this balance, a large measure of interpersonal reasoning and self-discipline is required. Interpersonal reasoning and self-discipline allow the therapist to keep the client's unique needs in focus to interpret the appropriate balance clearly. If a therapist achieves this balance, he or she does not rely too much on using activities to avoid direct discussion of interpersonal issues or, by contrast, does not overemphasize discussion of interpersonal issues when it is not comfortable for that particular client or appropriate for the situation.\njzvp | Principle Nine: Application of the Model Must Be Informed by Core Values and Ethics\nf71y | Occupational therapy core values must inform application of the IRM in practice. As each component of the model is covered in subsequent chapters of this book, examples of how occupational therapy core values and ethics inform application\n31e1 | Chapter Three A Model of the Intentional Relationship seventy-seven\n40ry | of the model are provided. In addition, Chapter fourteen overviews the occupational therapy core values and ethics, highlights the importance of the use of self in applying ethical principles, and specifies the numerous associations between ethical principles and the model. Examples of ethical dilemmas from clinical practice and possibilities for resolution are provided.\nd1j2 | Principle Ten: Cultural Sensitivity Is Central to Practice\nwstc | Therapeutic use of self must be informed by human diversity. In client-therapist relationships, human diversity is defined by differences in sex, age, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religious views, sexual orientation, disability status, and a wide range of other social and cultural dimensions. Developing cultural sensitivity is fundamental to effective use of self in occupational therapy. For this reason, cultural sensitivity is considered a central skill that must be developed and incorporated into every therapist's interpersonal knowledge base. Chapter nine summarizes existing knowledge about cultural sensitivity in the field of occupational therapy and provides additional recommendations for professional development in this area.\nba1e | SUMMARY\nen95 | A rationale for the need of the IRM was provided, and the primary elements of the model were described. Ten principles underlying the model were also elaborated. Formulation of these principles was influenced by several sources, including information provided by the contributing therapists and direct observations of their behavior in practice, my own training and clinical experience as a psychotherapist, occupational therapy\nl3do | Exercises for Learning and Reflection\nu9bo | Exercise three point one\n7avo | One. Have you ever experienced a client or other person in your life with one or more interpersonal characteristics that posed a challenge within the relationship? Please provide a detailed example, using IRM vocabulary to label the person's interpersonal characteristics.\nuzo6 | Two. In a past volunteer or professional capacity, have you ever prompted or witnessed an interpersonal event to have occurred? Describe what happened, including any attempts to resolve the situation.\n89b4 | Three. Refer to the case example featuring the client, Mr. Johnson, and Rigel, an occupational therapist, at the beginning of this chapter. In your personal or professional experience, have you ever encountered or observed a similar situation? What do you think about the interaction between Mr. Johnson and Rigel? In what ways was it effective and ineffective? Would you have done anything differently? Why or why not?\n5f7e | core values and ethics, and general principles derived from the occupational therapy and psychology literature and existing knowledge bases. The remainder of this book describes the IRM as one explanation of what occurs during our relationships with clients. Clinical examples of this model in action that were provided by the twelve featured therapists are incorporated throughout the book to illustrate how the concrete skills and concepts of this model can be utilized in practice.\nh83u | Four. Which of the ten underlying principles of IRM did Rigel draw upon during his interaction with Mr. Johnson at the beginning of the chapter? Please explain your answer.\nkjoa | Five. Explain what is meant by \"keeping head before heart\" in IRM terms. Is this relevant to developing an empathic understanding of a client? Explain your answer.\nwb1c | Six. Imagine that you are Erika and you have the chance to see Vera for a second session. How would you attempt to repair the rift that occurred in Chapter One?\nak13 | Seven.
