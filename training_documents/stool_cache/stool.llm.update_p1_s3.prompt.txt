You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

qecd | BMJ Open Xpert Ultra stool testing to diagnose tuberculosis in children in Ethiopia and Indonesia: a model-based cost- effectiveness analysis
1o7p | ABSTRACT
cp13 | Objectives The WHO currently recommends stool testing using GeneXpert MTB/Rif (Xpert) for the diagnosis of paediatric tuberculosis (TB). The simple one-step (SOS) stool method enables processing for Xpert testing at the primary healthcare (PHC) level. We modelled the impact and cost-effectiveness of implementing the SOS stool method at PHC for the diagnosis of paediatric TB in Ethiopia and Indonesia, compared with the standard of care.
bgre | Setting All children (age <15 years) presenting with presumptive TB at primary healthcare or hospital level in Ethiopia and Indonesia.
57lp | Primary outcome Cost-effectiveness estimated as incremental costs compared with incremental disability- adjusted life-years (DALYs) saved.
ukth | Methods Decision tree modelling was used to represent pathways of patient care and referral. We based model parameters on ongoing studies and surveillance, systematic literature review, and expert opinion. We estimated costs using data available publicly and obtained through in-country expert consultations. Health outcomes were based on modelled mortality and discounted life- years lost.
kpvt | Results The intervention increased the sensitivity of TB diagnosis by 19-25% in both countries leading to a 14- 20% relative reduction in mortality. Under the intervention, fewer children seeking care at PHC were referred (or self-referred) to higher levels of care; the number of children initiating anti-TB treatment (ATT) increased by 18-25%; and more children (85%) initiated ATT at PHC level. Costs increased under the intervention compared with a base case using smear microscopy in the standard of care resulting in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US$132 and US$94 per DALY averted in Ethiopia and Indonesia, respectively. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of 0.5xgross domestic product per capita, the projected probability of the intervention being cost-effective in Ethiopia and Indonesia was 87% and 96%, respectively. The intervention remained cost-effective under sensitivity analyses.
jie2 | Conclusions The addition of the SOS stool method to national algorithms for diagnosing TB in children is likely to be cost-effective in both Ethiopia and Indonesia.

lvae | BACKGROUND
o9sc | It was estimated that in 2018, around 1.1 million children below 15 years of age fell ill from tuberculosis (TB). In the same year, 250 000 children died of TB, mostly because TB was not diagnosed or was diagnosed too late. It is estimated that 55% of TB cases are missed, particularly in the youngest age group.2 TB in children presents with nonspe- cific signs and symptoms, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli are usually not detected.2 Partly, this is because the main specimen used for diagnosing pulmonary TB is sputum, which is challenging to obtain, especially from young children. Therefore, (semi-)invasive methods such as nasogastric aspiration and sputum induction are often required. These methods are painful and stressful for chil- dren and caregivers and sometimes require hospitalisation. Moreover, not all primary healthcare (PHC) facilities in TB endemic areas, where parents with children usually first seek care, have facilities and qualified saff to perform these procedures. Alternative, non-invasive specimens, such as stool, can
121u | be used for the diagnosis of TB in children using Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) technology. ,34
zh03 | Since January 2020, WHO recommends Xpert testing of stool specimens as a primary diagnostic test for TB in children with signs and symptoms of pulmonary TB.5 This recommendation has the potential to improve bacterio- logical confirmation of TB in children, and is increasingly being adopted by national TB programmes, for example, Ethiopia.6 However, to make the test fit for use at the PHC level, a simple, non-hazardous and cheap method to process stool for Xpert testing was needed. Several centrifuge-free methods have been proposed,7-10 but all need additional equipment and/or consumables which may not be (easily) available in peripheral lower-level public health facilities. Therefore, we developed a simple one-step (SOS) stool processing method for Xpert testing. This method can be applied in any laboratory with an Xpert machine, as it does not require additional equip- ment or consumables than those delivered routinely with the Xpert cartridges." Limited preliminary data suggest that Xpert Ultra on stool samples processed using the SOS stool method has higher sensitivity compared with other stool processing methods. Available systematic reviews on the diagnostic accuracy of stool testing have reported sensitivity of 50-67%.3412 The variation in sensitivity esti- mates may be explained by a variation in studies included, and thus, variation in study populations, stool processing methods and reference standards (sputum culture412 or a combination of sputum culture and sputum Xpert3) included in each review. This method has the potential to significantly impact the number of children receiving a bacteriological confirmation of TB, including rifampicin resistance profile. Consequently, more paediatric TB patients can be diagnosed at lower levels of the health- care system, with a reduced time to diagnosis because no referrals to higher levels of healthcare are needed as well as reduced costs for both the healthcare system and families.
1mvw | However, evidence on the impact and cost-effectiveness of the SOS Xpert stool processing method is needed to inform implementation and scale-up in routine health- care systems. Therefore, we modelled the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of bringing this test to the lower healthcare level where children present first, focusing on Ethiopia and Indonesia. Specifically, we aimed to estimate the impact of implementing the Xpert stool test for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB among chil- dren at the PHC level on rates of bacteriological confir- mation of TB and mortality among children, the costs to the healthcare provider, and the incremental cost- effectiveness of the approach. Ethiopia and Indonesia are currently among the 30 high TB burden countries in the world.13 The incidence of TB was estimated to be 301 (276-328) per 100 000 population with 824 000 (755 000-897 000) people falling ill with TB in 2020 in Indo- nesia. In Ethiopia, the incidence of TB was estimated to be 132 (92-178) per 100 000 population with 151 000 (106 000-205 000) people falling ill with TB in 2020. While TB

mqah | METHODS Conceptual approach
xxr8 | We developed a conceptual model of care pathways for children (age <15 years) with presumptive TB presenting at either PHC facilities or hospitals, referral (including self-referral) between these levels, and clinical and bacte- riological assessment and reassessment (see figure 1). This description of stages in patient care was based on national TB guidelines and local knowledge, and were broad enough to capture pathways in both Ethiopia and Indonesia, and incorporate the standard of care (SOC) as well as the intervention.
