You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

kpvt | A similar uniform bound can be found for the second integral in (2.31), since all the functions which appear in the integral belong to some space <LATEX>B _ { m _ { k } } ^ { \infty } ,</LATEX> upon possibly increasing <LATEX>m _ { k } .</LATEX> Indeed, since <LATEX>\mathfrak{f} _ { i } \in \mathscr{S}</LATEX> for any <LATEX>1 \leqslant i \leqslant k - 1 ,</LATEX> there exist <LATEX>m _ { k ^ { \prime } } \geqslant 1</LATEX> such that
jie2 | <LATEX>| \eta \mathfrak{f} _ { 1 } + \cdots + \eta ^ { k - 1 } \mathfrak{f} _ { k - 1 } | \leqslant \left( | \eta | \| \mathfrak{f} _ { 1 } \| _ { B _ { m _ { k ^ { \prime } } } ^ { \infty } } + \cdots | \eta | ^ { k - 1 } \| \mathfrak{f} _ { k - 1 } \| _ { B _ { m _ { k ^ { \prime } } } ^ { \infty } } \right) \mathcal{K} _ { m _ { k ^ { \prime } } } ,</LATEX> where the prefactor of <LATEX>\mathcal{K} _ { m _ { 1 } }</LATEX> , is uniformly bounded for <LATEX>| \eta | \leqslant \eta _ { * } ,</LATEX> so the second term <LATEX>\mathrm { i n } \left( 2 . 3 1 \right) \mathrm { i }</LATEX> is uniformly bounded in <LATEX>\eta</LATEX> by some constant depending only on <LATEX>\eta _ { * } , \varphi \mathrm { a n d } k</LATEX> k. Lastly, since <LATEX>Q _ { \eta , k } \in \mathscr{S} ,</LATEX> then <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } Q _ { \eta , k } \varphi \in \mathscr{S}</LATEX> , so there exists <LATEX>m _ { k ^ { \prime \prime } } \geqslant 1</LATEX> such that

This allows us to obtain the desired result. C
4exe | Nonlinear response. Linear response is only valid up to certain values of <LATEX>\eta ,</LATEX> after which the nonlinear part of the response becomes too large. To study the crossover, one needs to consider higher order terms of the response. As for <LATEX>t h e</LATEX> invariant mea- sure <LATEX>\psi _ { \eta }</LATEX> of the perturbed dynamics, the response can be expanded as a polynomial in <LATEX>\eta</LATEX> in view of (2.27):
0myz | <LATEX>\mathbb{E} _ { \eta } \left( R \right) = \int _ { \mathcal{X} } R \psi _ { \eta } = \eta \rho _ { 1 } + \eta ^ { 2 } \rho _ { 2 } + \eta ^ { 3 } \rho _ { 3 } + \cdots .</LATEX> This allows us to define the kth-order response, denoted by <LATEX>\rho _ { k } ,</LATEX> characterized induc- tively for <LATEX>k \geqslant 2</LATEX> as

lvae | 2.2.2. Numerical techniques to estimate transport coefficients. In this section, we discuss standard numerical techniques for computing transport coefficients. We first reformulate the linear response presented in Section 2.2.1 as an integrated correlation, through the celebrated Green-Kubo formula, and then outline the numer- ical difficulties associated with the estimation of transport coefficients, in particular the large statistical error of the associated estimators.
o9sc | Reformulating the linear response as an integrated correlation. A useful corol- lary of (2.26) and (2.24) is that we can reformulate the definition of the linear re- sponse (2.20) as an integrated correlation function, called the Green-Kubo formula. To define it, we first consider the following operator identity
121u | (2.35)
zh03 | <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } = - \int _ { 0 } ^ { + \infty } \mathrm { e } ^ { t \mathcal{L} _ { 0 } } d t</LATEX> on the Hilbert space
1mvw | <LATEX>L _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } \left( \psi _ { 0 } \right) = \Pi _ { 0 } L ^ { 2 } \left( \psi _ { 0 } \right) = \left\{ \varphi \in L ^ { 2 } \left( \psi _ { 0 } \right) | \int _ { \mathcal{X} } \varphi \psi _ { 0 } = 0 \right\} .</LATEX> The identity (2.35) holds for underdamped and overdamped Langevin under certain conditions discussed in [29, Section 2]. In view of this identity, as well as (2.20), (2.26) and (2.24), and the definition (2.10) of the conjugated response <LATEX>S ,</LATEX> we can write
6d4s | <LATEX>\rho _ { 1 } = \lim _ { \eta \rightarrow 0 } \frac { \mathbb{E} _ { \eta } \left( R \right) } { \eta } = \int _ { \mathcal{X} } R \mathfrak{f} _ { 1 } \psi _ { 0 } = - \int _ { \mathcal{X} } \left( \mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } R \right) \left( \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } ^ { * } 1 \right) \psi _ { 0 }</LATEX> <LATEX>= \int _ { 0 } ^ { + \infty } \mathbb{E} _ { 0 } \left( R \left( X _ { t } \right) S \left( X _ { 0 } \right) \right) d t ,</LATEX> (2.36)
mqah | where the expectation <LATEX>\mathbb{E} _ { 0 }</LATEX> is over all initial conditions <LATEX>X _ { 0 }</LATEX> distributed according to the invariant measure <LATEX>\psi _ { 0 } ,</LATEX> and over all realizations of the reference dynamics (2.1) at hand. For Langevin dynamics (2.18), the conjugate response function reads
xxr8 | (2.37)
rl4j | <LATEX>S \left( q , p \right) = \beta F \left( q \right) ^ { T } M ^ { - 1 } p .</LATEX> Similarly, for overdamped Langevin dynamics (2.13), it reads
vz32 | <LATEX>S \left( q \right) = \beta F \left( q \right) ^ { T } \nabla V \left( q \right) .</LATEX> In both cases <LATEX>S \in L _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } \left( \psi _ { 0 } \right) .</LATEX> We emphasize that, as already discussed in Section 2.1, the expression for <LATEX>S</LATEX> comes from the generator <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } }</LATEX> of the perturbation, and not the observable
ncb0 | <LATEX>R .</LATEX> The Green-Kubo formula shows that a nonequilibrium property (the transport coefficient <LATEX>\rho _ { 1 }</LATEX> in this case) can be computed using simulations at equilibrium, i.e. for
8mp0 | <LATEX>\eta = 0 .</LATEX> Standard numerical techniques. Transport coefficients are often estimated in one of two ways:
xjyk | (1) Equilibrium techniques based on the Green-Kubo formula (2.36). To numer- ically estimate the quantity (2.36), one needs to discretize the continuous dynamics in time, using a fixed timestep <LATEX>\Delta t > 0 .</LATEX> This leads to the presence of some timestep bias of order <LATEX>\mathrm { O } \left( \Delta t ^ { \theta } \right) ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>\theta</LATEX> depends on the numerical method at hand [28, 29]. Additionally, the time integral must be truncated
mt0f | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS

ixcc | to some finite integration time T. This leads to some truncature bias, which is small due to the exponential convergence of etCo.
8p6h | Last but not least, the expectation is computed using empirical averages over K realizations. This naturally suggests the following estimator for p1:
pmgl | PK,T = K ≥| R(X) (X) dt. k=1 K
90no | Although there are clear advantages to using equilibrium techniques (for in- stance, correlation functions for different conjugate responses can be com- puted simultaneously), there is also one major challenge in using (2.36). The integral is a correlation term, which is a small quantity for large t, plagued by a large statistical error [7]. The statistical error is therefore the main source of error, as the variance is expected to scale linearly with the integration time T. More precisely, it is shown in [38, Section 5] that the statistical error of PK,T is of order T/ K.
jt0y | Overall, a tradeoff has to be considered for the choice of T as the bias is smaller for larger T while the variance increases with T.
qb7o | (2) Nonequilibrium steady-state techniques. This method works by first approxi- mating the limit in (2.20) by the finite difference En (R)/n, with n sufficiently small to limit the bias; and next estimating the expectation with time aver- ages as
oae5 | (2.38) În,t = |R(X) ds,
s0fl | for response functions with average 0 with respect to yo. When computing such steady-state averages over long trajectories, the asymptotic variance of the trajectory average computed using the discretized dynamics coincides at dominant order in n with the asymptotic variance of the trajectory average computed using the corresponding continuous dynamics (see Proposition 2.4 below).
43ia | One source of error is the systematic error due to three different biases. As discussed in Proposition 2.4, the finiteness of the integration time leads to some bias of order 1/(nt), which is typically smaller than the statistical error. Additionally, the fact that we consider n / 0 leads to some bias of order n, as a consequence of Lemma 2.2. Lastly, the time discretization of the continuous dynamics also leads to some time step bias; see [28].
3g2y | As discussed in Proposition 2.4 below, the statistical error is dictated by a central limit theorem, so the variance of the estimator On,t scales as 1/(n2t). The simulation time required to estimate P1 with a sufficient statistical ac- curacy therefore scales as t ~ n-2, leading to very long integration times t. Such long simulation times are often prohibitive in practical cases of interest. These results, and the tradeoffs to be considered, are discussed in more detail in Section 2.3.
gc7v | 2.2.3. Application to mobility. The aim of this section is to illustrate the various previous results in the paradigmatic case of mobility. We consider the case where F E Rª is a constant force, and the state-space is X = Td. We define the mobility for both overdamped Langevin and Langevin dynamics, and discuss how it is related to the self-diffusion by Einstein's relation.
