        "content": "3yxv | While the complexity of the mutational landscape of GPCRs in cancer, which we refer to as the onco-GPCRome, is daunting, some interesting tissue-specific patterns are now emerging that may help explain their direct biological impact. Indeed, recent cross-cancer analysis of GPCR mutations in human malignancies has revealed that gastrointestinal cancers harbor the highest number of mutated GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins, irrespective of the mutational load of these cancers. This is coupled with the recent finding that a significant portion of mutated GPCRs couple to G as and G ai/o, more specifically, an enrichment of activating mutants of G as-coupled receptors, and deleterious (inactivating) mutants of G ai/o-coupled receptors. Together, these mutation patterns converge on the oncogenic impact of elevated adenylyl cyclase activity and production of cyclic AMP, which is stimulated by G as and inhibited by G ai/o, suggesting a prominent role for enhanced cAMP signalling in cancer. The cAMP signalling network is involved in different aspects of tumorigenesis, and these findings establish a functional link between the mutation patterns in GPCRs and their candidate role as cell-context specific oncodrivers, with emphasis on gastrointestinal cancers, including colorectal, stomach, and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. GPCRs are also known to possess copy number variation or gene expression alterations, leading to their aberrant expression in numerous cancer types, representing a mutation-independent, and potentially targetable mechanism by which they can drive oncogenic signalling networks. Indeed, twenty-eight out of thirty-three TCGA cancer cohorts have been found to have CNVs in GPCR and heterotrimeric G protein genes that are significantly correlated with the mRNA expression patterns of each respective gene. The tissue, cell type, and even tumor stage-specific nature of these alterations further emphasize the complex and dynamic molecular forces underlying GPCR signalling in cancer. These mechanisms can contribute to diverse aspects of tumorigenesis, which will be discussed in greater detail below.",
