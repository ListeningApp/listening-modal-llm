We then introduce the notion of synthetic forcings in Section three, where we also give examples and discuss them in more detail. We next demonstrate the possibly dramatic benefits in terms of statistical error with some numerical results in low dimensions in Section four, namely one and two-dimensional overdamped Langevin dynamics, and one-dimensional Langevin dynamics. We finally discuss in Section five the extensions and perspectives of this approach.\n4gqa | Two. Linear response and associated computational techniques. In this section, we review linear response theory and the computational techniques allowing to compute transport coefficients. The framework we consider is that of stochastic dynamics, ergodic for the Boltzmann-Gibbs measure, which are perturbed by external forcings.\nmpgz | We start in Section two point one by setting up the framework for general time-homogeneous stochastic differential equations, and the specific dynamics we consider, namely nonequilibrium overdamped Langevin and Langevin dynamics. We then review in Section two point two linear response theory, the definition of transport coefficients and discuss the associated standard numerical techniques to estimate these coefficients. We finally present the numerical analysis of nonequilibrium molecular dynamics in Section two point three.\ngf06 | Two point one. Reference dynamics and perturbation. We start by describing in Section two point one point one the general setting for linear response theory for a general stochastic differential equation. We introduce in particular some assumptions on the dynamics which will be used in the analysis throughout this paper. We next describe the dynamics and their nonequilibrium perturbations for overdamped Langevin and Langevin dynamics in Sections two point one point two and two point one point three, respectively.\n75hv | Two point one point one. General setting.\ntbiu | Reference dynamics. Consider a general time-homogeneous stochastic differential equation defined on the state-space X, where X is typically the full space R to the power of n or a bounded domain with periodic boundary conditions T to the power of n, with T equals R over Z the one-dimensional torus:\n413q | equation two point one d X t equals b of X t d t plus sigma of X t d W t,\n8wkl | for a given initial condition x naught in X, a standard Brownian motion W t in R to the power of m, and where b maps X to R to the power of n and sigma maps X to R to the power of n by m are assumed to be such that there exists a unique solution to equation two point one. A simple setting is to assume that b and sigma are C infinity, hence locally Lipschitz, which is used to prove existence and uniqueness of the solution. The stochastic differential equation two point one is associated with the following infinitesimal generator\nnext | equation two point two L naught equals b transpose V plus one half sigma sigma transpose V squared,\n3dfm | where : denotes the Frobenius inner product, and V squared is the Hessian operator. More explicitly, for some given C infinity test function psi maps R d to R, the operator L naught acts as\nhjmm | L naught psi equals summation i equals one to d b i partial derivative psi partial derivative x i plus one half summation i equals one to d summation j equals one to d summation k equals one to m sigma i k sigma j k second partial derivative psi partial derivative x i partial derivative x j.\ns0s6 | We assume that the dynamics equation two point one has a unique invariant probability measure with a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure denoted by pi of x.

The dynamics equation two point four admits a unique invariant probability measure for any eta in R, with a smooth density pi eta with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Moreover, trajectorial ergodicity holds: for any observable psi in L one of P eta, and any initial condition X eta,\nkbpy | expectation eta of psi equals integral psi of x pi eta of x d x equals limit as T approaches infinity of one over T integral zero to T psi of X eta t d t almost surely.\nafdp | Note that pi eta solves the Fokker-Planck equation\nfdhb | L naught plus eta L phys pi eta equals zero.\no1k9 | Sufficient conditions for Assumption One to hold are discussed after Assumption Two below. Although pi eta can be shown to uniquely exist, its analytical expression is generally not known. Note that in the case eta equals zero, the dynamics equation two point four reduces to the reference dynamics equation two point one.\ns1uu | We need to make precise some estimates on the evolution semigroup associated with equation two point four for the analysis presented in Section two point three. We consider to this end weighted spaces of bounded functions. To define them, we first introduce a family of Lyapunov functions denoted by K n sub eta in natural numbers, with K n maps X to open interval one to positive infinity such that\n22hf | K sub n less than or equal to K sub n plus one.\ngici | The associated weighted B infinity spaces are\nowaw | B infinity equals the set of measurable psi such that the weighted norm psi weighted B infinity equals the supremum of K n of x times psi of x is finite,\nz6xu | and m depending on the order of derivation.
