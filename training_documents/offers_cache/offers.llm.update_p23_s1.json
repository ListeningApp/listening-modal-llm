        "content": "gz4c | Twelve months after that, we now have a portfolio of seven eight-figure, and multi-eight-figure companies across a variety of industries (photography, publishing, fitness, business consulting, beauty) and business types (brick and mortar chains, software, service, e-commerce, training and education). Our portfolio companies now do about one million six hundred thousand dollars per week (and growing).\nu30w | I say this because I honestly can't believe it. All of this was because of a girl who believed in me, a credit card, and a Grand Slam Offer.\nee2o | I know I teleported you from rags to riches. And the natural question is how? That's what I'm going to use the rest of this book (and remaining books and free courses in this Acquisition.com series) to break down.\np87c | The skill of making offers saved me from bankruptcy and likely saved my life. I have made so many mistakes in my life. I've made so many bad life decisions. I've hurt people knowingly and mistakenly. I've done bad things with good intentions. I say this because I am human. I don't pretend to have the answers. I have my own demons that I battle everyday. But, despite my many shortcomings, I've still managed to get really good at this one thing ... and I'd like to share it with you. I can teach you how to build great offers.\nreyp | I don't know who you are (yes, you, the one reading this). But thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for allowing me to do work I find meaningful. Thank you for giving me your most valuable asset - your attention. I promise to do my best to give you a positive return on it.\n9vu6 | Here is your first piece of good news: if you are reading this, then you are already in the top ten percent. Most people buy stuff and then promptly ignore it. I can also throw out a spoiler: the further you get in the book, the bigger the nuggets become. Just watch.\nli13 | This book delivers.\nyb5z | The world needs more entrepreneurs. It needs more fighters. It needs more magic. And that's what I'm sharing with you - magic.\nl7da | GRAND SLAM OFFERS\n24j5 | \"Make people an offer so good they would feel stupid saying no.\"\nsyjc | I was twenty-three years old and, to quote Ruth from Ozark, I didn't know \"shit about fuck.\" But there I was, in a Las Vegas penthouse hotel room along with ten business owners learning about marketing and sales ... in my most-fashionable \"beast mode\" t-shirt (a shirt I had gotten for free, and one of the five shirts I owned at the time).\nijx9 | Truthfully, I was anxious, self-conscious, and thought I was making a huge mistake. I had paid three thousand dollars of money I didn't have to get a seat at the table. I knew I needed to learn. Everyone there had a business ... except me. I was planning on starting one, a gym.\nsosd | T.J., the organizer, had multiple successful businesses. While going over the agenda, I remember he made an off-hand comment about making one million dollars that year.\nzxxx | One. Million. Dollars. I was spellbound. I wanna be like this guy. I'll do anything. The problem was, I didn't know what any of them were talking about. Key performance indicators? Cost per lead? Conversion rates? My head was spinning as I pretended like I knew what they were talking about. But I didn't, and I'm bad at pretending.\ne6pm | Between \"sessions,\" T.J. found me. He could tell I was in way over my head. T.J. was kind, curious, and caring. After a little bit of small talk, he asked me a simple question that changed my life forever . . .\nml6c | \"Do you want to know the secret to sales?\"\nujdt | I had never sold anything in my life. I had never even read a book on it. I had just recently learned what the term meant (seriously). I leaned forward, intent to download every syllable he spoke right into my brain.\numn7 | I opened my notepad and stared at him with intent. I was ready for the secret.\nt2yx | He looked at me soberly and said: \"Make people an offer so good they would feel stupid saying no.\"\n70qq | I nodded, wrote it down, underlined it, and circled it. And with that, my entire worldview of selling was transformed.\n2421 | My mind began racing. I didn't have to be skilled ... or even any good. I just had to come up with things that anyone would say yes to. The greatest game of my life had begun.\nlvcg | What This Book Is About\nf9cy | At some point, every successful business owner was a wantrepreneur. A person full of ideas and frustrated at having potential to spare. Something clicks when they realize the horrible trade they (and so many people) make - trading their freedom for (falsely) perceived security.\n3vhx | Their discomfort compounds. And once the discomfort of staying the same surpasses the discomfort of change, they take the leap. I'm going to be an entrepreneur so I can be free. Free to do whatever I want, whenever I want, with whomever I want. Some learned about entrepreneurship through personal development.\n1lk7 | Others got into it through a franchise.\nrkgd | Others bought courses.\njbj0 | And some just said, \"F*CK IT. I'm doing it. I'll make it work.\" And made it work they did.\nf7b0 | Most of us open up shop with the intention of helping people in some way. Many times, this assistance is in some way related to something that's affected us personally. We set out to \"give back\" by providing value to others by helping them solve a problem that once plagued us. Then again, sometimes this isn't our way in. In either case, we cling to the dream of making more and being freer than we are now.\n9bdp | Many of us thought, naively, that owning a business would be our crowning accomplishment - a final destination - when in reality, it was just the beginning.\nb1jn | Somehow, in the transition between \"passionate to help others\" and \"owning my first business,\" we gradually realized that we don't even know the first thing about business, let alone turning a profit.\nf02j | We may know a lot about our passion, about why we started the business, but that doesn't mean we know anything about succeeding in business. Much to the disappointment of the idealists on the sidelines, succeeding in business means getting prospective customers to trade us money for our services. Our passion for their hard-earned coins. That's the agreement. The only way to facilitate that exchange, to transact, to literally carry out business as a business is by making the prospect an offer.\nuc93 | What's An Offer Anyways?\n24jr | The only way to conduct business is through a value exchange, a trade of dollars for value. The offer is what initiates this trade. In a nutshell, the offer is the goods and services you agree to give or provide, how you accept payment, and the terms of the agreement. It is what begins the process of getting customers and making money. It is the first thing any new customer will interact with in your business. Since the offer is what attracts new customers, it is the lifeblood of your business.\nweol | No offer? No business. No life.\nzo3w | Bad offer? Negative profit. No business. Miserable life.\nbqsc | Decent offer? No profit. Stagnating business. Stagnating life.\nc2j4 | Good offer? Some profit. Okay business. Okay life.\nk611 | Grand Slam Offer? Fantastic profit. Insane business. Freedom.",
