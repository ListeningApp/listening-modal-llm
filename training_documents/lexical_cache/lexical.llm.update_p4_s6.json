        "content": "l6t9 | How could a notion like articulatory effort be tested? Lindblom considered that his measurements of Swedish vowel formant frequencies, which suggested invariant vowel targets attained to a greater or lesser extent as a function only of vowel duration, implied that vowel reduction should not be explained in terms of lesser articulatory effort: only timing patterns determined whether or not a vowel would be reduced. Van Katwijk's measurements of subglottal pressure found little evidence of stress-related pressure increase.\n1ujy | Harder still to assess was the proposal that listener judgments of stress depended on perceived effort. However a relevant contribution was made in the work of Isačenko and Schädlich; in German utterances, stressed syllables could be signaled by any F zero obtrusion from the overall contour, so that a stressed syllable could be either higher or lower in pitch than its neighbors. Listeners rated both types of obtrusion as stress, which argued\nqzor | against commitment to greater perceived articulatory effort, and instead confirmed sensitivity to location of intonational prominence. Morton and Jassem found a similar result with English listeners judging synthesized nonsense bisyllables.\na0by | Eleven point one point four Reducing the complexity?\nu1ky | As the technology for manipulating speech signals improved, the complexity underlying stress perception was further confirmed. Nakatani and Aston used linear predictive coding techniques to manipulate orthogonally the natural duration, amplitude, and F zero attributes of bisyllables with initial or final stress, and found, as had others before them, that all exercised effects on stress judgments, although the effect of amplitude variation was weakest. In general, the effects were additive, except that durational variation lost its effect in sentence-final position, and F zero lost its effect when the word in question was deaccented in the intonation contour because it followed a contrastive accent. Nakatani and Aston also reported speaker differences in the realization of stress contrasts. Other studies showed that differences between stressed and unstressed syllables in the three standard acoustic parameters were maintained across speech rates, while experiments in languages with fixed-position stress, or in languages with other phonological effects interacting with the stress system, further complicated the picture.\nhtm9 | Attempts were made to develop perceptual measures that might facilitate greater comparability across studies. Gussenhoven and Blom proposed a \"language-neutral test\" based on paired judgments of perceived contrast between isolated vowels. Taylor and Wales proposed a contrast ratio:\n8hul | (stressed minus unstressed) divided by (stressed plus unstressed)\n87vz | which, they reported, for the three standard acoustic dimensions predicted judgments of perceived stress far more effectively than other ratios (such as the most commonly used subtraction ratio, i.e., the simple difference in any of the parameters between stressed and unstressed syllables, or the ratio stressed divided by unstressed, i.e., the division of one set of values by the other).\nym66 | More recent research has tried to disentangle the complexity and multiple determination of stress perception by considering potential confounds. For instance, might stress judgments be complicated by the possibility that word stress placement can shift (so that English thirteen is stressed on the second syllable in the number thirteen, but on the first in thirteen numbers)? However, the undoubted shift in perceptual prominence in many such contrasting phrases does not result from a simple reversal of relative placement of a word's syllables on acoustic dimensions. Likewise, measurements revealed little support for the notion of durational compensation within stress groups in English, such that segments of syllables might be longer in, say, a two-syllable foot (save it) than in a four-syllable foot (savoring it); segment durations are longer in syllables\nl0a3 | with primary stress than in syllables with secondary stress, and longer in turn in the latter than in unstressed syllables, such that syllable duration can be fully predicted given knowledge of the segments and stress pattern of the word.\nu8nw | Eleven point one point five Summary\nl2v9 | Research on stress perception continues both within and outside the speech perception literature. For example, it has long been of interest to speech engineers whether the use of stress-related information in the signal could improve the performance of automatic speech recognizers, and some successful implementations have been reported.\nafbe | Over nearly fifty years, however, perceptual studies have elaborated but not fundamentally altered the early claims concerning the suprasegmental dimensions involved. Syllables are perceived to be stressed if they exhibit F zero excursion, whereby the timing of the F zero movement within the syllable can be crucial for determining stress perception, and some types of F zero movement may require more excursion than others. Greater syllable duration is likewise associated with perceived stress. These two factors are the most strongly related and the least controversial.\n78r8 | More controversial is the common finding that amplitude manipulations only weakly affect stress perception (despite psychoacoustic research showing that quite small changes in this dimension are indeed perceptible). Turk and Sawusch found listeners' perception of duration and amplitude variation to be non-orthogonal; importantly, they observed effects of irrelevant durational variation on judgments of loudness to be greater than effects of amplitude variation on judgments of relative length. This, they argued, provided a rationale for why prominence judgments should be based on duration, or on duration and amplitude together, but not on the latter alone.",
