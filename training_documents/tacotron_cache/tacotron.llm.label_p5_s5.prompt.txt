You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

y4mj | 4 MODEL DETAILS
vpgq | Table 1 lists the hyper-parameters and network architectures. We use log magnitude spectrogram with Hann windowing, 50 ms frame length, 12.5 ms frame shift, and 2048-point Fourier transform. We also found pre-emphasis (0.97) to be helpful. We use 24 kHz sampling rate for all experiments.
ousl | We use <LATEX>r = 2</LATEX> (output layer reduction factor) for the MOS results in this paper, though larger <LATEX>r</LATEX> values (e.g. <LATEX>\left. r = 5 \right)</LATEX> also work well. We use the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with learning rate decay, which starts from 0.001 and is reduced to 0.0005, 0.0003, and 0.0001 after 500K, 1M and <LATEX>2 M</LATEX> global steps, respectively. We use a simple â‚¬1 loss for both seq2seq decoder (mel-scale spectrogram) and post-processing net (linear-scale spectrogram). The two losses have equal weights.
m4ju | We train using a batch size of 32, where all sequences are padded to a max length. It's a com- mon practice to train sequence models with a loss mask, which masks loss on zero-padded frames. However, we found that models trained this way don't know when to stop emitting outputs, causing repeated sounds towards the end. One simple trick to get around this problem is to also reconstruct the zero-padded frames.

ki8m | EXPERIMENTS
km8w | We train Tacotron on an internal North American English dataset, which contains about 24.6 hours of speech data spoken by a professional female speaker. The phrases are text normalized, e.g. "16" is converted to "sixteen".

xagm | Figure 3: Attention alignments on a test phrase. The decoder length in Tacotron is shorter due to the use of the output reduction factor r=5.
iwn5 | 5.1 ABLATION ANALYSIS
uooz | We conduct a few ablation studies to understand the key components in our model. As is common for generative models, it's hard to compare models based on objective metrics, which often do not correlate well with perception (Theis et al., 2015). We mainly rely on visual comparisons instead. We strongly encourage readers to listen to the provided samples.
pxbq | First, we compare with a vanilla seq2seq model. Both the encoder and decoder use 2 layers of residual RNNs, where each layer has 256 GRU cells (we tried LSTM and got similar results). No pre-net or post-processing net is used, and the decoder directly predicts linear-scale log magnitude spectrogram. We found that scheduled sampling (sampling rate 0.5) is required for this model to learn alignments and generalize. We show the learned attention alignment in Figure 3. Figure 3(a) reveals that the vanilla seq2seq learns a poor alignment. One problem is that attention tends to

lq35 | get stuck for many frames before moving forward, which causes bad speech intelligibility in the synthesized signal. The naturalness and overall duration are destroyed as a result. In contrast, our model learns a clean and smooth alignment, as shown in Figure 3(c).
3g9w | Second, we compare with a model with the CBHG encoder replaced by a 2-layer residual GRU encoder. The rest of the model, including the encoder pre-net, remain exactly the same. Comparing Figure 3(b) and 3(c), we can see that the alignment from the GRU encoder is noisier. Listening to synthesized signals, we found that noisy alignment often leads to mispronunciations. The CBHG encoder reduces overfitting and generalizes well to long and complex phrases.
d09o | Figures 4(a) and 4(b) demonstrate the benefit of using the post-processing net. We trained a model without the post-processing net while keeping all the other components untouched (except that the decoder RNN predicts linear-scale spectrogram). With more contextual information, the prediction from the post-processing net contains better resolved harmonics (e.g. higher harmonics between bins 100 and 400) and high frequency formant structure, which reduces synthesis artifacts.
ylhz | 5.2 MEAN OPINION SCORE TESTS
a3td | We conduct mean opinion score tests, where the subjects were asked to rate the naturalness of the stimuli in a 5-point Likert scale score. The MOS tests were crowdsourced from native speakers.
ex5k | 7
9d4o | 100 unseen phrases were used for the tests and each phrase received 8 ratings. When computing MOS, we only include ratings where headphones were used. We compare our model with a para- metric (based on LSTM (Zen et al., 2016)) and a concatenative system (Gonzalvo et al., 2016), both of which are in production. As shown in Table 2, Tacotron achieves an MOS of 3.82, which outperforms the parametric system. Given the strong baselines and the artifacts introduced by the Griffin-Lim synthesis, this represents a very promising result.
cjq2 | 6 DISCUSSIONS
5esx | We have proposed Tacotron, an integrated end-to-end generative TTS model that takes a character sequence as input and outputs the corresponding spectrogram. With a very simple waveform syn- thesis module, it achieves a 3.82 MOS score on US English, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. Tacotron is frame-based, so the inference is substantially faster than sample-level autoregressive methods. Unlike previous work, Tacotron does not need hand- engineered linguistic features or complex components such as an HMM aligner. It can be trained from scratch with random initialization. We perform simple text normalization, though recent ad- vancements in learned text normalization (Sproat & Jaitly, 2016) may render this unnecessary in the future.
m5ka | We have yet to investigate many aspects of our model; many early design decisions have gone unchanged. Our output layer, attention module, loss function, and Griffin-Lim-based waveform synthesizer are all ripe for improvement. For example, it's well known that Griffin-Lim outputs may have audible artifacts. We are currently working on fast and high-quality neural-network-based spectrogram inversion.
