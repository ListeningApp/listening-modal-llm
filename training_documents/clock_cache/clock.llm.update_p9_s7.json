There are differences in the coupling proteins obtained from the M. capsulatus Bath and M. trichosporium O B three b organisms, which could alter the properties of the system. Moreover, it should be recalled that the M. capsulatus Bath methanotroph was isolated from thermal waters and has its optimal monooxygenase activity at forty-five degrees Celsius, whereas the M M O from M. trichosporium O B three b is typically assayed at ambient temperature twenty-three degrees Celsius. Further studies, involving additional mechanistic probes and the application of other methodologies, are currently in progress to provide further insight into these issues.\nma93 | Conclusions. The major findings of this investigation may be summarized as follows:\nc6hh | One. The absence of ring-opened products in the hydroxylation of probes one and two suggests that the mechanism for M M O from M. capsulatus Bath may not involve radicals or carbocations, at least for these substrates.\ny7ea | Two. Isotope-effect studies with deuterated probe one indicate that the hydroxylation step is not rate-determining in the overall M M O mechanism but that substantial C-H bond activation is involved in this step.\nnav4 | Three. The observation that equimolar quantities of phenol and alcohol are produced in the hydroxylations of racemic mixtures of one and its trideuterated analogue implies that chiral discrimination in the enzyme active site can dictate the regiospecificity of the reaction.\ngem8 | Four. A semiquantitative Marcus theory analysis was used to evaluate how the ring-opening rate constant of phenyl-substituted cyclopropanes can be tuned by changing the dihedral angle between the phenyl and cyclopropyl rings.\ne8nr | Five. Several detailed proposals have been set forth for two discrete arcs of the M M O catalytic cycle, the activation of the reduced, diiron two form by dioxygen, and the subsequent hydroxylation step. These considerations should serve as a valuable reference point for the interpretation of mechanistic results from diiron oxo and related monooxygenases as well as their model compounds.\nk78w | Six. Analysis of the present and literature results for the hydroxylation of hydrocarbons by M M O suggests that multiple mechanisms may be operative.",
