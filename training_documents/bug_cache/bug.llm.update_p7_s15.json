        "content": "53eu | quently, we collected data from individuals in a broad range of jobs in a variety of organizations. This allowed us to rule out the possibility that results might be unique to a particular type of job or organization and would support generalization to a broad range of settings. We considered seventy-four firms in the Midwest as possible data collection sites and assessed each on four characteristics (likelihood of being able to study multiple groups from the same organization, likelihood of being able to study groups in which jobs were interdependent, likelihood that a personal contact would be willing to endorse the study, and our subjective assessment of the probability of successfully collecting data in the organization). On the basis of this analysis we contacted forty-four firms and twenty-one (forty-eight percent) agreed to participate, providing us with access to ninety-five work groups that met our criteria for inclusion. We excluded temporary groups (i.e., task forces and committees) and groups with low task interdependence where work was performed primarily by individuals working alone (i.e., bank tellers, research scientists with individual accountability for projects, and sales personnel with individual incentive programs). In summary, groups in the study were of an ongoing or permanent nature and composed of at least three employees in interdependent jobs who reported to the same supervisor. The resulting convenience sample consisted of data from five hundred ninety-seven employees, their peers, and their supervisors from ninety-five work groups (median group size equals eight) from twenty-one organizations. The data on voice behavior and respondent demographics were originally collected for cross-validation purposes as part of a larger construct validity study. For the current study variables, we obtained complete data on four hundred forty-one employees and conducted our analyses on these responses.\na5u1 | Data were collected from employees in group meetings held at company facilities during normal working hours. Participants were told that their individual responses would remain confidential and that they could withdraw from the study at any time. Respondents completed questionnaires in the presence of a researcher and other group members to assure that all participants were exposed to the same stimuli, had the same background information on the study, and completed their questionnaires under the same circumstances. On average, employees were thirty-six years of age and were employed by their organizations for seven years. Women made up fifty-four percent of the sample and forty-four percent had at least some college education. Respondents were all full time and sixty-five percent held manager or professional jobs.\nry7u | To ensure a stringent assessment of our hypotheses, we assessed voice six months after we obtained data on the predictors. Time one data collection included employee and supervisor questionnaires. At Time two, four peers rated each employee's voice behavior. Prior to the data collection meetings, group supervisors provided the researchers with names of all group members. We excluded temporary workers and employees who had been group members less than three months to ensure that group members had adequate knowledge to assess voice behavior. We prepared peer rating questionnaires in advance, by writing a specific peer's name on the top of each subsection of the peer report instrument. In groups that contained five or fewer employees, each group member described all peers. In groups of more than five, we randomly selected which four peers' names were written on each questionnaire. We did this to avoid potential selection bias that might have occurred if respondents chose specific peers.\n5mda | This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\ni4li | This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nr8sm | This also provided a balanced design where each individual was described by an equal number of peers. The primary advantage of using peers as raters is that in most interdependent work groups there is daily interaction among peers that allows them to observe a wide range of behaviors under different circumstances. Peer ratings, therefore, should be more reflective of behavior than self-ratings (which may be subject to self-presentation bias) and supervisor ratings (which may reflect atypical impression management behaviors).\ncuin | Measures\nn1i7 | Voice. We measured voice at Time two with Van Dyne and LePine's six-item scale, which itself was based on a modification of the Van Dyne, Graham, and Dienesch Advocacy Participation Scale. Item anchors were one equals strongly disagree to seven equals strongly agree. Items were prefaced by \"This particular co-worker\" and ended with (one) \"develops and makes recommendations concerning issues that affect this work group\"; (two) \"speaks up and encourages others in this group to get involved in issues that affect the group\"; (three) \"communicates his or her opinions about work issues to others in this group even if his or her opinion is different and others in the group disagree with him or her\"; (four) \"keeps well informed about issues where his or her opinion might be useful to this work group\"; (five) \"gets involved in issues that affect the quality of work life here in this group\"; and (six) \"speaks up in this group with ideas for new projects or changes in procedures.\" We used the mean of the peer ratings to operationalize voice. Internal consistency and interrater agreement for the scale were high, mean\n0r5m | R W G zero equals point eight eight, standard deviation equals point two zero. Satisfaction with the group. We assessed satisfaction with the group with four items based on Kunin's Faces Scales. For each item, employees circled the number of the face, one equals big frown to seven equals big smile, that best represented their feelings as a member of the work group. Example items include \"Consider this work group. Select the face which best expresses how you feel about this work group here\" and \"Consider your co-workers. Select the face which best expresses how you feel about your co-workers here.\" Cronbach's alpha was point eight six.\nne2o | Global self-esteem. We measured global self-esteem using Brockner's seventeen-item scale, one equals never to seven equals always. Participants were asked to think of their overall life experiences and then indicate the extent to which they believed in statements such as \"How often do you feel that you have handled yourself well at a social gathering?\" and \"How often do you have the feeling that you can do everything well?\" Cronbach's alpha was point eight nine.\nsqxn | Situational measures. Supervisors provided information on group size (number of employees in the group) and style of management, zero equals traditional, one equals self. Because the general context of work can affect attitudes and behavior, we controlled for the firm type, zero equals manufacturing, one equals nonmanufacturing, and firm size (number of employees in the organization).",
