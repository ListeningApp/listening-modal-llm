Let X be a local minima of one and X k be an iterate of Algorithm four with delta chosen according to forty-four. There exists Delta sep such that if X k in B of X star, Delta sep, then\ntxkp | script A of X k, delta equals script A of X star, zero. Proof.

We first we prove script I of X k, delta k superset script I of X star, zero.

In particular, we prove the contrapositive i in script A of X star, zero implies i in script A of X k, delta. For i in script A of X star, zero we know that X star to the i equals zero and so for X k in B of X star, Delta sep we have\nyck2 | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimisation with Nonnegativity Constraints\nhthe | That is,\notjm | i in script A of X k, delta. With this result in hand, we know that we apply the \"correct\" update to X k.
