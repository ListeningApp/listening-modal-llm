You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

kn5c | We're defining entropy with an integral now, unlike a sum as before, and sticking Boltzmann's constant into the definition of entropy, as physicists do, so that entropy has units of energy over temperature.
mqu9 | Given the formula for the energy E as a function on R", we'll have to find the Boltzmann distribution and then compute (E) as a function of T.
i0lj | PROOF OF THE EQUIPARTITION THEOREM: 1
fdab | Special case: a system with 1 degree of freedom where the energy E : R -> R is E(x) = x2/2.
07he | The Boltzmann distribution is
v1de | e-Bx2/2 e - Bx2 /2 doc
7mej | p(x) =
jw4n | so the expected energy is
9qfg | ∞ r2 e-Bx2/2 dxc
ssph | 1 00 Bx2e-Bæ2/2 dx .00
dves | 23 1-00 00 e-Bx2/2 dx
3d6a | (E) = -00 .00 E(x)p(x) dx =
li84 | ∞ e-Bx2/2 dx 2
y06n | so doing a substitution with u2 = Bx2:
sipr | (E) = 1 00
yuxx | 00 e-u2 /2 du u2e-u2/2 du
dbah | 23 1
4byb | 23
u64j | 2
4lha | since
uj4l | [° e-u2 /2 du = -00 u2e-u2/2du = V2T
ojba | We'll do two special cases before proving the general result. First let's do a system with 1 degree of freedom where the energy is E(x) = x2/2. In this case, after a change of variables, the Gibbs distribution becomes a Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1, and that gives the desired result. Or just do the integrals and see what you get! The expected energy (E) is }kT.
mwgi | PROOF OF THE EQUIPARTITION THEOREM: 2
cjze | More general case: a system with n degrees of freedom where the energy E: Rn > R is F(x) = Ml |2= 2
rtvx | We can reduce this to the case with 1 degree of freedom:
h0y1 | (E) = Rn
xxw0 | 2 T
fv2x | - e-Bl|2|12/2 dn x
663s | e- Blæ|12/2 dn x
385i | JIRn
uhr9 | Next we do a system with n degrees of freedom where the energy is a sum of n terms of the form x2/2. It's no surprise that each degree of freedom contributes AkT to the expected energy, giving
9w2j | 〈 E>= 5nkT
usxo | But make sure you follow my calculation above. I skipped a couple of steps!
5fmi | PROOF OF THE EQUIPARTITION THEOREM: 3
h8p7 | General case: a system with <LATEX>n</LATEX> degrees of freedom where the energy <LATEX>E : \mathbb{R} ^ { n } \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</LATEX> is any positive definite quadratic form. Then
gcbc | <LATEX>E \left( x \right) = \frac { 1 } { 2 } \| A x \| ^ { 2 }</LATEX> for some invertible <LATEX>n \times n</LATEX> matrix <LATEX>A .</LATEX> When <LATEX>A</LATEX> is a diagonal matrix this gives
d9tz | <LATEX>E \left( x \right) = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } \frac { c _ { i } x _ { i } ^ { 2 } } { 2 } \quad c _ { i } > 0</LATEX> We can reduce the general case to the previous case by a change of variables
dusw | <LATEX>y = A x :</LATEX> <LATEX>\langle E \rangle = \frac { \int _ { \mathbb{R} ^ { n } } \frac { 1 } { 2 } \| A x \| ^ { 2 } e ^ { - \beta \| A x \| ^ { 2 } / 2 } d ^ { n } x } { \int _ { \mathbb{R} ^ { n } } e ^ { - \beta \| A x \| ^ { 2 } / 2 } d ^ { n } x } = \frac { \int _ { \mathbb{R} ^ { n } } \frac { 1 } { 2 } \| y \| ^ { 2 } e ^ { - \beta \| y \| ^ { 2 } / 2 } d ^ { n } y } { \int _ { \mathbb{R} ^ { n } } e ^ { - \beta \| y \| ^ { 2 } / 2 } d ^ { n } y } = \frac { n } { 2 } k T</LATEX> Finally let's do the general case. A quadratic form on <LATEX>\mathbb{R} ^ { n }</LATEX> is a map <LATEX>Q : \mathbb{R} ^ { n } \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</LATEX> such that
pk82 | <LATEX>Q \left( x \right) = \sum _ { i , j = 1 } ^ { n } q _ { i j } x _ { i } x _ { j }</LATEX> for some numbers <LATEX>q _ { i j } \in \mathbb{R} .</LATEX> We say it's positive definite if
blll | <LATEX>x \neq 0 \Longrightarrow Q \left( x \right) > 0 .</LATEX> One can prove that a quadratic form <LATEX>Q : \mathbb{R} ^ { n } \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</LATEX> is positive definite if and only if
ocgf | <LATEX>Q \left( x \right) = \frac { 1 } { 2 } \| A x \| ^ { 2 }</LATEX> for some invertible <LATEX>n \times n</LATEX> matrix <LATEX>A .</LATEX> The factor of <LATEX>1 / 2</LATEX> here is just to make our calculations easier.
tybl | Thanks to this, if we have a system whose space of states is <LATEX>\mathbb{R} ^ { n }</LATEX> and its energy function <LATEX>E : \mathbb{R} ^ { n } \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</LATEX> is a positive definite quadratic form, we can compute
80zt | <LATEX>\langle E \rangle = \frac { \int _ { \mathbb{R} ^ { n } } E \left( x \right) \exp \left( - \beta E \left( x \right) \right) d x } { \int _ { \mathbb{R} ^ { n } } \exp \left( - \beta E \left( x \right) \right) d x }</LATEX> by reducing it to the previous case using a change of variables. We get
axet | <LATEX>\langle E \rangle = \frac { 1 } { 2 } n k T</LATEX> 51
drxk | So, each degree of freedom still contributes akT to the expected energy. That's the equipartition theorem!
08na | But be careful. The equipartition theorem doesn't apply when the energy is an arbitrary function of n variables. It also fails when we switch from classical to quantum statistical mechanics.
