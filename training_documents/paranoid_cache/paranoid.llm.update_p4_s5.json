Reparation in the essay is on the side of multiplicity, surprise, rich divergence, consolation, creativity, and love. If reparative reading is bet- ter at the level of ethics and affect-and there is really no doubt that it is-it also looks better at the level of epistemology and knowledge. Even though paranoid or, in terms borrowed from Silvan Tomkins, strong the- ory can organize vast amounts of territory and tell big truths, it misses the descriptive richness of weak theory. Weak theory stays local, gives up on\nylhz | hypervigilance for attentiveness; instead of powerful reductions, it prefers acts of noticing, being affected, taking joy, and making whole.\na3td | Still, despite the methodological gains and affective appeal of the turn away from critique, I just don't think it's possible to read Sedgwick's essay on paranoid and reparative reading as only a call for reparative reading. There is no doubt that she extends this call. But that is not all that she does. For one thing, Sedgwick acknowledges throughout the essay the benefits of paranoid reading. For another, the essay itself is not only reparative-it is paranoid. The paranoid aspect of the essay is evident not only in the subtitle but throughout the essay, and Sedgwick says so all but directly.\nex5k | Sedgwick not only acknowledges the paranoid nature of her earlier published work, at one point she characterizes her reading in the \"preced- ing section of the present chapter\" as an example of strong theory. There are also moments of pique in the essay that do not sound a repara- tive note. I think of the whipsmart exclamations that punctuate the essay. For instance, in a discussion of Michel Foucault's critique of pastoral care, she writes, \"As if! I'm a lot less worried about being pathologized by my therapist than about my vanishing mental health coverage\". Sedg- wick is more expansive about the negative affects that fuel her turn to re- parative reading in the later essay she published on Klein; she discusses her \"barely successful defenses against being devoured by my own cycles of greed, envy, rage and, in particular, overwhelming anxiety.\" The reflexivity and mimesis that Sedgwick identifies as the hallmarks of paranoid thought are evident throughout these two late essays. Perhaps the most striking example is the moment in \"Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading\" when Sedgwick takes Fredric Jameson to task for the absolute and mandatory quality of his famous injunction, \"Always historicize!\" \"Always historicize?\" she asks. In her essay on Klein, Sedgwick describes her intellectual com- mitments, adding that they are never dualistic. Never dualistic??\n9d4o | I do not point to such moments because I want to catch Sedgwick in her paranoid mode-though I'll try not to disavow entirely the aggressive and self-aggrandizing impulses that might push me in that direction. Still, as far as I can tell, my investment is somewhat different. I am trying to an- swer a call that I read in Sedgwick's work generally but especially in this essay-the call to acknowledge the negativity and the aggression at the heart of psychic life and to recognize that thinking is impossible without this kind of aggression. As in Klein, the schizoid position and the depres- sive position can't really be separated from each other: subjects vacillate between these two positions without ever coming to rest. My own reading of Sedgwick's essay vacillates between a schizoid-paranoid mode and a\ncjq2 | reparative mode. What the essay argues, and what it performs, is the im- possibility of choosing between them. So many of us feel compelled to answer Sedgwick's call to reparation, which cracks us out of academic business as usual and promises good things both for Sedgwick and for us. But I also think we need to answer the call to paranoia and aggression. Sedgwick taught me to let the affect in, but it's clear that by doing so I won't only be letting the sunshine in.\n5esx | I would suggest that we do Sedgwick a disservice when we read her solely through a reparative mode. A reading of her work as all about love suggests that we are not listening to her, nor watching how she moves. In his recent book Queer Optimism, Michael Snediker writes that \"Sedgwick's theorizations of shame are incontestably magnanimous and good-inten- tioned.\" To which I want to say, incontestably?\nm5ka | Sedgwick argues that paranoia, with its aversion to surprises, forecloses not only bad experiences but also unexpected good ones. She writes,\nbyu8 | Because there can be terrible surprises, however, there can also be good ones. Hope, often a fracturing, even a trau- matic thing to experience, is among the energies by which the reparatively positioned reader tries to organize the frag- ments and part-objects she encounters and creates. Because the reader has room to realize that the future may be differ- ent from the present, it is also possible for her to entertain such profoundly painful, profoundly relieving, ethically crucial possibilities as that the past, in turn, could have hap- pened differently from the way it actually did.\n76b0 | In this fracturing of the rigid temporality of paranoia we see the stakes of Sedgwick's turn to reparative reading. Yet, just as allowing for good sur- prises means risking bad surprises, practicing reparative reading means leaving the door open to paranoid reading. There is risk in love, including the risk of antagonism, aggression, irritation, contempt, anger-love means trying to destroy the object as well as trying to repair it. Not only are these two positions-the schizoid and the depressive-inseparable, not only is oscillation between them inevitable, but they are also bound together by the glue of shared affect. Paranoia is a mode of anxiety about what might hap- pen to you; reparation is also grounded in anxiety. The depressive position for Klein involves anxiety not only about what you may have done to others, but also about the unintended consequences of your actions in the present.\nzxz6 | Sedgwick worries about the problem of unintended consequences across these two essays. She invokes a fantasy figure-the ultimate\nxnth | teacher-who does no harm, \"who is able to perceive and be perceived clearly enough that the things he or she does are efficacious, and no more than efficacious.\" But that fantasy of doing no harm can only ever be a fantasy, just as there can be no possibility of acting without unintended consequences. Sedgwick tells us that karmic individuals-that is, all of us-will always be more than efficacious, nontransparent to ourselves, and capable of harms that we cannot begin to imagine. Our own actions produce results that will come as surprises, often unwelcome ones.\n```",
