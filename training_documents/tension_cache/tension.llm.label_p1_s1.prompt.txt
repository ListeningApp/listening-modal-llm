You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

o2kr | Sustainability reporting and approaches to materiality: tensions and potential resolutions
v6sk | Sustainability reporting and materiality
1wj6 | 341
936l | Abstract
06yq | Purpose - The concept of materiality is becoming increasingly important for sustainability performance measurement and reporting. It is widely agreed upon that materiality matters, in the sense that companies should identify, prioritize and disclose information on sustainability issues that are considered material. There is, however, a tension at the heart of this consensus, owing to parallel approaches to materiality being used in practice. This paper aims to shed light on how and why the parallel uses of the materiality concept may cause confusion and how this tension could be resolved.
dpv6 | Design/methodology/approach - This paper takes as point of departure the tension between two approaches to materiality: based on the Global Reporting Initiative definition, which emphasizes sustainability issues that are important to stakeholders and that have significant impacts and based on the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board definition, which emphasizes sustainability issues that are financially material, i.e. likely to influence the financial performance of the company. This paper discusses the nature and consequences of the tensions between how the two definitions of materiality in sustainability reporting are used in practice, with a particular emphasis on users of information in financial markets. This paper provides empirical insight on these users' perspectives through a survey <LATEX>\left( n = 3 0 \right)</LATEX> and qualitative interviews <LATEX>\left( n = 6 \right)</LATEX> of financial market professionals.
8r5j | Findings - This study reveals tensions between different approaches to materiality in practice and how this may lead users of sustainability reports to draw unjustified conclusions on the basis of materiality assessments. Specifically, this paper demonstrates the perceived shortcomings in information availability and information quality from the perspectives of different stakeholders in financial markets with different information needs.
2taz | Practical implications - The users of sustainability reporting information require clarity in the communication of materiality in non-financial reports. This paper addresses how such clarity can be pursued.
o3ya | Social implications - Clarity about materiality in non-financial reporting is important both for investors that pursue financial return on green investments and for society at large, which relies on information about real sustainability impacts.

qvnu | Introduction
kggw | In different ways and to varying degrees, companies increasingly attempt to improve their sustainability footprints and to disclose sustainability performance information (Kiron et al., 2017). There are a multitude of stakeholder expectations that drive this development. Companies show willingness to respond to such expectations, e.g. to comply with regulatory requirements, act in accordance with social norms and to act in ways that maintain a good reputation (Pérez-López et al., 2015). Thus, sustainability reporting is becoming widespread for both legitimacy and accountability purposes (Comyns et al., 2013). In recent years, also investors and lenders - who are important users of sustainability performance information - have increasingly demanded such information, in particular about companies' sustainability efforts that are correlated with financial performance (Nidumolu et al., 2009; Jørgensen and Pedersen, 2018).
xrd1 | As reporting on sustainability has become more prevalent across industries globally, new standards have emerged for measurement and reporting with an aim to ensure high- quality sustainability information. A key challenge for companies is how to assess which sustainability issues are more or less material for companies in different industries (Eccles et al., 2012; Beske et al., 2020). The development towards more standardized sustainability reporting responds to calls for relevant and comparable information on so-called environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors by investors and other users of non- financial information (Eccles et al., 2012).
5746 | In the field of sustainable business generally and sustainability reporting specifically, there seems to be widespread agreement that materiality matters. That is, scholars and practitioners alike argue that companies should conduct materiality analyses and that such analyses can inform both sustainability strategy and reporting (Khan et al., 2016; Whitehead, 2017; Rogers and Serafeim, 2019; Steinbarth and Bennett, 2018; PwC, 2019, p. 10). Companies' sustainability efforts and the reporting thereof are subject to continuous prioritization, for instance, regarding which efforts should be conducted, which indicators should be chosen as measures of performance and which information should be disclosed. Materiality assessments are central tools in such prioritizations, as they allow for an assessment of the relative importance of various sustainability issues. Furthermore, materiality assessments can help in the tradeoffs between potentially vastly different activities along each of the E, S and G dimensions.
7toz | At the heart of the apparent consensus about materiality, however, is an important source of confusion (Jebe, 2019). As pointed out by Edgley (2014), the malleable nature of the materiality concept has allowed for realignment and reinvention of the concept over time, to meet changing priorities and challenges. Materiality has been a contested concept for a long time. Already in 2003, Simon Zadek and Mira Merme argued that materiality was in the process of being redefined through pressures from civil society, through regulatory and litigation pressures as well as through practices developed by business organizations themselves (Zadek and Merme, 2003; Calace, 2019). The problem at present is that the concept of materiality as it relates to sustainability is used in two very different ways and that there is a tension between the two. The two approaches to materiality correspond with those used by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) on the one hand and those used by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) on the other hand. They diverge from each other in an
j346 | important way, as we will explore in depth below. This difference can easily deceive users of sustainability reports when references to "material sustainability issues" are made.
v8uq | In this paper, we take as point of departure the perspective of users of sustainability performance information in financial markets. The challenge of the two parallel approaches to materiality is important to this stakeholder group owing to their use of such information to inform investment and lending decisions. There is a widespread claim that companies that prioritize material sustainability issues in their strategies and operations are more profitable than those that do not. This is based on recent empirical findings (Khan et al., 2016; Grewal et al., 2020) that have received wide coverage in the business press. [1] Furthermore, these findings have informed both consulting advice (PwC, 2019; EY, 2018) and investment advice (Steinbarth and Bennett, 2018). Importantly, however, while the empirical findings that are the basis for these conclusions are based on a SASB understanding of the concept of (financial) materiality, much of companies' activities on the measurement and reporting of sustainability performance is based on a wider GRI understanding of materiality. A lack of clarity about what is implied when referring to "material sustainability issues" may consequently lead users of this information to draw unjustified conclusions and make potentially wrong decisions (e.g. investment decisions) accordingly. Indeed, as pointed out by SASB CEO Janine Guillot and Chair of the SASB Standards Board Jeffrey Hales, the GRI and SASB "have historically used fundamentally different definitions of materiality. This has led to a market dialogue in which even informed participants must take pains to avoid talking past each other" (Guillot and Hales, 2021).
x972 | The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the tensions between the two uses of the concept of materiality and what the difference implies for users of information in sustainability reports. We discuss what these differences imply in practice and how it may lead investors and other users of sustainability performance information astray. Furthermore, we provide empirical insight from a survey and qualitative interviews of users of sustainability information in financial markets, i.e. investment professionals and other financial market stakeholders. In doing so, we intend to contribute to the understanding of how parallel approaches to materiality in sustainability reporting may lead to confusion and how the tensions between these concepts can be resolved.
cwrw | The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. First, we account for existing literature on the concept of materiality in sustainability reporting. Second, we present our empirical study and its results. Third, we discuss the practical challenges of materiality in sustainability reporting and the way forward.
4i0e | Approaches to materiality in sustainability reporting: definitions and tensions Let us first consider the concept of materiality - what it is and how it matters for sustainability reporting. In financial accounting, from where the concept originates, materiality is defined as follows:
h2l3 | The omission or misstatement of an item is material in a financial report, if, in light of surrounding circumstances, the magnitude of the item is such that it is probable that the judgment of a reasonable person relying upon the report would have been changed or influenced by the inclusion or correction of an item (Messier et al., 2005, p. 155).
dfzb | The concept of materiality has, however, increasingly been translated from its use in the conceptual frameworks of financial accounting into the realm of sustainable business and reporting (Gibassier, 2019; Moroney and Trotman, 2016), as well as assurance (Edgley et al., 2015). Practically speaking, the goal is to distinguish between material sustainability issues, i.e. those sustainability issues that are likely to influence the decision making of

h27a | stakeholders (e.g. investors, consumers, regulators) and those issues that are non-material, i.e. not likely to influence decision-making. While the purpose of discerning between more or less material issues in financial reporting is related to understanding factors influencing the financial performance of the company, materiality in sustainability reporting is related to the company's social and environmental performance.
pdjh | Often, materiality assessments are visualized using a so-called materiality matrix. Such a matrix illustrates the prioritization of sustainability issues in a two-dimensional diagram in which the two axes represent the interests of different stakeholder groups (see the subsequent section for more detail on materiality matrices). In a reporting context, the materiality matrix serves as a taxonomy of the issues that are disclosed in the sustainability report. However, as pointed out by Forstater et al. (2006, p. 42), "[t]he basic methodology and matrix can be adapted for different needs and applications either in reporting or strategy development." Thus, it can be used to support various activities, such as risk assessment, performance management and reporting, that rely on discerning material sustainability information from non-material information.
xmgs | As defined by Adams et al. (2020, p. 9), material sustainability information is any information that is reasonably capable of making a difference to the conclusions drawn by:
bd9h | · stakeholders concerning the positive and negative impacts of the organization on global achievement of the SDGs; and
m047 | · providers of financing concerning the ability of the organization to create long-term value for the organization and society.
gy8c | This definition reflects what is often referred to as "double materiality," in which the former bullet point captures "environmental and social materiality" and the latter captures "financial materiality" (Gibassier, 2019). That is, this definition provides a holistic perspective on materiality, which corresponds with the interest of both stakeholders at large and shareholders or investors specifically. Importantly, however, the two rival definitions of materiality that correspond with each of these two are used separately and in parallel. In the following, we outline these concepts and the tensions between them.
y4mj | Global Reporting Initiative vs Sustainability Accounting Standards Board: two definitions of materiality
vpgq | The two rival definitions of materiality are associated with and used by GRI and SASB, respectively. According to Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) (2011, p. 3), material sustainability information refers to "those topics that have a direct or indirect impact on an organization's ability to create, preserve or erode economic, environmental and social value for itself, its stakeholders and society at large." The corresponding two-dimensional matrix used by the GRI to visualize degrees of materiality has "Influence on stakeholder assessments and decisions" along the Y-axis and "Significance of the reporting organization's economic, environmental and social impacts" along the X-axis (Figure 1).
ousl | SASB (2020) defines material issues as those "that are likely to affect the financial condition or operating performance of companies within an industry." [2] SASB does not explicitly use a comparable materiality matrix as the one in Figure 1. However, conceptually, the SASB approach to materiality is more akin to what is captured in a different kind of materiality matrix commonly used in sustainability reports, e.g. by large companies such as Unilever and Nestlé. In such materiality matrices, the Y-axis typically reads "Importance for stakeholders" while the X-axis typically reads "Importance for the company" or some comparable variety thereof (Figure 2) [3]. The latter phrase relates to the business performance of the reporting company itself, which is of crucial importance to its shareholders. While the materiality matrix

jfsr | illustrated in Figure 2 is not used by SASB, it visualizes an approach to materiality that lies closer to the SASB variant. As is evident from the axes in Figure 2, such an approach to materiality much more strictly delineates those sustainability issues that are financially material - a concept that SASB indeed has begun using to distinguish it from other forms of materiality. We should note, however, that issues that are judged to be important for the company's business performance by the company itself, may not necessarily be financially material. Thus, to use Figure 2 as a visual proxy for the SASB approach to materiality, we need to assume that "Sustainability issues that are important for the company" refers to sustainability issues that are deemed financially material for the sector in which the company operates.
u15r | Companies increasingly use such materiality analyses and develop materiality matrices to analyze and visualize which sustainability issues are material to them and that therefore needs to be addressed. Such materiality assessments can thus inform sustainability strategy as well as the measurement and reporting of sustainability performance, as they are a tool for identifying and prioritizing between sustainability issues (Whitehead, 2017; Jørgensen and Pedersen, 2018). Consequently, materiality analyses can be found on corporate websites, in strategy documents and in sustainability reports or integrated reports to visualize and communicate such prioritizations.
