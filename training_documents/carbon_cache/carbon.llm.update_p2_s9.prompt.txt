You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures

rhaz | Authors as Hao et al. (2016) show different effects of in- equality on pollution related to different shapes of environ- mental Kuznets curve (inverted U-shape, U-shape, linearity). They proposed that when the EKC curve was depicted as an "inverted U", the redistribution from the rich individuals to the poor contributes to the emission rise in connection with the decrease of the income inequality level. Conversely, in the case of a "U" shape, the enlargement of income inequality would contribute to the growth of emissions. When EKC re- lationship is linear, inequality has insignificant effect on envi- ronmental pollution. However, economic development is con- nected not only to environmental quality but also to income inequality level. Kuznets curve was applied for both variables (Kuznets 1955; Grossman and Krueger 1995). Hence, if coun- tries trace the same trajectory of Kuznets curve, and the turn point is rather similar, then the positive relationship between inequality and CO2 emissions is observed (Fig. 1a). In this case, pollution related to climate change is compatible with income inequality, and a process of economic development can resolve these issues (reduction of inequality and pollution) at the same time.
wak1 | Yet, in the case of economic growth, the environmental impact can decrease or, put in other words, match the right side of the EKC. Alternatively, when the economic develop- ment level stays the same, income inequality does not reach the turn point and remains on the left side of Kuznets curve (and vice versa) (Fig. 1b). In these circumstances, according to
wtfz | the proposed model, the negative correlation between inequal- ity level and CO2 emissions is observed. The negative rela- tionship between inequality and CO2 emissions can occur when a U-shaped trajectory of one variable (income inequality level (Barro, 2000) or CO2 emissions) is observed instead of the inverted U-shape (Fig. 1c). The relationship is insignifi- cant when pollution or inequality level of the countries corre- spond to the turn point. Therefore, different correlations be- tween the income inequality level and CO2 emissions with regard to the economic development level could be observed due to the different Kuznets curve trajectories. In addition, when analysing links between income inequality and environ- mental impact, the channels through which economic devel- opment affects inequality and environmental pollution should be considered.
qy1i | The channels through which the economic growth affects CO2 emissions and income inequality
1k9e | A large number of authors have analysed the EKC and iden- tified that the relationship between air pollution (or other type environmental degradation) and economic level depends on three channels: (1) scale, (2) composition and (3) technique (Dinda 2004; Kaika and Zervas 2013; Farhani and Shahbaz, 2014; Liobikienė and Butkus 2018, 2019, etc.). Besides, the same channels pertain to the influence of economic develop- ment on income inequality level (Castells-Quintana et al. 2013; He and Feng 2019). However, the effects of these chan- nels are different.
5bjs | Factors that are assigned to the scale effect (as economic development level (GDP)) contribute to the increase of envi- ronmental impact. Neagu and Teodoru (2019) found that eco- nomic complexity (improved capabilities of a country in the production process) has a statistically significant impact on CO2 emissions. Meanwhile, Barro (2000) argued that income inequality decreases due to economic growth in early stage of development level. Labour market is also related to the eco- nomic growth. Economic development can lessen inequality by allowing workers, who earn the least, to move from the informal employment sector to the formal. He and Feng (2019) pointed out that employment could improve income distribution. Castells-Quintana et al. (2013) also noted that in the European Union, inequality is higher in regions with higher unemployment.
uodj | Considering the composition effect or the changes in economic structure with regard to the EKC, the reduction of environmental impact is observed when sectors which are not very polluting (i.e. services sector) increase faster than the most polluting ones (i.e. manufacturing, industry) (Parith et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2013). Transfer from ag- riculture to manufacturing at first increases and then
k16v | decreases income inequality. Moreover, Castells-Quintana et al. (2013) indicated that the inequality level is higher where the employment in agriculture or trade sectors is higher. A higher employment in the construction sector is also positively related to the higher-income inequality lev- el. He and Feng (2019) revealed that industrialization could improve income distribution, which is not very favourable for the environment. However, the impact that a shift to the service sector makes on income inequality has still not been analysed. In this paper, it is suggested that a faster growth of the service sector can also contrib- ute to the reduction of inequality level because the wage gap in this sector is not very big. Furthermore, the less qualified work can also be included in the service sector.
b2lm | The technique channel is related to the development of technologies and innovations in the countries (Turner and Hanley 2011; Böhriger and Rutherfod, 2013). With regard to the EKC, the development of technologies has led to the re- duction of environmental pollution (Dinda 2004; Turner and Hanley 2011; Kaika and Zervas 2013; Farhani and Shahbaz, 2014; Liobikienė and Butkus 2018, 2019, etc.). Meanwhile, regarding the income inequality, the development of the tech- nologies may benefit the relatively richer population and con- tribute to the increase of income inequality. If technological development benefits the qualified labour (or richer individ- uals) more than the unqualified labour, the skill premium will
ti7f | increase, which should raise the income inequality level (Castells-Quintana et al. 2013).
oksu | Globalization, via trade and foreign direct investments (FDI), can also be attributed to an additional channel through which economic development affects environmental impact and income inequality (Zhuang et al. 2014). When discussing CO2 emissions, the reviewed authors provide different results. Some authors found that FDI and trade contribute to economic growth and to the degradation of environment at the same time (Shahbaz et al. 2015; Kivyiro and Arminen 2015; Ertugrul et al., 2016; Azam and Khan 2016; Sarkodie and Strezov, 2019). Other authors showed that FDI and trade contribute to economic development due to technology development, productivity and efficiency gains, and promotion of new and more innovative processes and managerial skills (Shahbaz et al., 2015) resulting in the reduction of environmental impact in host countries (Sbia et al. 2014; Tang and Tan 2015; Zhang and Zhou 2016; Kang et al. 2016). As far as income inequality is concerned, the mechanisms of FDI and trade openness dif- fer, and the results of the estimations are different as well (Dreher and Gaston 2008; Celik and Basdas 2010; Ines 2011; He and Feng 2019).
