You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0yab | It is clear that the four approaches discussed above-world history, postcolonialism, multiple modernities, and global history-cannot be neatly separated, but overlap in many re- spects. They are, in other words, ideal types. For heuristic pur- poses, however, it is helpful to keep them apart analytically. Let us very briefly look at a few issues and see how these dif- ferent paradigms may lead to very different results (indeed: to different questions)-before then using the case of national- ism to illustrate in greater detail the analytical surplus that is characteristic of a global history approach vis-à-vis the three other paradigms.
w95z | A first example is the case of human rights, on which a substantial historiography has recently emerged. A standard world history perspective would hold that the rights of man have a European genealogy that reaches back to humanism, and even a bit earlier, before coalescing into a program with global reach during the French Revolution. These rights with their universal claims then traveled beyond their place of ori- gin and gradually gained acceptance around the world.19 A postcolonial reading would instead emphasize the parochial and culturally specific notion of human rights and the indis- criminate way in which it was used to marginalize, and indeed efface, alternative concepts of entitlement and equality that
0i1k | were less dependent on the concepts of nation and the indi- vidual. A third approach, that of multiple modernities, insists on indigenous cultural and political resources that allowed multiple notions of human rights to emerge in many different places, largely independent of each other. Building on these three approaches, recent forays into a global history of human rights focus instead on the emergence of human rights as a truly global discourse. Historians have thoroughly explored the global scope of human rights discourse by placing the em- phasis less on the French Revolution and more on the appro- priation and universalization of a language of rights in Haiti a few years later.20 In the twentieth century, the 1970s appear as a pivotal moment, when the decline of socialism and national- ism as political ideologies paved the way for the rise of human rights claims to the status of a hoped for "Last Utopia." The intellectual origins of human rights, in this reading, are of less importance than the synchronous global conditions of their overall acceptance, and of their fusion with local genealogies in very diverse locations.21
dqlg | A similar case can be made in the field of international law. For a long time, historians have seen the Law of Nations, as it emerged in the wake of Hugo Grotius, as well as the subse- quent development of international law, as a rationalization of international relations. Against this belief in the benevo- lent spread of a European accomplishment, critical scholars have pointed out the close connection between the Law of Nations and European imperialism, and have judged ostensi- bly universal claims to be no more than a thin veil concealing colonial ambitions.22 Third, in their quest to identify inde- pendent origins for international law in today's global order, scholars have begun to mine the cultural and legal history of
p6pq | various societies to show that parts of what is currently held to be common sense are contributions from alternative non- Western traditions. A global perspective would want to ad- dress more specifically why international law emerged when it did, why it was appropriated by different actors around the world, and in what ways it can be understood as a response to a global challenge. A preoccupation with the inventors and intellectual patent-holders, in other words, would lose its pri- macy, while the actual practice of international law moved to center stage.23
zse6 | We can extend the heuristic differentiation of these four ap- proaches to virtually all fields of historical inquiry. Was the concept of race a European invention, a tool of empire, a no- tion that grew from various indigenous roots-or a response to global challenges? Was the Enlightenment the accomplish- ment of European salon culture, a Western imposition, the product of many indigenous cultures of rationalization-or rather a way in which social elites around the world came to terms with new global realities?24 Or think of attempts to his- toricize the global history of fascism. World historians have tried to define the term by drawing up a laundry list of neces- sary features: a charismatic leader, mass mobilization, an ide- ology of ultra-nationalism, and so on. All of these features, however, were derived from the European experience. Other instances of fascism, in Japan or Argentina, for example, would seem to fall short of the requirements; in fact, even German National Socialism did not live up to the model set by Italian Fascism, and vice versa. By using global history as a correc- tive lens for this slightly myopic analysis, historians have paid more attention to transfers and direct contacts and have thus been able to reveal to what extent Italy and Germany served as models and inspiration in many places around the world.
p2n3 | Moving beyond comparison and transfer history, finally, a more systematic focus on global integration would begin with the shared global situation of the interwar years, and the quest, by many societies, for a "third way" between classical liberal- ism and communism, a quest that led many governments to experiment with new forms of social organization and mobi- lization. From such a perspective, the absence of this or that item on the laundry list-Was there a mass party challenging the establishment, or only mobilization "from above"? for example-is of less importance than understanding different cases as related, but differentiated ways of coping with struc- tural transformations and a changing international order.25
ohh7 | Case Study: Nations and Nationalism in global history
vbni | In this final section, let us look in greater depth at the his- toriography of nationalism, as it is here that we can observe most clearly how new global perspectives have been able to complement and modify earlier ways of situating the nation within world history. In some respects, the nation is an un- likely candidate for such an endeavor. Not too long ago, in the 1990s, when "globalization" became the "in" word, some pundits were quick to predict the end of the nation-state alto- gether. In the realm of scholarship, its future prospects were equally bleak. Transnational and global histories were written with the explicit purpose of moving beyond the nation-state. But this moment of crisis-or was it one of euphoria ?- soon abated, and gave way to the recognition that nation-states had staying power and would continue to be relevant, albeit in an altered setting. It has also become clear that global history is
dgcw | not about consigning the nation/nation-state to the dustbin of history, but rather about reassessing its historical role and better explaining its emergence and significance.
gvwz | How do these more recent approaches compare with ear- lier attempts to place the nation in the world? To a certain extent, it is no exaggeration to say that the theory of national- ism operated on a global scale from its very beginnings. Thus, the explanatory approaches inspired by early modernization theory-most notably by Ernest Gellner-were universal in scope. They posited the formation of nations as an effect of the ongoing transition from traditional to modern societies. While nationalist activists typically emphasized the distinc- tive character of a given nation, Gellner discarded all claims to uniqueness by postulating a universal law of development: industrial manufacturing destroyed the hierarchies of agri- cultural society in order to guarantee the mobility of labor and thus continuous growth. Nationalist self-legitimation may have stressed a shared history, a common language, and com- mon cultural patterns, but for Gellner, nationalism was "the establishment of an anonymous, impersonal society [. . . ], in place of a previous complex structure of local groups [. . . ]. That is what really happens."26
