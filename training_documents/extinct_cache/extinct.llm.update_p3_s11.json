Sylvan's thought experiment has successively been modified and discussed by many other philosophers such as Mary Ann Warren and Robin Attfield. The latter engaged in this type of argument to scrutinise the possibility of human extinction in the context of nuclear armament and 'ecocatastrophe'. He aimed to show that non-sentient living nature such as trees has morally relevant interests and that causing their extinction by the 'last man' would be morally wrong, even if it would not affect any other humans.",
