        "content": "w4hq | Riches secured on the competitive plane are never satisfactory and permanent. They are yours today and another's tomorrow. Remember, if you are to become rich in a scientific and certain way, you must rise entirely out of competitive thought. You must never think for a moment that the supply is limited. Just as soon as you begin to think that all the money is being \"cornered\" and controlled by others, and that you must exert yourself to get laws passed to stop this process, and so on - in that moment you drop into the competitive mind and your power to cause creation is gone for the time being.\nghbe | And what is worse, you will probably arrest the creative movements you have already begun.\n1lkf | KNOW that there are countless millions of dollars' worth of gold in the mountains of the earth, not yet brought to light. And know that if there were not, more would be created from thinking substance to supply your needs.\nuobn | KNOW that the money you need will come, even if it is necessary for a thousand men to be led to the discovery of new gold mines tomorrow.\n3194 | Never look at the visible supply. Look always at the limitless riches in formless substance, and KNOW that they are coming to you as fast as you can receive and use them. Nobody, by cornering the visible supply, can prevent you from getting what is yours.\nr22o | So never allow yourself to think for an instant that all the best building spots will be taken before you get ready to build your house, unless you hurry. Never worry about the trusts and combines, and get anxious for fear they will soon come to own the whole earth. Never get afraid that you will lose what you want because some other person \"beats you to it.\" That cannot possibly happen. You are not seeking anything that is possessed by anybody else; you are causing what you want to be created from formless substance, and the supply is without limits. Stick to the formulated statement:\nnupw | There is a thinking stuff from which all things are made, and which, in its original state, permeates, penetrates, and fills the interspaces of the universe.\n37xs | A thought, in this substance produces the thing that is imaged by the thought.\nhoi0 | A person can form things in his thought, and, by impressing his thought upon formless substance, can cause the thing he thinks about to be created.\ntffb | CHAPTER Six\newwt | How Riches Come To You\n2tj1 | WHEN I SAY THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DRIVE SHARP BARGAINS, I do not mean that you do not have to drive any bargains at all or that you are above the necessity for having any dealings with your fellow men. I mean that you will not need to deal with them unfairly. You do not have to get something for nothing, but can give to every person more than you take from him.\nnbhq | You cannot give everyone more in cash market value than you take from him, but you can give him more in use value than the cash value of the thing you take from him. The paper, ink, and other material in this book may not be worth the money you pay for it, but if the ideas suggested by it bring you thousands of dollars, you have not been wronged by those who sold it to you. They have given you a great use value for a small cash value.\nw251 | Let us suppose that I own a picture by one of the great artists, which, in a developed society, is worth thousands of dollars. I take it to Baffin Bay and by \"salesmanship\" induce a native dweller to give a bundle of furs worth five hundred dollars for it. I have really wronged him, for he has no use for the picture. It has no use value to him; it will not add to his life.\n1vgx | But suppose I give him a gun worth fifty dollars for his furs. Then he has made a good bargain. He has use for the gun. It will get him many more furs and much food; it will add to his life in every way. It will make him rich.\nyjnk | When you rise from the competitive to the creative plane, you can scan your business transactions very strictly, and if you are selling any person anything which does not add more to his life than the thing he give you in exchange, you can afford to stop it. You do not have to beat anybody in business. And if you are in a business which does beat people, get out of it at once.\n9zmh | Give everyone more in use value than you take from him in cash value. Then you are adding to the life of the world by every business transaction.\nmi3g | If you have people working for you, you must take from them more in cash value than you pay them in wages, but you can so organize your business that it will be filled with the principle of advancement, and so that each employee who wishes to do so may advance a little every day.\nntjg | You can make your business do for your employees what this book is doing for you. You can so conduct your business that it will be a sort of ladder by which every employee who will take the trouble may climb to riches himself. And given the opportunity, if he will not do so, it is not your fault.\n86at | And finally, just because you are to cause the creation of your riches from formless substance which permeates all your environment, it does not follow that they are to take shape from the atmosphere and come into being before your eyes.\nbpd2 | If you want a sewing machine, for instance, I do not mean to tell you that you are to impress the thought of a sewing machine on thinking substance until the machine is formed without hands, in the room where you sit or elsewhere. But if you want a sewing machine, hold the mental image of it with the most positive certainty that it is being made or is on its way to you. After once forming the thought,\nhkd8 | The Science of Getting Rich\nsptg | have the most absolute and unquestioning faith that the sewing machine is coming. Never think of it or speak of it in any other way than as being sure to arrive. Claim it as already yours.\n2k40 | It will be brought to you by the power of the supreme intelligence, acting upon the minds of men. If you live in Maine, it may be that a person will be brought from Texas or Japan to engage in some transaction which will result in your getting what you want.\nkrk7 | If so, the whole matter will be as much to that person's advantage as it is to yours.\n4tyc | Do not forget for a moment that the thinking substance is through all, in all, communicating with all, and can influence all. The desire of thinking substance for fuller life and better living has caused the creation of all the sewing machines already made, and it can cause the creation of millions more - and will, whenever people set it in motion by desire and faith and by acting in a certain way.\n2mjl | You can certainly have a sewing machine in your house, and it is just as certain that you can have any other thing or things which you want and which you will use for the advancement of your own life and the lives of others.\n6d9q | You need not hesitate about asking largely. \"It is your Father's pleasure to give you the kingdom,\" said Jesus.\nwsc1 | Original substance wants to live all that is possible in you, and wants you to have all that you can use and will use for the living of the most abundant life.\nor3l | If you fix upon your consciousness the fact that your desire for the possession of riches is one with the desire of the supreme power for more complete expression, your faith becomes invincible.\nfbyc | Once I saw a little boy sitting at a piano, vainly trying to bring harmony out of the keys. I saw that he was grieved and provoked by his inability to play real music. I asked him the cause of his vexation, and he answered, \"I can feel the music in me, but I can't make my hands go right.\" The music in him was the URGE of original substance, containing all the possibilities of all life. All that there is of music was seeking expression through the child.",
