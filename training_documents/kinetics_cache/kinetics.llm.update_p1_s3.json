A challenge is to understand how static promoter architecture and dynamic feedback regulations dictate bursting on a genome-wide scale. Although single-cell RNA sequencing provides an opportunity to address this challenge, effective analytical methods are scarce. We developed an interpretable and scalable inference framework, which combined experimental data with a mechanistic model to infer transcriptional burst kinetics (sizes and frequencies) and feedback regulations. Applying this framework to single-cell RNA sequencing data generated from embryonic mouse fibroblast cells, we found Simpson's paradoxes, i.e. genome-wide burst kinetics exhibit different characteristics in two cases without and with distinguishing feedback regulations. We also showed that feedbacks differently modulate burst frequencies and sizes and conceal the effects of transcription start site distributions on burst kinetics. Notably, only in the presence of positive feedback, TATA genes are expressed with high burst frequencies and enhancer-promoter interactions mainly modulate burst frequencies. The developed inference method provided a flexible and efficient way to investigate transcriptional burst kinetics and the obtained results would be helpful for understanding cell development and fate decision.\na63r | INTRODUCTION\ndqvj | The gene-expression variability resulting from programmed and stochastic processes has emerged as a central preoc-\nr17u | cupation for investigating gene regulation. Genes are stochastically transcribed often in a discontinuous bursting manner. Transcriptional bursting is regarded as a primary proxy of stochasticity in gene expression and contributes to cell-to-cell variability, but the molecular mechanisms governing transcriptional bursting kinetics still remain elusive. Many experimental studies have provided evidence for linking static promoter architecture and sequence to transcriptional bursting and, therefore, to the resulting variability in gene expression. This variability can propagate from mRNA to protein and further to the downstream target genes via a complex regulatory network. This raises important issues: On the genome-wide scale, how do static promoter regulatory sequences encode transcriptional burst kinetics, and how do dynamic gene regulatory networks shape burst kinetics?\n3c47 | An intuitive view is that there is an indispensable link of gene-expression variability to promoter architecture. This link is due to the fact that a basic step of RNA synthesis is to copy the genetic information from the gene promoter. Much effort has been devoted to rationalizing the promoter-architecture encoding of transcriptional burst kinetics on genome-wide scales. For example, genes with TATA boxes increase variability in expression levels, whereas the presence of C-P-G island significantly lowers the variability. The sharp distributions of transcription start sites lead to higher gene-expression variability than the broad transcription start sites distributions. A recent study has revealed that the increases in burst sizes are dependent on the presence of TATA box and initiator elements (characteristics of the core promoter), and burst frequencies are regulated by enhancer-promoter interactions. All these studies and others indicate the importance of promoter architecture in modulating transcriptional burst kinetics.\ng345 | Another viewpoint is that feedback regulations modulate transcriptional burst kinetics by creating a higher-level\nsvhz | structure regulatory pattern. In fact, feedback regulations exist extensively in biological systems, and their functions may be reflected by the circuits of interacting genes and proteins. In particular, auto-regulatory feedback loops have been identified in various regulatory systems, where transcription factors directly or indirectly regulate the corresponding gene expression. In general, feedbacks can be categorized into positive and negative ones. Experimental investigations for a few genes or transcripts have demonstrated that different kinds of feedback played diverse roles. For example, negative feedback limits large expression variability and accelerates responses. Conversely, positive feedback amplifies expression variation, induces bimodal expression, and stimulates genes to 'active' states. In addition, negative feedback with a long delay loop can display increased variability. Theoretical analysis has also shown that different feedback mechanisms modulate burst kinetics in different manners. All these studies indicate the important roles of feedback regulations in mediating gene expression, including transcriptional bursts, but it is unclear whether the results obtained for case-by-case studies can hold on a genome-wide scale.\noaen | The above two viewpoints are not solitary but are complementary to each other. A challenging task is to investigate how static promoter architecture and dynamic feedback regulation coordinate transcriptional burst kinetics on a genome-wide scale. Previous studies of transcriptional bursting were limited to low-throughput experimental approaches, where observed experimental results could not be generalized across different genes or cell types. Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled the in-depth measurement of expression levels within cell populations, providing an opportunity to study genome-wide transcriptional mechanisms. An important step toward this study is to develop mathematical models for the genome-wide inference of burst kinetics. The models for inference should satisfy some requirements. First, these models should be interpretable, i.e. they can capture essential gene-expression dynamics and convey kinetic information about transcriptional bursts. Previous studies relied on inferring the direct correlations between features across molecular scales. However, these correlations are insufficient to uncover the mechanisms of gene expression. Second, the inference models should be tractable, i.e. they can effectively treat a large number of cells and genes. In general, a complex mechanistic model incorporating regulatory factors is difficult to analyze on the one hand, and a genome-wide inference needs expensive computational cost on the other hand. Therefore, an interpretable and tractable inference framework integrating experimental data and molecular mechanisms is strongly demanded.\n5u67 | Here we developed a statistical framework based on the model-driven and data-driven combination to perform a scalable genome-wide inference. This framework used the static snapshots of single-cell RNA sequencing data to infer the regulatory mechanisms underlying transcriptional burst kinetics. Specifically, it integrated the expected information on gene-expression variability, burst frequencies, burst sizes, and feedback regulation forms. Applying this inference method to the single-cell RNA sequencing data generated from embryonic mouse\ndvms | fibroblast cells, we showed that feedbacks differently modulate burst frequencies and sizes, TATA genes are expressed with high burst frequencies only in the presence of positive feedback, feedback regulations conceal the effects of transcription start site distribution on transcriptional burst kinetics, and enhancer-promoter interactions mainly modulate burst frequencies only in the presence of positive feedbacks. Briefly, we found that characteristics of genome-wide transcriptional burst kinetics in the case without feedback regulations were different from those in the case with feedback regulations, implying Simpson's Paradox, an interesting statistical phenomenon.\nqrd3 | MATERIALS AND METHODS\nrxrg | A mechanistic hierarchic model for statistical inference\ntf43 | The observed counts in a single-cell RNA sequencing experiment reflect a combination of the true expression level and the measurement level of each gene in each cell.
