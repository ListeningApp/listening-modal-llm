You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

(2017) suggests that water may ascend towards the production well under these conditions, making seasonal storage of hydrogen in porous storage systems challenging.
sk5m | While the hydrogen density and thus the compressibility in the depth range of UHS systems mainly increases with increasing pressure (Figure 1A), the dynamic viscosity increases significantly with increasing temperature (Figure 1B). In the range of standard conditions up to pressures of 50 MPa and temperatures of 50℃, the viscosity shows a comparable temperature and pressure dependence. For example, hydrogen viscosity increases by about 15% from standard temperature and pressure conditions to an elevated temperature of 50℃ (at standard pressure; Leachman et al., 2009). At standard temperature, viscosity increases by about 18% in the pressure range from 0.1 to 50 MPa (Leachman et al., 2009). In direct comparison, the viscosities of CH4 and CO2 are larger than those of H2, and both show a dominant pressure dependence that far exceeds the behavior of H2 viscosity (Figures 2B, D). Hence, hydrogen has a much higher mobility than CH4 and CO2. The viscosities of H2 and CH4 are still most similar here in comparison and are in the same order of magnitude. As elaborated by Muhammed et al. (2023), underground hydrogen storages could thus be used as a direct substitute for CH4 storage. Due to their viscosities, according to Edlmann et al. (2016) and Heinemann et al. (2018), H2 and CH4 can be stored in a wide range
qws8 | of underground reservoirs because they are not limited by reservoir conditions or depth. Rather, reservoirs are determined based on the geologic characteristics of the reservoirs, as appropriate containment features are required to seal against these mobile gases (Muhammed et al., 2023). But, Paterson (1983) and numerous subsequent studies have shown that the low density, viscosity, and molecular size of H2 result in more viscous fingering and poorer conformation during injection, faster migration toward structurally high sites, and some amount of unrecoverable hydrogen (e.g., Hagemann et al., 2014; Feldmann et al., 2016). For this reason, Epelle et al. (2022), for example, recommend adjusting the flow rate of hydrogen and the size of the wellbore (Sørensen, 2007; Zivar et al., 2021) compared to operation with natural gas to minimize diffusion in porous media.
877u | As previously described by us and other studies (e.g., Iglauer, 2022), the optimal depth, d, for UHS systems is in the range of 800-1,100 m depth. Assuming a mean surface temperature of 8.2℃ and an average geothermal gradient of 32℃/km (Agemar et al., 2012), a temperature range of 33.8-43.4℃ results for the target depth. For an average density, Plith, of the overlying rock of 2,300-2,600 kg/m3 and a lithostatic factor, Flith, of 0.5-0.7 (Foh et al., 1979), the pressure at which hydrogen could be stored in UHS systems can be determined using the following simple relationship:
rzhj | PH2 = Flith Xd x 9.81 m.s2 x Plith = 9.03 . . . 19.64 MPa. (2)
bfax | This temperature and pressure range corresponds to the optimal conditions for the geological storage of hydrogen in porous storage systems (black rectangles within Figures 1, 2). The so-called lithostatic factor was introduced here to represent the ratio of working pressure to lithostatic pressure in the reservoir. For this typical geological conditions for porous media storage, hydrogen has a low density and viscosity in the narrow ranges of 6.6-13.5 kg/m3 and 9.2-9.6 µPa-s, respectively (Figures 1A, B). The influence of temperature and pressure variations on the density and viscosity of highly compressible hydrogen is thus almost negligible at this reservoir depth. In contrast, the thermophysical properties of CO2 and CH4 behave in a much more pressure- and temperature-dependent manner, which is reflected in the relative density and viscosity ratios (Figure 2). Within the proposed reservoir range, the density and viscosity ratios of H2 and CH4 do not vary too much (max. +25%; Figures 2A, B), whereas the corresponding ratios of H2 to CO2 can vary by up to a factor of about 2-3 (Figures 2C, D). This has to be considered when re-using former natural gas reservoirs with H2.
f2y8 | 4 Capacity estimates for UHS in Germany
o7qm | 4.1 Technical hydrogen storage capacity in former and current UGS systems
d52l | Underground gas storage facilities can be adapted for hydrogen storage and some of the currently operating underground storage facilities have already stored town gas with a hydrogen content of about 50-60% in the past. Thus, in a first step, we focus on the installed capacity of underground pore storages in Germany. The hydrogen storage capacity is calculated based on the recoverable volume of natural gas as reported by the State Authority for Mining,
qlbb | Energy and Geology in Germany (Landesamt für Bergbau, Energie und Geologie, LBEG). These data are based on empirical values, which are derived from technical and economic considerations for natural gas and, thus, provide sound estimates of the dynamic recovery of hydrogen. The amount of energy stored as hydrogen in the working gas, which describes the portion of gas that is cycled in and out of the reservoir, EH, is calculated according to the modified equation after Mouli-Castillo et al. (2021), that writes
nhsg | EH2 = HHV H2 X WV CH4 X PCH4,STP x PHaires, PH2,STP (3)
