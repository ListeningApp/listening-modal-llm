        "content": "p57i | Two. Function: Secretions including galactose and sialic acid have a lubrication function and precede emission of semen along the penile urethra.\nu5ug | c) Penis\ni9k5 | i) Tissue Organization:\n20z2 | One. Three cylindrical masses of erectile tissue\n4cgs | Two. Corpora cavernosa: Irregular and communicating blood spaces or sinusoids supplied by an artery and drained by venous channels.\nhtre | Three. Ventral corpus spongiosum\nda3c | Four. Penile urethra: Transverses the penis\n890q | Five. Glans penis: The tip of the corpus spongiosum\njomo | ii) Erection: Arterial blood fills the sinusoids. They enlarge and compress the venous channels to engorge the penis. The process of erection is controlled by nitric oxide and the cyclic guanosine monophosphate signaling pathway.\n06fi | SEMINAL PLASMA AND SEMEN\nhb4s | Twenty-two. Seminal Plasma\ncqq2 | a) During ejaculation, the sperm become mixed with the combined secretions of the accessory sex glands. The mixture of these secretory fluids constitutes the seminal plasma, which serves as a vehicle for the ejaculated spermatozoa. The combination of seminal plasma and sperm is termed the semen. The chemistry and volume of the seminal plasma varies greatly among animal species. In the cat, the ejaculate can be less than one milliliter; in the boar, the volume reaches five hundred milliliters; in the human, the ejaculate averages three to four milliliters.\n1ews | b) All of the accessory sex glands do not secrete their constituents simultaneously. The glands of Cowper and Littr√© emit first, followed by the prostate, the ampulla, epididymis (containing the spermatozoa), and finally the seminal vesicles. It is important to note that the sperm are contained in the first portions of the ejaculate. Therefore, loss of this first portion during collection could result in artificially reduced sperm counts.\nafyn | Twenty-three. Coagulation and Liquefaction of the Semen: Human semen is ejaculated as a thick, viscous fluid that coagulates immediately after ejaculation. The coagulum usually liquefies, i.e., becomes very fluid-like and watery, within five to twenty minutes. The formation of the clot is catalyzed by the action of a clotting enzyme upon a coagulating substrate produced and secreted by the seminal vesicles. Lysis of the clot is caused by proteolytic enzymes secreted by the prostate. An ejaculate that fails to clot may be indicative of seminal vesicle malfunction (or absence of the vas deferens), while a coagulated ejaculate that does not completely liquefy may suggest prostatic dysfunction.\n8sye | Twenty-four. Ejaculation: Ejaculation is a complex two-part spinal reflex that involves emission, the movement of semen into the urethra, and ejaculation proper, the propulsion of semen out of the urethra at the time of orgasm. Just prior to ejaculation, the testes are brought up close to the abdomen, and fluid is rapidly transported through the vas deferens toward the region of the ejaculatory ducts and subsequently into the prostatic urethra. After ejaculation, intravasal fluid is transported back toward the epididymis and occasionally into the seminal vesicles as well. The retrograde transport of sperm to the seminal vesicles has been documented by video radiography during ejaculation after vasography. The return of sperm to the seminal vesicles after ejaculation may help explain the prolonged presence of sperm in the ejaculate for some men after vasectomy.\nr04h | a) Emission: Transport of semen to the bulbous urethra is termed emission. It is controlled primarily via the sympathetic nervous system acting through adrenergic receptors. Stimulation of the presacral nerves results in bladder neck closure and seminal emission. Failure of the bladder neck to close may result in retrograde ejaculation in which case the sperm are expelled into the bladder.\norpr | b) Ejaculation: Expulsion of semen from the urethral meatus is ejaculation. Propulsion and expulsion is caused by rhythmic contractions of the bulbocavernosus and ischiocavernosus muscles. The ejaculatory contractions involve the entire length of the penile urethra. Ejaculation proper is a parasympathetic response.\nk36m | Twenty-five. MALE INFERTILITY\nwnuz | a) Varicocele: Varicocele is a condition resulting from a varicosity of the pampiniform plexus, possibly interfering with the temperature regulation of the testis. Varicocele is usually, but not always, found on the left side. Varicocele can be palpated in about forty percent of men with oligozoospermia. However, varicocele can also be detected in about twenty to twenty-five percent of normal men, thus raising questions regarding the true association of varicocele with infertility. Varicoceles can be surgically treated, and this will be beneficial for a subset of infertile couples resulting in a thirty to thirty-five percent pregnancy rate. Varicoceles can be present in children and, in the setting of associated testicular atrophy, will be surgically repaired.\nsy14 | b) Kartagener Syndrome: Patients presenting with Kartagener syndrome will have severe asthenozoospermia. These patients are characterized by an absence of dynein arms of the axoneme, thus rendering the sperm incapable of movement. Kartagener syndrome patients will also have a history of other cilia abnormalities (due to the absence of dynein arms) including multiple sinus and pulmonary infections, history of chronic sinusitis and bronchiectasis, etc. These patients should have an eosin vital stain performed during the semen analysis to confirm asthenozoospermia and not necrozoospermia.\nghss | c) Cryptorchidism: Cryptorchidism is a condition characterized by failure of the testes to descend properly into the scrotum during fetal development. This condition may be unilateral or bilateral (i.e., one or both testes). Cryptorchidism occurs in as many as six percent of full-term births. If the testes have not descended by six months of age, medical intervention is required, either surgically or hormonally, to induce descent. Cryptorchidism will result in abnormal elevation of testicular temperature that can have profound effects on spermatogenesis. Furthermore, prolonged increased testicular temperature may lead to tumorigenesis, which further necessitates medical treatment.\n3s61 | d) Retrograde Ejaculation: Retrograde ejaculation results from incomplete bladder neck closure (often from a dysfunctional internal sphincter) during ejaculation. This often causes the semen to be ejaculated into the bladder instead of out of the penis. Patients who have a history of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection will often have retrograde ejaculation. This condition is asymptomatic, although patients may complain of a dry ejaculation due to severe hypospermia. Semen analysis in these patients will often display severe hypospermia. A postejaculation urine analysis will show marked increase in the presence of sperm. These patients can be treated by collecting a postejaculation urine sample into buffer, isolating, and washing the sperm by centrifugation, with subsequent artificial insemination of the prepared sperm.\ns3rm | e) Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism: also called Kallmann syndrome. Patients will have decreased serum testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone. Patients may also complain of anosmia (decreased sense of smell). Patients will display marked oligozoospermia or azoospermia. These patients can be treated with human chorionic gonadotropin to stimulate androgen production and gonadotropins to provide follicle-stimulating hormone for spermatogenesis. Although",
