        "content": "bbpr | The presence of all component causes of a causal pie constitutes a sufficient cause, which implies that the outcome occurs. Each of the component causes is then subject to the full force of natural selection on the outcome, for without any one of them, the outcome would not occur. The force of selection on the outcome is not partitioned over the component causes. Just like the sum of causes exceeds one hundred, the force of selection on causes exceeds the force of selection on outcomes. Some component causes will not be determined intrinsically, such as the environment. These component causes will not be subject to natural selection. Still, it will usually be possible to define an intrinsic component cause that is subject to natural selection, such as avoidance of some environmental factor(s).\n5zyf | In the absence of any one of its complementary component causes, the emergence of a component cause has no effect and therefore is not subject to natural selection. However, component causes are part of the complementary sets of all the other component causes in a causal pie. A component cause that does not give rise to an outcome immediately does change the set of component causes\n9own | against which yet other component causes arise. It thus affects the chance that another component cause will arise in the context of its complementary set and hence make the outcome occur. In the long term, this gets picked up by evolution. Below, we give a wide-ranging sample of applications of these principles.\nbqfb | Example one: Agents of selection\nwwdt | Wade and Kalisz recognize that \"the fitness of an individual is the result of the interaction of the phenotype with the environment and not an intrinsic feature of either one\", the phenotype being caused by some gene of interest. In this context, they discuss that the selection of a gene that gives a fitness advantage in a particular environment depends on whether that environment is indeed present. They call the environment the \"causal agent of selection\" of the gene, as the environment causes the gene to be selected.\nmn1r | Wade and Kalisz's realization is a special case of the general principle that selection on a component cause depends on the presence or absence of its complementary set. The effect of the component cause \"gene\" depends on its complementary component cause \"environment\". The complementary set can certainly be environmental, but can be essentially anything that completes a causal pie. If the interaction of many different genes is necessary to bring about some effect, as in the next example, genes act as each other's complementary component causes.\n5vqw | Example two: Semi-neutral mutations\nmeyw | Genetic mutations can be semi-neutral: While they do not have an immediate phenotypic effect, they pave the way for non-neutral change over evolutionary time. This happens when a number of mutations have to be acquired before causing phenotypic change. The order of occurrence and the way in which the mutations are generated may be completely random. Only the last mutation seems non-neutral and causes a change in the phenotype, but it is facilitated by the earlier, semi-neutral, mutations. The earlier changes are semi-neutral, because they seem neutral at first sight, but eventually get picked up by evolution.\n2e62 | In terms of the causal pie model, new mutations arise in the context of the existing mutations, which determine whether the complementary set is present. The first few mutations are insufficient to have a phenotypic effect, but they do change the context against which new mutations arise. At one point, the new mutation arises in the presence of the other mutations necessary for phenotypic change, that is, its complementary set of a sufficient cause for phenotypic change. All of the mutations are equally\n75y3 | causal to the outcome. Yet, all mutations before the one that leads to phenotypic change seem neutral, because their complementary set for phenotypic change is lacking.\ns2g2 | Example three: selection for versus selection of\nq1q2 | Selection of refers to an empirical observation of what is selected, while selection for means that there is selection due to a causal effect of some trait on vital rates. These sorts of selection differ if traits are correlated, which is a well-established area of research. As an example, consider a population of mice in which small mice have a selective advantage, for instance because they are not seen by predators. Suppose also that the same gene that controls body size causes large mice to have blue eyes, while it causes small mice to have green eyes. Finally, suppose that having blue eyes versus green eyes by itself does not affect mortality and fecundity. In this example, there is selection for small body size, because this has a direct effect on the risk of predation. There is selection of not only small body size, but also of green eye color. Although the latter has no effect on fitness, selection results from the correlation of eye color with body size.\ncb7r | In the causal pie model, traits are correlated when they share one or more component causes. For instance, A is a component cause for both sufficient causes one and two, leading to correlation. If one sufficient cause is subject to natural selection, the force of selection extends to all component causes. Some of these component causes can be component causes also of sufficient causes for neutral traits, leading to selection of. Selection on sufficient causes one and two leads to selection on component causes A E. Sufficient cause three is not selected forâ€”it is in itself a neutral trait. Still, there is selection of sufficient cause three, because there exists selection on all its component causes B C E.\n68xu | Example four: Trade-offs",
