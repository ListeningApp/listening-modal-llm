        "content": "ba14 | Virtually none of these people has any true concept of how a real community comes into being, how it develops, how its local manifestations are working, what its future might be-how they could benefit from what is being done.\n72rs | If you circularise people with details of how a local class or group is run, they all want to be in a local class or group. It is just like mentioning a lollipop to a child: it may have been thinking about something else, but this key-word can possess its thinking mechanism to the exclusion of everything else.\nkb97 | For a moment, as an exercise, transpose this situation into some other field, and you will see that such behaviour is so primi-\n1jn0 | tive, so crude, so unfortunately wasteful of energy, or understanding, of everything, that it is obvious that something has to be done for such people. Anyone prone to such behaviour-patterns is in no position to benefit from any higher knowledge at that point. He is, however, a suitable prey for one or other of the people or bodies which offer instant assuagement of tensions by going along with the individual's infantile behaviour.\n8q4r | The real higher community to which you could belong is organised and has its being and communication in its own manner. It needs, and operates by means of, both local and other groupings. Its members study, attract, retain and give out currents of knowledge irrespective of the form in which their studies are couched. For some people at some times it is important that they be 'isolated' from others. Such 'isolation' which is regarded as a curse by people who live in remote places is generally an inestimable advantage which has been allotted to them, not anything else. As and when a time for closer contact in the conventional sense arrives, so do the means for its attainment. But if the individual simply wants to be a member of a herd: Sufis are prevented from pandering to this desire.\ny60y | In respect to higher teaching, the individual has to learn the difference between 'wants' and 'needs'. He can learn this only after basic teaching. When a child says that it needs something, it often means, until it understands the difference, that it 'wants' that thing. 'I need a lollipop' does not describe the situation at all. Only experience can show the difference between wants and needs.\n14cu | There is an inbuilt demand for 'togetherness' in human beings. Whoever learns this and panders to it may quite easily become rich, famous, respected and so forth.\nsxgl | To play upon this tendency is not only wrong in ordinary principle, it is unproductive in our work, because it would mean that we were doing one thing while pretending to do another.\nv1id | Remember, that because this work and this community operate in a manner essentially unique, they have no need for organising in a primitive manner or catering for neurotic or infantile demands disguised as 'needs'.\nospk | Furthermore, as soon as we have made this plain, and as soon as\nayzb | individuals and groups have realised that they need not indulge in their social masquerades, the community and the work invariably make it possible for the activity, the contact, the study and the learning necessary to take place.\nyid2 | In short, this community is neither a troop of baboons nor a military force, dependent upon desire and fear, upon reward and punishment, for the continuance of its action.\n0tro | This community operates in accordance with a sensitive pattern. This pattern is its protection and its strength. If you try to organise yourself or others in a lesser pattern, you are out of touch with this work. You have, in short, disengaged yourself from higher development, and chosen to stabilise your life upon simply living out your life by diversions, just like someone putting of time in a waiting room.\nfkdd | Work in the manner and with the materials indicated by the teaching. Plan, by all means, if you really know the plan.\negd7 | The Sufi authority Abu-Nasr al-Sarraj illustrates the need for plan and priorities in study in his Kitab al-Luma. He quotes the words of one of the most eminent Sufis, Bayazid, who taught Abu Ali of Sind the formal rituals of Islam, while Abu Ali taught him, in his turn, the experiential doctrine of Sufism.\num9s | And one of Bayazid's disciples reported that he heard not a word from his master for thirteen years, the time he spent with him ...\nit25 | The misunderstanding of the need or otherwise of constant association with a master as a kind of magic key is due - at least in part-to the deterioration in behaviour of those very numerous groupings which were originally Sufis, but which have over the centuries become mere cults.\n3mfz | Many ancient Sufis insisted on solitude and anonymity, refusing to associate with people.\n0vyw | Muinuddin Chishti, who introduced Chishtism into India and is buried at Ajmer, was a notable example. While some of his precedents have been adopted by later followers, who imagine that they follow his teaching, his proclivity for solitude has been ignored.\nrf9l | 'He would not allow, generally,' says Dr. Sharib 'more than one Dervish to accompany him on his travels. He would stay in\nhycc | desolate and deserted places. Sometimes he would stay in a graveyard. The moment he came to be known he would stay there no longer. He hated publicity.'\nl8ni | The great peril in study-groupings is, of course, that they become miniature tribes or families, cults and frames for finding social satisfactions, not learning, let alone understanding.\nipcw | This pattern asserts itself, and often quite obviously, in most imaginedly religious communities and activities. For this reason Sheikh Abdullah Ansari has called prayer 'only abstaining from food', formal prayer 'the work of old men and women', pilgrimage 'a pleasure of the world'.\nadu9 | People can learn from groups and meetings only to the extent to which they have overcome the four traps which Ansari stresses:\npq8y | Internal Dimensions\n8fpu | THERE are internal dimensions of meaning in all the materials used in our work. In these materials I include those written, spoken, seen and handled, as well as the ones which are performed and experienced.\nkd2r | The unlocking of the inner dimensions, as in all valid traditions, is something which has to take place as and when it can be effective. It is not a matter of detective-work, puzzle-solving or disguised recreation. On the contrary, these elements must be kept in their places, which are very minor ones.\nwda6 | The inner dimensions are present in order to convey a certain experience at the moment of their revelation. This experience supplies an element which the student needs in order to carry him further in his development.\n862o | Unlocking inner dimensions just for the sake of so doing is not only superficial: it robs the operation of its development value.\nzyiv | Take a rough example as an illustration.\noy6e | I say: 'This is our work.' This word comes to be associated with certain significances in the mind. 'Work' means action. But if, subsequently, I reveal to you that 'Work' in fact also stands for, say, 'World Organisation for Research into Knowledge' and is composed of the initials of that phrase, you see another range of possibilities in this. But merely to do this is banal when no constructive purposes are present.\nvtgu | This is why the 'revealing of secrets' is a stage after familiarisation with the materials and concepts. The 'revealing' must-and does-take place on a level and under circumstances appropriate to the goal: the development of human kind.\nc1go | Impatience with this process will simply turn you into a trivial person, playing with words, objects and concepts. If you play with something complex, treating it as if it were simple, it will not operate to its real capacity. An electronic device, for instance, which may be extremely delicate, efficient and costly, may simply look like an object used in a children's game. If you use it for",
