        "content": "s9fn | The IRM describes skills that are essential to meeting the basic interpersonal demands of practice, such as listening effectively, communicating clearly, overcoming basic conflicts and events, and being reliable and predictable in interactions. The model describes additional skills that are required to achieve a level of communication with a client that responds to his or her interpersonal needs. This continuum of skills is described in detail and accompanied by clinical examples in Chapters eight through sixteen.\nk5r6 | Principle six: Provided That They Are Purely and Flexibly Applied, a Wide Range of Therapeutic Modes Can Work and Be Utilized Interchangeably in Occupational Therapy\nz9v9 | Individuals who enter the profession of occupational therapy have a side to their personalities that is oriented toward others and desires to support, uplift, empathize with, motivate, advocate for, guide, or otherwise empower people. At the same time, each therapist has a unique combination of interpersonal characteristics that largely derive from his or her temperament, usual interpersonal style with others, and from life experience. These characteris-\ngpu9 | tics influence the therapist to have a natural therapeutic\nu5ws | mode or modes (i.e., particular ways of relating to a client in a given situation). As already mentioned, the six interpersonal therapeutic modes are the advocating mode, collaborating mode, empathizing mode, encouraging mode, instructing mode, and problem-solving mode. The therapeutic mode or set of modes that characterize a therapist's general approach to interacting with clients is referred to as the therapist's interpersonal style.\nonkh | An underlying principle of the IRM is that no particular mode or interpersonal style is superior to another. Two therapists with diametrically opposite personalities, who use different combinations of modes, can be equally effective. However, certain interpersonal styles tend to work better with different populations and circumstances. Thus, therapists who are critically self-aware choose areas of practice most suited for their interpersonal style.\n8t55 | More importantly, effective use of self depends on the flexible and appropriate use of modes depending on the client and the situation. A therapist who relies heavily on only one therapeutic mode is effective with a narrower range of circumstances and clients than a therapist who can employ a variety of modes in response to changing interpersonal circumstances. Thus, the IRM recommends that therapists make an ongoing effort to expand their capacity to use different modes as demanded by individual differences between clients and the unique features of specific interpersonal events that may occur during therapy.\n7imw | When a therapist decides to invoke a particular mode, it is important that the mode is communicated to the client accurately in its pure form. To achieve the pure, accurate use of a mode, it is recommended that the therapist remain within that mode for as long as it takes to communicate and ensure that the client has received the intended interpersonal message (e.g., that the intention for the moment is solely to empathize, solely to instruct, solely to problem-solve, or what have you). If a therapist attempts to blend modes so two interpersonal messages are being communicated simultaneously, it is likely to weaken the intended communication of both modes and to result in the client becoming confused. For example, if a therapist's true intention is to address a client's behavior by using the instructing mode but, instead, begins to question the client about the reasons behind the behavior in a way that conveys disapproval, the therapist is blending the problem-solving mode into the instructing mode.\nlf1t | The result is that the client receives a confused message about the desirability of the behavior (e.g., does the therapist want me to stop the behavior, or might it be okay if I explain to her why I am doing this?). Similarly, if a therapist shifts modes too rapidly it may also lead to confusion or weakening of the communication, depending on the cognitive level and emotional maturity of the particular client. Although the IRM acknowledges the need for therapists occasionally to share mixed feelings with a client and send complex messages to clients that involve many mode shifts, this approach to communication must be done with great circumspection. These and other issues pertinent to shifting modes are discussed in more detail in Chapter seven.\ntze7 | Principle seven: The Client Defines a Successful Relationship\nryvv | Clients differ widely in terms of what they are seeking from their relationships with health-care professionals. For instance, some clients prefer a relationship that is professional, hierarchical, and relatively distant in which the therapist provides specific instructions, technologies, or resources to assist in the accomplishment of occupational goals and objectives. Other clients desire a relationship that involves a more personalized connection and results in feelings of emotional support as well as tangible occupational outcomes. Still others wish for a collaborative relationship in which mutual planning and problem-solving take place.\nzdrh | What is considered a successful relationship in occupational therapy must be defined by the client rather than the therapist. A successful client-therapist relationship must be based on the achievement of the type of therapeutic relationship the client needs most and is capable of during the time he or she is in therapy. This means that a successful therapeutic relationship is not defined by a feeling of closeness, or connection, unless the client clearly wants it as a feature of the relationship. Although in many circumstances these variables are associated with the client's perception of a successful relationship, for some clients a successful relationship may mean one that involves a certain level of professional distance or some other kind of interaction that is consistent with the client's prior experiences with health-care professionals and cultural expectations.\nosmo | A corollary to this principle is that clients may change through time in their desires for the therapeutic relationship. The following are some examples. A client who at first desires a more hierarchical and therapist-structured relationship following a traumatic event resulting in impairment may wish for a more collaborative relationship later during the course of therapy. A long-term client seen first as a child may wish to achieve more distance as he or she comes into adolescence. A client who previously insisted on a highly collaborative relationship may, following an exacerbation of an impairment or symptom or during a crisis, need an empathic and supportive relationship. Such changes in a client's desires for the therapeutic relationship may reflect such factors as responses to stress, personal growth, or natural development. They must be respected and accommodated by the therapist.\n0b8v | Principle eight: Activity Focusing Must Be Balanced With Interpersonal Focusing",
