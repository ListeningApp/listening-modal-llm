Using Puzzle fifty-seven, conclude that LaTeX formula: the expected value of E with respect to beta approaches E sub one exponentially fast as LaTeX formula: beta approaches positive infinity. Finally, since\n1sn7 | LaTeX formula: S equals k beta times the quantity F minus the expected value of E and both LaTeX formula: F and LaTeX formula: the expected value of E approach LaTeX formula: E sub one exponentially fast as LaTeX formula: beta approaches positive infinity, conclude that LaTeX formula: S approaches zero exponentially fast as\nbcxr | LaTeX formula: beta approaches positive infinity. Let's summarize! Suppose we have a system with a countable infinity of states and just one state of lowest energy. If thermal equilibrium is possible for this system for some LaTeX formula: T greater than zero, the Third Law of Thermodynamics says its entropy in thermal equilibrium goes to zero as LaTeX formula: T approaches zero from above. But in fact we can say more: for some LaTeX formula: a, LaTeX formula: b greater than zero we have\n0dtd | LaTeX formula: the absolute value of S with respect to beta is less than a times the exponential of negative b beta for all large enough\nrnxf | LaTeX formula: beta.
