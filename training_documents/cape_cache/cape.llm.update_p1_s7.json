Some members of Convocation whose names were mentioned or cited in the petition including Prof. Samuel Kyei and Prof. Emmanuel Kwesi Abu were not given a hearing.\n9zf9 | Six point zero OPINION OF THE AD-HOC COMMITTEE\nclwo | The opinion of the Ad-hoc Committee on the constitution of the Special Committee, the report submitted by the Special Committee and the petition sent to Management of the University based on the findings are as follows:\naki1 | i. The constitution of the Special Committee is unconventional because it should have been done by Convocation. Conventionally, members who serve on Committees of Convocation are nominated and seconded by Members of Convocation.\nvf5h | ii. The appointment of the Chairman of Convocation to chair the Special Committee constituted by the Board of Convocation is problematic since the Special Committee was expected to submit its report to him.\nl51p | iii. The composition of the Special Committee is unconventional because all the members of the Special Committee are members of the Board of Convocation.\ns9zz | iv. The report submitted to the Board of Convocation by the Special Committee without explicit terms of reference is unacceptable.\nx97k | v. The report submitted by the Special Committee, which was not signed by the members, is an anomaly because it raises questions about the authenticity of the report.\nqwix | vi. A procedural error was committed because the report submitted by the Special Committee to the Board of Convocation should have been brought to the attention of Convocation as per Statute thirty-nine point eleven (b).\n```",
