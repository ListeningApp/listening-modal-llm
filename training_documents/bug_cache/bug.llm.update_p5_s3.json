Similarly, Van Dyne et al. included global self-esteem as an important antecedent of voice in their proposed model. This is consistent with Near and Miceli and Miceli and Near, who suggested, in their work on whistle-blowing, that low self-esteem individuals may withdraw from involvement in controversial situations and also that high self-esteem individuals might be more likely to get involved in attempts to reform the situation. Although whistle-blowing is different from voice in that it focuses on alerting others to wrongdoing, it is similar to voice in that it requires initiative and nonconformance. On the basis of this reasoning, we expect that group members with high self-esteem will be more proactive in engaging their environments and will be less influenced by conformity pressures than individuals with low self-esteem. Thus,\nd8zj | Hypothesis Two. Global self-esteem will be positively related to voice such that individuals with high levels of global self-esteem will engage in more voice than individuals with low levels of global self-esteem.\nywxn | Situational Antecedents\nuxhs | Although the discussion so far has focused on person-centered antecedents of voice, it is likely that situational factors also influence voice. Situations provide direct stimuli as well as the context for interpreting other stimuli and therefore have the potential to influence behavioral responses directly and indirectly. Although a large number of situational variables could be considered in a comprehensive model of voice, the literature on small groups suggests two factors that should be particularly important for predicting voice. These situational factors are group size and the extent to which groups are self- versus traditionally managed.\ned6e | Group Size\n6qqm | Past research demonstrates strong relationships between group size and member involvement and conformity behavior. Diffusion of responsibility tends to be positively related to the number of members in a group. In larger groups, it is difficult to identify individual members' relative contributions and therefore individuals feel less responsible for group-level outcomes. Individual members, in essence, feel more anonymous. The result is that members of large groups become less involved in group matters relative to members of smaller groups. In addition, conformity pressure in-\nonum | creases with group size, making it less likely that individual members will speak up and express challenging or change-oriented ideas. Because voice is proactive, discretionary, and challenging, it should be especially susceptible to the diffusion of responsibility and conformity pressures of large groups. Members of large groups should feel less involved and be less willing to engage in challenging behavior (e.g., voice) than members of small groups. Accordingly, we expected\n3iir | Hypothesis Three. Group size will be negatively related to voice such that individuals in smaller groups will engage in more voice than individuals in larger groups.\n7a0a | Style of Management: Self- Versus Traditional Management\no1qp | Self-managed work groups are self-regulating. They perform a complete task, encourage differential member contributions based on skills and abilities, and exercise discretion over work methods and task schedules. The amount of autonomy and discretion delegated to a work group influences each member's sense of involvement and responsibility. In self-managed groups, therefore, members are likely to take \"personal responsibility\" and feel \"personally accountable\" for outcomes. Employees in self-managed groups are also linked together by high levels of task interdependence and shared responsibility for group performance. Consequently, member jobs are more complex and individuals are more broadly involved in group decision making than those who work in traditional groups that function under control systems based on a hierarchy. Although research on self-managed groups is inconsistent and does not demonstrate higher overall effectiveness, research has shown that self-managed groups have higher job complexity and that individuals in complex jobs exhibit more voice. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that members of self-managed work groups will be especially proactive in expressing their opinions, making innovative suggestions, and developing recommendations for change. Specifically, we hypothesized\njrik | Hypothesis Four. Individuals in self-managed groups will engage in more voice relative to individuals in traditionally managed groups.\nxv78 | Person X Situation Interactions\nsdks | havior in organizations is best conceptualized as the result of interactive processes that depend on the simultaneous interplay of differences between situations and differences between individuals,\" few have actually pursued this approach. Instead, researchers have tended to focus on either personal or situational predictors. This is certainly the case in voice research where researchers have focused almost exclusively on individual affect (satisfaction) and have rarely considered situational factors or the interaction between person-centered characteristics and situational characteristics. Considering person-situation interactions allows identification of systematic relationships that occur when the behavior of different types of individuals varies based on the situation. In the next two sections, we draw upon and extend behavior plasticity theory to specify the nature of Person X Situation interactions on voice behavior.\ny8fb | Self-Esteem and Behavior Plasticity\n521q | Research on self-esteem as a main effect has yielded weak and inconsistent results. To address this issue, Brockner developed behavior plasticity theory. This theory proposes that self-esteem moderates the relationship between situational factors and individual behavior such that those with low self-esteem are more responsive to external cues (situational factors) than those with high self-esteem. Brockner gave three reasons for this relationship. First, low self-esteem individuals are less certain of their own beliefs and behaviors and are more influenced by their environments. Second, because low self-esteem individuals are dependent on others for positive feedback, they respond to others by conforming in an attempt to gain approval. Finally, low self-esteem individuals are especially sensitive to negative feedback. They tend to overgeneralize, apply the feedback broadly, and change their behavior in a variety of situations. In contrast, those with high self-esteem are less influenced by situational factors and are more likely to exhibit behavioral autonomy.",
