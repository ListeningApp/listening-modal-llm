Besides more conventional species conservation practices, there is a broader discussion on the ethics of developing and using biotechnologies for conservation purposes and beyond. Setting these larger concerns aside, more technology-focused conservation approaches - if justifiable in certain cases - should be seen as complementary rather than alternatives to conventional conservation practices. Accordingly, the subject of debate concerns whether there are certain cases where such technological means are appropriate and desirable at all.\nmq4s | For example, a topic that has recently been gaining attention is the evaluation of the possibility of engineering species (via gene drives, cloning, etc.) either with the purpose of avoiding their extinction, such as by genetically adapting them to new climatic conditions or by increasing the genetic diversity of a population, or as means to eradicate invasive species.\n95el | Related to proposals in favour (or critiques) of altering species to avoid (or cause) their extinction, a second body of work focuses on how and whether methods such as back-breeding, cross-species cloning and genetic engineering can be employed to appropriately address extinctions once they have occurred. Thus, the possibility of de-extinction by bringing a species 'back' from extinction has captured the imagination of many environmental philosophers.\na0a5 | This topic has become the centre of a lively debate in the ethics of extinction, which is noteworthy in so far as de-extinction is only a minor subject within the broader field of conservation ethics and debates. Of concern are, for example, different moral values and goods that might be supported or hindered by de-extinction projects, which also include anthropocentric reasons in favour of the de-extinction of certain species, such as their potential value for ecosystem functioning, their economic value or their scientific value.\ngocl | Non-anthropocentric attempts to provide a qualified justification for this approach include providing a list of criteria for its employment or by trying to make the idea useful for other normative purposes such as whether de-extinction might be a way of enacting a reparative duty towards nonhuman species or individual animals after extinctions have occurred. While thinking about de-extinction in terms of reparation or restitution might be intuitively appealing and constitute an argument occasionally engaged by conservation professionals, concerns about de-extinction as a form of reparation or retribution are shared by many authors, while more might be said in favour of de-extinction as ecological restoration. Overall, while some authors argue that de-extinction can be ethically permissible in certain circumstances, the debate on the desirability of de-extinction has been rather sceptical. Three common, not exhaustive, critiques of de-extinction fall into the following three categories.\nob1z | Firstly, it has been frequently pointed out that the resulting species is not the same species as the previously extinct species, but only constitutes a copy, which concerns the species' identity. Actual resurrection is not considered to be possible - or only possible by drawing on a very specific species concept and related metaphysical commitments to resolve the resurrection paradox - which leaves any de-extinction proposal wanting and reintroduces the above-mentioned considerations about the ontology of species. However, other writers argue that de-extinction technologies should not be understood as aiming to re-create extinct species in the first place, which weakens this critique aimed at de-extinction while also reducing its intuitive appeal.\nm4cb | Secondly, concerns about animal welfare have been raised, which regards, for example, the welfare of the animals used for laboratory testing, of the animals that are reintroduced into ecosystems and of the animals already living in the target ecosystems. Distinct from but related to such worries are also concerns regarding the ecological risks of reintroducing species into ecosystems and, thus, what this means for ecosystems beyond the de-extinct species in question.\nm61y | Thirdly, we can find a range of worries raised against de-extinction on a more abstract level of analysis concerning the human-nature relationship.\nu2ob | linked, in turn, to worries about naturalness in terms of artificiality and authenticity as well as concerns about instrumentalist techno-optimist conservation strategies more generally as exemplified by de-extinction.\n2gnm | Extinction studies\n```",
