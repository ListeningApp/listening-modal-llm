        "content": "5bjs | A fast spin echo three-dimensional MR cholangiopancreatography is recommended with echo time six hundred to seven hundred milliseconds, repetition time one thousand five hundred to two thousand five hundred milliseconds, flip angle one hundred forty degrees and fat suppression using a one point five-tesla unit. Acquisitions are strictly coronal and almost isotropic to allow for non-distorted detection and assessment of the smaller structures. Real-time navigator gating is necessary to synchronize breathing. Field of view eighteen to twenty-four centimeters and acquisition matrix two hundred fifty-six by two hundred fifty-six are adequate. We suggest using a flexible surface coil according to the child's weight with a minimum of twelve channels.\nuodj | Gentle swaddling and natural sleep or sedation are both possible options. We recommend the patient fast for at least four hours before the MRI and no digestive contrast.\nk16v | The MR cholecystopancreatography diagnosis of biliary atresia was made on the basis of the non-visualization of the extrahepatic biliary tree or the non-visualization of the extrahepatic bile duct and gallbladder, also considering periportal thickening and high signal intensity in the porta hepatis on T two-weighted images. Other authors considered the non-visualization of the extrahepatic bile duct and gallbladder abnormalities.\nb2lm | The meta-analysis performed by He et al. included seven MR cholecystopancreatography studies for biliary atresia diagnosis reporting a sensitivity of eighty-nine point seven percent, a specificity of sixty-four point seven percent, a positive likelihood ratio of three point one zero, a negative likelihood ratio of zero point one six, and a diagnostic odds ratio of thirty-two point four eight.\nti7f | Kim et al. used a conditional inference tree analysis to select discriminators for the diagnosis of biliary atresia. Visibility of the common bile duct, abnormality of the\noksu | gallbladder and MRI triangular cord thickness were good discriminators for the diagnosis of biliary atresia. The MRI-based decision tree using these findings with MRI triangular cord thickness cutoff of five point one millimeters showed ninety-seven point three percent sensitivity, ninety-four point eight percent specificity and ninety-six point two percent accuracy, comparable to ultrasound. MRI scans in this study were performed using sedation. This was a retrospective study with the possibility of bias. The authors did not assess the reproducibility of MRI triangular sign thickness and the baseline characteristics were different between the biliary atresia and non-biliary atresia groups. The proportion of patients with visible or dilated common bile duct on MRI in the non-biliary atresia group was much higher than in other studies because the authors included patients with choledochal cyst and partially visualized common bile duct in the visible common bile duct group, compared with previous studies that excluded these cases.\nwtow | According to Siles et al., non-enhanced MR cholecystopancreatography visualization of the entire extrahepatic bile duct system, including confluence of intrahepatic bile ducts, is possible but was only observed in sixty-two point five percent of neonates and infants younger than three months in a normal physiological state. For infants younger than thirty days, this result dropped to fifty percent. This compromises the ability of MR cholecystopancreatography to exclude the diagnosis of biliary atresia at the optimal time for surgery.\no22k | Hepatobiliary scintigraphy\nnwfz | Hepatobiliary scintigraphy uses technetium ninety-nine m-labelled iminodiacetic acid derivatives as a radiotracer. Patient preparation for imaging should include phenobarbital to activate liver excretory enzymes and increase bile flow for a minimum of three to five days before the hepatobiliary imaging study. Scintigraphy can exclude biliary atresia by demonstrating transit of radiotracer into the bowel. Cholescintigraphic images should be acquired at multiple times up to twenty-four hours.",
