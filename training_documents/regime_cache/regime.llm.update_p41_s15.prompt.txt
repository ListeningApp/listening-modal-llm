You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

b09f | Discretization of perturbations. For Langevin dynamics, perturbations of the form (B.3) can correspond to differential operators acting on the positions or mo- menta, i.e. FTVq and FTVp. In dimension one, these options reduce to - Fogo and - FOpyo, both of which are trivially discretized with centered finite differences.
zutp | For the modified fluctuation-dissipation in p, its discretization corresponds to scaling the LFD term in (2.16) by (y + an). For its position counterpart -8-1
qgmy | q its discretization corresponds to adding (B.2), scaled by on.
40wi | Upwind scheme for Langevin. We now motivate the upwinding used to discretize the transport term <LATEX>p ^ { T } M ^ { - 1 } \nabla _ { q }</LATEX> in the Fokker-Planck equation (2.17). In particular, the use of a centered finite difference with an even number of points <LATEX>m _ { q }</LATEX> in the spa- tial domain would lead to independent submeshes, and hence might give incorrect results, an issue known as odd-even decoupling (see [45] for a thorough discussion). To overcome this, one resorts to decentered finite differences, in particular upwinding.
a418 | Recall that equation (2.3) can be seen as the stationary solution to the evolution PDE <LATEX>\partial _ { t } \psi = \mathcal{L} ^ { \dagger } \psi .</LATEX> To implement the upwinding scheme, we write the transport term in the Fokker-Planck in the form of the advection equation, that is
e9lu | <LATEX>\partial _ { t } \psi + p ^ { T } M ^ { - 1 } \nabla _ { q } \psi = 0 .</LATEX> The scheme used to discretize the components of <LATEX>\nabla _ { q } \psi</LATEX> depends on the sign of the components <LATEX>o f \quad p .</LATEX> The (partial) derivative is discretized with a scheme decentered on the left when <LATEX>p \geqslant 0 ,</LATEX> and decentered on the right when <LATEX>p \leqslant 0 .</LATEX> The discretization of <LATEX>p \partial _ { q } \psi</LATEX> in dimension one at a mesh point <LATEX>\left( Q _ { i } , P _ { j } \right)</LATEX> is therefore done as follows:
a278 | <LATEX>\left\{ \begin{array}{} p \frac { \left[ \Psi _ { 0 } ^ { h } \right] _ { i + 1 , j } - \left[ \Psi _ { 0 } ^ { h } \right] _ { i , j } } { h _ { q } } , & p < 0 , \\ p \frac { \left[ \Psi _ { 0 } ^ { h } \right] _ { i , j } - \left[ \Psi _ { 0 } ^ { h } \right] _ { i - 1 , j } } { h _ { a } } , & p > 0 . \end{array} \right.</LATEX> Acknowledgments.
