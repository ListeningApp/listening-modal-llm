        "content": "nznd | IF YOUR HANDS ARE FULL\nnukq | Terribly afraid one dark night, Mulla Nasrudin travelled with a sword in one hand and a dagger in the other. He had been told that these were a sure means of protection.\nzrkf | On the way he was met by a robber, who took his donkey and saddlebags full of valuable books.\nqylb | The next day, as he was bemoaning his fate in the teahouse, someone asked:\np5x0 | 'But why did you let him get away with your possessions, Mulla? Did you not have the means to deter him?'\ntbvr | 'IF my hands had not been full' said the Mulla, 'it would have been a different story.'\nawwt | The use of the story, of course, is to indicate that people may have a transmitted formula ('weapons are a defence') without the ability to understand how to employ it.\nc10m | Like Nasrudin, they go through the motions, merely carrying the instruments . . .\nx72s | The unusual tenacity of replication of mere form which is to be observed in religious transmission is evidence of human determination, not of effective content.\ni772 | The ancient Chinese, Babylonian and Egyptian civilisations, as social examples, for instance, endured for thousands of years not because they were especially good and true and necessary: but because they were promoted and maintained by determined men and women, and because there was in addition a quota of inertia in them which prevented laudable change. They did not develop beyond a certain stage.\n9bcl | People appreciate and value form, and therefore do not at first appreciate the reality of Sufis, though they may think they do, mistaking certain outward form for Sufi reality. It is for this reason that the great ancient among the Sufis, Sahl son of Abdullah of Tustar, said: 'You may not appreciate Sufism at first, but once you do you will appreciate it until the end of your days.'\ndb44 | WEAKNESS OF EXPECTATION\nose7 | form can even include expectation, since people all over the world, and of all types, tend to prize the experience of expectation and especially the desire for reward. Form implies the acceptance of automatic or conditioned expectations, and Sufis therefore in their teaching circumstances defy this. As Yahya son of Maaz of Balkh said, over a thousand years ago, in this connexion: 'Ascetics renounce this world, but Sufis renounce expectations of the next one as well. Ascetics seek the pleasures of Paradise, but the Sufi is a stranger even to Paradise.'\nh0hp | His contemporary Sari al-Saqati (who died in eight hundred sixty-seven of the Christian Era) underlines how the attachment to form and to one's self are intertwined, and says: 'True wisdom is non-attachment to the self and devotion to Truth.' And Sufism is traditionally termed 'Truth without form.'\nqt19 | Talking of the limitations of question-and-answer sessions, the onus of limiting these to useful content and length is upon the teacher.\newyu | In his Table-Talk, the great master Jalaluddin Rumi said:\novoh | The Night passed and our talk did not end: What sin was the night's? It was our speech which was too long.\ndfi8 | And do not forget the occasional enlightenment of what lurks within some supposedly spiritual people, which can slip out in question-and-answer circumstances. Traditionally, in India, couched in the form of a joke, there is an argument that false gurus can learn to be real ones by suddenly seeing their own inadequacies. This is the story:\njkvs | 'Guruji, why don't you enroll your boy into the Teaching?'\ntvai | 'Because it is against my principles to teach the sons of the rich for nothing!'\n6i7y | Dedication, Service, Sincerity\n3pjf | Q: Is there any real sincerity behind the feeling of the sincerity that is open to doubt?\nyu90 | A: One of the most embarrassing pieces of knowledge to have is to know when someone is doing something for his own entertainment, but is convinced that he is doing something for someone else.\nbv6e | It makes one feel ashamed for such a person, and it makes me shocked by the cultural defect which has trained this wretched individual to imagine that he is serving someone or something, when he is instead obtaining personal gratification.\n31d9 | At this time, and probably for some time to come, there is no hope that most of these people can ever be shown what they are doing: doing to themselves and to others.\nupug | Not least sad is the fact that, while someone is pursuing self-gratification believing it to be something else, he neither gets any deep gratification, nor does he ever do anything for anyone else, for a cause, for his real self.\nz6yj | Instead of looking at this problem, man prefers to preen himself and crow: 'Look what I have achieved since I came down out of the trees'.\n6idz | Isn't that more sad than still being in the trees?\nxh1w | This is a most important technical problem. It can be solved, certainly in the case of some people. But first it must be observed. No culture of today provides any generally applicable theoretical or practical method of drawing attention to it, let alone doing anything about it. And yet it remains one of the major stumblingblocks to human progress.\n76xh | Instead of showing that disguised gratification-seeking is a masquerade, and just as inhibiting as any other make-believe (you can't do anything else while you are engaged in pretence) many human cultures sanctify and employ this flaw. Instead of saying: 'You are amusing yourself by engaging in this or that national,\n9kpf | cultural, religious, spiritual game,' they may say: 'This is not a game it is serious. In fact, it is the way to heaven.' For lack of a high enough level of understanding, leaders of thought operate too shallowly.\n8pu6 | This is because, at some time in the past, a shortage of technicians who know what really is happening caused a majority of the ignorant to take the place of most of the wise.\ngzff | Giving people tasks, or letting them choose them, will often either make them inured to such tasks, or else may cause them to derive sadistic or masochistic pleasure from such activities which entail service, dedication, suffering and so on: without an additional dimension of insight.\n7omh | The only hope is for there to be someone present to prescribe, from time to time, what a person should do and what he should not do, to strengthen his real efforts, to prevent himself becoming a parrot or machine, or to stop sanctimoniousness getting the upper hand.\nfsva | It is unpopular to say that someone might know better than the individual himself as to the course which he should pursue.\nnhf3 | Unpopular, yes. But one cannot hope that everything right will always be popular. The people who go raving about that they 'must sacrifice' are the last people who, for their own sake, should be allowed to make sacrifices. But what happens? Every organisation known to you is on the lookout for just these people, in order to fuel itself from their sacrifice.\nzouw | Understanding this is what we call seeing oneself and seeing others.\novjt | One can help by giving you undertakings to involve yourself in which neither flatter you nor exploit you. But you have to do something towards it, too, you know. This something is not becoming an acceptor, rejector or being uncertain.\nzduq | It is for you to study this theory and watch it in practice, and keep yourself open to work and study, act and live without forming a part of an unnecessarily over-simplified pattern, which is the way in which the majority of people operate.\nbh3w | THE TREASURE CAVE\nx3lh | Q: People say that premature insight, beyond ordinary understanding, is worse than none: because one cannot use it or be used by it. They also say that someone may lose through greed and yet benefit others. What does all this mean? Can it be put in a more comprehensible form?",
