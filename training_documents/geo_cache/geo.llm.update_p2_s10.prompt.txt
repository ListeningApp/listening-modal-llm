You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

90no | Before the introduction of natural gas, town gas with a hydrogen content of more than 50% hydrogen was produced, transported and stored in Germany and Europe. Town gas was derived from coal, and its production still persists in China and Asia. When storage tanks could no longer meet the requirements of the gas industry, underground gas storage facilities were built in the porous geological subsurface starting from the 1950s. Pore storage systems were launched in Beynes (France), Lobodice (Czech Republic), Engelbostel (Hannover) Reitbrook (Hamburg), Hähnlein (Darmstadt), Kirchheiligen (Mühlhausen/Tühringen), Eschenfelden (Fürth/Oberpfalz), Ketzin (Brandenburg) even before the first salt caverns were put into operations in Bad Lauchstädt and Kiel in the 1970s (e.g., Jones and Machsen, 1963; Šmigáň et al., 1990; Sedlacek, 2002; Panfilov, 2016; Marcogaz, 2017). Today, these underground storage facilities have been converted to natural gas storage facilities or have since been abandoned. Currently, pure hydrogen (>95% H2) is solely stored in salt caverns at a few sites, namely, Teesside (United Kingdom) and Clemens Dome (United States), Spindletop (United States), and Moss Bloss (United States) (e.g., Panfilov, 2016; Zivar et al., 2021). Given this sparse and limited experience with hydrogen in pore storage systems, it is necessary to formulate recommendations for the safe handling of hydrogen in the subsurface.
jt0y | 2.2 Prospects for hydrogen network structures
qb7o | The design of future hydrogen infrastructure and storage requirements in Germany remains uncertain and complex (Lux et al., 2022; Neuwirth et al., 2022). It is challenging to analyze
oae5 | underground storage requirements and infrastructures in such a highly complex and swiftly evolving environment. While the German National Hydrogen Strategy was published in 2020 to promote the use of hydrogen in all sectors of the hydrogen economy, it didn't specify the design of the hydrogen transport and storage infrastructure (BMWi, 2020). To examine the potential use of underground hydrogen storage in porous media, three inter- dependent variables that could impact future storage requirements in Germany have to be considered: 1) spatial distribution of hydrogen production via electrolysis, 2) hydrogen demand centres, and 3) hydrogen pipelines and import terminals.
s0fl | Lux et al. (2022) investigated the positioning of electrolysers, underground storage and transport infrastructure in a greenhouse gas-neutral German energy system using five scenarios. Regardless of the scenario, their calculations indicate that 71% of the total hydrogen production in Germany will be located in the North and Baltic Seas, with a combined hydrogen production of 83-129 TWh by 2050 and total electrolyzer capacities of 37-55 GWel (ibid.). The concentration in these regions is due to the high potential for wind power, and it does not conflict with the alternative of expanding the electricity grid. Sens et al. (2022) report similar findings, as they calculate the second-lowest hydrogen supply cost at the North Sea, while Husarek et al. (2021) also support the idea of regional concentration, which contrasts with the results of Gils et al. (2021). Lux et al. (2022) demonstrate that hydrogen can serve as a seasonal and long-term storage medium, with a working gas volume of 42-104 TWh of hydrogen in 2050. In contrast, Gils et al. (2021) report a required storage capacity of 53 TWh in the same year. In the modelled energy systems, hydrogen storage levels decrease during winter when renewable electricity generation is lower and increase in summer with higher renewable electricity feed-in (Lux et al., 2022). This seasonal profile for hydrogen storage has been identified in previous studies by Gils et al. (2021) and Welder et al. (2018) for Germany, and Cárdenas et al. (2021), Samsatli and Samsatli (2019), Gabrielli et al. (2020), and Hernandez and Gençer (2021) for different regions or countries. Large-scale storage directly on site or at the end of a transport pipeline at the demand location can reduce hydrogen costs by decreasing excess electricity (Welder et al., 2018; Gils et al., 2021; Sens et al., 2022).
43ia | In order to establish a cost-effective hydrogen economy and a greenhouse-gas neutral energy system in the long run, a German- wide transport network is necessary (Gils et al., 2021). However, the design of such a network and the routing of its pipelines is still up for debate. Although detailed expansion plans differ, there is consensus in the literature on the need to connect production hubs and import terminals in the North with demand centers in the South of Germany (ibid .; Lux et al., 2022; Husarek et al., 2021). The European gas network operators have proposed a European-wide hydrogen pipeline vision (hydrogen backbone), which focuses on the repurposing of existing natural gas infrastructures (Wang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). For example, in Germany, a North-South pipeline from Rostock to Lake Constance is planned to be established from 2035 onwards, repurposing the existing natural gas infrastructure, which is considered more cost effective than building new pipelines. The repurposing of pipelines and port
3g2y | infrastructure is also a part of the IPCEI Hydrogen initiative (important projects of common European interests). The association of the supra-regional gas transmission companies in Germany (FNB Gas) develops a joint network development plan every 2 years, which is then submitted to the German Federal Network Agency. The 2022 plan (FNB Gas, 2022) models a national hydrogen network in Germany, based on a survey of transportation needs. However, due to the current regulatory framework, this network is not legally binding. The 2020 plan (FNB Gas, 2020) only contained a rough outline of a visionary hydrogen network, in contrast to the more detailed model presented in the 2022 plan.
gc7v | Assessing hydrogen storage requirements is a multi-faceted endeavour that includes an evaluation of potential future hydrogen demand and its regional distribution. Future hydrogen demand is still uncertain, according to Neuwirth et al. (2022), while Lux et al. (2022) indicate a range of hydrogen demand scenarios between 34 and 667 TWh (final energy demand in 2050), attributable to different usage categories such as industry, transport, and heating. To derive a more comprehensive estimate, Neuwirth et al. (2022) conducted a site- and process- specific bottom-up analysis of hydrogen demand from the energy- intensive sectors alone, revealing a potential hydrogen demand of 326 TWh/a. The spatial distribution of this demand is heterogeneous, with concentration in a few regions. Consequently, we posit that underground hydrogen storage is more likely in these regions, given that they are probable endpoints for pipelines, and industry clusters require an economic and steady hydrogen supply, which can be secured through storage.
