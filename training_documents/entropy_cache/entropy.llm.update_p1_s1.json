While it had its flaws, I came to like it and eventually decided to teach a short course on entropy in the form of tweets. This little book is a slightly expanded version of that course.\npa2d | It's easy to wax poetic about entropy, but what is it? I claim it's the amount of information we don't know about a situation, which in principle we could learn. But how can we make this idea precise and quantitative? To focus the discussion I decided to tackle a specific puzzle: why does hydrogen gas at room temperature and pressure have an entropy corresponding to about twenty-three unknown bits of information per molecule? This gave me an excuse to explain these subjects:\nlf13 | · information\n28e7 | · Shannon entropy and Gibbs entropy\nye9e | · the principle of maximum entropy\ndyie | · the Boltzmann distribution\n75gl | · temperature and coolness\nwu5u | · the relation between entropy, expected energy and temperature\nw7ga | · the equipartition theorem\nl7xq | · the partition function\ncqbg | · the relation between entropy, free energy and expected energy\nhr2e | · the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator\nzsya | · the entropy of a classical particle in a box\n7dof | · the entropy of a classical ideal gas.\nykie | I have largely avoided the second law of thermodynamics, which says that entropy always increases. While fascinating, this is so problematic that a good explanation would require another book! I have also avoided the role of entropy in biology, black hole physics, et cetera. Thus, the aspects of entropy most beloved by physics popularizers will not be found here. I also never say that entropy is 'disorder'.\n3hj2 | I have tried to say as little as possible about quantum mechanics, to keep the physics prerequisites low. However, Planck's constant shows up in the formulas for the entropy of the three classical systems mentioned above. The reason for this is fascinating: Planck's constant provides a unit of volume in position-momentum space, which is necessary to define the entropy of these systems. Thus, we need a tiny bit of quantum mechanics to get a good approximate formula for the entropy of hydrogen, even if we are trying our best to treat this gas classically.\noy25 | Since I am a mathematical physicist, this book is full of math. I spend more time trying to make concepts precise and looking into strange counterexamples than an actual 'working' physicist would. If at any point you feel I am sinking into too many technicalities, don't be shy about jumping to the next tweet. The really important stuff is in the boxes. It may help to reach the end before going back and learning all the details. It's up to you.\nti3v | In twenty ten, Chas A. Egan and Charles H. Lineweaver estimated the biggest contributors to the entropy of the observable universe. Measuring entropy in bits, these are:\nufwv | · stars: ten to the eighty-one bits.\nm0qi | · interstellar and intergalactic gas and dust: ten to the eighty-two bits.\ny63m | · gravitons: ten to the eighty-eight bits.\n12af | · neutrinos: ten to the ninety bits.\nnznk | · photons: ten to the ninety bits.\ntd48 | · stellar black holes: ten to the ninety-eight bits.\n0tv0 | · supermassive black holes: ten to the one hundred five bits.\n1pei | So, almost all the entropy is in supermassive black holes!\nat1e | In twenty ten, Chas A. Egan and Charles H. Lineweaver estimated the entropy of the observable universe. Entropy corresponds to unknown information, so there's a heck of a lot we don't know! For stars, most of this unknown information concerns the details of every single electron and nucleus zipping around in the hot plasma. There's more entropy in interstellar and intergalactic gas and dust. Most of the gas here is hydrogen-some in molecular form H-two, some individual atoms, and some ionized. For all this stuff, the unknown information again mostly concerns the details, like the position and momentum, of each of these molecules, atoms and ions.\nzpsj | There's a lot more we don't know about the precise details of other particles whizzing through the universe, like gravitons, neutrinos and photons. But there's even more entropy in black holes! One reason Stephen Hawking is famous is that he figured out how to compute the entropy of black holes. To do that you need a combination of statistical mechanics, general relativity and quantum physics. Statistical mechanics is the study of physical systems where there's unknown information, which you study using probability theory. I'll explain some of that in these tweets. General relativity is Einstein's theory of gravity, and while I've explained that elsewhere, I don't want to get into it here so I will say nothing about the entropy of black holes.\nb75r | Quantum physics was also necessary for Hawking's calculation, as witnessed by the fact that his answer involves Planck's constant, which sets the scale of quantum uncertainty in our universe. I will try to steer clear of quantum mechanics in these tweets, but in the end we'll need a tiny bit of it. There's a funny sense in which statistical mechanics is somewhat incomplete without quantum mechanics. You'll eventually see what I mean.\nbuot | THE ENTROPY OF HYDROGEN\npb5c | At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen gas has an entropy of\nh0uy | One hundred thirty point six eight joule per kelvin per mole\nkqxy | But a joule per kelvin of entropy is about\n3572 | One point zero four four nine times ten to the twenty-three bits of unknown information and a mole of any chemical is about\nmj6d | Six point zero two two one times ten to the twenty-three molecules\nosru | So the unknown information about the precise microscopic state of hydrogen is\n7cej | One point zero four four nine times ten to the twenty-three approximately equals twenty-three bits per molecule!\n9v21 | One hundred thirty point six eight times six point zero two two one times ten to the twenty-three\nt3ut | Egan and Lineweaver estimated the entropy of all the interstellar and intergalactic gas and dust in the observable universe. Entropy corresponds to information we don't know. Their estimate implies that there are ten to the eighty-two bits of information we don't know about all this gas and dust.\nblsg | Most of this stuff is hydrogen. Hydrogen is very simple stuff. So it would be good to understand the entropy of hydrogen. You can measure changes in entropy by doing experiments. If you assume hydrogen has no entropy at absolute zero, you can do experiments to figure out the entropy of hydrogen under other conditions. From this you can calculate that each molecule in a container of hydrogen gas at standard temperature and pressure has about twenty-three bits of information that we don't know.\nc9it | You can see a sketch of the calculation above. But everything about it is far from obvious! What does 'missing information' really mean here? Joules are a unit of energy; kelvin is a unit of temperature. So why is entropy measured in joules per kelvin? Why does one joule per kelvin correspond to one point zero four four nine times ten to the twenty-three bits of missing information? How can we do experiments to measure changes in entropy? And why is missing information the same as-or more precisely proportional to-entropy?\nt29r | The good news: all these questions have answers! You can learn them here. However, you will have to persist. Since I'm starting from scratch it won't be quick. It takes some math-but luckily, nothing much more than calculus of several variables. When you can calculate the entropy of hydrogen from first principles, and understand what it means, that will count as true success.\nddhd | See how it goes! Partial success is okay too.\ne69f | WHERE ARE WE GOING?\nq12e | The mystery: why does each molecule of hydrogen have approximately twenty-three bits of entropy at standard temperature and pressure?\nvj9y | The goal: derive and understand the formula for the entropy of a classical ideal monatomic gas:\ng0bb | S equals kN times the natural log of kT plus the natural log of approximate plus r parentheses over N times V\nk09q | including the mysterious constant y.\nw30h | The subgoal: compute the entropy of a single classical particle in a one-dimensional box.\n4vcv | The sub-subgoal: explain entropy from the ground up, and compute the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator.\n```",
