You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

d09o | But if our empire has left us with the rewards of (former) membership, it has also left us with liabilities of an educational nature. Imperialism afforded lessons in how to divide the world. It taught people to read the exotic, prim- itive, and timeless identity of the other, whether in skin color, hair texture, or the inflections of taste and tongue. Its themes of conquering, civilizing, converting, collecting, and classifying inspired educational metaphors equally concerned with taking possession of the world-metaphors that we now have to give an account of, beginning with our own education.
ylhz | Educational Accountability
a3td | In thinking about how schools are ill prepared to address the history of iden- tities that imperialism has bestowed upon us, I think we need to begin with the intersection between imperialism's legacy and education within our own lives. When my great-grandmother's family arrived in America in the 188os, they were in search of a Europe they had not been able to find in Russian Poland.12 After centuries of internal colonization in Eastern European shtetls, the Jewish people were being depicted at the time of their emigration as a race apart from Europeans. They were said to be a "secret race" and a "nation within a nation," as new scientists of race were obsessively given to measuring Jewish feet, noses, and gait.13 It hardly needs to be added that this shift cul- minated in the Nazi campaign to eliminate a defiled, mongrel race, a rootless Jewish nation.
ex5k | Fortunately, long before the shoah, my family were making their way across the New World on what might be taken to be a journey away from anti-Semitism and toward whiteness.14 It often meant joining in on the dis- placement of others, such as American Natives and African Americans. While holding to their religion (although conversion was embraced by some), Jews sought to deracialize their family's lives through the language they spoke and
9d4o | WHERE IS HERE?
cjq2 | the education they sought. 15 My mother recalls formally debating in her Sat- urday Hebrew school class whether Judaism was a religion or a race. She held with religion, but the racial barriers would take another generation to fall. My grandfather was barred from the post that he coveted and qualified him- self for on the faculty of the University of Toronto, for as late as the 1940s there were no Jewish professors in Canada (A. I. Willinsky, 1961; Abella, 1996). In the decade leading up to the Second World War, Canada had the worst record of any nation in restricting Jewish immigration; and during the war, riots in Montreal led to the smashing of Jewish shop windows.16 While I was growing up, after the war, my parents were still not able to join the local golf and country club, but for my family these were the last such outposts of racial privilege associated with defining and maintaining the whiteness of here. Although it would not have occurred to my family to hold the forces of imperialism responsible for racial discrimination, imperialism had fostered and been well served by the science of race that through the nineteenth and into the twentieth century gave a thoroughly modern legitimacy to anti- Semitism and other forms of racism (more to follow on this).
5esx | My own education felt race-free, outside the occasional school-yard slan- der. Still, I kept my Jewishness protected and quiet well into my days as a schoolteacher. What could this aspect of my "background" have to do with the wonders of Western culture that I studied and ended up teaching to others? It didn't occur to me that "the best that had been thought and said," in Matthew Arnold's famous phrase (1896), was based, as he also put it, on dis- criminating between Hebraic and Hellenic influences in favor of the glory
m5ka | that was Greece. On the rare occasions in this race-unspoken education when the Jew made an appearance, it was in the form of Shylock in my introduc- tion to Shakespeare, or Fagin featured in my first Dickens, and there was scarcely a comment from anyone, least of all me, on what had been made of these characters. In science class, it's true, there was the inevitable poster of the wild-haired Albert Einstein as eccentric scientist-hero. Meanwhile, I took my history and geography lessons on a world split between civilized and primi- tive, West and East, male and female. So, keeping my Jewishness for the Woody Allen moments in my life, I went on to make an Arnoldian education my business and my life. It must have been a common experience for teachers in current and former British colonies around the globe, except that through one generation and a terrible war, I had been freed of the racial designation.
byu8 | Only now have I finally come to ask how I so eagerly acquired an educa- tion that was indifferent, where it was not negative, toward aspects of my life and generations of my family. Who was I to be, what was I to make of this culture that was not meant to be mine, a culture that had been built, after all ;; on realizing such discriminations of character and identity? I had been taught to think the world of Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, and D. H. Lawrence, and did- only to learn sometime later that they would have found in me a distasteful and racialized Jewishness. I realized then that I had distanced myself from the Jewish culture that T. S. Eliot and Co. did not care much for.
76b0 | This critical return to what our education makes of us is one that femi- nist scholars have been pursuing for some time, following Virginia Woolf's disquieting footsteps through the British Museum and Oxford University in A Room of One's Own (1929), all the while asking how it is that we make our- selves worthy of the West's best arts and sciences. Such reconsideration is, of course, what one should be about as an educator, always being drawn back to one's own never-adequate education, as if to affirm Eliot's all too well- known lines:
zxz6 | We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time.
xnth | Yet when I now recall these lines from Four Quartets (1971b), they speak both to the age of exploration and to "where we started" in a new way ("for the first time").17 They speak to an education in who I was to be, for all appearances,
vafm | WHERE IS HERE?
2zmw | and who I was not to be: "What might have been and what has been / Point to one end, which is always present."
bf9k | Against this historical and global backdrop of a world imagined as em- pire and race, I seek to achieve with this book a degree of educational ac- countability. Although this phrase typically refers to holding teachers re- sponsible for student achievement scores on standardized tests, what I have in mind is that educators owe those they teach some account-if always partial- of what we have taught them about the world. The ethics of accountability, as I would cast it here, is about examining what this form of schooling has un- derwritten and who it has denied. It is about giving an account of education's and scholarship's role in a recent historical phenomenon that has had incal- culable global ramifications. The account called for here concerns the signif- icance of such divides as East and West, primitive and civilized; it concerns how the world has been constructed around centers and margins, and how these divisions were bolstered through forms of scholarship supported by im- perialism. As I am a teacher, I owe students an account of my work within the educational project that sought to put the world together in this way. I owe them an account of why education has not done more good in the world, why it has not done more to realize fully the democratic promises that con- tinue to underwrite public education. I owe them an account of why I re- main committed to expanding the concerns of education to include this re- flective and self-critical function.
otkr | What might such an account sound like? Leon Litwick, in his presiden- tial address to the Organization of American Historians in 1987, captured the spirit of educational responsibility that I am invoking here, when he called upon historians to acknowledge that "no group of scholars was more deeply implicated in the miseducation of American youth and did more to shape the thinking of Americans about race and blacks than historians" (cited by Hughes, 1993, p. 123). This particular burden of scholarship does not fall, of course, on historians alone. It is distributed across the educational experiences that, in all likelihood, we and our children have gone through. However one wants to label this work-and Litwick would not use postcolonial to describe his position-there is a need to examine education's continuing contributions to what were and continue to be colonizing divisions of the world. Every- where in this work there is a worrying about the consequences of knowing
ibgs | that might have been inspired by the ethical compass set out in the eighteenth century by Montesquieu:
colo | If I knew something useful to myself and detrimental to my family, V would reject it from my mind. If I knew something useful to my fam- ily but not to my homeland, I would try to forget it. If I knew some- thing useful to my homeland and detrimental to Europe, or else useful to Europe and detrimental to Mankind, I would consider it a crime. (Cited by Kristeva, 1991, p. 130)
d6r4 | This book is about the accumulation of learning that proved eminently use- ful to Europe and often detrimental to the larger body of humanity. It is con- cerned with what remains of that crime, as Montesquieu would have it, in the lessons we continue to teach the young and in the way many of us still see the world.
9mrz | To let students in on how their education may still be marked by Euro- pean imperialism resembles the project proposed by the literary scholar Ger- ald Graff (1992) when he calls on scholars to "teach the conflicts." Rather than following the typical pedagogical tack of "conflict evasion," Graff recom- mends that university classes explore the contest of ideas that dominate pub- lic forums and scholarly enclaves.18 Perhaps the recent controversy surround- ing Stanford University's Western civilization courses would be a good place to start in trying to understand the politics of imperialism's educational af- termath.19 However, when it comes to excluding dissenting voices, few insti- tutions can best the public high school, which is the educational home to a far wider range of the public than is the university. To hold off "teaching the con- flicts" of imperialism's educational legacy until college, or to treat it simply as an intellectual contest, diverts our attention from how the ideas of the prim- itive and the civilized become part of a commonsense division of the world by race, culture, and nation. The common sense of these divisions, I will argue, can be attributed to the success of this legacy, from primary grades to graduate school, from television's Wild Kingdom to National Geographic. This book turns to the less glamorous site of the public school because this is where most people form their ideas about history, science, literature, and other disciplines.
pk06 | The aim of this account giving is to afford students (and readers of the book) a critical distance from their own education, which may well, in turn be in need of revision itself one day; the aim is to hasten and focus chano that are already under way in creating a multicultural curriculum by offering readers a review of the history and the sort of education that have brought to this point. I do not intend the intellectual legacy of imperialism to be the whole of anyone's education, but neither should it go completely missing in a dozen years of schooling. Such teaching as I propose is not about realizing. or teaching to, the true identity of the student. It is intended, rather, to heln students understand their own education and the education of others as a worthy object of inquiry. Whatever criticisms of education this inquiry raises. it still reflects a faith in learning.
7wn9 | In writing this book, I have sifted through the rich history of imperial- ism, drawing on primary documents and firsthand accounts as well as con- temporary polemics and advances in critical theory; I have worked with stu- dents, teachers, and textbooks in today's schools. The pattern I follow in this book is to move from the larger historical record of imperialism to specific components of today's classrooms. Along the way, I pause at the 196os as the critical juncture when the current generation of baby boomers that swell the ranks of today's teaching force was schooled and when twenty-eight nations, from Algeria to Zaire, successfully struggled through war and diplomacy to wrest their independence from the imperial powers. It was a time when Frantz Fanon published his scathing indictment of colonialism, The Wretched of the Earth (1963); and Great Britain attacked the UN for pursuing "a new and dangerous path" of decolonization as it pressured Portugal to grant inde- pendence to Angola, Mozambique, and Portuguese Guinea. Meanwhile, the United States was amassing some fourteen thousand military "advisers" in Vietnam while at home it faced, as Time put it, "the pressures of Negro revo- lution bursting out all over." Federal troops had to accompany African Amer- ican students to school in Little Rock, Oxford, and Tuscaloosa, while two hundred thousand people gathered during the triumphant March on Wash- ington to hear Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. tell the world, "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."20
wcd0 | To give a sense of the intellectual climate of those formative years in the education of many of us, I draw on three powerful scholarly statements in the chapters ahead: William McNeill's The Rise of the West (1963), Carlton Coon's The Origin of Races (1962), and Northrop Frye's The Educated Imagi- nation (1963). Even as the European empires were dissolving, these major scholars and educators bolstered the case for a unequaled culture and race, whatever civil rights and political independence might finally be achieved in the world. Taken with Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth, these works make for a fascinating intellectual moment in the legacy of a collapsing imperialism that was as important as the Beatles, dare one say, in the education of the postwar baby boom generation now assuming the reigns of power in the West. At the very least, we need to reconsider how a person coming of age in the West in those years, whether in grade school or graduate school, was raised in the aftermath of colonialism among imperial habits of mind that now need to be identified, as they might still contribute to the educated imagination.
