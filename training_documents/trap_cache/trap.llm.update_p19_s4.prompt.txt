You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

The general point is that several different strategies can incorporate informal workers into electoral politics with promises of benefits not connected to upgrad- ing and in ways that divide formal and informal workers. Dani Rodrik paints a vivid picture of the political consequences of a large, enduring informal sector:
8qb6 | FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT
wkbn | Sustained, cohesive support from a broad segment of big business is likely a necessary condition for high-cost, long-term investment in up- grading institutions. However, business in most MI countries is struc- turally fractured along a dimension that fragments interests on key issues related to upgrading policies, such as education (Section IV). The cleavage-absent in all large earlier industrializers-is between foreign and domestic firms. The stock of FDI in large MI countries is not high when compared to the stocks in OECD countries today, but the more relevant comparison is between MI countries in the twenty-first century (34 percent of GDP) and HI countries in the twentieth century (4 percent of GDP for East Asia and 9 percent GDP for OECD) (see Table 5). The average percentages would have been even lower for HI countries
ftfg | in the twentieth century, when they were making the transition to HI. Moreover, MNCs are among the largest of big businesses in today's MI countries. In Latin America they usually account for a third to a half of the hundred largest firms.66 MNCs are especially dominant in the manu- facturing sectors of many MI countries, including in our two Southeast Asian cases, Malaysia and Thailand, where they account for thirty-four and thirty-one of the top fifty manufacturing firms, respectively.67 This typically translates into MNC dominance of manufactured exports and contrasts with the cases of the East Asian HI "graduates," where do- mestic firms account for the majority of manufacturing exports.68 At a minimum, this MNC dominance shuts the largest domestic firms out of manufacturing.
7xi5 | Of course, market-seeking MNCs might be amenable to joining up- grading coalitions, but these firms have technology and marketing ad- vantages derived from home markets that protect them from domestic competitors. Because of their market advantages, they can also afford to pay workers more and poach skilled workers elsewhere, thereby also creating a private solution to the skills problem (discussed in more de- tail in the next section). Efficiency-seeking MNCs operating in global production networks (GPNs) might have stronger interests in joining an upgrading coalition, but they also have other options: solving skills needs internally, relying on affiliated foreign suppliers, or simply mov- ing higher value-added production to a country that already has the desired skills and infrastructure.

gii5 | mestic firms to find common ground, especially for long-term, costly investments in building up the institutional infrastructure needed for innovation. Although some domestic firms might favor such a push, foreign firms typically do not, as they do most of their R and D in their home countries.69 When MNCs do invest in R and D in developing coun- tries, as they do increasingly in India and China, it is often in the lower technology, more routinized elements of R and D. But MNCs invest very little in R and D of any kind in large MI countries and have little inter- est in paying for costly long-term upgrading for domestic innovation.70
q5eu | In terms of collective action and political engagement, MNCs are pretty deficient, as Albert Hirschman first noted decades ago.71 For one, MNCs regularly operate through more direct ties to relevant agencies, such as boards of investment. MNCs also sometimes create separate as- sociations, such as the ubiquitous Amchams (American Chambers of Commerce), or split off separate associations in particular sectors (for example, mining in Chile or banking in Argentina).72 Moreover, some prominent associations exclude foreign firms. For example, in Mexico the exclusive CMHN (Mexican Council of Business Men, a council of the top forty or so business groups) had no MNC members, and in TUSIAD (Turkish Industry and Business Association), the main association for big business in Turkey, less than 10 percent of close to six hundred members were from MNCs.73 In turn, governments, when establishing councils to meet with business, often exclude foreign firms (for ex- ample, CDES [Economic and Social Development Council] in Brazil). Or MNCs opt not to participate in tripartite meetings, something that often occurs in Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) coun- tries.74 In addition, MNCs usually have further incentives to disengage from politics because they want to maintain a low profile (and stay out of government crosshairs) and/or because expat managers may know little about how best to engage. In sum, even were they more interested, MNCs would make poor coalition partners.
