        "content": "yogo | Macromolecules and organelles in the presynaptic terminal travel a long distance from the soma, making them old and vulnerable. Rapid turnover of proteins, membranes, receptors, and vesicles in the presynapse assigns autophagy a major role in maintaining synaptic homeostasis. This tasks synaptic autophagy with quality control responsibilities. Though there is compelling evidence that compromised autophagy contributes to PD, these studies primarily looked at the soma from a proteinopathy or mitophagy perspective. Selective inactivation of autophagy by conditional knockout of autophagy protein atg7 in dopaminergic neurons leads to enhanced dopamine release and rapid presynaptic recovery with abnormal axonal profiles. Conversely, autophagy enhancement through mTOR inhibition slows dopamine release, reduces the number of synaptic vesicles, and increases autophagosome density in the axons. These results emphasize the importance of synaptic autophagy in normal dopamine transmission and further evaluation is warranted to understand if additional synaptic autophagy defects exist, which may lead to PD pathogenesis.\n2285 | Another unique and stressful situation for neurons is that autophagosomes loaded with unwanted materials from an active presynaptic terminal need to be transported a long distance to the soma for lysosomal degradation. Microtubule and scaffolding proteins aid in this retrograde axonal transport of autophagosomes and are crucial for the normal functioning of E-L system. During their transport, autophagosomes mature into autolysosomes by fusing with late-endosomes or lysosomes towards the proximal end of the axon. There are recent studies suggesting lysosomal degradation at the distal end, especially of mitophagosome mediated by Parkin-PINK1. This is predicted to provide rapid neuroprotection against oxidative stress by damaged mitochondria, without requirement for retrograde transport. Axonal transport aids this function through anterograde transport of E-L system components required for degradation from soma towards distal end. Any defect in this to-and-fro transport machinery can completely clog the E-L system and other processes. Considering its functional significance in neuronal survival, axonal transport might hold clues for understanding pathological mechanisms. Abnormal axonal swelling with lysosomal accumulation has been noted in Alzheimer's disease, blocking the retrograde transport of autophagosomes. Similar understanding on the health of axonal transport machinery and\nys0g | Five. Sometimes, there are traffic issues: E-L system trafficking in PD\n7zvp | its dynamics in PD is crucial towards finding commonalities amongst neurodegenerative diseases.\nww6u | The multi-compartmentalized nature of neurons puts tremendous pressure on the endosomal sorting and trafficking machinery, which is also true in case of nigrostriatal neurons. The vacuolar protein sorting group of proteins that form retromer complex comprising of VPS thirty-five, VPS twenty-six, and VPS twenty-nine are crucial in retrograde trafficking and sorting of protein cargos from endosomes to the TGN, facilitating their recycle and reuse. The retromer complex also functions in sorting proteins or cargo to regulate endosomal and lysosomal maturation. Pedigrees with single allelic mutation in VPS thirty-five revealed autosomal dominant, late-onset, L-dopa-responsive PD, with striking similarities to idiopathic PD. Broadly, it is proposed that the mutant VPS thirty-five fails to associate with other components of the retromer complex, resulting in impaired retrograde trafficking. Induced loss-of-function mutations of VPS thirty-five in vitro resulted in enlargement of late-endosomes and aggregation of alpha-synuclein oligomers. Another study on flies revealed ceramide accumulation due to VPS thirty-five deficiency, suggesting lysosomal dysfunction. Alpha-synuclein accumulation in nigral dopaminergic neurons, loss of dopaminergic neurons, reduced dopamine transporter levels in the striatum, and locomotory deficits were noted in VPS thirty-five deficient mice. Further in vitro studies of VPS thirty-five (D six twenty N) mutant cells revealed dysfunction in endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of lysosomal membrane proteins (LAMP two A) and accelerated lysosomal degradation of LAMP two A. LAMP two A is considered important in directing misfolded alpha-synuclein to lysosomes, suggesting a mechanism for alpha-synuclein accumulation in VPS thirty-five deficiency. VPS thirty-five mutations also affect autophagy and dendritic AMPA receptor trafficking. VPS thirty-five mutations bring severe abnormality in mitochondrial dynamics, as noted in cultured dopaminergic neurons, mice SNpc neurons, and in PD patient derived fibroblasts. Oxidative stress implicated in sporadic PD might mediate pathogenesis through VPS thirty-five driven mitochondrial defects. VPS thirty-five also has a role in biogenesis of mitochondria-derived vesicles, further suggesting that its dysfunction causes mitochondrial pathology and neurodegeneration. VPS thirty-five is functionally linked to LRRK two, boosting its kinase activity. In fact, decreased VPS thirty-five levels were noted in the SNpc of PD patients with LRRK two mutations. Interestingly, overexpression of VPS thirty-five ameliorated locomotor deficits and enhanced lifespan in LRRK two mutant models, which was also seen in Parkin mutant models. Neuroprotection was also noted against MPP plus induced toxicity in dopaminergic neurons. Along with its E-L sorting functions, these links between VPS thirty-five and alpha-synuclein, LRRK two, Parkin, lysosomal dysfunction, autophagy, mitochondrial perturbations, and oxidative stress strongly suggest VPS thirty-five as a good therapeutic target.\nhpi6 | Six.
