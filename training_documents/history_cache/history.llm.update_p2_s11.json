        "content": "tp8g | In this disease of attention, if it can with propriety be called so, every impression seems to agitate the person, and gives him or her an unnatural degree of mental restlessness. People walking up and down the room, a slight noise in the same, the moving a table, the shutting a door suddenly, a slight excess of heat or of cold, too much light, or too little light, all destroy constant attention in such patients, inasmuch as it is easily excited by every impression. The barking of dogs, an ill-tuned organ, or the scolding of women, are sufficient to distract patients of this description to such a degree, as almost approaches to the nature of delirium. It gives them vertigo, and headache, and often excites such a degree of anger as borders on insanity. When people are affected in this manner, which they very frequently are, they have a particular name for the state of their nerves, which is expressive enough of their feelings. They say they have the fidgets.\ngxfd | By citing these examples of his patients' behaviors, Crichton depicts a great distractibility by extraneous and even slight stimuli, a considerable restlessness and perhaps some kind of impulsivity when the disorder \"excites such a degree of anger as borders on insanity.\" All symptoms observed by Crichton can be\ns2v1 | The history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\njkp9 | associated with ADHD. However, his descriptions do not entirely reflect the current concept of ADHD. He does not mention any symptoms of hyperactivity. It is possible that Crichton observed hyperactive or impulsive symptoms in his patients, but failed to recognize a correlation and decided not to specify them in this context. Another possibility is that he described the inattentive subtype of ADHD as suggested by Palmer and Finger. His brief description is consistent with some of the symptoms of this ADHD subtype, but does not fully meet the criteria for a clinical diagnosis.\nz8tt | We do not know for certain whether the \"morbid alteration\" of attention described by Crichton is identical with the current concept of ADHD. Crichton's patients might have suffered from another disorder associated with attention problems, such as a metabolic dysfunction, epilepsy, or head injury. However, Crichton's descriptions provide some evidence for the existence of ADHD at the end of the eighteenth century.\n9g22 | Fidgety Phil\n41fx | In eighteen forty-four, the German physician Heinrich Hoffmann created some illustrated children's stories including \"Fidgety Phil\" (\"Zappelphilipp\"), who is nowadays a popular allegory for children with ADHD. Hoffmann was born in Frankfurt/Main in eighteen oh nine. He studied medicine in Heidelberg, Halle, and Paris. In eighteen thirty-five, he became a general practitioner and obstetrician in Frankfurt/Main. In eighteen fifty-one, he was employed at the mental hospital of Frankfurt (\"Anstalt für Irre und Epi- leptische\") and became a successful psychiatrist. Hoffmann rejected the common opinion of his time that psychiatric patients were obsessed or criminal, but rather regarded mental disorders as medical issues. In eighteen sixty-one, he founded a new and very advanced hospital in Frankfurt. He was head of this institution until his retirement in eighteen eighty-eight and was known for his revolutionary efforts to improve the conditions of psychiatric patients.\n7um8 | In Germany, Hoffmann has become famous as the author of \"Struwwelpeter,\" a storybook created in eighteen forty-four as a Christmas present for his three-year-old son Carl Philipp. As Hoffmann detailed in his autobiography, he had several times previously pulled a piece of paper out of his notebook and had made little drawings to calm and amuse crying children, thus making possible an undisturbed medical examination. Hoffmann conceived \"Struwwelpeter\" for private use in order to\nuow2 | delight his son. However, the publisher Löwenthal who had seen his manuscript convinced him to publish the colorful drawings. In eighteen forty-five, the first edition of the \"Struwwelpeter,\" initially called \"Cheerful Stories and Funny Pictures with fifteen colored plates for children from three to six years\" (\"lustige Geschichten und drollige Bilder mit fünfzehn kolorierten Tafeln für Kinder von drei bis sechs Jahren\"), was released with great success. The second edition followed a year later and Hoffmann added some stories, which included among others the story of Fidgety Phil. Hoffmann's Struwwelpeter was published in numerous editions and translated into several languages. The four hundredth edition was released in nineteen seventeen and the number of editions can no longer be counted these days.\niat7 | In the story of Fidgety Phil, Hoffmann illustrates a family conflict at dinner caused by the fidgety behavior of the son and culminating in his falling over together with the food on the table. This can be interpreted as an early case of ADHD. At the beginning of the story, the father asks \"in earnest tone\" (Hoffmann eighteen forty-six, English edition): \"Let me see if Philip can be a little gentleman; Let me see if he is able to sit still for once at table\" (Hoffmann eighteen forty-six, English edition). The initial statement suggests that the father had anticipated some misbehavior of his son at table, indicating that this was no singular or occasional event. It is a first hint at the presence of an underlying persistent disorder. The DSM-IV-TR currently postulates that, for a diagnosis of ADHD, the symptoms \"have persisted for at least six months.\" Subsequently, Hoffmann describes symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity in Philipp. The boy's reaction to his father's admonition reads in the original German text as follows: \"Doch der Philipp hörte nicht, was zu ihm der Vater spricht,\" which, literally translated, means \"but Philipp did not listen to what the father was saying to him.\" This behavior represents explicit symptoms of inattention. The DSM-IV-TR describes that the patient \"often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly\" and \"often does not follow through on instructions ( ... ) [what is] not due to oppositional behavior.\" Instead of following his father's request, Philipp \"wriggled and giggled, and then, I declare, swung backward and forward and tilted his chair\" (Hoffmann eighteen forty-six, English edition). This description can be interpreted as symptoms of \"motoric overactivity\" and is close to the first symptom of hyperactivity characterized in the DSM-IV-TR: \"often fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat.\" Hoffmann depicts Philipp's motor activity as being excessive enough that \"his chair falls over quite. Philip screams with all his might, catches at the cloth, but then that makes",
