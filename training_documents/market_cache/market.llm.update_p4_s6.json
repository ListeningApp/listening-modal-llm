        "content": "p2n3 | Colonias in Texas and the Land Titling Programme in Starr County\nohh7 | Before analysing the specifics of land development and land market practices in the study areas, it is important to outline briefly the nature of irregular settlement development and self-help in Texas and elsewhere in the U.S., not least since few researchers are aware of the widespread existence of settlements that are so closely akin to their Latin American and Mexican counterparts. In Texas alone, an estimated one-half a million people, almost exclusively of Mexican origin, live in some one thousand six hundred plus settlements or colonias as they are more generally known; while significant additional numbers of people also live in colonia-type sub-divisions in other border states such as New Mexico and Arizona. While significantly different in many important respects from their Mexican counterparts, the formation of these settlements responds to a similar logic-namely, rapid urban and population growth, a context of little or no public housing supply and low state support for other low-income housing opportunities. Although illegal, they are effectively the only route that poor households have if they are to embark upon home-ownership, build a home and create a family patrimony, all within a context of poverty and low-wage economies, without access to\nvbni | low-interest formal lending institutions. Housing acquisition is made affordable primarily by cheapening the cost of the actual lots themselves through the sale of agricultural land in rural (peri-urban) areas without adequate service provision at the outset, and doing so in such a way as to make the process seller-financed but without any transaction costs, and on terms that are favourable to the seller (ease of repossession for non-payment, etc). Thus, lots are sold under a 'Contract for Deed' mechanism whereby purchasers defer receipt of any deed or title until the lot is paid for in full. Sometimes they are sold informally without any contract, just with receipts for payments. Modal lot prices range from six thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars in two thousand and three values, depending upon the county and lot size. Another important way to achieve affordability is by lowering the cost of the housing unit itself, either through self-help construction or by living out of a camper or trailer, at least until household finances improve so as to allow for the purchase of a better manufactured home that can be placed on site. Services such as power and electricity are provided privately and, in the absence of county (public) capacity to provide water and wastewater removal services, these are also obtained privately from a number of possible sources including roving water tanker lorries. On-site septic tanks and evaporation fields are usually privately purchased and installed to deal with household effluent, although these are rarely adequate especially in the poorest settlements and regions.\ndgcw | Despite the hazards and difficulties associated with colonia-type housing, this supply system remains the only mechanism of entering home-ownership for low-income households earning less than twenty-five thousand dollars a year (and many, in fact, earn only half this amount). Even compared with other very poor counties near the border, in Starr County incomes are especially low: the median household income in nineteen ninety-nine was sixteen thousand five hundred four dollars (compared with thirty-nine thousand nine hundred twenty-seven dollars for Texas as a whole) and forty-five percent of households earned below fifteen thousand dollars a Two principal land developers controlled year. Data for the other border counties are\ngvwz | also indicative of widespread poverty, albeit not quite as extreme as in Starr County. The following data are for other border counties in the same Lower Rio Grande Valley region and show the median household income and the proportion of households earning less than fifteen thousand dollars total per year (figures in parenthesis): Cameron twenty-six thousand one hundred fifty-five dollars (twenty-nine point six percent); Hidalgo twenty-four thousand six hundred thirty-five dollars (thirty-two percent); Webb twenty-eight thousand one hundred dollars (twenty-six point nine percent); Zapata twenty-four thousand six hundred thirty-five dollars (thirty-two percent), while Upper Valley El Paso County, although also poor, has a more bifurcated income distribution, with thirty-one thousand fifty-one dollars median and twenty percent of households receiving less than fifteen thousand dollars per year. As one moves away from the border, so the median incomes usually rise, but there remains a significant proportion of the population in the very poor category, such that colonia-type sub-divisions are also widespread. Travis County in central Texas where the relatively well-off capital of Austin is located, has a median household income of forty-six thousand seven hundred sixty-one dollars (yet twelve point two percent still receive less than fifteen thousand), while Lubbock in the north has a median income of thirty-two thousand one hundred ninety-eight dollars (twenty-two point five percent below fifteen thousand). Both cities have colonia-type sub-divisions in their peri-urban hinterland and, although they are developed informally and are poor, the social conditions are rarely as extreme as one finds in the border area.\nsk5m | The current study location of Rio Grande City has particularly little going for it economically, with a median income of just under twenty thousand dollars, and forty percent of all households earning less than fifteen thousand. And as expected, within the specific settlements studied, incomes are even lower. Fairly typical (but not the poorest) is the colonia of Las Lomas where the median household income in nineteen ninety-nine was ten thousand nine hundred twenty-seven dollars with sixty-five percent earning below fifteen thousand. Most householders have at least one worker and employment spans a wide range of low-paid (usually) service jobs, sometimes supplemented by part-time service work for women and/or migrant agriculture and haulage jobs among the men.\nqws8 | Two principal land developers controlled and oversaw most of the peri-urban settlement outside Rio Grande City. They were Mr. Blas Chapa-a local judge-and Mr. Elías López. Independently, but sometimes together, these two men accounted for most of the land sales in the RGC colonias that later would require title regularisation. As developers, these two men were not unlike others in Texas, selling unserviced land with vague promises of later providing services, at prices and on terms that were affordable. However, the actual process of land development is rather atypical since the Chapa- and López-developed colonias, unlike most others, are distinctive in that many lots were not sold legally under Contract for Deed (although some were), but instead were sold piecemeal in exchange for receipts and handwritten entries in a book of sales. Equally problematic was that not all settlements were properly surveyed and platted (sub-divided into individual lots), but instead lots were identified by a 'metes and bounds' survey system that references land parcels according to distance and direction from a compass point, or by reference to a prominent feature-a clump of trees, a rock outcrop, or even to another person's property lines. Perhaps not surprisingly, therefore, many people ended up living on lots allocated and sold (but often not occupied) to someone else; others had homes that were actually in the street (which was poorly delineated and difficult to identify), while others lived unwittingly in the floodplain of an arroyo and only discovered the fact after a flashflood event. Finally, because relatively few people occupied their lots immediately and because the terms of default were so favourable to the developer, some lots were sold several times to different people.",
