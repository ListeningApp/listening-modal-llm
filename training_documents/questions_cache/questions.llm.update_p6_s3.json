But if we have a longer lever, or a more dynamic question, we can open that can up much wider and really stir things up. . . . If the right question is applied, and it digs deep enough, then we can stir up all the creative solutions.\"\noczy | While you may not immediately know the characteristics of a powerful question, it's actually quite easy to recognize one. For instance, if you were an Olympic judge scoring the power of questions on a scale from one to ten, with ten being the highest, how would you rate the following queries?\n2ttg | One. What time is it?\nhis3 | Two. Did you take a shower?\nm50z | Three. What possibilities exist that we haven't thought of yet?\nme84 | Four. What does it mean to be ethical?\no56m | We have tested questions such as these in several different cultures. In the process, we've discovered that, despite cultural differences, people quite consistently rate questions one and two as being less powerful, and questions three and four as being more powerful. Clearly, powerful questions are ones that transcend many boundaries.\nslz6 | Not long ago, we hosted a conversation with a group of international colleagues about what makes\n90k5 | a compelling question. Here are some of their reflections:\n9m8s | Finn Voldtofte from Denmark: The question has to catch people where they are, to meet them where there is the most energy and relevance for them, and then use that energy to go deeper. Action will flow naturally from that energy.\n893y | Felipe Herzenborn from Mexico: The question also needs to be simple and clear and penetrating. It's like a laser beam. A good question invites and challenges you to reflect at a deeper level-to find the knowledge or wisdom that's already there beneath the surface.\nfavz | Verna Allee from the United States: To me, the most energizing questions are those that involve people's values, hopes, and ideals—questions that relate to something that's larger than them, where they can connect and contribute. People don't have a lot of energy around questions that are only about removing pain.\n7szx | David Isaacs from the United States: Even though it's useful to acknowledge pain, I think it's also important to shift the question away from a problem focus or fix-it focus to a possibility focus. There's always a subtle feeling of disempowerment in a problem, a feeling that all the doors are shut. \"We've got a problem ... oh no! Not another problem!\" There's a weariness and stuckness about it. Simply asking, \"What's the possibility we see in this situation?\" can make a big difference.\nhx9e | Toke Moller from Denmark: Here's an example of that approach. I was working with a local school to frame a possibility-oriented question. We asked teachers, students, parents, and administrators, \"What could a good school also be?\" This way of posing the question helped people to see their school in a different light. It resulted in some amazing new ideas. I'm quite sure they would not have been as innovative if the question had focused only on fixing problems.\nywn2 | Carlos Mota from Mexico: It's a real art to find as well as to shape the right question for your situation. Once a friend told me about a time she was being interviewed. The interviewer said, \"We're just going to ask you one question: What's the question we\na63r | should be asking?\" Sometimes the most important thing to do is to help the people themselves shape the questions in the most powerful way, since they know their own situation the best of anyone.\ndqvj | Thus, a powerful question:\nr17u | · generates curiosity in the listener\n3c47 | · stimulates reflective conversation\ng345 | · is thought-provoking\nsvhz | · surfaces underlying assumptions\noaen | · invites creativity and new possibilities\n5u67 | · generates energy and forward movement\ndvms | · channels attention and focuses inquiry\nqrd3 | · stays with participants\nrxrg | · touches a deep meaning\ntf43 | · evokes more questions\nfcco | A powerful question also has the capacity to \"travel well\"-to spread beyond the place where it began into larger networks of conversation throughout an organization or a community. Questions that travel well are often the key to large-scale change. As we'll explore below, how such queries are crafted can make a difference in their capacity to move a system toward innovative futures.\n8uji | The Architecture of Powerful Questions\ndf3e | As shown at the start of this volume, powerful questions can dramatically improve the quality of insight, innovation, and action in our organizations, in our communities, and in our lives. Therefore, understanding the basic architecture of formulating powerful questions is a key skill in today's knowledge economy. There are three dimensions to powerful questions: construction, scope, and assumptions. Each contributes to the quality of learning and knowledge creation that emerges as we engage with others in a generative inquiry.\n53eu | The First Dimension: The Construction of a Question\na5u1 | The linguistic construction of a question can make a critical difference in either opening our minds or nar-\nry7u | rowing the possibilities we can consider. Is it a yes/no question? Is it an either/or question? Does it begin with an interrogative, such as Who, What, or How?\n5mda | Who What\ni4li | When Where Which\nr8sm | Why How?\ncuin | Just for fun, try placing these words in a pyramid of lower to higher power. Don't think too much; use your intuition.\nn1i7 | When asked, most people rank these words from more powerful to less powerful as follows:\n0r5m | By using the words toward the top of the pyramid, we can make many of our questions more robust. For example, consider the following sequence:\nne2o | · Are you satisfied with our working relationship?\nsqxn | · When have you been most satisfied with our working relationship?\n6pmo | . What is it about our working relationship that you find most satisfying?\n195r | . Why might it be that our working relationship has had its ups and downs?\nkqmi | As you move from the simple \"yes/no\" question at the beginning toward the \"why\" question at the end, you'll notice that the queries tend to stimulate more reflective thinking and a deeper level of conversation.\ng8rd | That's what we mean by a powerful question-one that provokes thoughtful exploration and evokes creative thinking.\nnns9 | However, a note of caution: Unless a \"why\" question is carefully crafted, it can easily evoke a defensive response, as people try to justify their answer rather than proceed in a spirit of inquiry. For instance, the questions, \"Why can't you ever tell me exactly what you are thinking?\" or \"Why did you do it that way?\" can cause someone to defend a given position or rationalize some past decision, rather than open new possibilities. In contrast, when a \"why\" question stems from genuine curiosity, such as \"I wonder why that happened?\" then the inquiry has the potential to create useful insights.",
