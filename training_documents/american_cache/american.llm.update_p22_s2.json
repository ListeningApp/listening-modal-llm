        "content": "0i6j | The map bears out the cartouche's invitation to conceive map reading as a hybrid product of print literacy. Inside the map image, cartographic symbols compete with the letters of the alphabet for the reader's attention. While pictographic dots, lines, and mountain symbols describe the nation's topography, an array of alphabetic names identify places from the locally specific (\"Philadelphia\") to the larger geopolitical unit (\"Pennsylvania\"). These toponyms are typographically differentiated according to political significance: the names of states appear in large capitals, the names of cities in roman characters, and those of villages in a running hand. The map, however, contains the typographic tension between regional and local places through the structural evenness of the geographic grid and borderlines. While the written names of concrete places and abstract political territories are located within the grid, the map orients its east-west, north-south base lines along the \"Meridian of Philadelphia.\" As cartographic and alphabetic signs become thus aligned with the nation's capital, the map's diversified symbolic code becomes a grammatical construct: it expresses American independence from England by providing a new baseline for imagining the nation's geographic framework.\n87cq | At the same time, it was the map's small-scale projection (it shows a relatively large area without attention to local detail) that invited readers to view the nation as a picture rather than a product of writing systems. Thick washes of watercolor marked the territorial outline of the nation's constitutive states, creating schematic images of the various states similar to today's didactic map puzzles in which color and shape rather than geographic content and location guide the student's memory. Some copies of the book map even included a thick trace of color marking the nation's external border line, thus presenting the image of the nation-\n0qs3 | state in the form of an iconographic symbol or hieroglyph, similar to modern cookie-cutter shapes or commercial logos.\nz8f7 | It was precisely the cartographic design of the nation's official borderline by which Morse imagined he could inscribe the student's visual memory and verbal literacy with the idea of the nation. Contemporaneous formulations of national ideologies, especially those by the German Johann Gottlieb Fichte, looked to the borderline rhetoric of the national map in order to unite a fragmented society under the rubric of a collective imaginary. Writing at a time when Germany (even under Napoleonic rule) looked like a puzzle on the political map, Fichte argued in his Reden an die deutsche Nation that for a people to become a nation the \"external frontiers\" of the state (however loosely defined, as body politic, civic union, or bureaucratic institution) must become the \"internal frontiers\" of the citizen. According to this formulation, the nation-state always began and ended with the cartographic line demarcating political boundaries. Through a self-fulfilling logic of dialectic reasoning, these boundary lines-once they were established-were deemed to be natural boundaries dividing traditionally established political territories. With the stroke of a mapmaker's pen, the line became a cognitive and disciplinary tool transposing local into national identities.\n7w7j | Like the Federalist language reformer Noah Webster, Morse sought to achieve a degree of national identity by aligning the overall practices of alphabetic training with geographical knowledge. Given the programmatic rethinking of elementary literacy instruction, the map became a product of alphabetic learning. Indeed, as the basic principles of literacy (the alphabet, representational sign systems, phonetics) became imbricated with basic principles of geography (notions of place, systems of measurement, taxonomic organization), the conventional words and verbal text were perceived through a geographic consciousness. By prefacing\n51vd | his textbook with a map of the new nation-state, Morse invariably coupled the map reader's desire for visual self-location to the textbook's otherwise verbal representation of political identities. Students following the reading protocol of the textbook map, then, learned not only to privilege the geographic dimension of the nation-state over representations of local places but also to superimpose the cartographic signs representing the union over the textbook's alphabetic notations describing the states. Thus, while Webster relied on the national map to Americanize the spelling and pronunciation of English words, Morse's map-reading lesson transformed the study of geography into a nationalistic spelling bee.",
