o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before.

qrvy | Previous and recent experimental studies [9, 10, 29, 64] have demonstrated that, unlike end stiffeners, intermediate stiffeners can also be one-sided in links with various lengths. The numerical study of Daneshmand and Hashemi [13] revealed that using one-sided stiffeners can reduce the rotation capacity of intermediate and long links, however, this reduction rarely decreases ymax below the code-specified rotation capacity. Furthermore, the reduction was reported to be more pronounced for links in the range of 1.8 < p < 2.2. Nevertheless, AISC 341-10 [3] permits the use of one-sided intermediate stiffeners for links with a depth of less than 635 mm. Malley and Popov [9] demonstrated that partial depth intermediate stiffeners can also be used in shear links, provided that a concrete slab properly restrains the top flange. However, as required by AISC 341-10 [3], it is more advisable to use full-depth intermediate stiffeners welded to the web and both flanges since these stiffeners can enhance the stability of the link against flange local buckling as well as against lateral torsional buckling [7, 64, 78].
pn9j | Recent tests and the probabilistic analysis of Bulic et al. [52] suggested the use of at least two couples of properly designed web stiffeners in short I-shaped links to achieve enough reliability according to Eurocode 0 [79] for the mean recurrence interval of 50 years.
1pmc | Richards and Uang [51] noticed during their numerical study that some of the intermediate links failed to achieve the rotation capacity predicted by the provisions, with a maximum difference of 11%. Similar observations were also reported by Arce [23]. Richards and Uang [51] attributed the issue to the intermediate stiffener spacing requirements of the AISC Seismic Provisions [3]. As stated earlier, Kasai and Popov [75] proposed their stiffener spacing formula for short links; however, the provisions extended its use to intermediate links, without accounting for the significant moment-shear interaction that is present in the web panels of these links. Thus, it was concluded by Richards and Uang [51] that the direct use of stiffener spacing requirements of short links may be unconservative for intermediate links.
5z6q | During a series of tests [23, 25, 26, 28] from 2002 to 2005 on A992 links, conducted at the University of Texas at Austin, another important issue was observed. Most of the specimens with p < 1.7 exhibited web fractures at the ends of the stiffener-to-web welds prior to any notable web buckling (Figure 3a). This was not consistent with the failure modes observed in the early studies of Popov and his colleagues (e.g. [6, 15, 18]) where web fracture occurred only after severe web buckling at locations of large deformations. The pre-buckling web fracture had also been reported previously by McDaniel et al. [24] during tests on large built-up links where it was attributed to the insufficient offset between the stiffener-to-web and the web-to-flange welds. It is also worth noting that in a number of more recent tests this type of failure mode has also been reported [14, 41]. Based on the test results, Okazaki and his colleagues [29, 31] have concluded that altering the applied loading history or the utilized stiffener detailing cannot change the link failure type from the web fracture mode. The test results however revealed that it is fruitful to terminate the stiffener-to-web weld at a distance not less than 5tw from the k-line of the link section. A clear correlation between the reduced material toughness in the k-area and the occurrence of link web fracture was not established [31]. In addition to the above findings, a new stiffener detailing was also reported by Okazaki and Engelhardt [31] which can delay web fracture and provide enhanced cyclic performance. This detail consists of two-sided intermediate
yeoh | stiffeners which are welded only to the flanges that restrain the web by sandwiching it. Additional research regarding this detail was deemed necessary by Okazaki and Engelhardt [31].
b8hf | In order to further investigate the cause of the recently observed pre-buckling web fracture failures, Chao et al. [80] conducted a detailed numerical study. Numerical results suggested that the web fractures are due to the high triaxial constraints that develop at the ends of the stiffener-to-web weld and the localized high plastic strains at these locations. Beneficial effects of welding stiffeners to both flanges, using two-sided intermediate stiffeners and avoiding large stiffener spacing were also mentioned. Similar observations were also reported in previous experimental studies [25, 31]. Chao et al. [80] also proposed a possible reason for the observed web fractures in the recent tests as opposed to the 1980s experiments. The new straightening process for structural shapes causes higher strength and reduced toughness in the k-area, along the full length of the rolled sections, unlike the old method which induced localized changes in the material properties due to work hardening. As explained by Chao et al. [80], the higher k-area strength in the new shapes prevents yielding in this region, and consequently, high plastic strains are developed in the adjacent web steel. These localized strains coupled with high stress triaxiality at the stiffener-to-web weld ends increase the possibility of ductile fracture initiation at the weld ends. Based on the numerical results, Chao et al. [80] proposed a single horizontal stiffener instead of multiple vertical stiffeners for short links and demonstrated its promising performance numerically. The sandwich stiffener detail proposed by Okazaki and Engelhardt [31] also performed well during the simulations [80].
hntf | Dusicka et al. [36] conducted experiments on isolated very short built-up I-shaped links with a different stiffener detailing in which the link web was constructed from low-yield-strength steel (with Fy of 100 MPa or 225 MPa) without any stiffeners. The test results revealed that, unstiffened links with stocky webs constructed from low-yield-strength steel can sustain extremely high cyclic rotation angles, of the order of 0.2 rad. As a result of such detailing, the failure mode was altered from that controlled by fracture at the ends of the stiffener-to-web weld to web tearing at the link end corners accompanied by web out-of-plane deformations in some cases. Bahrampoor and Sabouri-Ghomi [81] also studied the effect of using very low-yield-strength steel with Fy = 90 MPa in EBF links. Comparison between the results of one-story one-bay FE models with links constructed from regular
99fo | 18
y5r7 | and low strength steels revealed that the energy dissipation characteristics of links can be enhanced using unstiffened stocky webs constructed from very low-yield-strength steel.
lrry | The use of diagonal web stiffeners for shear links was studied both experimentally and numerically by Yurisman et al. [82]. Based on the results reported by these researchers it appears that the diagonal web stiffeners may provide an alternative to the commonly used vertical stiffener arrangement for short links; however, further research is essential. Chegeni and Mohebkhah [70] proposed new stiffener details for improvement of the rotation capacity of long links. Two details were suggested: placing an additional one-sided stiffener at a distance of 0.75bf from the link ends; and using small one-sided diagonal stiffeners between the end stiffener and the intermediate stiffener in long links. Results of the parametric study indicated that the latter detail is more effective in improving the rotation capacity and energy dissipation of long links. However, further experiments for validating the suggested details were deemed necessary [70].
hvhm | Ohsaki and Nakajima [83] investigated the optimization of stiffeners in I-shaped EBF links. These researchers used the heuristic Tabu Search algorithm for optimizing the locations and thicknesses of link stiffeners.
863b | Stiffener requirements for built-up box links were studied by Berman and Bruneau [45-49]. The use of end stiffeners for built-up box links was recommended similar to I-shaped links. However, results reported by Berman and Bruneau [48, 49] revealed that intermediate stiffeners are only required for shear links (p ≤ 1.6) in which the web depth-to-thickness (h/tw) ratio is greater than or equal to 0.64 /E/Fy. For shear links with lower h/tw ratios, flange buckling is the controlling failure mode, for which the presence of intermediate stiffeners is not effective. Berman and Bruneau [48, 49] also demonstrated that intermediate stiffeners are not beneficial in intermediate and long links where compressive local buckling of both webs and flanges controls the link performance. The required intermediate stiffener spacing for shear links with h/tw ≥ 0.64 JE/Fy has been determined by Berman and Bruneau [45] using a methodology similar to that used by Kasai and Popov [75] for I-shaped links.
fj24 | In the numerical and experimental investigations of Berman and Bruneau [48, 49] external stiffeners welded to webs and flanges were considered. However, as stated above, these stiffeners are not effective in controlling flange buckling. Thus, stiffeners welded to outsides of the link webs or located inside the box section and welded to the insides of the webs can be considered in practical applications.
uz3c | During the 2011 earthquakes in Christchurch, New Zealand, the first documented field fractures of EBF short links were recorded at the Christchurch hospital garage [84]. In some of the fractured links, unlike the correct detailing, the end stiffeners were not aligned with the brace flanges. This misalignment was speculated to be a probable reason for the observed fractures in the link flange and connection panel. Kanvinde et al. [84] performed in-depth numerical analyses to investigate the issue. Numerical results revealed that the misalignment had an influential effect in triggering the fractures; however, other factors, such as the imposed ground acceleration which was several times higher than the expected design value, also played a major role. The use of field-welded stiffeners and gusset plates for brace connections was suggested by Kanvinde et al. [84] for better fit-up. Another recent study by Imani and Bruneau [85] further confirmed that the severe stress concentration in the vicinity of the misalignment can initiate fracture and reduce the link rotation capacity significantly. The numerical results also demonstrated that correcting the misalignment by using a different brace section or, more conveniently, by relocating the end stiffeners can mitigate the problem [85].
d5bi | 3.3. Lateral Bracing
ba4l | Lateral torsional buckling (LTB) can have deteriorative effects on the cyclic performance of links. The lateral bracing requirements are intended to restraint the link against out-of-plane displacement and twist to ensure stable inelastic response [3]. Although lateral bracing was provided in earlier tests [4], the importance of proper link lateral bracing was fully understood during the tests of Manheim [86] on three-story prototypes in 1982, where LTB occurred in some test specimens. As a result, lateral bracing of link ends was suggested by Manheim [86] with moment connections between the lateral braces and the link ends to increase the torsional stiffness of the link. In 1989, Hjelmstad and
ffx8 | Lee [87] conducted an study to investigate the lateral buckling of beams in EBFs. Based on the experimental results of five tests on propped cantilever beams with different lateral bracing schemes at the link ends and a numerical parametric study, Hjelmstad and Lee [87] concluded that providing full rotational restraints at the link ends is essential. Furthermore, it was noted by these researchers that the forces imposed on the lateral braces were much higher than the traditionally used design load of 2% of the flange yield force, pllange. During the experimental study of Engelhardt and Popov [11, 64] on long links, strength degradation due to LTB of the link or the beam outside the link was reported for some specimens. These observations further emphasized the importance of providing strong and stiff lateral bracing at link ends. Similar to Hjelmstad and Lee [87], Engelhardt and Popov [11, 64, 88] also mentioned that the demand on link lateral braces is several times higher than the minimum load of 1.5% of pflange, considered in the 1980s design codes [12, 72]. A minimum load of 6% of pflange was suggested by these researchers for the design of lateral braces of short and long links. Furthermore, it was recommended that the lateral braces should frame into the link ends from only one side in order to prevent imposing excessive in-plane restraint to the link [11].
s6su | Based on the above research, the use of lateral braces at the link ends was required by the early EBF codes [12, 72, 73]. Similarly, AISC 341-10 [3] requires lateral bracing of both top and bottom flanges of I-shaped links at the link ends. The concrete slab may only provide restraint to the top flange [63, 64] and thus, explicit bracing of link ends is generally necessary.
y219 | The main advantage of built-up box links compared to I-shaped links is their significant resistance to LTB. Berman and Bruneau [47] demonstrated that lateral bracing at link ends is not necessary for typical built-up box links. This can be fruitful in cases where providing lateral bracing for links is not possible or not desired. For instance, lateral bracing of links adjacent to elevator cores or links used in bridge piers is generally cumbersome. Consequently, built-up box links are also referred to as self- stabilizing links [46].
06ht | 3.4. Connections
v3r2 | In EBF systems, brace-to-beam and link-to-column connections attracted particular research attention due to the high level of demands on these joints. Gusset plate buckling at the brace-to-beam connection was observed in the full-scale tests of Roeder et al. [89] and Foutch [90]. Engelhardt and Popov [11, 64] proposed and tested modified gusseted and directly welded brace-to-beam connections. Satisfactory results were reported for all of the proposed connection details; however, the directly welded connections were found to be more advantageous in controlling LTB of the beam segment outside the link. Considering that the braces are expected to remain essentially elastic during severe loadings, most of the ductility requirements which are required for braces of special CBFs are not mandatory for EBF braces and their connections, based on the AISC Seismic Provisions [3].
nv42 | Tests by Hjelmstad and Popov [6, 7], and Malley and Popov [9, 18] in the 1980s suggested that fully welded link-to-column connections can exhibit satisfactory behavior during severe loading scenarios. In these tests short links with different combinations of complete joint penetration (CJP) groove welds and fillet welds for the flanges and the web were considered. In contrast, details with welded flanges and bolted web connections tested by Malley and Popov [9, 18] showed significant bolt slippage which led to premature flange fractures.
