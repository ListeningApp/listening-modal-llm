The profession of occupational therapy is responding to changes in the health care system by expanding the contexts and models for service provision, typically referred to as emerging practice. As a pilot study, a survey was completed by one hundred seventy-four occupational therapists to gather information and opinions about emerging practice. Results indicated occupational therapists hold diverse perceptions about emerging practice settings and services as well as the role and significance of emerging practice within the profession. Occupational therapists engaged in emerging practice described numerous rewards and challenges inherent within the process of developing and delivering services. The findings indicate continued professional dialogue and research are needed to support the development and efficacy of occupational therapy services in emerging settings and roles.\nti7f | INTRODUCTION\noksu | The health care system in the United States is dynamic with continuous changes in policies, models of service delivery, and reimbursement systems. Ongoing challenges include the number of medically uninsured individuals in the United States at forty-five point seven million in two thousand seven, down slightly from forty-seven million in two thousand six, and those underinsured estimated at twenty-five million. As well, the management of chronic diseases among an increasingly aging population and the continual growth of health care expenditures at approximately six point seven percent annually further strain the existing system. During the nineteen seventies and nineteen eighties, philosophical and policy decisions began to shift the focus of health care away from the medical model to alternative models of care. Baum described these elements of change in the health care system as a \"progression from an institution-centered medical model, with treatment delivered episodically, to a community-based sociopolitical model, the goal of which is to plan or manage health care delivery.\" Accompanying the development of alternative and managed models of care is a stronger emphasis on wellness, health promotion, and disease prevention. Experts believe future changes will include larger, integrated care systems, an increasing focus on patient-centered care, the shift of procedures from hospitals to outpatient and home settings, and a continued emphasis on facilitating reimbursement for preventive care. This ongoing evolution compels health care professionals to examine their philosophy of services, current and future roles within the health care system, and methods for service delivery.\nwtow | The profession of occupational therapy experienced both challenges and opportunities brought about by these changes in the health care system. As an example, during the nineteen nineties, occupational therapy practitioners increasingly found their daily practice shaped by restrictive reimbursement policies and a decreasing availability of employment in medical settings. More recently, data show an increasing availability of occupational therapy positions nationwide with school systems, early intervention programs, and hospitals employing the majority of practitioners at fifty-two point six percent and a four percent annual growth in available positions in several regions of the country. Concurrently, the context for providing occupational therapy services began to expand beyond facility-based environments, such as rehabilitation programs and hospitals, to community-based and emerging practice settings.\no22k | These developments align with the call for occupational therapy practitioners to evaluate their roles and services in light of the philosophical foundations of the profession and the therapeutic goal of engagement in occupations for the promotion of health, well-being, and full participation in life.\nnwfz | The Centennial Vision outlines broad practice categories from which emerging practice may meet new and growing needs of communities and individuals. These categories are children and youth, health and wellness, productive aging, work and industry, and rehabilitation, disability, and participation. Examples of emerging practices within these categories include ergonomic consultation, driver rehabilitation and training, health promotion for aging communities at senior centers, welfare-to-work services, and life skills training at homeless shelters.\nnvfy | Although the provision of occupational therapy services in community-based settings is often a component of emerging practice, multiple settings and roles may be considered an emerging practice. However, it remains a limited area of practice for the profession as a whole. The results of a recent workforce and salary survey conducted by the AOTA showed few occupational therapy respondents reporting community at one point six percent or emerging practice settings at one point nine percent as their primary work setting. Because emerging practice is a relatively new development within the profession, its nature and significance to the profession is not clearly understood. Accordingly, the purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the characteristics of emerging practice prior to an exploration of the competencies for emerging practice.\nmror | METHODOLOGY\nzlxc | A written survey was developed for this study to answer the following questions. What is the nature of emerging practice today and what are its challenges and rewards? Survey research was chosen as the method to collect information from the population of occupational therapists in order to complete an initial description and exploration of the topic. Survey research provides information about a targeted population or sample at one point in time and in that respect can be considered cross-sectional. The written survey results offered preliminary information relevant to understanding and further investigating emerging practice.\nk0bw | Participants\naq5a | The population included occupational therapists who were current United States residents and initially certified for practice by the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy. The study sample was recruited using convenience and purposive sampling techniques. The sample comprised seven hundred occupational therapists who were current members of AOTA and who either identified the AOTA Home and Community Health or Education Special Interest Sections as their primary interest on their initial or renewing membership applications from nineteen ninety-nine to two thousand. These Sections were thought to include members with interest or expertise in emerging practice. Names and addresses of the Sections members were selected by the AOTA List Rental Service and purchased in electronic format. Each of the seven hundred therapists received a letter inviting them to participate in the study. The survey and a return envelope were also included in the packet. Institutional Review Board approval to conduct the study was obtained from Gonzaga University. Return of the survey form was considered voluntary consent to participate in the study.\nsc5y | Instrument",
