        "content": "0fpw | RESEARCH ARTICLE\ndqn8 | Stool-based Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in children at a teaching and referral hospital in Southwest Ethiopia\ncop0 | Abstract\nlhkq | Background\n82ju | Diagnosis of tuberculosis in children is challenging mainly due to the difficulty of obtaining respiratory specimen and lack of sensitive diagnostic tests. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert hereafter, for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis from stool specimen in children.\ny2qo | Methods\n1piq | A cross-sectional study was conducted among consecutively recruited children, less than fifteen years old, with presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis at Jimma Medical Center, Ethiopia. One pulmonary specimen, expectorated sputum or gastric aspirate, was collected from each participant and tested for tuberculosis by Xpert and Lowenstein-Jensen culture. In addition, one stool specimen per child was collected and tested by Xpert after a single step, centrifuge-free stool processing method adapted from KNCV TB Foundation. Diagnostic performance of Xpert was calculated with reference to Lowenstein-Jensen culture and to a composite reference standards comprising of confirmed tuberculosis, positive by Xpert or culture, and unconfirmed tuberculosis, clinical diagnosis with improvement after anti-tuberculosis treatment.\n7fqw | Results\nrhaz | A total of one hundred seventy-eight children were enrolled; one hundred fifty-two of whom had complete microbiological results. Overall, tuberculosis was diagnosed in thirteen point two percent of the children with presumptive tuberculosis. Of these, only ten had microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis, positive Xpert or culture, and the remaining ten were clinically diagnosed with positive response to anti-tuberculosis treatment and were classified as unconfirmed tuberculosis. Stool Xpert had sensitivity of one hundred percent and specificity of ninety-nine point three percent compared to culture; however, the sensitivity was\nwak1 | Xpert MTB/RIF for the diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis\nwtfz | decreased to fifty percent when compared to composite reference standards. The Xpert on gastric aspirate had sensitivity of seventy-seven point eight percent compared to culture and forty percent compared to composite reference standards.\nqy1i | Conclusions\n1k9e | The sensitivity of Xpert for stool sample is comparable to that for gastric aspirate. Stool sample is a potential alternative to pulmonary specimen in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in children using Xpert.\n5bjs | Background\nuodj | Tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death globally. Children account for eleven percent of the global disease burden with an estimated one point one million new childhood tuberculosis cases and two hundred five thousand pediatric tuberculosis deaths in twenty eighteen. Early detection of tuberculosis is critical for timely initiation of treatment but is challenging in children because of non-specific clinical presentations, difficulty of obtaining respiratory specimen and lack of sensitive diagnostic tests.\nk16v | Sputum specimen remains being the most frequently used clinical sample to confirm the diagnosis of tuberculosis microbiologically. However, in most cases, children are unable to expectorate sputum specimen and when sputum is available; the yield is expected to be poor because of the paucibacillary nature of childhood tuberculosis. As a result, specimen obtained through different procedures such as induced sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, and gastric aspirate have been studied to improve the sensitivity of microbiological examinations. Though these procedures are well tolerated in adults, they are relatively uncomfortable for children, and the capability to carry out these procedures may be lacking in many tuberculosis endemic settings. Thus, there is a need for non-sputum based specimen to diagnose tuberculosis in children who are unable to expectorate sputum.\nb2lm | Stool is an alternative specimen for tuberculosis diagnosis, because Mycobacterium tuberculosis can be swallowed with the sputum and detected in stool. In particular, stool is easy to obtain from infants and young children who are unable to produce sputum. The introduction of Xpert has revolutionized the diagnosis of tuberculosis and the World Health Organization has endorsed Xpert for the diagnosis of tuberculosis from various types of specimen such as sputum, lymph node tissue and aspirate, cerebrospinal fluid, gastric lavage and aspirate. Recently, studies evaluating Xpert for detection of pulmonary tuberculosis from stool have been published with highly variable sensitivities, ranging from thirty-two percent to eighty-three point three percent. In Ethiopia, there is a paucity of data on the diagnostic performance of Xpert on stool specimen for children who are unable to expectorate sputum. Therefore, this study is aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Xpert for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis from stool specimen in children with presumptive tuberculosis.\nti7f | Materials and methods\noksu | Study design and setting\nwtow | An institution-based cross-sectional study was carried out among consecutively recruited children, less than fifteen years old, with presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis at Jimma University Medical Center, Ethiopia between March and November twenty nineteen. The study area is located in Jimma Zone, Oromia Regional State in Southwest part of Ethiopia. Jimma town is located three hundred fifty-seven kilometers away from Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. Jimma University Medical Center, located in Jimma town, is one of\no22k | Xpert MTB/RIF for the diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis\nnwfz | the oldest public hospitals in the country. Jimma University Medical Center is a teaching and referral hospital that provides services for about fifteen million people in its catchment area. Each year, Jimma University Medical Center reports serving approximately fifteen thousand inpatient hospital stays, one hundred sixty thousand outpatient visits, and eleven thousand emergency department visits. Most of the patients getting services at the center are from rural area. According to World Health Organization twenty twenty-one report, Ethiopia is among the thirty countries with high tuberculosis and tuberculosis or HIV burden, with an estimated annual incidence of one hundred fifty-one thousand cases and an estimated nineteen thousand tuberculosis-related deaths excluding HIV associated tuberculosis deaths.\nnvfy | Study participants\nmror | Participants were children aged less than fifteen years presenting with a chronic cough of more than two weeks, weight loss, loss of appetite, persistent fever without an apparent cause, night sweats, or history of close contact with a tuberculosis patient within the preceding twelve months. They were classified as the presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis patients. Participants were excluded, if they had an already confirmed tuberculosis, had been on anti-tuberculosis treatment for more than seventy-two hours before enrollment and clinical symptoms or physical signs suggestive of extrapulmonary tuberculosis.\nzlxc | Study procedures\nk0bw | Children up to fifteen years of age were screened for tuberculosis and those presumptive tuberculosis cases were enrolled into this study. Tuberculosis screening was done as per standard of care, which mainly relies on self-reporting of symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis, cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss and history of close contact with tuberculosis patients. Study subjects were diagnosed with confirmed tuberculosis based on positive microbiological test results, positive Lowenstein-Jensen culture and positive Xpert on gastric aspirate or sputum or with unconfirmed tuberculosis based on a clinical diagnosis and positive response to anti-tuberculosis treatment. Some of the patients with negative microbiologic results were given empirical treatment based on the evaluation by the treating clinicians and were evaluated for response to treatment, resolution of symptoms, weight gain, and radiographic improvement after two months. Demographic data and clinical information of the participants were collected through structured questionnaires. Clinical data such as radiologic findings, clinical improvement after anti-tuberculosis treatment, HIV status, nutritional status, and BCG vaccination status were obtained from the participants' medical records.\naq5a | Specimen collection and laboratory procedures",
