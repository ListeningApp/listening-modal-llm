You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

In an arti- cle titled "Climate Trauma: Towards a New Taxonomy of Traumatology," he writes:
yskz | Climate Trauma is an ever-present existential threat with a bevy of constant cognitive reminders-melting ice caps; eroding shorelines; waves of homeless refugees; the ravaging storms, floods, and fires broadcast into our homes 24/7; and the constant roll-call of disappearing species, vanishing rain forests, and dying coral reefs. There are certain things in life that we cannot "unsee," and Climate Trauma indelibly stamps our consciousness in that way, fundamentally altering the way we see the world and our place in it.38
1y6b | Not everyone is currently or directly in harm's way of natural disasters, but many of us still experience climate trauma or a preoccupied attachment to the earth by liv- ing in daily anxiety about the state of our water, air pollution, the state of forests, the loss of biodiversity and the extinction of animal species, just to name a few. For one of my clients, the bulk of our therapy has revolved around her environ- mental anxiety and its impact on every area of her life. When she wakes up every day, she looks through her window to what she sees as a world in peril. She is per- sonally pained by the manifold ways that humans are mistreating the planet. Even though she has everything she needs on a physical level, she often tells me that "If the environment isn't OK, then I'm just not OK." She feels intensely unsafe and unstable living in a world where a natural disaster could occur at any time, and where the future sustainability of human life seems so precarious. This particular client illuminated for me how the current state of the earth has changed the way in which some people orient to their personal future and even their individual sense of purpose. Where for many it appears to be a given truth that we are working to- wards a better future for the next generations, infusing our individual life with a larger sense of meaning, for this client the future was no longer something secure
ihhb | that she could hang her sense of meaning and fulfillment on.
xvgt | Another client of mine always felt a strong sense that the meaning of his life had everything to do with becoming a father. Ever since he could remember he de- sired to be a dad, seeing parenthood as his greatest contribution to this life. When he learned more about global issues such as overpopulation and food scarcity, it seriously called into question whether having a child made sense for him anymore. His concern for the environment ignited a personal identity crisis as he contem- plated who he would be and what he would do if having children no longer seemed viable or wise from an environmental perspective. His worry for the planet created a state of constant urgency in his internal nervous system and hypervigilance that disrupted his work and marriage.
k2yr | With both of these clients, I found that by treating their attachment anxiety with the environment the same way I would work with relational attachment trauma, they were both able to rebuild an inner sense of safety and security. Each of them developed a larger felt sense of trust in the wisdom and support that the earth has to offer, while also feeling more empowered, rather than overwhelmed or compla- cent, about their environmental efforts.
y5vm | Finally, in talking about the global level, it is also extremely important to high- light collective trauma. This is the traumatic impact that happens to societies over multiple generations when experiences including slavery, genocide, famine, war or the subjugation of women occur. The individuals who experience these events are undeniably impacted, but the effect also transcends the individual, altering the course of the world in unfathomable and incalculable ways. Thomas Hubl is the cofounder of the The Pocket Project, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the healing of collective trauma. He posits that we currently exist in a traumatized col- lective and the main symptom of being in a traumatized world is that we feel sepa- rate from each other, from the world, from spirit and from the natural world as a whole.39 These symptoms are not just present in the collective or even individual psyches, but can become evident through actual changes in our genetic expres- sion. Unresolved trauma from previous generations can alter the expression of
graj | DNA, making subsequent generations more susceptible to certain health issues, in- creased anxiety, PTSD and wariness to danger. This means that certain mental health or physical symptoms that you are experiencing today at the self level may have actually been inherited from collective traumas that your ancestors went through generations ago.
stgo | con
r4hn | Traumas arise in many forms over multiple generations and how each person and their nervous system responds to the very same incident can vary greatly in degree. Trauma and attachment wounds separate us from feeling safe and secure, and left unaddressed they can create serious impairments in our ability to connect, re- spond or even function. All of these levels can cause threats, ruptures and viola- tions that activate the attachment system. This means that each level has the potential to impact how safe we feel in our bodies, with others and in the world at large. Living in regular chaos, fear or uncertainty is not conducive to secure attach- ment. At each separate level we can look at a potential trauma occurring at that level and see how it then permeates to all of the levels above and below. Traumas that continue to occur at the levels of culture, society and the collective cannot en- tirely be healed by the individual, but that does not mean that they are beyond cleansing and repair at the self and relationship levels where we do have more power to take responsibility for our own healing. As I've already alluded to, healing is available to all of us at these different levels too. When ruptures occur at one level, we can focus our healing on that specific level, but we must also utilize the repair and respite that the other levels have to offer us-whether through self- compassion, a warm embrace from a loved one, a home where we can relax, being acknowledged and accepted within a community, receiving legal rights or benefits that were previously denied, or a quiet walk in nature to restore our inner equi- librium.
7nts | Part Two
68kv | Now that we have become more familiar with attachment theory and trauma, we will use Part Two to become better acquainted with consensual nonmonogamy. This section will address what consensual nonmongamy is, what attachment re- search has to say about nonmonogamy, why understanding attachment is partic- ularly important for people practicing nonmonogamy, and how attachment rup- tures and traumas can occur at multiple levels of the nested model of attachment and trauma when a person is nonmonogamous.
0b1o | CHAPTER FOUR CONSENSUAL NONMONOGAMY
xogx | WE ARE LIVING IN A TIME OF NOTABLE CHANGE. Since change is the only constant, we could probably say that about any time in history, but over the last several decades, multiple established beliefs and deeply rooted cultural and societal prac- tices have shifted. This includes attitudes towards race, class, gender and sexuality. While these societal revisions are far from complete and there is still much room for improvement, over the past 50 years or so marginalized groups have received more access, acknowledgment, justice and rights than previously granted in West- ern history. These necessary changes have come from the courageous and sus- tained efforts of the oppressed. Many people, known and unknown, have sacrificed their personal safety, their own freedoms and even their lives for the collective.
