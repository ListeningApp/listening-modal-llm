        "content": "0lfu | The Jean Charcot troughs in the northern New Hebrides, Vanuatu-Solomon Islands, constitute one of the youngest back arcs in the world, forming only approximately four million years ago in response to eastward subduction and rollback of the Indo-Australian plate beneath the Pacific plate. Unlike the simple graben morphologies of other young back-arc rifts, such as the Coriolis troughs to the south, back-arc extension in the Jean Charcot troughs is characterized by a complex series of horst-and-graben structures that are widely spaced up to approximately one hundred twenty kilometers from the arc front and have variable orientations. Seafloor depths range from approximately eight hundred to three thousand six hundred meters below sea level, and individual grabens range from twenty to sixty-five kilometers long and five to fifteen kilometers wide. The Jean Charcot troughs are bound to the south by the Hazel Holme fracture zone, a seismically active ridge that is considered to be an extensional zone related to the opening of the North Fiji basin. A second east-west-trending extensional zone, Tikopia fracture zone, occurs north of the Hazel Holme fracture zone. Like the Hazel Holme fracture zone, the Tikopia fracture zone displays a slow-spreading trough morphology to depths of approximately four thousand two hundred meters below sea level east of Tikopia Island. To the west of this island, the presence of volcanic ridges and aligned seamounts suggests that the basement structure that controls the location of volcanic activity extends at least as far as the volcanic arc. Where the Tikopia fracture zone crosses the back-arc region, there is a notable bathymetric high, interpreted to be recent volcanic complexes that obscure the horst-and-graben morphology of the back arc. The Jean Charcot troughs are separated from the North Fiji basin by the West Tikopia Ridge and the Duff Ridge, which are interpreted to be part of the prerift fossil volcanic arc. There is no consensus on the northern extent of the Jean Charcot troughs, although here we consider these to include the northwest-southeast-trending trough between the Duff Ridge and the Reef Islands. The current rate of extension of the\ncnjl | Mineralization and alteration of the Tinakula S.M.S. deposit\nrtdl | troughs increases northward from thirty-six to fifty-five millimeters per year to seventy to eighty-one millimeters per year; however, this extension may be distributed over the entire width of the back arc, in which case individual troughs could be opening much more slowly.\nnorp | High-resolution, fifty meters or better, regional bathymetric data are lacking, and most of the region is unexplored, particularly in the north. The first indication of hydrothermal venting in the Jean Charcot troughs was a methane anomaly detected in the water column near the Starfish seamount during the KAIYO eighty-nine cruise. This anomaly was investigated on the SOLAVENTS cruise, which recovered fresh and\nchx3 | Research cruises in the late nineteen-eighties to early nineteen-nineties provided most of the geochemical data that we now have for the Jean Charcot troughs, but\nsfcf | Bathymetry",
