You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

c3lz | A number of recent studies have focused on the optimization of EBF systems. In 2013, Gong et al. [183] presented a genetic algorithm based structural optimization technique for EBFs. A successful application of this optimization method was demonstrated for a hypothetical three-story EBF building; however, this came with the cost of an excessive computational burden (of the order of days). In a more recent study, Karami Mohammadi and Sharghi [184] developed an optimum design technique for EBFs based on the concept of uniform deformation theory. These researchers applied the method to three-, five-, and ten-story EBFs and demonstrated that the optimized EBFs have lower weights and better seismic performances compared to those of regularly designed EBFs.
8bwk | There are also a limited number of studies regarding the effect of concrete slabs on the structural response of EBF systems. In 2013, Danku et al. [185] investigated the issue in three EBFs and three dual EBFs with four, eight, and twelve stories through nonlinear static (pushover) analyses as well as IDA considering seven earthquake records. The models were calibrated using the outcomes of a companion experimental study [37]. The numerical results revealed that composite action can increase the system stiffness and reduce the structural drifts and rotation demands on links and lead to a more
ez9s | optimum EBF design. For the case of dual EBFs, inelastic action was reported to be mainly concentrated in the links. Furthermore, the R factor for the steel EBFs and the steel dual EBFs was found to be about 6.0 (similar to Eurocode 8 [137]); however, a lower R factor (between 3.5 to 6.0) was reported when composite action was incorporated in the models. Prinz and de Castro-e-Sousa [186] also investigated the effect of concrete slabs on the EBF behavior in 2014. Two three-story EBFs with and without concrete slabs were modeled via FE method. The results of dynamic analyses under two earthquake accelerations confirmed the findings of Danku et al. [185] regarding the effects of concrete slabs on stiffness, inter-story drifts, and rotation demands of EBFs, especially for the case with long links, where a reduction of 35% was reported in the residual drifts because of composite action. Although the link rotation demands were lower in the composite models, Prinz and de Castro- e-Sousa [186] observed that the link damage accumulation was rather independent of the presence of concrete slabs. This increase of plastic demand in the composite models was attributed to the shift in the neutral axis which in turn produced higher strains in the bottom flanges of the links.
mqot | 6. Special Topics
oc99 | Beside the topics covered in the previous sections, some special and emerging topics related with EBF systems are also available in the literature, and these are briefly discussed here.
gipz | 6.1. EBFs with Vertical Links
b4wj | Although one of the earliest experimental studies on EBFs was conducted on frames with vertical links (also known as inverted Y-braced EBFs; Figure 1d) by Tanabashi et al. [2] in 1974, the use of horizontal links in EBFs has become more popular through the years. Compared to their horizontal counterpart, vertical links have an easier post-earthquake repair process. In addition, they can be conveniently used for the seismic rehabilitation of existing structures. Furthermore, their use can be advantageous in cases where the floor girders are required to remain elastic due to the presence of very large gravity loads. On the other hand, proper lateral bracing of vertical links can be difficult in certain cases. Early static, cyclic, and dynamic loading experiments by Seki et al. [187] and Vetr [188] on
5xlt | single- and multi-story EBFs with vertical shear links revealed that this system can exhibit a very ductile and stable behavior during an intense loading, provided that proper lateral bracing for the link ends is available. The results of a numerical study by Fehling et al. [189] in 1992 further emphasized the importance of lateral bracing for vertical links. A force equal to 1/50 of the link shear force was deemed adequate for the design of these lateral braces. In a subsequent study by Bouwkamp and Vetr [190] a relation for limiting the length ratio of short (or shear) vertical links was proposed which was dependent upon the ratio of the link end moments.
9bz4 | The advantages of hybrid vertical links with low strength web and high strength flanges were demonstrated by Shinabe and Takahashi [191] in 1995. Similarly, the FE analyses of Saedi Daryan et al. [192] revealed that utilizing vertical links constructed from very low-yield-strength steel with Fy of about 100 MPa could increase the energy dissipation of an EBF notably while reducing the probability of local buckling.
yfv2 | The concept of EBFs with double vertical links, originally mentioned by Fehling et al. [189], was recently investigated numerically as well as experimentally by Shayanfar et al. [193, 194] and promising results were reported. This concept can be advantageous in cases where the dimensional limitations of the floor beam in an existing structure do not allow the use of a single large-size vertical link for seismic rehabilitation.
pujl | Through extensive nonlinear static and dynamic analyses, Dicleli and Mehta [195, 196] investigated the behavior of EBFs with vertical shear links built from compact HP sections. Results revealed that such systems can combine the advantages of MRFs and CBFs during an earthquake while experiencing less damage and eliminating the negative aspects of each system.
3rqe | In 2012, Shayanfar et al. [197] tested a composite vertical shear link in which a steel link was partially encased in reinforced concrete. Results revealed that the concrete in these links can delay the web buckling and increase the shear strength and energy dissipation of the specimens significantly. Nevertheless, the behavior of the composite link coincided with that of the bare steel link when the concrete portion was fully damaged at later stages of the loading.
nsi3 | A novel two-stage seismic load resisting system was developed by Zahrai and Vosooq [198] in 2013 which combined an EBF system with vertical shear links with a knee braced frame. During a
nil3 | moderate earthquake, only the vertical links dissipate energy while in the case of a strong ground motion, the plastic deformations in the vertical links are limited to a certain extent using a mechanical stopper device and further frame drift causes yielding in the knee elements.
68a1 | Shayanfar et al. [199] developed a performance-based plastic design (PBPD) methodology for EBFs with vertical links similar to the design methodology proposed previously by Chao and Goel [158, 159] for EBFs with horizontal links. Based on the approach developed by Mastrandrea et al. [147-150], a rigid-plastic analysis and design approach for EBFs with vertical links was developed by Montuori et al. [200, 201] in 2014 which included moment-shear interaction and aimed to prevent local and partial mechanisms while ensuring formation of a desired global collapse mechanism.
seik | In a recent numerical study by Massah and Dorvar [202], the analysis and design of EBFs with vertical shear links and shape memory alloy (SMA) devices were investigated. The SMA material can recover its original shape even after very large strains through the shape memory effect (which requires heating) and the superelasticity effect (which requires unloading). In this study, SMA devices were mounted on sides of the vertical links to obtain a reversible system with reduced residual deformations.
