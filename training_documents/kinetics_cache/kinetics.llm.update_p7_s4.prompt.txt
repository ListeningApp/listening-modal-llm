You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

gxfd | The hierarchical statistical model developed here can give a mechanistic interpretation for Unique Molecular Iden- tifiers (UMIs) based on scRNA-seq data. In fact, this model not only captured the characteristics of transcrip- tional burst kinetics and feedback regulations, but also de- scribed the measured noise of UMIs data (see 'Materials and Methods'). Then, we used the maximum likelihood method to determine burst kinetics and feedback forms (positive-, negative-, non-feedback) within biologically rea- sonable ranges of model parameters. Note that the infer- ences with traditional MCMC methods (50) would need huge and even unaffordable computational costs since the static mRNA distribution was expressed in a high-order in- tegral that is difficult to solve. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a fast algorithm for computing this distribu- tion based on generalized Gauss-Laguerre quadrature rules, thus realizing a scalable genome-wide inference (51) (see 'Materials and Methods').
s2v1 | To evaluate the validity of our inference method, we first explored the sensitivity of distribution shapes to changes in model parameters. We found that the genes with high expression levels were more sensitive to model parameters than the other genes (Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). Then, to test the reliability of the method in inferring kinetic parameters, we generated synthetic single-cell RNA data by stochastic sampling from the distribution for the hierar- chical model with known parameter values. Through infer- ence using the synthetic data, we can give robust estimates of burst frequencies, burst sizes, and feedback forms from the corresponding static mRNA distributions (Supplemen- tary Figure S4-S6). Besides, we also assessed the robust- ness of our inference method to different cell numbers and stochastic losses of mRNA molecules (mimicking the in- complete mRNA detection in scRNA-seq protocols) (Sup- plementary Figures S4b-c, S5b-c and S6b-c). Overall, we provided a mechanistic model and an effective, robust and scalable inference method for learning dynamic burst kinet- ics and feedback forms from static snapshot data, which can be conveniently used in the analysis of scRNA-seq data.
jkp9 | Next, we applied our hierarchical model and inference approach to the scRNA-seq data of primary mouse fibrob- lasts (16). From the original UMIs data containing 10727 genes and 224 cells, we selected 2162 highly expressed genes using a quality control method and then merged two al- lelic expression data into a matrix to infer burst kinetics and feedback forms. We observed that these selected genes were transcribed with widely different burst kinetics (68), and in particular, those genes with the same average expres- sion level exhibited diverse burst kinetics, implying that the expressions of different genes were regulated possibly by dif- ferent molecular mechanisms (Figure 2A). To check the va- lidity of these inferred results, we performed a goodness-of- fit test (see 'Materials and Methods'). We found that the dis- tributions from the dataset were consistent with those ob- tained using the inferred parameters (Supplementary Fig-
z8tt | ure S7a), and confirmed that the mRNA mean and vari- ability in the mechanistic model matched those in the data (Supplementary Figure S7b). All the good-fit genes can be classified into three categories: 626 positive-feedback genes, 625 negative-feedback genes, and 840 non-feedback genes. The inferred results for example genes: Mbnl2, Prr13, Ralb, and Plod1 were demonstrated in Figure 2a1-a4, showing that these genes had different feedback forms and followed different distributions. Interestingly, our hierarchical model can particularly recover bimodal distributions from static data, which however were fitted as unimodal distributions via the telegraph model without feedback (69) (e.g. the dis- tribution of the Mbnl2 gene as shown in Figure 2a1 and more genes as shown in Supplementary Figure S8). In ad- dition, we compared the inferred results between our hier- archical model and the telegraph model, finding that both models captured almost the same gene-expression variabil- ity (CV2, Figure 2B) while keeping high correlations be- tween burst frequencies and burst sizes (Figure 2C, D, P- value < 2.2 x 10-16). Notably, we found that the forms of dynamic feedback regulations can lead to different burst ki- netics on a genome-wide scale but cannot be inferred by pre- vious methods (Figure 2C, D) (16,43).
