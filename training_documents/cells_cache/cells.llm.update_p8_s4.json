        "content": "wak1 | Proteomics studies using advanced mass spectrometry have identified numerous flow-sensitive proteins that are differentially expressed or post-translationally modified in endothelial cells in response to flow. Analyses of secreted media (secretome) of endothelial cells show that disturbed flow alters the levels of hundreds of proteins, including ANGPT two and endothelin one. A study to determine proteome-wide S-sulfhydration changes of reactive cysteines (S-sulfhydrome) in endothelial cells in response to pro-atherogenic conditions in vitro and in vivo identified hundreds of flow-sensitive S-sulfhydrated proteins, including integrins, which have an important role in the flow-dependent vascular relaxation response. A metabolomics study using plasma samples from Apoe knockout mice subjected to PCL surgery showed that disturbed flow induces significant changes in the levels of hundreds of metabolites, including sphingomyelin and the amino acids methionine and phenylalanine. However, the causal effects of flow-dependent changes in metabolites have not been clearly defined in vivo and further investigation is warranted. The targets identified by omics approaches and their roles in endothelial cell dysfunction and in atherosclerosis are summarized in Table one.\nwtfz | Disturbed-flow-induced reprogramming of endothelial cells\nqy1i | Early transcriptomic and epigenomic studies used mouse bulk RNA and DNA samples obtained from pooled endothelial cells collected by carotid flushing after PCL surgery. The findings from these\n1k9e | studies helped to establish flow-dependent changes in transcriptomic and DNA methylation patterns in endothelial cells in a genome-wide and epigenome-wide manner. However, although these results revealed a definitive list of genes with reduced expression in endothelial cells in response to disturbed flow, identifying genes that are increased under disturbed flow conditions in the PCL model has been difficult. The reason for this dilemma is that disturbed flow induces endothelial cell inflammation and accumulation of other cell types, especially immune cells, in the subendothelial layer, thereby causing substantial contamination of the endothelium-enriched luminal-flushing samples. Therefore, it was difficult to discern whether the increased expression of any gene of interest originated from the endothelial cells or from the contaminating immune cells and VSMCs. To address the difficulty in identifying flow-sensitive genes in endothelial cells, our group carried out scRNA-seq and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq).\n5bjs | scRNA-seq enables the study of transcriptional changes at a genome-wide scale at single-cell resolution. scRNA-seq quantifies each gene transcript, both unspliced precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) and mature, spliced messenger RNA (mRNA), in each cell, providing insights into gene transcript expression profiles and dynamic cellular status. The results show each gene transcript quantity in every cell, while the pre-mRNA and mRNA levels can be used for trajectory inference analysis, such as pseudotime analysis or RNA velocity analysis. scATAC-seq assays reveal genome-wide epigenomic changes in chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution, providing data on gene cis-regulatory elements including enhancers, nucleosome positions and transcription factor binding sites. Integration of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq analyses provides additional independent validation and comparison of gene transcript levels and epigenomic regulatory profiles for each gene, adding another layer of confidence to the data analysis.\nuodj | Our study of single cells obtained from LCAs (exposed to disturbed flow for two days or two weeks) and RCAs (exposed to stable flow for two days or two weeks) in the same mice after PCL surgery enabled the identification of differential transcriptomic and epigenomic changes in endothelial cells and other cell types, in a flow-dependent and time-dependent manner. The scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq results independently showed that disturbed flow induced dynamic changes in cell composition in the mouse carotid arteries in a time-dependent manner. The comparison and integration of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data showed remarkable concordance, demonstrating the reproducibility and validity of each dataset. Each individual cell in these datasets was assigned a specific cell type based on the expression of cell type-specific canonical marker genes. The carotid arteries contained eight endothelial cell clusters, four monocyte-macrophage clusters, one cluster of VSMCs, one of fibroblasts, one of dendritic cells and one of T cells, all varying in terms of cell identity and number in a flow-dependent and time-dependent manner. Most interestingly, carotid artery endothelial cells are heterogeneous and dynamic in response to flow. In the RCA exposed to the healthy stable flow condition, four endothelial cell subclusters (E1-E4) were identified and remained unchanged over time. However, in the LCA exposed to the pro-atherogenic disturbed flow condition, most of the healthy endothelial cell subclusters (E2-E4) were nearly lost, whereas new endothelial cell subclusters (E6 and E8) emerged. In addition, few VSMCs were found in the RCA intima, but disturbed flow increased the VSMC numbers in the LCA, as expected. Fibroblasts were found in both the LCA and RCA, with the highest number found in the LCA in the two-day disturbed flow condition. Although monocyte and macrophage\noksu | clusters were rare in the RCA, the LCA had dramatically increased numbers of monocytes and macrophages, reflecting substantial pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic vascular changes in response to disturbed flow. Like macrophages, few dendritic cells and T cells were present in the RCA but their numbers were increased by disturbed flow in the LCA.\nwtow | Differential gene expression and gene ontology analyses showed that disturbed flow induces numerous changes that favour pro-atherogenic responses in endothelial cells. To understand the potential underlying mechanisms by which disturbed flow induces endothelial cell phenotype changes, eight different endothelial cell clusters were analysed for their differential gene expression and gene ontology. As expected, the prototypical healthy endothelial cell clusters (E2) expressed the highest levels of the two best known mechanosensitive genes, Klf2 and Klf4, and the expression of these genes was significantly lower in endothelial cell clusters exposed to disturbed flow, such as the\no22k | prototypical E8 in the LCA. Disturbed flow induced the expression of genes in the E8 cluster of endothelial cells that were also found to be highly expressed in VSMCs (Acta2 and Tagln), fibroblasts (Dcn1) and immune cells (Cd74, H2-Eb1, H2-Aa and H2-Ab1), indicating potential EndMT and acquisition of immune cell-like features by endothelial cells under the disturbed flow condition. Comparison of the differentially expressed genes between the stable flow-exposed E2 and disturbed flow-exposed E8 clusters by Panther gene ontology analysis showed that disturbed flow induces many well-known biological processes associated with pro-atherogenic pathways, including inflammation, EndMT, apoptosis, angiogenesis and endothelial permeability. A pseudotime trajectory analysis and additional differential gene expression and chromatin accessibility analyses confirmed that E8 cells express higher levels of marker genes for EndMT (Acta2, Cnn1, Snail and Tagln) and EndIT (C1qa, C1qb, C5ar1 and Tnf) than E2 cells. The evidence for EndMT and EndIT was further validated by immunofluorescence",
