You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

b3bt | General Kinetic Model for pH Dependence of Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer: Application to an Electrochemical Water Oxidation System
0w8m | INTRODUCTION
vcu3 | Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions are ubiquitous and crucial steps in chemical, biological, and catalytic processes. Understanding the mechanistic details of PCET reactions can allow control of these processes. A powerful mechanistic probe is the pH dependence of PCET reaction rates in aqueous solution. For example, a pH- independent apparent rate constant often indicates either a sequential mechanism with rate-limiting electron transfer (ET) or a concerted mechanism with H2O as the proton donor or acceptor." If the apparent rate constant k increases or decreases 10-fold per pH unit, H3O+ or OH are often assumed to be the sole proton donor or acceptor, and a plot of logk versus pH should have a slope of ±1. However, in several studies, a much weaker pH dependence of the PCET apparent rate constant has been observed. These examples include the homogeneous oxidation of tyrosine13-15 and tryptophan, 16-18 as well as the interfacial reduction of Ru-based water oxidation catalysts."" However, an explanation for these weak pH dependencies remains elusive. Herein, we will show that the weak pH dependence of some PCET reactions can be explained in terms of a competition among multiple mechanisms.
hjzj | The idea of competing reactions has a long history in the PCET literature. 12,20-23 Laviron developed a model to
j79f | describe the pH dependence of the apparent standard rate constant for stepwise, electrochemical PCET reactions.20 In this model, the competition between two ET reactions involving the protonated or deprotonated redox species is considered. The resulting pH-dependent standard rate constant has two plateaus at low and high pH limits connected by a V-shape curve. In the intermediate pH region, the rate constant first decreases due to the depletion of the protonated form and then increases due to the growing contribution from the deprotonated form, resulting in the V-shape curve. This model was then generalized by Finklea2 to stepwise multi- proton multi-electron PCET reactions. In addition to the stepwise case, recently, the Surendranath group developed a model that considers the competition between two concerted pathways with different proton donors on a graphitic conjugated catalyst interface. The predicted pH-dependent apparent standard rate constant also has a V-shape, which
6tbv | agrees with the experimental results. All of these models were developed for electrochemical PCET reactions and rely on the Butler-Volmer equation.24,25 Furthermore, Costentin and co- workers developed competing reaction-based pH-dependent models for homogeneous PCET reactions with water as the proton donor or acceptor."2 Their work discussed various cases, such as the competition between concerted pathways with proton transfer within a local water cluster or directly to bulk solvent, the competition between concerted and stepwise pathways, and reactions involving buffer.
xb13 | In this paper, we introduce a general, multichannel kinetic model to describe the pH dependence of homogeneous and heterogeneous PCET. This model yields a general expression for the pH-dependent apparent rate constants of both homogeneous PCET in solution and electrochemical PCET. The core concept of this model is that several ET and PCET channels are accessible and actively contribute to the overall PCET process. The contribution of each channel is strongly influenced by the relative populations of the different forms of the redox species (i.e., protonated or deprotonated and various hydrogen-bonded complexes with the proton donor or acceptor). These populations, described by the mole fractions, are pH-dependent and therefore lead to a complex dependence of the apparent rate constants on pH. Furthermore, we employ this model to describe experimentally measured pH-dependent kinetic data for a representative interfacial electrochemical PCET reaction, namely, reduction of a Ru-based water oxidation catalyst attached to a tin-doped In2O3 (ITO) surface."" Our model explains the origins of the previously observed weak pH dependence of PCET for this system using physically meaningful parameters. Moreover, our model's predicted behavior for a wider pH range is then confirmed by additional experiments. This example highlights the importance of considering all possible reaction channels instead of just the dominant channel when analyzing experimental PCET kinetic data. Although this application focuses on electrochemical PCET, a future study will focus on applications of this kinetic model to homogeneous PCET systems.
cxqi | THEORY
qfmx | We use the four-channel model shown in Figure 1 as a typical example. Derivations for the general cases are provided in the Supporting Information. In our model, both the oxidized and reduced species can exist in protonated and deprotonated forms: Ox, OxH+, Red", and RedH. These species can be converted to each other via electron transfer (ET) and proton transfer (PT) to or from an external source. The edges of the square diagram in Figure 1 represent sequential ETPT or PTET pathways, and the diagonals of this diagram represent the concerted electron-proton transfer (EPT) pathways.26-29 Herein, the term PCET encompasses both sequential and concerted mechanisms, and the term EPT indicates concerted PCET. Assuming that buffer ions do not participate in the concerted pathways, either a hydronium ion H3O+ or a water molecule can serve as the proton donor for the reduction reaction, and either a water molecule or a hydroxide ion OH can serve as the proton acceptor for the oxidation reaction. If H3O+ or OH is the proton donor or acceptor in the concerted mechanism, the redox species must first form a hydrogen- bonded complex with the ion. These hydrogen-bonded complexes are denoted as {Ox ... H3O+} and {RedH ... OH }. The formation of these complexes is shown with black double
rut3 | arrows in Figure 1, requiring the displacement of a water molecule by either H3O+ or OH. On the other hand, if water is the proton donor or acceptor in the concerted mechanism, these additional hydrogen bond formation steps are not needed because the complexes with water are already formed upon solvation.
m3cp | Next, we explicitly write the chemical reactions shown in Figure 1. For the remainder of this paper, we use the following convention. For ET, PT, and complex formation reactions, water is considered as a solvent, and the notation {X ... H2O} is dropped. For concerted EPT reactions, the notation {X ··· H2O} must be written explicitly to ensure mass conservation. The ET and EPT channels (half reactions) are characterized by their standard potentials and rate constants, as given by the following expressions
