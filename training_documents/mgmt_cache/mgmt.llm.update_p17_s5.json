        "content": "gc7v | Resources. To complement the changes to the organizational structure, Zhang developed a new corporate culture to support the company's shift toward responsiveness and customer orientation. To encourage simultaneous internal cooperation and competition among the company units, Haier's corporate culture emphasized internal reputation and performance. Backed up by appropriate performance management systems, the company emphasized that the more productive and customer-oriented employees are, the more decision-making autonomy and greater rewards they will receive. The new corporate culture was understandably more receptive to the radical changes in organizational practices in the mid-two thousands.\nwqfv | But beyond employing the organizational culture as a resource, the introduction of a new management system required resources such as consultancy fees, new I T systems, and staff training. More importantly, the performance outcomes of Rendanheyi were totally unknown, and unsuccessful implementation could become a major drain on the company's finances. However, Zhang suggested that Rendanheyi would proceed even if revenues and profits showed signs of weakening.\nj30a | Fortunately, Zhang did not have to worry about resources or the potential impact on investors when he introduced his new management system in two thousand five. Haier's revenues in the mid-two thousands were soaring, having quadrupled from R M B twenty-seven billion in nineteen ninety-nine to R M B one hundred three billion in two thousand five. And the Haier Group was under partial public ownership, freeing the company from delivering consistent financial returns.\n7bdk | The freedom to allocate resources distinguished Haier from western competitors. Indeed, Zhang told us that he specifically discussed the idea of introducing\nfim0 | Management Innovation Made in China: Haier's Rendanheyi\nojro | Rendanheyi with senior management of a very large U S multinational firm, and he was reportedly told that \"we cannot do it [introduce Rendanheyi] because we need to play by Wall Street rules.\" On another occasion, a group of visiting European managers from several well-known large enterprises accused Haier of fabricating a \"trompe l'Å“il\" with their ZZJYTs and communities of interest, suggesting that such radically innovative practices would be \"impossible to implement.\" A focus on quarterly results and steady revenues keeps American and European companies from even contemplating the sort of changes that Rendanheyi requires. In contrast, Haier's resources allowed Zhang to embark on a radical new management innovation, shifting the firm from a traditional manufacturer toward an agile online-platform-driven firm, without any guarantee that this turnaround would actually enhance organizational performance.\nl6t9 | Lessons for Management Innovators\n1ujy | The Haier Rendanheyi case produces four key lessons for management innovation. First, it is clear that one good response to a high V U C A world is management innovating, that is, the creation of innovative management systems. We showed how Rendanheyi constituted just such a response for the Haier Group. The Haier case is quite significant, since this is not a company from the buzzing I T sector in Silicon Valley or the innovative biotech sector in Britain's Silicon Fen. The white goods industry is traditionally a mature, slow-moving, and low-profit manufacturing sector. Yet, an environment with high V U C A is challenging this sector, too, and the Haier example illustrates the necessity as well as the opportunity for established companies to invent novel management systems in response.\nqzor | The second lesson revolves around how Haier experimented with Rendanheyi. The case study demonstrates that experimentation is a sine qua non for success in a V U C A environment. In particular, the Haier case demonstrates that leadership may eventually be the single most important contextual factor for making management innovation work. Furthermore, the management innovation seemed to co-evolve with the ideas and experiences of Haier's C E O. This suggests that those leaders that can actually learn from experiments are best placed to make management innovation work.\na0by | Third, we presented an extended process model of management innovation, which managers in both emerging and developed countries can apply. The four-stage process model, illustrated in Figure one, describes each of the stages managers go through when undertaking management innovation, with the internal and external contexts influencing all four stages. Managers must carefully consider competitive, technological, and institutional constraints when engaging in a new management innovation, while the three organizational contextual factors of structure, leadership, and resources act as enablers or levers for management innovating. Clearly the relative importance of internal and external contexts varies from one episode to the next, as emphasized by Zhang:\nu1ky | both matter . . . the first big transformation of Haier was based on external factors, as we knew that the market was going to become much more competitive, but the next transformation was based on a fear that we had, or would, become much too bureaucratic, and so we needed to combat the internal tendency.\nhtm9 | Fourth, managers should align the nature of management innovations they create, and how these are created, to the six environmental categories in our model, in line with the Haier case but also following other successful management innovators throughout history. Where leadership in an organization is strong and charismatic, a top-down creation process is more viable, which is how G M came up with the divisional M-form. With slack resources, organizations should attempt to undertake more management innovation, as G E has demonstrated throughout its history with stretch goals, Six Sigma, and the strategic business unit, to mention but a few. Organizations that want to be more effective management innovators have to build structures that allow for more experimentation, as Procter and Gamble did with Connect-and-Develop. Furthermore, managers must align their attempts at management innovating to what is possible in their institutional environment, Toyota's lean manufacturing being a great example, as noted earlier. Finally, they should increase efforts at management innovation when technological change is frequent and when there is intense competitive pressure, which was part of the reasoning behind Samsung's coopetition model.\n8hul | Discussion and Conclusion\n87vz | The main contributions of this article are demonstrating how the internal and external contexts mattered for the creation of Rendanheyi to allow Haier to deal with a high V U C A world, drawing lessons from Haier's experimentation process for other firms, and providing an improved explanation of how new management innovations are created.\nym66 | For the creation of Rendanheyi, leadership was the most important contextual factor, and our model extends the literature on the role of leadership in management innovation by providing a detailed description of how strong leadership can drive the development and implementation of management innovation. Yet, we suggest that leadership would not have been enough to drive Rendanheyi through, if the other contextual factors were not aligned and pushed in the same direction. In general terms, strong leadership does not always have to be the most important factor for every single management innovation. For instance, the initial development of innovations such as the balanced scorecard at Analog Devices and scenario planning at Shell was neither initiated nor driven by top management.\nl0a3 | The complexities and uncertainties of the V U C A world are driving firms such as Haier to create management innovations that are appropriate to the context in which they operate. This article shows specifically how rapid and timely\nu8nw | Management Innovation Made in China: Haier's Rendanheyi\nl2v9 | responses to deal with V U C A lead to context-dependent management innovations created by emerging market firms such as Haier. Rendanheyi allows Haier to both connect better to customers and create more internal cohesion, without sacrificing scale advantages, due to technology deployment. Our model suggests that managers must carefully consider the specific context within which they operate before introducing a novel management innovation.",
