You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

qy1i | Music and its admirers were ever contemned by him and Swift ; but, having neither taste nor judgment in this art, they were surely unqualified to censure it. Few conquerors ever aimed at universal monarchy, compared with the number of authors who have wished to be thought possessed of universal knowledge ; and yet these great writers, who discover, in what is within their competence, a vigour of mind, and elevation of genius, which inclines mankind to regard them as beings of a superior order, whenever they hope by the power

b2lm | of thinking to supply the place of knowledge, discover an imbecillity, which degrades them into common characters.
ti7f | I will not, however, over-rate musical sensations so far as to say, with the poet, that the man who cannot enjoy them " is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils " ; there being, perhaps, among mankind, as many persons of bad hearts that are possessed of a love and genius for music, as there are of good, that have neither talents nor feeling for it: but I will venture to say, that it has been admired and cultivated by great and eminent persons at all times and in every country, where arts have been cherished ; and though there may be no particular connection between correctness of ear, and rectitude of mind, yet, without the least hyperbole it may be said, that, ceteris paribus, the man who is capable of being affected by sweet sounds, is a being more perfectly organized, than he who is insensible to, or offended by them.
oksu | But, as the Constable in Much ado about Nothing says, " these are gifts which God gives," and lovers of music should be content with their own superior happiness, and not take offence at others for enjoying less pleasure than themselves. However, it is no uncommon thing for the rich to treat the poor with as much insolence, as if it were a crime not to be born to a great estate; yet, on the other hand, to be proud of beggary and want, is too ridiculous for censure.
wtow | With respect to the present work, there may, perhaps, be many readers who wish and expect to find in it a deep and well digested treatise on the theory and practice of music: whilst others, less eager after such information, will be seeking for mere amusement in the narrative. I wish it had been in my plan and power fully to satisfy either party; but a history is neither a body of laws, nor a novel. I have blended together theory and practice, facts and explanations, incidents, causes, consequences, conjectures, and confessions of ignorance, just as the subject produced them. Many new materials concerning the art of Music in the remote times of which this volume treats, can hardly be expected. The collecting into one point the most interesting circumstances relative to its practice and professors; its connection with religion; with war; with the stage ; with public festivals, and private amusements, have principally employed me: and as the historian of a great and powerful empire marks its limits and resources; its acquisitions and losses; its enemies and allies; I have endeavoured to point out the boundaries of music, and its influence on our passions; its early subservience to poetry, its setting up a separate interest, and afterwards aiming at independence; the heroes who have fought its battles, and the victories they have obtained.
o22k | If the titles of my chapters should appear too general and miscellaneous, and the divisions and sections of my work too few; it method and minute exactness in the distribution of its several subjects and parts should seem wanting; the whole is, perhaps, the more likely to be read for these deficiences; for a history, of
nwfz | PREFACE
nvfy | which the contents are symmetrically digested, separated by chapters, and sub-divided into sections, may be easily consulted, but is no more likely to be read throughout, than a dictionary.
mror | My subject has been so often deformed by unskilful writers, that many readers, even among those who love and understand music, are afraid of it. My wish, therefore, is not to be approached with awe and reverence for my depth and erudition, but to bring on a familiar acquaintance with them, by talking in common language of what has hitherto worn the face of gloom and mystery, and been too much " sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;" and though the mixing biographical anecdotes, in order to engage attention, may by some be condemned, as below the dignity of science, yet I would rather be pronounced trivial than tiresome; for Music being, at best, but an amusement, its history merits not, in reading, the labour of intense application, which should be reserved for more grave and important concerns.
zlxc | I have never, from a vain display of erudition, loaded my page with Greek; on the contrary, unless some disputable point seemed to render it necessary, or the passage was both remarkable and short, I have industriously avoided it, by referring my learned readers to the original text. The modesty of citation may, however, be carried to excess; for quotations of remarkable passages are very amusing and satisfactory to learned readers, and often prevent suspicions of misrepresentation. There is no pedantry in a margin; and the ancients are perhaps never so entertaining as in the fragment way of quotation. As I pretend not to such a profound and critical knowledge in the Greek language as to depend entirely upon myself, in obscure and contested passages, I have, when such occurred, generally had recourse to the labours of the best translators and commentators, or the counsel of a learned friend. And here, in order to satisfy the sentiments of friendship, as well as those of gratitude, I must publicly acknowledge my obligations to the zeal, intelligence, taste, and erudition of the reverend Mr. Twining ; a gentleman whose least merit is being perfectly acquainted with every branch of theoretical and practical music.
k0bw | As ancient Greek Music had its technical terms, as well as the modern Italian, with which many excellent scholars and translators from that language, for want of an acquaintance with Music, and Greek musical writers, have been utter strangers, I may venture to observe that I have tried, and I hope not always without success, to trace these terms in ancient authors, in order to discover their original acceptation.
aq5a | It would be a false, and perhaps offensive modesty, if I were here to trouble the reader with apologies for the length and frequency of quotations from the Iliad and Odyssey, and other ancient poets besides Homer; as it will be shewn, that history has no other materials to work upon in times of high antiquity, than those poems, which have always been regarded as historical; prose

0yab | compositions having been utterly unknown in Greece for 300 years after most of them were written (s).
w95z | I have never had recourse to conjecture, when facts were to be found. In the historical and biographical parts, I have asserted nothing without vouchers; and I have made the ancients tell their own story as often as was possible, without disputing with them the knowledge of their own history, as many moderns have done; for I cannot help supposing them to have been full as well acquainted with their own affairs 2,000 years ago, as we are at present. An ancient Greek might. with almost equal propriety, have pretended to foretell what we should be, at the distance of 2,000 years, as we determine now what they then were.
0i1k | Indeed it was my intention, when I first entered upon this work, to trace the genealogy of Music in a right line, without either meddling with the collateral branches of the family, or violating the reverence of antiquity. I wished and determined to proportion my labour to my powers, and I was unawares seduced into a course of reading and conjecture, upon matters beyond the reach of human ken, by the chief subject of my enquiries being so extensively diffused through all the regions of literature, and all the ages of the world. I found ancient Music so intimately connected with Poetry, Mythology, Government, Manners, and Science in general, that wholly to separate it from them, seemed to me like taking a single figure out of a group, in an historical picture; or a single character out of a drama, of which the propriety depends upon the dialogue and the incidents. If, therefore, a number of figures appear in the back-ground, I hope they will give relief, and somewhat keep off the dryness and fatigue which a single subject in a long work, or a single figure, if often repeated, though in different points of view, is apt to produce.
