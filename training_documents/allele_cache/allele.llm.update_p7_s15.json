        "content": "jt0y | BAD-corrected estimates of the ASB ES allow to visualize the magnitude of allelic imbalance at different positions of significant motif hits. To this purpose, we introduce a staveplot that is partitioned into sections corresponding to the motif positions, and each section is a stave of four strings denoting the minor allele. Individual ASBs are shown as the beads on the staves, with the major allele encoded with color, following the palette of the motif logo diagram that is shown underneath. As an illustrative example, we use ASBs of the CEBPB TF. For example, the first string from the left denotes A as the minor allele found in the first position of CEBPB motif hits. The string carries multiple beads, each of which is the major allele of a particular heterozygous SNV within an ASB site of CEBPB. The position of a bead on the Y-axis shows the ASB ES in log-scale. The most conserved motif positions three, seven, nine, and ten are almost unicolor, with the major allele usually being the same as the consensus letter in the motif (hence the beads on the strings depicting minor alleles mostly share the color of the preferred major allele). Lowly conserved positions (e.g., one or twelve) allow for more options with various pairwise combinations of alleles (i.e., with minor allele strings carrying the beads of all four possible colors). Of note, the staveplot reveals a clear pattern where beads found in core motif positions are located generally higher, i.e., marking a greater ES for heterozygous variants at conserved motif\nqb7o | positions. This agrees with the commonly accepted testimony that substitutions in the core motif positions bring about larger changes in TF-binding affinity.\noae5 | Particularly for CEBPB, position six is of special interest: it displays frequent T/C ASBs with C being the major allele. These cytosines belong to the core CG pair which is prone to spontaneous deamination. The produced mismatches are then protected from repair through enhanced CEBPB binding resulting in mutation fixation. Such ASBs, on the one hand, confirm frequent mutagenesis of CEBPB binding sites, and, on the other hand, suggest the action of purifying selection that stabilizes such sites as heterozygous variants. The staveplots for other TFs are shown in Supplementary Figure seven.\ns0fl | Machine learning predicts ASBs from sequence analysis and chromatin accessibility. With previously published ASB sets of smaller volumes, it was possible to predict ASB from chromatin properties and a sequence analysis. To assess to what degree this holds for ADASTRA data, we applied machine learning with a random forest model atop experimentally determined allele-specific chromatin DNase accessibility data, predicted allele-specific chromatin profile from DeepSEA, and sequence motif hits.\n43ia | A generic classification problem (ASBs versus non-ASBs) can be formalized in two subtasks: one, general assessment, i.e., to predict if an SNV makes the ASB for any of the TFs or in any of the cell types, and two, TF- and cell type-specific assessment, i.e., to predict if an SNV makes the ASB for the particular TF or in the particular cell type. Models for both subtasks were trained and validated using multiple single-chromosome hold-outs: iteratively for each of twenty-two autosomes, one autosome was selected for validation, and twenty-one other autosomes were used for training. At each iteration, the model performance was estimated at the held-out autosome, and the resulting ROC and PRC were averaged.\n3g2y | For the first subtask, the performance at TF and cell type ASBs was zero point seven-four and zero point seven-three for the area under the receiver operating characteristic (auROC), and zero point four-four and zero point five-six for the area under the precision-recall curve (auPRC), respectively. For the second subtask, we used the top ten TFs and top ten cell types with the highest numbers of ASBs, and a dedicated model was trained for each TF and each cell type. The quality of the models was different for different TFs and cell types, with the highest auROC of zero point seven-two and zero point eight-one for CTCF (of TFs) and HepG2 (of cell types), and the highest auPRC of zero point three-five and zero point six-four for CTCF and A549.
