You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

uooz | Approaches to estimating <LATEX>x _ { 2 } \left( \text { reanalysis } \right) \text { and } x _ { 3 }</LATEX> (filtering) from observations using the maximum likelihood method are discussed in the exercises. We next introduce a general Bayesian approach to data assimilation and then return to this example.

lq35 | Chapter 20. Data Assimilation
3g9w | The contemporary approach to analysis and forecasting problems is based on Bayes' rule. This rule was first formulated by the English mathematician and Presbyterian minister THOMAS BAYES (1701-1761). It yields estimates that are asymptotically correct and does not require an appeal to the law of large numbers, which would make little sense in the climate context. To simplify the following presentation, we assume that all state variables and data are finite-dimensional vectors-a reasonable assumption for data but a substantial simplification for state variables.
d09o | Suppose we are interested in estimating a vector X of process variables with a known or assumed pdf fx. The distribution may come from long-term observations or from an- other forecast model and is referred to as the prior distribution on X. The data model uses a vector Y of observations of (the components of) X, which may also include other random effects. We assume that for each possible realization x of X, the conditional distribution fylx of Y given x is known. This is essentially the data model.
ylhz | Now, suppose that the observation of Y at a particular instance results in the value y. The goal is to incorporate this value in the distribution of X by constructing the condi- tional distribution fxly of X given y. This conditional distribution is referred to as the posterior distribution on X. To find its formula, we note that the joint probability density fx,y of process variables and observations can be expressed in two ways,
a3td | (20.7)
ex5k | f
9d4o | The prior distribution fx is assumed to be known, as is the data model fy1x; the posterior distribution fxly is sought, and the distribution of the observations fy is unknown. After dividing both expressions by fy(y), we obtain Bayes' rule,
cjq2 | fxly(x)= fylx(y)fx(x) fy(y) .
5esx | (20.8)
m5ka | Note that both sides depend on x and y. The quantity y is given as an observation; there- fore the denominator on the right-hand side is fixed, although unknown. The entire equa- tion has the form
byu8 | fx(x)‹fx|x(y)fx(x), (20.9)
76b0 | where the implied proportionality constant (depending on fy) makes the term on the left a pdf. The constant can be found and equality established by computing an integral, either with analytical techniques or with numerical simulations.
zxz6 | In the case of Gaussian random variables, all integrations that would be required in Eq. (20.9) can, however, be replaced by matrix algebra, as the following lemma shows.
xnth | Lemma 20.1. Let X and Y be Gaussian random variables such that X ~ N(u,P) and Y|X ~N(HX,R), where H is a matrix. Then X|Y ~ N(u*, P*) with u* = u+K(Y-Hu) and P* = (I -KH)P, where K is the gain matrix,
vafm | K=PH™(R+HPHT)-1. (20.10)
2zmw | Proof. According to Eq. (20.9), the conditional probability density fxly satisfies
bf9k | fxly(x) x exp (=((x-Hy)TR-1(x-Hy)-(y-[)" p-1(y == ))). (20.11)

d6r4 | Completing the square, we obtain a Gaussian distribution,
9mrz | <LATEX>f _ { X | _ { \mathcal{Y} } } \left( \mathrm { x } \right) \propto \exp \left( - \frac { 1 } { 2 } \left( \left( \mathrm { x } - \mu ^ { * } \right) ^ { T } \left( P ^ { * } \right) ^ { - 1 } \left( \mathrm { x } - \mu ^ { * } \right) \right) \right) ,</LATEX> (20.12)
pk06 | with
7wn9 | <LATEX>\mu ^ { * } = \mathscr{E} \left( \mathrm { X } | \mathrm { y } \right) = \left( P ^ { - 1 } + H ^ { T } R ^ { - 1 } H \right) ^ { - 1 } \left( P ^ { - 1 } \mu + R ^ { - 1 } H ^ { T } \mathrm { y } \right) = \mu + K \left( \mathrm { y } - H \mu \right) ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P ^ { * } = \mathrm { v a r } \left( \mathrm { X } | \mathrm { y } \right) = \left( P ^ { - 1 } + H ^ { T } R ^ { - 1 } H \right) ^ { - 1 } = \left( I - K H \right) P .</LATEX> We leave the details of these calculations to the reader.
wcd0 | The distribution <LATEX>f _ { X | _ { \mathcal{Y} } }</LATEX> given in the lemma is the posterior distribution. Its covariance matrix <LATEX>P ^ { * }</LATEX> does not depend on the value <LATEX>\mathrm { y } .</LATEX> The lemma tells us that <LATEX>P ^ { * } = P - C ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>C</LATEX> is a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix. In this sense, the posterior variance is smaller than the prior variance, and we have reduced uncertainty by using the data. The lemma also shows that the mean of the posterior distribution is the prior mean updated by the gain applied to the difference between the observed <LATEX>\mathrm { Y }</LATEX> and its mean value <LATEX>H \mu .</LATEX> Recall that the difference between an observed quantity and its temporal mean is called "anomaly" in climate science, so this concept arises naturally in Bayesian data assimilation.
caos | 20.3.1 . Example: Bayesian Approach
qrvy | We return to the example introduced in Section 20.2. Assume that <LATEX>X _ { 1 } \sim N \left( \mu _ { 0 } , \sigma ^ { 2 } \right) ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>j o</LATEX> and <LATEX>\sigma ^ { 2 }</LATEX> are known. Then the column vector <LATEX>\mathrm { X } = \left( X _ { 1 } , \ldots , \check { X } _ { 4 } \right) ^ { T }</LATEX> of process variables has a multivariate normal distribution <LATEX>\mathrm { X } \sim N \left( \mu , \Sigma \right)</LATEX> with mean vector <LATEX>\mu =</LATEX> <LATEX>\left( \omega _ { 0 } , \alpha \mu _ { 0 } , \alpha ^ { 2 } \mu _ { 0 } , \alpha ^ { 3 } \mu _ { 0 } \right) ^ { T }</LATEX> and a suitable covariance matrix <LATEX>\Sigma</LATEX> (see the exercises). This is the prior distribution <LATEX>f _ { X }</LATEX> on <LATEX>\mathrm { X } .</LATEX> It does not use any observations. Explicitly,
pn9j | <LATEX>f _ { X } \left( \mathrm { x } \right) \propto \exp \left( - \frac { 1 } { 2 } \left( \mathrm { x } - \mu \right) ^ { T } \Sigma ^ { - 1 } \left( \mathrm { x } - \mu \right) \right) .</LATEX> The column vector <LATEX>\mathrm { Y } = \left( Y _ { 2 } , Y _ { 3 } \right) ^ { T }</LATEX> of observations and the vector <LATEX>\mathrm { X }</LATEX> of process variables are related by the equation <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathrm { Y } } = H \mathrm { X } + \left( \zeta _ { 2 } , \xi _ { 3 } \right) ^ { T } ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>H = \left( \begin{array}{} { 0 } & { 1 } & { 0 } \\ { 0 } & { 0 } & { 1 } \end{array} \right) .</LATEX> Given a particular realization <LATEX>\mathrm { X }</LATEX> of the process variables, <LATEX>\mathrm { Y }</LATEX> then has a multivariate normal distribution, <LATEX>\mathrm { Y } | \mathrm { x } \sim</LATEX> <LATEX>N \left( H x , \tau ^ { 2 } I \right) ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>I</LATEX> is the <LATEX>2 \times 2</LATEX> identity matrix. All quantities can be computed from the gain matrix <LATEX>K ,</LATEX> which will also be derived in the exercises.
1pmc | It is instructive to compare the standard deviations of the prior and posterior distribu- tions for <LATEX>X _ { 1 }</LATEX> (reanalysis) and for <LATEX>X _ { 3 }</LATEX> (filtering). These quantities are computed in Exercise 4. It turns out that <LATEX>\mathrm { v a r } \left( X _ { 1 } | \mathrm { y } \right) < \mathrm { v a r } \left( X _ { 1 } \right) = \sigma ^ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\mathrm { v a r } \left( X _ { 3 } | y \right) < \mathrm { v a r } \left( X _ { 3 } \right) = \sigma ^ { 2 } \alpha ^ { 4 } + \alpha ^ { 2 } + 1 ,</LATEX> as expected. However, <LATEX>\mathrm { v a r } \left( X _ { 1 } | \mathrm { y } \right)</LATEX> cannot be made arbitrarily small, even if z is small, while <LATEX>\mathrm { v a r } \left( X _ { 3 } | \mathrm { y } \right) = O \left( \tau ^ { 2 } \right) .</LATEX> Details are in the exercises.
5z6q | 20.4 - Sequential Data Assimilation
yeoh | We now focus on reanalysis, filtering, and forecasting for time-dependent processes. The data arrive as a time series-a sequence of realizations of a discrete-time stochastic process.
b8hf | Suppose the process variables are <LATEX>\mathrm { X } \left( k \right) ,</LATEX> <LATEX>k = 0 , 1 , \ldots ,</LATEX> and the observations are <LATEX>\mathrm { Y } \left( k \right) ,</LATEX> <LATEX>k = 1 , 2 , \ldots .</LATEX> A starting value <LATEX>X \left( 0 \right)</LATEX> for the process variables is allowed to incorporate a background state for which no observations are available. We use the notation <LATEX>\mathrm { X } \left( 0 : N \right)</LATEX> for a sequence <LATEX>\left\{ \mathrm { X } \left( k \right) : k = 0 , 1 , \ldots , N \right\}</LATEX> of vector-valued random variables and <LATEX>\mathrm { x } \left( 0 : N \right)</LATEX> for a sequence of its realizations, and similarily for <LATEX>\mathrm { Y } .</LATEX> We are interested in estimating <LATEX>\mathrm { X } \left( n \right) ,</LATEX> given <LATEX>\mathrm { Y } \left( 1 : N \right)</LATEX> (reanalysis), or given <LATEX>\mathrm { Y } \left( 1 : n \right)</LATEX> (filtering), or given <LATEX>\mathrm { Y } \left( 1 : n - 1 \right)</LATEX> (forecasting).

y5r7 | Chapter 20. Data Assimilation
lrry | Joint pdfs (also called probability mass functions) and conditional pdfs are identi- fied by suitable indices. For example, fx(0:n),Y(1:n)(x(0 :n), y(1 : n)) is the joint den- sity function of the process variables X(0), ... , X(n) and observations Y(1), ... , Y(n), and fx(2:2)/ (1 . ly(1:n-1) (x(2 : n)) is the conditional pdf for X(2), ... , X(n) given observations y(1), ... , y(n-1). The latter is a function of y(1 : n-1) and x(2 : n). Since observations arrive sequentially, one can try to find forecast and filter estimates also sequentially.
hvhm | 20.4.1 - Filtering and Forecasting for Markov Chains
863b | Definition 20.1. A discrete-time stochastic process X(0 : N) has the Markov property if its pdfs satisfy
fj24 | fx(n:N)|x(0:n-1)(x(n: N)) = fx(n:N)|x(n-1)(x(n:N)), n=1, ... ,N, (20.13) for all x(n : N). A discrete-time stochastic process that has the Markov property is called a Markov chain.
uz3c | Intuitively, the Markov property says that, to predict future observations X(n : N) of the stochastic process, it is sufficient to know the immediate past X(n-1). Additional knowledge of the more distant past X(0 : n-2) does not change the predictions of the future. An induction argument shows that the joint distribution of X(0 : n) can then be written as a product of conditional distributions,
