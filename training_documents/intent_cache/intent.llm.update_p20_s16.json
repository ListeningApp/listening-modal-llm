        "content": "usfa | For the duration of the therapy process, the therapist must engage in a process of interpersonal reasoning. Interpersonal reasoning is the process by which a therapist consciously and reflectively monitors both the therapeutic relationship and the interpersonal events of therapy in order to decide on and enact appropriate interpersonal strategies. Chapter seven discusses the interpersonal reasoning process in detail.\ndnjr | Intentional Relationship Model: Ten Underlying Principles\nqser | The IRM defines the most critical components of the client-therapist relationship as it occurs in occupational therapy. In addition to its central elements and mechanisms, ten fundamental principles underlie the conceptualization of this model. They are explained in the following sections. Each principle specifies unique assumptions about how the client-therapist relationship is approached. Collectively, the principles should be kept actively in mind anytime the model is applied during an interaction with a client.\n8gam | Principle one: Critical Self-Awareness Is Key to the Intentional Use of Self\nz4db | Developing critical self-awareness involves having a working knowledge of your interpersonal tendencies while interacting with clients of different interpersonal styles and under different conditions and circumstances. These interpersonal tendencies may manifest in one's emotional reactions to others and in one's verbalizations and\nlw7l | BOX three point one Underlying Principles of the Intentional Relationship Model\n2exi | One. Critical self-awareness is key to the intentional use of self.\n16py | Two. Interpersonal self-discipline is fundamental to effective use of self.\nm4ov | Three. It is necessary to keep head before heart.\n9uqd | Four. Mindful empathy is required to know your client.\n8szx | Five.

Application of the model must be informed by core values and ethics.\nnyqt | Ten. Application of the model requires cultural sensitivity.\n7odd | nonverbal behavior. Critical self-awareness also requires understanding how your interpersonal reactions and behaviors change, become attenuated, or become amplified in awkward, tense, or stressful situations. Understanding yourself in these highly detailed and variegated ways is not easy to achieve. Nevertheless, this understanding is critical to developing interpersonal skills that are perceived as therapeutic by clients.\n0le2 | The difficulty involved in achieving critical self-awareness is illustrated by research findings that therapists are usually not accurate in their self-estimation of the extent to which they convey an attitude of care and empathy toward their clients. In studies of psychotherapy, empathy was linked to positive outcomes only if it was perceived by the client; therapist self-ratings of empathy were not associated with positive outcomes.\n5dw0 | Chapter three A Model of the Intentional Relationship seventy-one\ni4yq | Because therapists are not always accurate self-estimators of their own interpersonal capacities, merely considering oneself to be a caring and empathic therapist does not offer adequate assurance that an effective interpersonal process has occurred in therapy. Many of us have probably had the opportunity to know someone whose caring behavior toward us was fully spontaneous, sincere, and heartfelt but nevertheless largely missed what we most needed at the time.\nfj3g | Truly effective use of self hinges on ongoing critical awareness of your interpersonal behavior and emotional reactions to clients. This includes a mindfulness concerning:\nzuua | What you are communicating verbally (content, choice of words, types of questions asked).\nelwn | What you are communicating nonverbally (stance or sitting posture, positioning of arms and legs, angle of torso and head in relation to the client, gestures, extent and pace of body movements).\njnqv | What you are communicating emotionally (tone, tenor, and volume of voice; facial expression; extent to which emotion is shown or shared).\nunp3 | What you are withholding, limiting, or otherwise not communicating and the implications of these kinds of noncommunication for the therapeutic interaction.\nv8vk | Principle two: Interpersonal Self-Discipline Is Fundamental to Effective Use of Self\nsr40 | Achieving critical self-awareness is necessary for effective therapeutic relationships, but it is not sufficient. Therapists must also have the courage to seek and respond to interpersonal feedback from clients in a manner that reflects a dynamic, second-by-second recognition of what the client needs at any given moment. These abilities to anticipate, measure, and respond to the effects of ongoing communications with a client is most succinctly characterized as interpersonal self-discipline. Interpersonal self-discipline is fundamental to the use of self because it allows a therapist to develop stable, predictable relationships with clients. It allows a client to trust that the therapist has the ability to place his or her own interpersonal reactions and expectations aside to best fulfill what the client wishes to take from the relationship.\n5zjj | A critical aspect of interpersonal self-discipline involves acting on your awareness of your reactions to interpersonally challenging clients whose interpersonal behavior does not meet your expectations or tends to be negative. These clients may be particularly emotional, hypersensitive, defensive, demanding, critical, manipulative, difficult to manage, or otherwise vulnerable. Therapists differ among and within themselves regarding:\nf56l | What kinds of client behaviors and emotions are experienced as difficult.\nar2z | The extent to which they feel comfortable managing these different types of difficult interpersonal behaviors.\nyad0 | Some therapists find it easier to work with an emotionally sad client than an angry client, whereas the opposite may be true for another therapist. Interpersonal self-discipline involves knowing the types of client and the situations that are most likely to test your interpersonal resolve and emotional perspective. Once you are familiar with your own vulnerabilities, you can more effectively prepare yourself emotionally and psychologically before interacting with these clients. In addition, you can more readily seek support, advice, and guidance from mentors and peers when treating difficult clients.\n3g38 | Collectively, the actions you take toward self-preparation and self-management in the face of interpersonally difficult clients helps ensure that the ways in which you choose to interact with these clients will be optimally therapeutic. This decreases the likelihood that you will unwittingly act out your own negative feelings toward a difficult client. For example, a therapist once shared that she felt less guilty about precipitously changing an appointment with a client in order to meet an out-of-town friend for lunch because the client tended to behave in demanding ways and had recently questioned her approach. Changing an appointment with a client for a nonurgent matter is not a disciplined way of managing one's feelings toward a client. Moreover, changing the appointment with an already-difficult client may lead to increased tension in the relationship. Another example is the extent to which one may make special efforts on behalf of a client. It is generally easier to make these extra efforts for clients whom one likes and sees as investing a great deal in the therapy. However, depriving the difficult client or the client who is not invested in therapy of one's extra effort is not justified ethically.",
