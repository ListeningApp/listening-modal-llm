There is, however, a tradeoff to be considered. As one tightens the acceptable relative error by decreasing epsilon, the value of na epsilon is also decreased. In practice, values of epsilon in the range zero point zero one to zero point one are small enough to lead to a bias of a few percent in relative magnitude, but large enough so that the benefit of the increased magnitude of the forcing is significant. We further illustrate the tradeoff in Section four with numerical results for several observables for overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics.\nnjvp | As a final remark in this section, note that computing a plus epsilon requires computing the full response curve. Although this is not practical, the aim here is to provide a proof of principle demonstrating the potential computational gains obtained by making use of synthetic forcings and decide, between various strategies, the most promising one in order to adapt the approach to actual systems of interest.\ntxab | Three point four. Linearly combining extra forcings. As discussed in Section three point three, with the addition of some extra forcing Lextra, it is possible to find a value of sigma which cancels the second-order response p two due to the linearity of f two in sigma, as shown in three point one two. We can extend this notion to linear combinations of extra forcings. In particular, one can combine k forcings in order to cancel the first k nonlinear orders of the response. That is, for alpha equals alpha one to alpha k, the synthetic perturbation Lphys plus alpha one Lextra one plus alpha k Lextra k can be used, with alpha chosen such that p two a to p k plus one a equals zero. This is a nonlinear equation in alpha, with k unknowns scalar values and k conditions to solve.\ndov0 | Four. Numerical results. The aim of the numerical illustrations presented in this section is to demonstrate the potential of the synthetic forcing approach, on the examples given in Section three point two. The numerical results are obtained by discretizing the partial differential equations determining the invariant probability measure of each system, namely the Fokker-Planck equation three point three and the Poisson equation two point two three. The use of this method, particularly in low-dimensional systems, allows us to extensively and thoroughly examine the quality of synthetic forcings, as we can easily compute full response curves and individual orders of the response, in contrast to Monte Carlo simulations, for which some statistical error and timestep discretization bias are present. This numerical method, however, cannot be used as such for higher dimensional systems, as solving the associated partial differential equations becomes too cumbersome a task. Thus, for higher dimensional systems, Monte Carlo simulations are usually preferred.\nxd5o | We first discuss in Section four point one the numerical methods used, then present the numerical results for the one and two-dimensional overdamped Langevin, and one-dimensional Langevin dynamics in Sections four point two, four point three and four point four, respectively. We finally discuss in Section four point five the impact of the synthetic forcings approach on variance reduction in the estimation of transport coefficients.\n3gny | Four point one. Numerical method. The full response curve and the linear response are computed by solving the associated Fokker-Planck equation for each dynamics, and the Poisson equation two point two three, respectively. The main advantage of numerical methods based on solving partial differential equations is that the discretization error can be systematically reduced to a very small value by refining the mesh used to represent the functions at hand. There are two situations in which the solutions to partial differential equations are required to determine the response to external perturbations, which we outline below.\nws73 | Approximation of the linear response rho one. The linear response is obtained by computing fraktur f one and approximating the integral on the right-hand side of two point two six. To approximate fraktur f one, we solve the Poisson equation two point two three, which we recall here for convenience:\nvyos | Four point one\nw4hq | L zero star fraktur f one equals negative tilde L phys star one. For overdamped Langevin dynamics, we directly solve four point one as we consider a bounded position space, namely the torus T d. For Langevin dynamics, instead of solving for fraktur f one in the expansion two point two one, we solve for psi bar one in psi eta equals psi zero plus eta psi bar one plus eta squared psi bar two plus so on, i.e. psi bar one equals fraktur f one psi zero. This function satisfies the Poisson equation\nghbe | Four point two\n1lkf | L zero dagger psi bar one equals negative tilde L phys dagger psi zero, which is equivalent to reformulating four point one in terms of the L two adjoint. Due to the unbounded momentum space for Langevin dynamics, solving four point two makes the problem easier to solve numerically than four point one. Indeed, the unbounded momentum space needs to be truncated. A natural choice when solving for psi bar one is to set Dirichlet boundary conditions at the boundaries of the domain in p, which is consistent with the fact that psi bar one q p is expected to vanish as the absolute value of p approaches positive infinity. In contrast, there is no natural boundary condition for fraktur f one in two point two six when the momentum space is truncated.\nuobn | Once an approximation of fraktur f one or psi bar one is obtained, we perform a quadrature on one of the following integrals to directly find the linear response",
