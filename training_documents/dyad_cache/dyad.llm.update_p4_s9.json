        "content": "da3c | Given its type of regime, North Korea constituted a challenging target for Humint. This task had become even more difficult because of the cumbersome organization of the various bodies involved in this mission. Following the withdrawal of United States forces in June nineteen forty-nine, American military assistance to the South Korean army was provided by the Korean Military Advisory Group, which also passed information from Republic of Korea sources to the Pentagon. In addition, the United States maintained three small intelligence missions in Korea: the Korean Liaison Office, established by MacArthur's G-two, General Charles Willoughby after the\n890q | American forces left South Korea in nineteen forty-nine and tasked with intelligence collection and analysis; the Air Force Office of Special Investigations; and a Central Intelligence Agency element that was linked to the local police and intelligence services. Their main sources were the South Korean collection agencies. Although South Korean officers claim that the intelligence that they collected about the coming attack was valuable, there is a consensus that G-two in Tokyo regarded it as conflicting and useless.\njomo | The Korean Liaison Office and Central Intelligence Agency collection abilities in North Korea are a matter of controversy. According to Willoughby, in nineteen forty-nine, he had sixteen agents in North Korea. However, Korean Liaison Office officers had reservations about \"their competence, motivation, and loyalty.\" Similarly, according to John Singlaub, he and his colleagues recruited dozens of Koreans in Manchuria between nineteen forty-six and nineteen forty-eight, trained them as agents, and sent them across the Yalu River into North Korea. The agents provided valuable information to the CIA station in Seoul,\n06fi | page one hundred thirty and on the eve of the war reported on specific North Korean preparations for invasion. Based on these reports, the CIA distributed a document assessing \"that a North Korean invasion was pending\" on June nineteenth. Other intelligence histories of the war tend to ignore the CIA's Humint contribution. Thus, a semi-official report of American Humint in the war maintains that when it started \"Korea was an intelligence vacuum.\" Academic accounts and the CIA documents themselves refute the claim that the agency forecast a North Korean invasion as an immediate threat a week before the war.\nhb4s | Lastly, the Foreign Broadcast Information Service, which was established in nineteen forty-one and transferred to the CIA in nineteen forty-seven, provided some information as well. However, its focus was less on North Korea per se, and more on Soviet media coverage of the two Koreas and Soviet-North Korean relations. Consequently, Open Source Intelligence missed some hints in the North Korean media (primarily deceptive messages) that could have indicated a certain change in the situation prior to the invasion.\ncqq2 | Two. The information and its estimate\n1ews | Given the low ranking of North Korea in the United States intelligence requirements order of priorities, the Communications Intelligence contribution to an early warning was minimal. Post factum, it provided two hints of the coming invasion: an increase in Soviet targeting of South Korean communications between April twenty-first and May fifteenth; and, from February nineteen fifty onward, indications of large Soviet shipments of bandages and medicines to North Korea and Manchuria. Foreign Broadcast Information Service monitoring of Soviet references to North Korea and North Korean broadcasts revealed no significant indications for a drastic change in the public attitude of both states on the issue of \"armed unification.\"\nafyn | Humint provided a somewhat better picture. On January thirteenth, nineteen fifty, a CIA document reported further expansion of the Korean People's Army forces, including tank units and heavy artillery, in the border zone with South Korea. In addition, the report notified an influx of People's Liberation Army forces in Manchuria. A G-two report that was distributed six days before the invasion included significant war indicators: \"an imminent enemy offensive-extensive troop movements along the thirty-eighth parallel; evacuation of all civilians north of the parallel for two kilometers; suspension of civilian freight service from Wonsan to Ch'orwon and the transportation of military supplies only; concentration of armored units in the border area; and the arrival of large shipments of weapons and ammunition.\" On the same day, a CIA report included no specific warning indicators. It did notice, however, that the Korean People's Army continued to deploy forces near the border, that the deployment included tanks and heavy artillery that had moved there \"in recent months,\" and that, in general, the North Korean military forces in the border area \"equal or surpass the strength of southern Korean army units similarly deployed.\"\n8sye | Some Humint sources also referred to specific dates of the coming offensive. On December thirtieth, nineteen forty-nine, Willoughby sent Washington reports from field agents that warned of a North Korean invasion in March or April of nineteen fifty. A month-and-a-half later, he delivered two additional warnings about an attack in March or June. Korean Liaison Office officers reported on March tenth that the invasion had been rescheduled from March or April to June\nr04h | nineteen fifty. However, since most of the warnings came from South Korean field sources, rather than American sources, they were dismissed by American intelligence officers.\norpr | The CIA was right in assessing that the withdrawal of the American army from Korea would lead to a communist \"armed unification,\" but it erred in estimating the circumstances under which the invasion would take place. It also was wrong in evaluating the balance of forces between North Korea and the Republic of Korea. In early January nineteen forty-seven, the CIA's predecessor, the Central Intelligence Group, had assessed that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics' long-term goal was to take over the whole of the Korean Peninsula, and that since the United States military presence was the main obstacle to employing this scheme, \"Soviet propaganda and Communist agitation have consistently sought to drive the United States out of Korea.\" Toward the end of nineteen forty-seven, a CIA assessment warned that \"United States withdrawal would have the effect of leaving South Korea incapable of offering any serious resistance to eventual domination by the North.\" A March nineteen forty-eight document estimated that the right-wing South Korean regime under Syngman Rhee \"would be incapable of withstanding ideological and military pressures from North Korea.\" Following the elections in August, the CIA assessment was somewhat more optimistic, expressing the belief that a strong South Korean army could be built before the expected American military withdrawal, and that such an army could serve as an effective deterrent against communist aggression.\nk36m | The belief, shared by all American estimators, that the unification of the Korean Peninsula would be initiated by the USSR, and not by Kim Il Sung, was expressed in a February nineteen forty-nine report of a decrease in Communist influence in South Korea. Consequently, the CIA analysts concluded that the conditions were not ripe for \"carrying out the Soviet plan for the eventual absorption of South Korea into the Democratic Peoples Republic.\" This estimate relied on the expectation that \"the Politburo would not engage in overt forms of aggression which involved the risk of a general war for the present and several years hence.\" A more alarmed tone was expressed a week later, noting that the scheduled American military withdrawal in June \"would probably in time be followed by an invasion, timed to coincide with Communist-led South Korean revolts, by the North Korean People's Army possibly assisted by small battle-trained units from Communist Manchuria.\" This estimate is considered by some as evidence that the CIA correctly foresaw the coming events.\nwnuz | The South Korean estimate was more pessimistic and also more accurate. Based on the \"recent enemy situation and general developments,\" the Republic of Korea Army Headquarters warned in its annual intelligence estimate of December twenty-seventh, nineteen forty-nine, that \"the enemy would carry out a full-scale offensive campaign in the spring of nineteen fifty.\" By March, the warning had become more concrete, forecasting June as the time of the invasion. The Korean Liaison Office and the Korean Military Advisory Group G-two reported this information, but it did not have a considerable impact in Tokyo or in Washington because it had gone through Willoughby, who rejected the Korean predictions.",
