You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

p2n3 | A Conceptual Framework for Range-Expanding Species that Track Human-Induced Environmental Change
ohh7 | For many species, human-induced environmental changes are important indirect drivers of range expansion into new regions. We argue that it is important to distinguish the range dynamics of such species from those that occur without, or with less clear, involvement of human-induced environmental changes. We elucidate the salient features of the rapid increase in the number of species whose range dynamics are human induced, and review the relationships and differences to both natural range expansion and biological invasions. We discuss the consequences for science, policy and management in an era of rapid global change and highlight four key challenges relating to basic gaps in knowledge, and the transfer of scientific understanding to biodiversity management and policy. We conclude that range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental change will become an essential feature for biodiversity management and science in the Anthropocene. Finally, we propose the term neonative for these taxa.
vbni | W Videly accepted definitions of the nativeness of species-or, more generally, of taxa-are based on a dichotomous classification (i.e., native, meaning indigenous, and alien, meaning nonnative, exotic, nonindigenous; Webb 1985, Richardson et al. 2000, Pyšek et al. 2004, Blackburn et al. 2011, Crees and Turvey 2015, Wilson et al. 2016, Essl et al. 2018). Native taxa are those that have arisen through evolution in a region or have colonized a region by their own means of dispersal. Alien taxa are those that have been transported by specific human agency-that is, the anthro- pogenic movement of propagules or parent organisms, respectively, or the dispersal through human-constructed corridors, such as canals (Essl et al. 2018)-into regions that could not be reached (or could only be reached in very rare cases) by natural dispersal (Pyšek et al. 2004).
dgcw | Despite considerable debate (e.g., Warren 2007), the basic principles on how native and alien species should be classified have become widely accepted in science (e.g., Richardson et al. 2000, Blackburn et al. 2011, Essl et al. 2018) and environmental policy (e.g., CBD 2002). However, there is ongoing debate on how this dichotomy should be applied in practice, because of the multitude of situations in
gvwz | which human agency may be involved in range expansion and because of the paucity or uncertainties of available taxo- nomic and biogeographic data (Essl et al. 2018). Less atten- tion has been paid to situations in which range expansion is the result of human modifications of the environment that have led to changes in the distribution of suitable environ- mental space, allowing a species to disperse naturally to and establish in new areas previously not colonized. The only example we are aware of that systematically distinguished between natural and anthropogenic occurrences-in this case, of vascular plant species-is the New Atlas of British and Irish Flora (Preston et al. 2002).
sk5m | Human activities increasingly cause environmental per- turbations, such as climate change, land-use change, over- harvesting, eutrophication, and pollution. The resulting changes in biophysical attributes of the environment affect the distribution of species in different ways (e.g., Pereira et al. 2010, Waters et al. 2016, Pecl et al. 2017). Many spe- cies experience population declines or local extinction (e.g., Baker et al. 2018) that result in shrinking ranges or even global extinction (Wessely et al. 2017). Other species track the shifting environmental conditions by colonizing new
qws8 | geographical space, at widely varying rates (Chen et al. 2011, Pinsky et al. 2013), and there are many species that react differently to human-induced environmental change in dif- ferent parts of their ranges (particularly at the northern and southern distribution limits or upper and lower elevational limits, respectively). The phenomenon of geographic range expansion is becoming increasingly frequent (e.g., Lenoir and Svenning 2015), the velocity of range expansion is often increasing (Devictor et al. 2012, Steinbauer et al. 2018), and ongoing rapid environmental change will doubtlessly amplify these processes in the future (e.g., Loarie et al. 2009, Pecl et al. 2017). For instance, recent range expansion into higher latitudes and altitudes have frequently been docu- mented as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change, in particular for mobile species (e.g., Chen et al. 2011, Devictor et al. 2012, Steinbauer et al. 2018).
877u | This situation is blurring the distinction between native and alien species and has fuelled debate on how to clas- sify taxa that respond to human-induced environmental changes by expanding their ranges without any specific human assistance into new regions that are often adjacent to their native range. Some authors have suggested that such taxa should be considered as native (e.g., Webber and Scott 2012, Hoffmann and Courchamp 2016, Gilroy et al. 2017). Others, while agreeing partly with this view, have proposed that alien status may be applied if there is a strong indirect human contribution (e.g., the creation of novel ecosystems such as heated environments-e.g., greenhouses, power plant cooling ponds-in the newly colonized region) that is a prerequisite for such autonomous range expansion (e.g., Essl et al. 2018). Finally, some authors have suggested that all such species should be considered as aliens, because of the underlying indirect human agency and because their range expansion is clearly attributable to human-caused environ- mental changes (e.g., Ben Rais Lasram and Mouillot 2009) or, at least, cannot be considered native using the current definitions (Pyšková et al. 2016). The classification of such range-expanding species as native or alien has important ramifications for environmental legislation and biodiversity management. This is because, although both groups can cause major effects on communities and ecosystems, they often carry different obligations for responsible authorities.
rzhj | We argue that there can be substantial differences regard- ing the spread dynamics and characteristics, as well as the impacts caused, between taxa that are naturally expanding their range solely because of anthropogenic environmental change, native species that have been present in a region since historic times, and alien species that have been directly introduced by humans from another region. The increasing frequency of naturally range-expanding taxa (e.g., Engelkes et al. 2008, Chen et al. 2011, Devictor et al. 2012), and the unclear situation in management and regulations warrants recognizing these species as a special category. In the present article, we elucidate the salient features of the rapid increase in the number of range-expanding species, review the rela- tionships and differences between resident native and alien
