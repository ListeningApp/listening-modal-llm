You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

jd7m | Above, I proceeded to compute Za directly by doing the Gaussian integral over momenta and integrating each position over the box. Here's a slightly different way. Because
sknv | exp(-(E) =exp(-ßE1) ... exp(-BEN),
usuw | the partition function Za is a product of integrals which are all equal:
d4hr | BJR3 e-Bp·p/2m d3pd3q h3 .
ph8j | Za =
bemf | The integral in the parentheses is the partition function of an single particle in a box. We have already seen that this equals
s9l9 | JB JR3 e - Bp.p/2m ď3pd3q _V h3
bs07 | A3
y6eq | where A is the thermal wavelength. Thus we have
0tl4 | Za =
vbq2 | We can also do this calculation with a lot less work using Puzzle 36. This implies that when we build a new system from N identical noninteracting copies of some old system, the partition function of the new system is the Nth power of the partition function of the old system. What I just did is show this in a special case.
pfrt | GAS OF DISTINGUISHABLE PARTICLES: ENTROPY
iws8 | In thermal equilibrium, an ideal gas of N distinguishable classical particles of mass m in a 3-dimensional box of volume V has expected energy
n452 | (Ed) = kNT 3
ztct | and free energy
enir | A3N VN
e4d4 | Fa = - kT In
d8ta | where A = h/V2TmkT is the thermal wavelength. Its entropy Sa is ((Ea) - Fa)/T, so
c9cw | Sa = kN In N (InN +3)
b93o | We use the subscript d for a gas of N distinguishable particles. Since the energy is a quadratic function of 3N variables, the equipartition theorem says the expected energy is (Ed) = kNT.
tjqy | The free energy F is minus Boltzmann's constant times the logarithm of the partition function, which we just computed:
58xg | Fa = - kln Za =- kln
70zf | Thus the entropy of the gas is
xnbe | Sa = (Ea) - Fa T V( 3 +2). h =
uv86 | A = V2TmkT 3 2Tm h2 + 2 )
gksi | If we expand this out using
oh7q | we get the formula I promised earlier:
6gn8 | Sa = kN (InV +InkT +]]n
yun5 | The only advantage of this messier formula is that it separates out the temperature dependence and the volume dependence.
vdx2 | THE GIBBS "PARADOX"
4k9e | For the ideal gas of N distinguishable classical particles in a box of volume V, the entropy
keds | Sa = kN In V + InkT + In 3
ugy5 | 2 3 2Tm + 3 h2 2
yhw8 | more than doubles if we double both N and V while keeping everything else the same. This confused people for a while, so it's called the 'Gibbs paradox'.
o7zq | Start with a box B containing an ideal gas of distinguishable classical particles. Then double the volume of the box to get a new box B', and double the number of particles in the box too, while keeping the temperature and everything else the same.
hqd5 | We might expect the entropy to double. After all, we could take the doubled box and slip a thin wall down the middle to get two identical copies of the original box. So the entropy should be twice as big now. Right?
su3f | Apparently not! Instead of just doubling the kN ln V term in the original entropy, we are replacing it with 2kN ln(2V ), which is more than twice as big. The reason is that in the doubled box B' each individual particle has twice as much room to roam than if you put a wall down the middle. Thus, it takes more information to say where all the particles are.
s1l7 | While there's no real paradox here, people found this result deeply counterintuitive, so they called it the 'Gibbs paradox'. And in fact they had a good reason for being suspicious of this result. It would be correct if gas molecules were distinguishable. But in fact molecules of the same kind are not distinguishable they don't have little labels on them that let you recognize which is which. And if we take this fact into account, our formula for the entropy changes. Let's see how!
12yz | GAS OF INDISTINGUISHABLE PARTICLES: PARTITION FUNCTION
0xfx | The partition function of an ideal gas of N indistinguishable classical particles of mass m in a 3d box B of volume V is
bg91 | Zi(8) = Za(B) N!
bsog | β 3N/2 = 1 VN N! h3N
o7e8 | Thus
xjy8 | Zi(3) = N! A3N 1 VN
6746 | where A = h(8/2Tm)1/2 is the thermal wavelength.
r5zg | The partition function Zi for a gas of N indistinguishable particles is 1/N! times that for a gas of distinguishable particles. Why? We got Za by integrating exp(-ßE) over the space of ordered N-tuples of position-momentum pairs. The energy E here does not change if we permute our N-tuple, so we can also think of it as a function of unordered N-tuples. Then we get Z; by integrating exp(-BE) over the space of such unordered tuples. Notice that there are N! ordered N-tuples for each unordered N-tuple, except for N-tuple with repeated entries, which form a set of measure zero and thus contribute nothing to the integral. Thus, we should not be surprised that
hk56 | Zi(B) = Za(B) N! .
29ac | But we've seen
no4d | Za(B)= A3N VN
nh8n | where A is the thermal wavelength, so
ircn | Zi(8) = N! A3N . 1 VN
npsf | Making this sketchy argument precise requires more notation. I think carefully doing the case N = 2 is the best way for you to see what's going on.
