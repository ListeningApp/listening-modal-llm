You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

0fpw | studies should aim to reveal which of the three scenarios in Fig. 3 (b)-(d) is most likely for the light inhibition of
dqn8 | <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } } .</LATEX> Several mechanisms co-contribute to the Kok effect
cop0 | Our analyses suggest that not a single mechanism determines the Kok effect, but at least three mechanisms (i.e. decreasing <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> with irradiance, varying <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> and light inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> co-con- tribute to it. Using a model, we quantitatively estimated the rela- tive contribution of the CO2-specific processes like refixation (reflected via <LATEX>\left. \Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } } \right)</LATEX> vs the light-dependent decrease in photo- chemical efficiency <LATEX>\left( \Phi _ { 2 } \right)</LATEX> in explaining the Kok effect. Our result suggested that varying <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> explained c. 25% of the Kok effect, while variable <LATEX>\Phi</LATEX> cannot be ignored and explained c. 12% of the Kok effect, across various <LATEX>C O 2 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> and temperature conditions. The appreciable contribution of variable <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> is supported by decreases in the slope of phase 2, compared with Phase 1, of the <LATEX>A - I _ { a b s }</LATEX> plots under conditions where photorespiration is greatly suppressed, for example, for <LATEX>C _ { 3 }</LATEX> species under low-O2 conditions or for <LATEX>C _ { 4 }</LATEX> species (Yin et al., 2011a).
lhkq | However, there are still small decreases in the slope of phase 2 for <LATEX>C _ { 3 }</LATEX> species under low-O2 conditions or for <LATEX>\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }</LATEX> species when <LATEX>A</LATEX> was plotted against <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } } \Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> (Yin et al., 2011a). This effect in <LATEX>\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }</LATEX> species may reflect the low efficacy of the CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) caused by a high leakiness at low irradiances (Kromdijk et al., 2010; Yin et al., 2011b). However, for a <LATEX>\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }</LATEX> species, Buckley et al. (2017) observed even more significant changes for developing leaves under 2% than under 21% O2 con- ditions, suggesting an involvement of other mechanisms. A fourth mechanism was shown here to potentially contribute to the Kok effect (Fig. 2d), but we were not able to verify it, as any variable <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { a c t } }</LATEX> and/or <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 }</LATEX> are hard to identify at the light intensities showing the Kok effect. Our results, that <LATEX>B _ { 1 } : B _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratios (Table 2)

1piq | and <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { D 1 } } : R _ { \mathrm { D 2 } }</LATEX> ratios (Table 3) were very close to 1 at 2% O2 or 700 µmol <LATEX>\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }</LATEX> suggest that significant involvement of a fourth mechanism was highly unlikely. Thus, our remaining unexplained part (c. 63%) of the Kok effect is most likely a result of the light suppression of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } } ,</LATEX> in agreement with the statement of Buckley <LATEX>e t</LATEX> al. (2017) on the dominant role of this third mecha- nism.
7fqw | A dual effect of photorespiration in contributing to the Kok effect
rhaz | Our strong linear relationships between the <LATEX>B _ { 1 } : B _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratio and the <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> ratio (Fig. 5a) confirmed previous results in the literature (Cornic & Jarvis, 1978; Ishii & Murata, 1972; Ishii & Schmid, 1981; Sharp et al., 1984; Farquhar & Busch, 2017; Way et al., 2019) showing that the Kok effect was strongly associated with the occurrence of photorespiration. Perhaps it is because of the significant contribution of varying <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> that the Kok effect reported in the earlier days (Kok, 1949; Ishii & Schmid, 1981; Sharp et al., 1984) generally had sharper transition than the recent data (Farquhar & Busch, 2017; Tcherkez et al., 2017a; Way et al., 2019) because <LATEX>C _ { a }</LATEX> has been increasing over years. However, the contribution of other factors as discussed earlier means that the Kok effect will never disappear in the future high- <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> atmosphere; instead, it will continue, but to a lesser extent.
wak1 | Our modelling analysis suggests that strong associations between the <LATEX>B _ { 1 } : B _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratio and the <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> ratio shown in Fig. 5(a) are the combined result of a dual effect of photorespiration in contributing to the Kok effect. The first-type effect is what Far- quhar & Busch (2017) discussed on the role of increasing <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> with irradiance in explaining the Kok effect, as a result of regula- tion of <LATEX>g _ { s }</LATEX> and <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } } .</LATEX> The second-type effect is what we found here - the light inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> identified after removing the first-type effect <LATEX>\mathrm { w a s }</LATEX> still positively correlated with <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> (Fig. 7). Our results suggest that the second-type effect, representing real bio- logical inhibitions, probably contributed more to the Kok effect than the first-type effect.
wtfz | Farquhar & Busch (2017) demonstrated that the first-type effect of photorespiration on the Kok effect can generate the apparent light inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> for photorespiratory conditions. As stated in the introduction, this inhibition via regulation of <LATEX>g _ { s }</LATEX> and <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> is the same as the importance that Loreto et al. (2001) emphasized for accounting for the refixation of respired CO2 when estimating <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } } .</LATEX> Loreto et al. (2001) stated that there would be no significant difference between <LATEX>R _ { 4 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d k } }</LATEX> if the refixation of respiratory CO2 during illumination is taken into account. Our results showing that, after correcting for varying <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c } ,</LATEX> light inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> only became lower but did not disappear (Fig. 6b), do not agree with the conclusion of Loreto et al. (2001). The refixation is an important means to reduce the (photo)respiratory loss under photorespiratory conditions, but its net contribution to total photosynthesis should be negligible under nonphotorespiratory conditions (Yin et al., 2020). Berghuijs et al. (2019) showed that <LATEX>R _ { d }</LATEX> estimated by the Kok method was closer to the estimate made by their model (that accounted for the refixation) under nonphotorespiratory than

(2001) was conducted with maize, a <LATEX>\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }</LATEX> species where Rubisco is expected to be surrounded by a high CO2 partial pres- sure as a result of the <LATEX>\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }</LATEX> CCM, and thus the refixation of <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> released from respiration and photorespiration should have little contribution to the total assimilation. Using 14C-labelling, Pärnik & Keerberg (1995, 2007a,b) showed that light inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> occurs even when accounting for <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> refixation. Gong et al. (2015) reported a high suppression of <LATEX>R _ { 0 }</LATEX> by light in a <LATEX>\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }</LATEX> species. If refixation does occur appreciably in <LATEX>\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }</LATEX> species as Loreto et al. stated, it may reflect the refixation more by phos- phoenolpyruvate carboxylase than by Rubisco, which might con- tribute to leakiness.
k16v | Apparent vs real light inhibition of
b2lm | <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> The suppression of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> by light has been identified using the Kok method, in many experimental studies, including recent reports based on CO2-exchange measurements (e.g. Buckley et al., 2017) or both <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> and O2-exchange measurements (e.g. Gauthier et al., 2018). Light is known to suppress the activity of enzymes that involve CO2-releasing pathways contributing to <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> (Buckley & Adams, 2011; Tcherkez et al., 2012, 2017a,b). Using the model analysis, Farquhar & Busch (2017) demonstrated that at least part of the light inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> can be generated without assuming this inhibition beforehand. Here we used the modelling approach to analyse combined CO2-exchange and Chl fluores- cence data. With such combined experimental and modelling analyses, we demonstrated quantitatively that the original Kok method that attributes the Kok effect entirely to the light inhibi- tion of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> overestimated the real inhibition (Fig. 6), as a result of ignoring the contribution of varying <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> to the Kok effect. The effect of varying <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> on the Kok method in overesti- mating the inhibition has been corrected simply by the Yin method, while the correction for varying <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> is more compli- cated. We previously stressed that both Kok and Yin methods to estimate <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> actually apply to nonphotorespiratory conditions (Yin et al., 2011a). Our analysis with Eqn 5 suggests an approach to estimate the real light suppression of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> for photorespiratory conditions, although we are unable to clarify which one of the three scenarios of suppression in Fig. 3(b-d) is most likely. Most importantly, our analysis using Eqn 5 revealed that the real sup- pression still increased with relative amounts of photorespiration (Fig. 7). While this new empirical trend receives the support from a theoretical analysis of Buckley & Adams (2011) that photores- piratory NADH may be involved in the suppression, there are probably other underlying biochemical mechanisms that merit further investigation.
