You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

xmgs | Owing to the prevalence of noise in data layers with such high resolution, most layers were smoothed using a circular mean Focal Statistics filter (Spatial Analyst in ArcGIS, ESRI, Redlands CA). This type of smoothing retains the original spatial resolution, but tends to improve classification predictions (e.g., Gottfried et al 2014) by decreasing the impact of meaningless local variation, instrument noise, and small shadows. We initially processed layers at several smoothing distances (0.5 m, 0.75 m, 1 m, 1.25 m), but we only retained layers that appeared important in preliminary models and had a Spearman correlation less than 0.95 at the reference plot locations. Once the layers were prepared, the values of all predictor layers at the location of each reference plot were extracted for model training and validation.
bd9h | 2.5. Random forest modeling
m047 | Random Forest (Breiman 2001) is a machine learning algorithm that uses ensembles ('forests') of classification or regression trees. In a Random Forest, each tree selects and permutes random subsets of predictor variables at each splitting node, which reduces overfitting and improves the strength of predictions. Additionally, Random Forest is non-parametric, models local interactions naturally, and is relatively robust against the collinearity common to ecological variables (but not perfectly; Dormann et al 2013), making it an effective tool for ecological research (e.g., Cutler et al 2007, Evans and Cushman 2009, Reese et al 2014, Belgiu and DrÄƒgu 2016).
gy8c | We implemented Random Forest using the package 'randomForest' (Liaw and Wiener 2002) along with model training tools in the package 'caret' (Kuhn 2016) in the R statistical language (R Core Team 2017).

wzno | Because the Random Forest algorithm strives to produce the best overall accuracy, it is susceptible to producing poor accuracy for small classes in imbalanced datasets. Since our input dataset was imbalanced, we used an upsampling algorithm implemented in the caret package to ensure equal weighting of each class (Chen et al 2004). The model building was an iterative process: we used out-of-bag error rates and confusion matrices from early models to determine which classes could not be differentiated, then collapsed input classes accordingly (table S1 is available online at stacks.iop.org/ERC/1/105004/mmedia) and retrained the model, seeking a balance between accuracy and retention of informative classes. The final class names and reference plot membership counts are in table 3. We also used tools in the caret package to tune the number of trees and the number of variables selected for splitting at each tree node (mtry) based on 5-fold cross-validation repeated ten times. We found that any number of trees greater than 500 and any value of mtry less than approximately 6 gave largely similar results (data not shown). The final model used 1001 trees and an mtry of 1.
xagm | 2.6. Mapping
iwn5 | After building the final Random Forest model, we applied it across the three data collection footprints using the AsciiGridPredict tool in the R package 'yaImpute' (Crookston and Finley 2007). Once the initial maps were built,
uooz | pixels in class patches smaller than 25 pixels (i.e., 1 m2) were replaced by the surrounding majority class; therefore, while the map spatial resolution is 20 cm, the minimum mapping area is 1 m2. Queen-related pixels (i.e., pixels touching only at one corner) were considered to be connected to each other, so 1 m2 patches may not appear as cohesive blocks. Minor manual cleanup was performed to correct pixels where infrastructure had been classified as vegetation on the Toolik Field Station gravel pad. Some misclassifications of other infrastructure on the landscape, such as boardwalks, remain uncorrected but are apparent to the human eye.
pxbq | To evaluate the accuracy of the map, we extracted the final mapped class at the location of each withheld test plot. From these mapped locations, we determined the overall accuracy (i.e., the proportion correct), balanced accuracy (i.e., the mean class-wise accuracy), Cohen's kappa, and Cohen's weighted (fuzzy) kappa (Cohen 1968). Like Cohen's kappa, Cohen's weighted kappa quantifies the overall agreement after accounting for agreement occurring by chance, but it also permits the investigator to subjectively indicate the degree of disagreement present (table S2). Given that vegetation classes are discrete labels that represent gradients of species abundance and structure, and given that our class labels were highly granular, it is reasonable to treat some disagreements as more or less serious in this way. For example, in most applications it would be considerably less serious to confuse Tussock Tundra with Shrubby Tussock Tundra than to confuse it with Tall Shrub. Detailed descriptions of the classes are in table S3.
jfsr | 3. Results and discussion
u15r | 3.1. Model and map accuracy
lq35 | Random Forest upsampled out-of-bag overall accuracy was 0.86, with a kappa of 0.85 and weighted kappa of 0.91 (data not shown). Based on extraction of final mapped classes for withheld test plots, overall map accuracy was 0.52, and balanced (mean class-wise) map accuracy was 0.57 (table 4). Kappa was 0.47 for the mapped withheld plots, indicating moderate agreement. Weighted kappa was considerably higher (0.65), suggesting that many disagreements were relatively minor in an ecological sense. The confusion matrix (table 4) shows that the main confusion was among shrubby classes (e.g., Shrubby Moist Non-Tussock Tundra and Low to Tall Moist Shrub) and among moist upland classes (e.g., Tussock Tundra and Moist Non-Tussock Tundra), which was expected because these classes grade into each other on the landscape. Mean user's accuracy was slightly higher than mean producer's accuracy (0.63 versus 0.57). The confusion matrix also illustrates that although the withheld test data represented 25% of all reference data, the imbalanced class sizes led to very small withheld sample sizes for small classes (as small as 4 members, mean 13); this makes the accuracy metrics more difficult to interpret, since there were relatively few opportunities to test accuracy in these smaller classes.
3g9w | 3.2. Sources of error and challenges of high-resolution mapping
d09o | The logistics of mapping at 20 cm resolution exacerbates uncertainty, especially in the context of such a finely heterogeneous landscape. At such a high resolution, unavoidable sub-meter errors in data collection and processing become important, but remain difficult to quantify. These errors might include small artifacts from imagery stitching and orthorectification; minor spatial variations in lidar ground-control adjustments; centimeter-level errors in GNSS base station location or RTK corrections; and slight mismatches in the location of a reference plot photo center and the measurement of its GNSS coordinates-any of which could displace a

a3td | reference plot into the wrong pixel and introduce noise into the modeling process. Indeed, the large difference between the value for kappa (0.47) and weighted kappa (0.65) suggests that many misclassifications are attributable to small ecological (gradient-related) offsets or locational errors in the data.
ex5k | Nonetheless, we believe that the high resolution of the maps, their relatively large extent, and the granularity of the classes offset the moderate map accuracy we were able to achieve, especially given the challenges inherent in any vegetation classification. For example, the gradient nature of vegetation communities can make class assignment for a plot ambiguous, since a given location may show characteristics of multiple vegetation communities. This might lead to two similar training plots being assigned to different classes based on an arbitrary distinction, introducing noise to the training data. The granularity of our classification scheme also increases opportunities for confusion. For example, there were five shrubby classes, many of which are structurally similar, as well as two common classes (Tussock Tundra and Moist Non-Tussock Tundra) that each had a corresponding 'Shrubby' class. These 'Shrubby' versions would only be differentiable from their non- shrubby counterparts based on the presence of sparse, low-stature shrubs (<30 cm height), which are difficult to detect in remotely sensed data. Nonetheless, we retained the granular classes because we believe the maps accurately reflect landscape vegetation patterns, and that this classification will be most valuable to map users.
9d4o | 3.3. Predictor importance
cjq2 | Although the Random Forest approach is valuable for its flexibility and robustness, it provides only limited options for ecological interpretation of results. Variable importance metrics are derived by examining how much the accuracy (both class-wise and overall) changes when the model is run iteratively with the values of each predictor permuted (i.e., randomly reordered among plots). However, variable importance metrics become less meaningful when input variables are highly correlated (Nicodemus et al 2010, Kuhn and Johnson 2013, Raschka and Mirjalili 2017), as they are in this study, so it is not advisable to interpret the variable importance values rigorously in this case.
5esx | With that caveat, some results are interesting (table S4). For example, lidar intensity was important to accuracy for several classes, with standard deviation of intensity especially important for very wet vegetated classes (Raised Areas in Wet Tundra, Wet Tundra), where the occurrence of intermixed high- and low-intensity pixels could indicate areas of intermixed vegetation and saturated microsites. Intensity smoothed at 1 m was the predictor with the largest impact on the overall Gini purity index (not shown) and was especially important for very dry vegetated classes (Dry Exposed Tundra, Dry Sheltered Tundra) where intensity would be high, and for Water, where intensity would be low. This adds to emerging evidence that lidar intensity can be an important ecological metric (Eitel et al 2016).
m5ka | Greenness indices (NDVI, DSI, 2GRBI) were important for predicting all shrubby classes, as would be expected, and coarse-scale topographic position was important for predicting Low to Tall Moist Shrub, which generally occurs in low-lying streambed areas. Unsurprisingly, lidar-derived canopy height metrics were important for predicting Tall Shrub, and heat load index was important for predicting Moist Snowbed-but it
byu8 | was somewhat more surprising that percent red appeared important for predicting wet tundra classes (Wet Tundra, Raised Areas in Wet Tundra) and moist upland tundra classes (Moist snowbed, Tussock Tundra, Moist Non-Tussock Tundra), perhaps owing to a comparatively high degree of red absorption by both water and plants in those areas. The standard deviation of the panchromatic (R + G + B), although not at all important for most classes, was highly important for predicting Tussock Tundra, where high values may have indicated the distinctive speckled image texture created by tussock shadows. Indeed, in our early modeling attempts, which

zxz6 | employed 1 m spatial resolution rather than 20 cm, we found that models could not distinguish tussock tundra from non-tussock tundra, perhaps owing to dilution of this signal when averaged over a larger area.
xnth | Overall, in a list of 15 most important predictors per class, all 33 predictors appear for at least one class (table S4); in a list of the five most important variables per class, only seven predictors fail to appear for at least one class (hue_sd, swi_05, swi_1, ws_05, ws_1, tpi_25, and tpi_50). Although this may be due in part to the correlated nature of many of the predictor variables, the wide variety of variables appearing as important for different classes also suggests the complicated interrelationships between vegetation communities and their ecological drivers.
vafm | 3.4. Mapping
2zmw | The final maps are 4-bit unsigned integer 20 cm resolution rasters. Figure 2 shows the full extent of the Toolik map; figure 3 shows a detail from an area within the larger Toolik footprint. Full extents of the Pipeline and Imnavait maps are shown in figures 4 and 5, respectively. Details from the Pipeline and Imnavait maps are included in the supplemental material (figures S1-S2). Minor flight-line artifacts are visible in a few areas, most notably in the southern portion of the Imnavait footprint; these artifacts are likely the result of sun-sensor geometry interacting with the vegetation canopy and the slope of the terrain, potentially along with slight inconsistencies in cloud cover between flight overpasses. The effect appears to cause some tussock tundra areas to be classified as Shrubby Moist Non-Tussock Tundra, presumably because the effect increased the apparent

ibgs | 4. Conclusion
colo | This project combined predictor datasets derived from two airborne sensors in a machine learning approach that permitted the construction of very high-resolution validated vegetation classification maps based on simple ground reference data. The approach highlights the ability of high-quality airborne data to produce very high- resolution geospatial data products over relatively large areas, providing an important link between limited- extent ground- and UAS-based remote sensing products and coarser geospatial data products covering larger extents. The maps should prove to be a valuable resource for Arctic researchers requiring fine-scale reference data for these important research landscapes.
