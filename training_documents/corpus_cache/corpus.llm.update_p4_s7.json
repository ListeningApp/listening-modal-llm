        "content": "bbpr | Three point three Follow-up and seizure outcome\n5zyf | Follow-up after the primary CC was two to one hundred ninety-one months (median equals forty-two point four, I Q R equals sixteen to eighty-five). The number of ASMs at the last follow-up after the primary CC procedure was similar to that prior to CC (three point three plus or minus one point three after versus three point three one point two before CC). Seizure outcomes are presented in Table two. Overall, eighty-three percent had at least a fifty percent reduction in drop attacks, and a sixty\n9own | percent reduction in other seizures. Comparing the outcomes between anterior callosotomy and complete callosotomy (including a one or two stage complete callosotomy), extent of disconnection did not significantly affect drop attack control (considering a fifty percent and an eighty percent cutoff, and using the chi-squared test). For \"other seizure types,\" a complete callosotomy was significantly associated with a better outcome when compared to anterior callosotomy using the fifty percent cutoff (P equals point zero one three) but not using the eighty percent cutoff.\nbqfb | Outcomes of drop attack control following CC were compared to VNS outcomes according to degree of seizure reduction categories: less than fifty percent, between fifty percent and eighty percent, and greater than eighty percent. To verify that sufficient time had elapsed since placing VNS, we focused on patients with one to two-year follow-up after VNS (prior to CC, N equals twenty-seven), and patients with greater than two years follow-up after VNS (prior to CC, N equals sixty). Using the Fisher exact test, the degree of drop attack reduction following CC was not significantly correlated to the degree of reduction after VNS (P equals point six seven six for one to two years, and P equals point two six six for greater than two years following the VNS before CC).\nwwdt | In addition to the ten cases undergoing completion of the posterior CC, ten patients underwent additional surgeries: frontal lobectomy (N equals one), responsive neurostimulation system (RNS) concurrently with the completion of CC (N equals one), and deep brain stimulation to the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus (N equals eight, three of which had an RNS to the CM nucleus).\nmn1r | Four DISCUSSION -\n5vqw | We report here that in children with LGS who fail to achieve seizure control after VNS, CC has an added value, significantly improving seizure control. This is true for drop (tonic and atonic) seizures and other seizure phenotypes. CC-related morbidity was low, and complete CC was associated with higher seizure reduction rates than partial CC.\nmeyw | Prior studies have reported the greater value of CC over VNS as a primary treatment for children with LGS,\n2e62 | especially for atonic seizures. However, other studies have found similar effectiveness for both treatments. Additionally, VNS seems more cost-effective one year after surgery and is associated with fewer complications. However, this study did not evaluate long-term cost-effectiveness (considering the need for VNS battery replacement), which may prove CC is more cost-effective. When both options (CC and VNS) are available, many families will opt for VNS first. Reasons include avoidance of brain surgery, especially because the treatment is palliative and not curative. This is based mainly on the fear of callosotomy-associated risks, including vascular injury, supplementary motor area syndrome, akinetic mutism, disconnection syndrome, and other risks (infection, hydrocephalus, wound-related, and others).\n75y3 | Data are limited regarding secondary treatments (CC following VNS or VNS following CC). Hong et al. reported that half of the patients who underwent CC following VNS reported greater than fifty percent seizure reduction, with seven of nine patients experiencing total elimination of drop seizures. Guillamon et al. reported a small case series of three patients treated with CC following VNS in severe drug-resistant epilepsy. They reported up to ninety-eight percent decrease in total seizure frequency following CC. In another small series of seven cases, Arya et al. reported all patients were free of drop attacks, with a thirty-four point seven percent decrease in total daily seizure frequency at a mean follow-up of two point six years. The results of the current series concur with these publications, with approximately eighty percent having greater than fifty percent reduction in drop attacks, and sixty percent having greater than fifty percent reduction in other seizure types.\ns2g2 | Katagiri et al. evaluated ten children who underwent VNS following failed CC, the reverse of our approach. Six of ten (sixty percent) patients had greater than or equal to fifty percent seizure reduction for all residual seizure types after VNS, and seventy-seven point eight percent showed total resolution of drop seizures.\nq1q2 | CC may be performed via various approaches, including interhemispheric, endoscopic-assisted (also done via the interhemispheric route), and LITT. LITT approach is minimally invasive, associated with shorter hospitalization and fewer complications, and has similar outcomes to the open approaches. However, LITT is not widely available, and may not be suitable for all corpus callosal anatomy. Open CC, on the other hand, is a widely performed surgery. The microsurgical technique is common to other commonly performed procedures, and is associated with low morbidity if done by experienced surgeons.\ncb7r | There is a long-lasting debate regarding the optimal extent of callosotomy between anterior, complete, and posterior callosotomy. The basis for this debate is the potential for disconnection syndrome. However, most children with LGS have profound intellectual disability at baseline, and the balance between seizure control (with\n68xu | its positive impact on the quality of life) and the risk of potential disconnection syndrome often favor the goal of seizure control.\nhd35 | This study aim was not to compare CC to VNS as a primary treatment, but to show that VNS failure does not predict the failure of CC, and that CC as the secondary treatment can have a significant benefit.",
