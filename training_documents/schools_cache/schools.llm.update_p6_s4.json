        "content": "hd35 | This literature not only synthesized current school leadership practices, but also pointed out the direction of future inquiry and capacity development for leadership culturally diversity, responsiveness, and social justice. And while we appreciate extant attempts to define culture as part of the context for empirical study, we see the need to extend and enhance this work theoretically and empirically in light of the contemporary situation of increasing cultural diversity among students. For this, we draw primarily on the work of Pierre Bourdieu as well as Lingard and Christie, two scholars who have applied Bourdieu's theories to educational leadership.\n2zpk | Four point one. Leadership Approaches from Social Theories\nepu7 | Beyond ISLDN, a growing number of educational leadership scholars have proposed leadership approaches in schools aimed at societal transformation, most often using various critical theory lenses that expand functionalist organizational theory and the role of leadership. Here scholars seek to explain and promote individual school leaders and social justice work in schools. Drawing on empirical findings and other scholarly models or approaches, Shields highlighted the differences among the three approaches that have dominated the educational leadership field for three decades, transactional, transformational, and transformative leadership. According to Shields, transactional leadership involves a reciprocal transaction; transformational leadership focuses on improving organizational qualities, dimensions, and effectiveness; and transformative leadership begins by challenging inappropriate uses of power and privilege by challenging inappropriate uses of power and privilege that create or perpetuate inequity and injustice. In Shields' approach to transformative leadership, the fundamental task is to ask questions, for example, about the purposes of schooling, about which ideas should be taught\n7od1 | A Bourdieusian Approach to Educational Leadership ...\n0bqy | and about who is successful. Her critique lays the groundwork for the promise of schooling that is more inclusive, democratic, and equitable for more students.\nb780 | Transformative leadership, therefore, recognizes the need to begin with critical reflection and analysis and to move through enlightened understanding to action-action to redress wrongs and to ensure that all members of the organization are provided with as level a playing field as possible-not only with respect to access but also with regard to academic, social and civic outcomes.\nccmb | Shields argues for a careful and consistent deconstruction of old knowledge frameworks that perpetuated deficit thinking and inequity, creating new frameworks of inclusion and equity that undergirded the continuous improvement mentality. Although Shields enhances leadership approaches to include aims toward social transformation, we still do not see the educational leadership literature as complete in terms of understanding leadership practice in a cultural context.\nma93 | Other scholars have proposed transformative leadership approaches to shed light on how the school social and cultural context influences the operation of effectiveness in elementary schools. In our view, the significance of their findings is limited in terms of explicit explanations of students' social and cultural capital in instructional improvement programs and leadership as it emerged from the effective schools' literature. Besides focus on the development of curriculum, the following studies indicate the characteristics of transformative leaders.\nc6hh | Transformative principals develop a clear school mission, monitor student progress, protect instructional time from interruptions, and maintain high standards for teachers and students. Dimmock and Walker aligned school leadership with reflection of strategic intents, values, and connectivity, emphasizing the importance social-cultural context in contemporary multiethnic communities. Research regarding knowledge-based educational leadership and management drew on the way school context (community, socio-cultural, political, and economic) influences leadership practice, thus illustrating the nature of successful leadership practice. Khalifa also discusses culturally responsive school leadership and argues that culture plays a significant role in shaping the thinking, behaviors, and practices of school leaders and other school stakeholders. Theoharis' concept of social justice leadership illustrates how principals develop and sustain their social justice work in order to lead their schools to transform and to benefit the marginalized students. Hallinger's systematic review of research on educational leadership and management in Africa shows the increasing need to diversify the corpus of studies beyond the traditional Anglo-American centers of knowledge production. We see Bourdieu's theories and thinking tools as a way to diversify the corpus of studies beyond the Anglo-American centers of knowledge production as we shall discuss below.\ny7ea | Five. Bourdieu's 'Thinking Tools'\nnav4 | Many education researchers know Pierre Bourdieu for his work on social and cultural reproduction. For example, Bourdieu describes how schools are not agents of social mobility but rather perpetuate existing societal inequalities. According to Bourdieu, the concepts of habitus, capital, and field are integral in understanding practice. Bourdieu explained that practice was the complex interplay of these main concepts. These concepts help make sense of the relationship between objective social structures like institutions and everyday practice.\ngem8 | Six. Habitus\ne8nr | Bourdieu describes habitus as \"socialized subjectivity\". Bourdieu suggests that through the experiences of everyday life social agents unconsciously adopt the norms of the society. In society, social practices are characterized by regularities despite there being no explicit rules that dictate these practices. Conceptions of what is right and/or appropriate become embedded, instinctive patterns of thought and behavior. According to Bourdieu, habitus constitutes,\nk78w | Systems of durable, transposable dispositions, structured structures predisposed to function as structuring structures, that is, as principles which generate and organize practices and representations that can be objectively adapted to their outcomes without presupposing a conscious aiming at ends or an express mastery of the operations necessary in order to attain them.\ng9du | To Bourdieu, habitus constrains but does not determine thought and action; it operates at the subconscious level. Bourdieu writes, \"The schemes of the habitus, the primary forms of classification, owe their specific efficacy to the fact that they function below the level of consciousness and language, beyond the reach of introspective scrutiny or control by the will\". For Bourdieu, habitus defines the dispositions through which we perceive and act in the world through lasting exposure to particular social conditions and conditionings. The habitus is not just the producer of actions, but it is a product of the structural conditions a social agent encounters. Bourdieu also describes habitus as a \"feel for the game\" or a \"second sense\" that equips social agents with practical knowledge to navigate the social field.\nf682 | The concept of habitus confronted organizational theorists' assumptions that individuals and organizations make rational decisions. According to Bourdieu the theorists ignored the socio-economic conditions that shaped the actions they take. Bourdieu concludes that habitus is the result of social conditionings or history but it can be transformed as it encounters different types of fields.\nli1k | A Bourdieusian Approach to Educational Leadership ...",
