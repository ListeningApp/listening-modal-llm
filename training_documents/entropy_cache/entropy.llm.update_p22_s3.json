Indeed, people often get sloppy and say dX 'is' Lebesgue measure, and I may do that too. By the way, Lebesgue measure is one where we cannot take mathcal M to be the collection of all subsets of\n4vdi | real numbers. There is an extensive theory of measures. We will not need it here, but if you're interested, you can try a book like Halsey Royden's Real Analysis, where I learned the basics myself, or Terry Tao's An Introduction to Measure Theory, which has a legal free version online.\nkl0p | Here are some puzzles about measures.\nczi9 | Puzzle ten. Let X be any set and define mathcal M to be the collection of all subsets of X. Show that there is a measure m from mathcal M to zero to infinity called counting measure such that for any S subset of X, m of S is the number of elements of S, infinity S is infinite.\na3sj | Puzzle eleven. Let X be any set and define mathcal M as before. Suppose p is a probability distribution on X, meaning a function p from X to zero to infinity with the sum over i in X of p of i equals one. Show that there is a probability measure m from mathcal M to zero to infinity such that for any\nfhkc | S subset of X, m of S equals the sum over i in S of p of i. In this situation, we usually write p of i as p sub i and call it the probability of the outcome i in X. For any S subset of M we call m of S the probability of the event\n5hcr | S. In the next puzzles, X is any set, mathcal M obeys the three rules for a collection of measurable subsets of X, and m from mathcal M to zero to infinity is a measure.\nem55 | Puzzle twelve. Show that if S, T in mathcal M then the union S cup T is in\n8x5q | mathcal M. Puzzle thirteen. Show that if S, T in mathcal M then the intersection S cap T is in\nwv87 | mathcal M. Puzzle fourteen. Show that if S sub i in mathcal M for i equals one, two, and so on then the intersection over i equals one to infinity S sub i is in mathcal M. Puzzle fifteen. Show that if S, T in mathcal M and S subset of T then\n97h8 | m of S is less than or equal to m of T. Puzzle sixteen. Show that if S sub i in mathcal M for i equals one, two, and so on then\ncj29 | m of the union over i equals one to infinity S sub i is less than or equal to the sum over i equals one to infinity m of S sub i. Puzzle seventeen. Show that if m is a probability measure and S in mathcal M then\nekqn | zero less than or equal to m of S less than or equal to one. One of the main uses of a measure m on a space X is that it lets us integrate certain functions f from X to real numbers. Alas, not all functions! It's only reasonable to try to integrate measurable functions f from X to real numbers, which have the property that if S subset of real numbers is measurable, its inverse image f inverse of S subset of X is measurable. And even measurable functions can cause trouble, because when we try to integrate them we might get positive infinity, negative infinity, or something even worse. For example, what's\nhi3b | the integral over all X of X squared sin X dX? There's no good answer. We say a function f from X to real numbers is integrable if it is measurable and its integral over X, defined in a certain way I won't explain here, gives a well-defined real number.\n3my4 | Shannon entropy: a first taste.\nwizx | When you learn an event of probability p has happened, the amount of information you get is negative log p.\n```",
