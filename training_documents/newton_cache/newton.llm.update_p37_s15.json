It follows that MINRES always selects D sub type equals S O L step.\n3blu | The result follows from the step size selection procedure in Algorithm four and the analysis in the S O L case of Lemma C.1.\nxv2l | Building on Lemma E.1, our next result, Lemma E.3, will show that, close enough to X sub star, the active set update will be large enough and the inactive set update small enough that the zero bound constraints at x sub K plus one coincide with the zero bound constraints at X star, i.e., curly A left parenthesis x sub K plus one comma zero right parenthesis equals curly A left parenthesis x superscript star comma zero right parenthesis. The intuition for this result is that the gradient and hence the step in the inactive indices should be going to zero as x sub K approaches X sub star. By contrast, in the active set, a non-degeneracy condition (Assumption three point eleven) ensures there is positive gradient in the active indices arbitrarily close to the boundary. When curly A left parenthesis x sub K plus one comma zero right parenthesis equals curly A left parenthesis x superscript star comma zero right parenthesis, the fixed active set and small inactive step can also be used to ensure that our iterates do not drift too far from the starting point. This is the second part of Lemma E.3.\nxt4k | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimization with Nonnegativity Constraints\nti78 | Lemma E.3. Suppose that f satisfies Assumption three point one. Let X sub two be a local minima satisfying Assumptions three point eleven and three point twelve. If delta is chosen according to, then the following two results hold:\nk5pk | One.
