Thus, one can suppose the formation of excimer molecules like open parenthesis M-OH close parenthesis star, M two star, and open parenthesis M.H two O close parenthesis star.\ncp13 | The decomposition of the ArOH star excimer is accompanied by the emission at three hundred ten, three hundred sixteen, and three hundred eighteen nanometers and of ArHO star open parenthesis excimer close parenthesis at three hundred forty nanometers:\nbgre | Ar plus O H star right arrow ArOH star open parenthesis A r e H O star close parenthesis right arrow right arrow Ar plus O H plus h nu (six)\n57lp | Thus, these particles can contribute to the light emission of the spectra of water sonoluminescence.\nukth | The continuum of the spectra originates from the radiative stabilization of a quasimolecule formed by the reaction\nkpvt | H plus O H plus M right arrow open bracket H minus O H minus M close bracket sharp right arrow H two O plus M plus h nu quad open parenthesis lambda approximately four hundred nanometers close parenthesis (seven)\njie2 | where sharp denotes the vibrational excited complex molecule.\nd0ik | Consider the possible addition to the SL spectra of the excited atoms and molecules of noble gases. The M two star excimers radiate in broad-band emission with the maximum in the ultraviolet field. This maximum shifts to a short-wave region with the decrease in atomic weight of a gas. For example, the maximum is situated at one hundred seventy nanometers for xenon and at one hundred twenty-six nanometers for argon. The bands at one hundred ninety-five nanometers (argon), two hundred twenty nanometers (krypton), and three hundred nanometers (xenon) originate from the reaction of ion-electron recombination like\n0x0s | right arrow X star star or X plus plus e minus right arrow X star open parenthesis cubed P one, two close parenthesis thirty-five Such prominent bands in the SL spectra of noble gas-saturated water were not discovered (see Figure one and references). This supports, in our mind, the opinion that electrical phenomena are not major in the mechanism of a cavitation light emission.\n4exe | The continuum in the near-ultraviolet field with the maximum at two hundred ten nanometers (argon) or two hundred seventy nanometers open parenthesis krypton close parenthesis is formed by the transitions\n0myz | X two star star equals X two star plus h nu (eight)\nxh3i | Note that the maximum of the emission shifts to a longer wave region with the increase in atomic weight of noble gas. Thus, it is impossible to explain the results of Figure one by reaction eight as we observed an opposite dependence: the maxima in the spectra are shifted to the short-wave field with the increase in atomic weight of noble gas (Figure one).\nsyiw | The lines of noble gas in the spectra of SL were not also discovered before. This can be a consequence of two causes. First, the excitation energy of noble gases is higher than that one of water; thus, the temperature inside the cavitation bubble is not high enough for the formation of excited molecules or atoms of noble gases. Second, water molecules quench effectively the excited states of noble gas atoms.\nkg3t | Thus, the continuum in the spectra is formed by fast transition open parenthesis approximately ten to the power of negative twelve seconds to the power of thirty-two close parenthesis C tilde one B one right arrow right arrow A tilde one B one (reaction four b) and by the recombination (seven). Note that the vibrational excited water molecules can also be formed by reaction one.\nlvae | It is still not clear what kind of species emits the light at wavelengths below three hundred ten nanometers.

Probably, authors of that paper assumed that the emission originates by two-body collision with the radiative stabilization of the product:\nzh03 | H plus O H right arrow H two O star right arrow H two O plus h nu (ten)",
