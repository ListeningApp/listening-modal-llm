You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

o2kr | Topic 1 - Feeding and digestion - invertebrates
v6sk | Introduction
1wj6 | In this lecture we will examine feeding and digestion of the two groups of invertebrates that are the most significant in aquaculture: decapod crustaceans and bivalve molluscs. We will also examine the storage of digested nutrients: their composition, location and seasonal variations. The nutrient composition of food will be referred to (e.g., peptides, amino acids, lipids, triacylglycerols, amylose and amylopectin), this forming a necessary part of understanding digestion and assimilation. These nutrients will be discussed in much greater detail in Topic 3, so you may wish to re-read this lecture in the light of knowledge gained later.
936l | CRUSTACEANS
06yq | The most cultured group of decapod crustaceans are shrimp. These can be filter feeders, scavengers and predators; they are classified as herbivores, carnivores and omnivores. In the wild, or in extensive and semi- intensive aquaculture, shrimp eat other species of crustaceans, annelids, molluscs, echinoderms, nematodes, fish tissue, insects, seeds, algae, macrophytes (an aquatic plant that grows in water) vegetable matter and detritus (Figueiredo & Anderson, 2009; Focken et al., 1998). In extensive and semi-intensive pond-cultured shrimp, the naturally available food organisms can dominate over the externally applied feed (Nunes et al., 1997; Nunes & Parsons, 2000).
dpv6 | 1. Feeding
8r5j | The external feeding appendages, the pereiopods and the mandibles (jaws) are involved in feeding behaviour (Maynard & Sallee, 1970) (Fig. 1).
2taz | Fig. 1. General anatomy of a penaeid prawn.
o3ya | The antennae and antennules are used as feelers or sensory feelers. The maxillipeds are used to rip food apart before it is moved into the mandible where it is crushed and devoured.
r5il | Crustaceans detect chemicals produced by food using small cuticular sense organs called sensilla. Two types of sensilla are involved in this process: bimodal sensilla and unimodal sensilla called aesthetascs (Schmidt & DeForest Jr., 2011). Bimodal sensilla contain both mechanoreceptor and chemoreceptor neurones whose dendrites terminate in a pore at the tip of a seta. These organs are present on the body and all appendages. Aesthetascs contain numerous neurones whose branched dendrites fill the lumen of a tube-like seta. They are found only on the outer flagellum of the antennules and provide input into the olfactory lobes of the brain.

tzt3 | Once food has been identified remotely and the animal has moved adjacent to it, the pereiopods and the mouthparts locate the food via their own chemo- and mechanosensory setae and then grasp, manipulate, crush and transport it to the mouth (Derby, 1982; Derby & Atema, 1982a; 1982b; Derby & Harpaz, 1988). Postlarvae may also use their mouthparts to capture suspended particulate food.
t8vv | The sense of taste (gustation) is present in most, if not all, of the crustacean appendages. A substance is tasted by a hair-like hollow structure, the sensillum, that houses gustatory neurones (Reinhard, 2010). What distinguishes gustation from olfaction is that in the former, the material requires to be in direct contact with the sensory organ. The mouthparts provide the final check of food quality before ingestion since food that has been accepted by the pereiopods may be subsequently rejected after handling by the mouthparts (Derby et al., 1984).
qvnu | Food is masticated by the external, toothed maxillipeds and mandibles before being swallowed. It then enters the cardiac pocket of the stomach via peristaltic waves of the relatively short oesophagus.
kggw | 2. Digestive system
xrd1 | The alimentary canal of decapods is a tubular structure, which begins with an anteroventral mouth, runs dorsally along the body and terminates in the anus, located in the base of the telson Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.
5746 | Fig. 2. The digestive system of a penaeid prawn. The hepatopancreas is not shown.
7toz | The digestive system is divided into three distinct regions: foregut, midgut and hindgut (Felgenhauer, 1992; Icely & Nott, 1992). The foregut is lined with a thin cuticle and comprises the mouth, the oesophagus and the stomach. The midgut comprises the intestine and associated organs: the hepatopancreas (digestive gland or midgut gland) and the midgut caeca. The relative length of the midgut varies considerably between decapod groups (Smith, 1978). The hindgut, like the foregut, is lined with cuticle and forms a muscular rectum that leads to the anus.

4i0e | 2.1 The foregut
h2l3 | When the sensory receptors within the oesophagus are stimulated, they cause a rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the oesophageal muscles which move the food into the anterior chamber of the stomach (the cardiac stomach or pocket) (Robertson & Laverack, 1979). The cardiac stomach serves as a storage area, its relative size varying between species. Food is passed from this storage area to the masticating parts of the gastric mill (Fig. 4).
dfzb | Fig. 4. The digestive system of a penaeid prawn. Detail of foregut.
u6ty | The epidermis of the cardiac pocket is associated with the exoskeleton and participates in the periodic moulting process. The epidermis secretes sclerotized, cuticular structures which are often calcified. These structures are moved by individual muscles located outside the stomach wall and receive their own specific innervation. The gastric mill of the cardiac pocket grinds the food into a soup of fine particles. Particles are circulated and undergo further mastication until they are fine enough to pass into the pyloric stomach via the cardiopyloric valve.
awvu | The pyloric stomach squeezes material through the more dorsal aspects of the pyloric filtering apparatus and final filtration is performed by the more ventral gland filters. This filtration ensures that the hepatopancreas does not become clogged by large particles. In the lobster, such particles need to be less than 1 um diameter (Bayer et al., 1979).
on9b | The lining of the stomach, particularly in the pyloric region, is invaginated suggesting that some digestion may take place although transit time is short (under a minute). Macerated food is passed to the midgut where it is further digested and most nutrients are absorbed.
a8ge | 2.2 The midgut
h27a | The intestine of the midgut consists of a simple columnar epithelium which is folded longitudinally and its surface area is increased by the presence of microvilli. Three organs are associated with the midgut: the anterior and posterior midgut caeca and the hepatopancreas (or digestive gland). The midgut caeca consist of blind-ending tubules that connect to the lumen of the midgut. Decapod crustaceans usually possess a pair of anterior caeca that arise laterally, one on either side of the anterior midgut and a single posterior caecum that arises dorsally close to the junction between the midgut and the hindgut (Smith, 1978). These caeca appear to play only a minor role in digestion and osmoregulation (Holliday et al., 1980) although Mykles (1980) has reported that they are significant in the uptake of water during ecdysis. Recent evidence suggests that the caeca are involved in endocrine regulation of feeding behaviour (Christie et al., 2007).

m047 | The midgut is connected to the hepatopancreas, so named because it combines the functions of the vertebrate liver and pancreas. The hepatopancreas forms a pair of glands on either side of the stomach where it occupies a large proportion of the cephalothorax (Fig. 5).
gy8c | The hepatopancreas is also known as the midgut gland or digestive gland. This organ is particularly large in decapod crustaceans, where it makes up 2-6% of the body mass (Brockerhoff & Hoyle, 1967; Stewart et al., 1967). The colour of the hepatopancreas is variable (e.g., brown, red, green, yellow) depending on the pigments that it contains. Each half of the hepatopancreas consists of a cluster of ducts that subdivide into small tubules that make up the glandular mass. The primary duct of each gland opens into the midgut. Digested food and secretions exchange between the gland and the midgut as a result of the peristaltic action of circular and longitudinal muscles.
y4mj | The hepatopancreas is responsible for the secretion of digestive enzymes, the absorption of nutrients, the storage of energy reserves and the transport of monovalent and divalent ions. Digestive enzymes are synthesised in the F-cells (fibrillar cells) and accumulate in the B-cells (blister-like cells) (Sousa et al., 2005; Vogt et al., 1989).
vpgq | The products of digestion are absorbed and stored by the hepatopancreas. This tubular system has a single layer of epithelial cells that facilitate rapid trans-cellular nutrient transport to the haemolymph. Two of the cell types of the hepatopancreas, the R- (resorptive cells) and F-cells, are equipped with microvilli, indicating absorptive functions. Epithelial cells of the intestinal ceca, present in several shrimp species, also have well organized microvilli (Ceccaldi, 1997). The midgut intestine is capable of absorbing nutrients such as amino acids and glucose but this is relatively minor compared to the role played by the hepatopancreas (Ahearn, 1974; Ahearn & Maginniss, 1977; Gibson & Barker, 1979b).
ousl | Significant sodium-dependent glucose and glutamate uptake and non-sodium-dependent alanine and lysine uptake has been demonstrated in crustacean hepatopancreas; transport rates are several orders of magnitude greater than those of the intestine (Ahearn & Clay, 1987; Ahearn et al., 1985; Verri et al., 2001).
m4ju | Experiments on penaeids have revealed that R- (resorptive cells) and B-cells of the hepatopancreas possess different types of glucose transport mechanisms with B cells showing a Na+-dependent sugar transport process and R cells showing a Na+-independent sugar carrier system (Blaya et al., 1998; Verri et al., 2001; Vilella et al., 1998). Simmons et al. (2012) found that, in the hepatopancreas of the White shrimp, Litopenaeus setiferus, sodium, potassium, and metallic cations such as zinc and manganese may stimulate the absorption of D-glucose, L-leucine and L-histidine by independent carrier-mediated transport processes. These mechanisms use the gradient of one solute's concentration to force the other molecule or ion against its gradient. Such mechanisms are known as cotransporters.
a0mb | The activities of several membrane transporters in the hepatopancreas are pH-dependent (Verri et al., 2001). This has been demonstrated for the Na+ -D-glucose cotransporter, the Na+ /Cl- /L-alanine cotransporter, the Na+ /2Cl- /L-

xagm | leucine cotransporter and the Na+ /Cl- /L-glutamate cotransporter. The low pH in the hepatopancreatic lumen facilitates nutrient influx into the epithelial cells.
iwn5 | Undigested residues from the hepatopancreas are passed back to the midgut intestine and combine with material that was diverted away from the hepatopancreas opening. This material is compacted in the intestine where water and ions are removed and transported across the epithelium.
uooz | The hepatopancreas also releases an insulin-like factor in lobsters and probably other decapod crustaceans (Sanders, 1983a). This factor increases glycogenesis in lobster muscle (Sanders, 1983b) but is not released in response to a rise in glucose in the haemolymph nor does it reduce haemolymph glucose levels (Sanders, 1983c).
pxbq | In some decapods, such as the marine Carcinus maenas and Cancer pagurus, and the freshwater crab Paratelphusa hydrodomous, calcium and phosphate are accumulated by the hepatopancreas during the pre-moult period and stored as calcium phosphate granules (Greenaway, 1985).
jfsr | 2.3 The hindgut
u15r | Digestion is completed in several hours and indigestible matter passes into the peritrophic membrane of the midgut. The faecal pellet is contained in this tube, which is grasped by the rectal pads and extruded at intervals in lengths equal to that of the midgut. Infolding of the basal membrane in the hindgut epithelial cells as well as folding of the entire epithelium allow for stretching of the hindgut lining under faecal loading.
lq35 | The cells lining the short hindgut appear to be specialized for cation transport (Mykles, 1980), but their specific functional role in nutrition has yet to be defined. Since the hindgut is lined with cuticle, it is unlikely to absorb digestive materials (van Weel, 1955). It may be involved in water transport (see the section on osmoregulation), but again its role must be limited due to the cuticular lining. The rectum is probably also the means by which the external medium is pumped into the midgut but, again, the function of this rectal pumping has not been firmly established.
3g9w | 3. Digestive enzymes
d09o | The pH of digestive fluids is acidic (about pH 5) (Hoyle, 1973) which favours the activities of the various enzymes involved in digestion. The shrimp stomach, which is covered in a chitin layer, does not secrete acid or enzymes, although its contents often show digestive enzyme activities, some of which may derive from the hepatopancreas and some from food animals.
