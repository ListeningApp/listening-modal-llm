        "content": "vcu3 | Next, we use induction, applying Lemma twenty point one with X equals X of i given Y of one to i minus one and Y equals Y of i given y of one to i minus one. The data model has the property that Y of i is independent of Y of k for k less than i, so Y of i given y of one to i minus one equals Y of i. According to Lemma twenty point one,\nhjzj | mu sub i given i equals mu sub i given i minus one plus K sub i times y of i minus H sub i mu sub i given i minus one, equation twenty point nineteen,\nj79f | where the Kalman gain matrix\n6tbv | K sub i is given by K sub i equals Sigma sub i given i minus one H sub i transposed times H sub i transposed Sigma sub i given i minus one H sub i plus R sub i inverse, equation twenty point twenty,\nxb13 | provided the matrix inverses all exist. The term y of i minus H sub i mu sub i given i minus one is called the innovation and is conceptually similar to an anomaly in climate science. Also from Lemma twenty point one, the filtering covariance matrix is\ncxqi | Sigma sub i given i equals I minus K sub i H sub i Sigma sub i given i minus one, equation twenty point twenty-one.\nqfmx | \nrut3 | Twenty point six. Numerical Example\nm3cp | The Kalman filter algorithm is obtained by alternating the forecasting and filtering step, just as in the general Algorithm twenty point one.\nmq4s | Algorithm twenty point three, Kalman filter. Given\n95el | (i) a prior distribution\na0a5 | X of zero follows a normal distribution with mean mu and covariance Sigma, (ii) the process model\ngocl | equation twenty point sixteen, and (iii) the linear data model twenty point seventeen,\nob1z | the following algorithm gives the forecasting distributions f sub X of i given y of one to i minus one and filtering distributions\nm4cb | f sub X of i given y of i. Step one. The forecasting and filtering distributions of X of one are given\nm61y | by X of one follows a normal distribution with mean mu sub one given zero and covariance Sigma sub one given zero, X of one given y of one follows a normal distribution with mean mu sub one given one and covariance Sigma sub one given one. Step two. Suppose i is in the set two, three, up to N and the filtering distribution at time step i minus one is known, X of i minus one given y of one to i minus one follows a normal distribution with mean mu sub i minus one given i minus one and covariance Sigma sub i minus one given i minus one. Then the forecasting and filtering distributions at time step i are given by\nu2ob | X of i given y of one to i minus one follows a normal distribution with mean mu sub i given i minus one and covariance Sigma sub i given i minus one, X of i given y of i follows a normal distribution with mean mu sub i given i and covariance Sigma sub i given i, where Mu sub i given i minus one, mu sub i given i, K sub i, Sigma sub i given i minus one, and Sigma sub i given i are computed from equations twenty point eighteen, twenty point nineteen, and twenty point twenty-one.\n2gnm | The data influence only the forecasting and filtering means but not the variance matrices which, in principle, can all be computed in advance. In practical applications, the problem of computing or estimating the covariance matrices becomes important. For those i for which no observations are available, the filtering distribution and the forecasting distribution agree.\nemgw | The basic reanalysis Algorithm twenty point two can also be rewritten in terms of matrix operations for this situation.\nxaqt | Twenty point six - Numerical Example\n5rcb | The following numerical example illustrates the results of Kalman filtering and reanalysis. The example uses the one-dimensional process model x sub i equals alpha x sub i minus one plus xi sub i for i equals one up to thirty, where alpha equals zero point eight and\n524j | xi sub i follows a normal distribution with mean zero and variance q squared, where q equals zero point four. The value x sub zero is drawn from a standard normal distribution. A typical sequence is plotted in black in Figure twenty point two. The data model is y sub i equals b sub i x sub i plus zeta sub i, where",
