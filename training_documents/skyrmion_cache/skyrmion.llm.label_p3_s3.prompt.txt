You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

xmgs | <LATEX>J < 0 .</LATEX> Beyond a critical system diameter of <LATEX>L \approx 8 a ,</LATEX> we find val- <LATEX>\mathrm { l e s } \mathrm { o f } D</LATEX> and <LATEX>B</LATEX> for which the ground state of the Hamiltonian <LATEX>\widehat { H }</LATEX> hosts skyrmion-like spin textures confined in the interior (bulk) of the lattice, which we display in Fig. 2. We checked that these skyrmion wave functions correspond to approxi- mate eigenstates of the Hamiltonian by computing the energy variance <LATEX>\mathcal{E}</LATEX> and performed a linear extrapolation toward results without numerical errors (see Appendix A for a discussion).
bd9h | We compute the components of the spin magnetization, which are local expectation values <LATEX>m _ { r } = \langle \widehat { S } _ { r } \rangle .</LATEX> Since <LATEX>m _ { z , r }</LATEX> is parallel to the external field, we call this magnetization com- ponent the polarization. For <LATEX>B \approx J = - D / 2 ,</LATEX> the local spin profiles yield magnetization textures similar to those obtained for classical skyrmion configurations of the NÃ©el <LATEX>\left. \mathrm { h e d g e h o g } \right)</LATEX> type: the central spin is polarized opposite to the applied magnetic field, and the spins wind radially from the center toward the periphery. In Fig. 2, we depict the polarization along the field <LATEX>\left( m _ { z , r } \right)</LATEX> using a color scale and the in-plane magnetization <LATEX>\left( m _ { \chi / y , r } \right)</LATEX> by arrows. More detailed radial and an- gular distributions of panel Fig. 2(e) are depicted in Fig. 3. In Fig. 4, we show that the average polarization <LATEX>\bar { m } _ { z } = \frac { 1 } { N } \sum _ { r } m _ { z , r } ,</LATEX> as a function of the external field, yields three disconnected regions uniquely associated with the three phases of Eq. (1).
m047 | We estimate the size of an individual quantum skyrmion as the number of lattice sites over which the polarization changes its orientation once and the components orthogonal to the external field vanish. The radius can then be read out from Figs. 2 and 3 and results in <LATEX>r _ { 0 } \approx 3 a</LATEX> for <LATEX>J = - \quad 0 . 5 D</LATEX> and <LATEX>K =</LATEX> 0. These quantum skyrmion (SK) ground states occur not only for the fine-tuned parameters presented in Fig. 2 but in a wide range of intermediate values of the magnetic field. Furthermore, the emergence of individual skyrmions for small lattices is largely independent of the lattice geometry. While the effect of boundaries cannot be neglected for the small systems considered here, we verified that the size of an individual skyrmion is neither affected by the boundary conditions (see Fig. 2) nor the system diameter (see Fig. 8).
gy8c | As we show in Fig. 2, for small magnetic fields, the sys- tem's ground state is a helical spin spiral (HS) state. This is characterized by a degenerate ground state, in which each pos- sible ground state features oscillations of the magnetization along a symmetry axis of the lattice. The large ground-state degeneracy makes the spin spiral phase notoriously difficult to simulate for tensor network states. In contrast, for large mag- netic fields, the system reaches a ferromagnetic state, where all spins are polarized parallel to the external magnetic field. The bulk of the field-polarized ferromagnet is devoid of entan-

xagm | To probe whether the spins of a skyrmion are entangled, a genuine quantum feature of many-body systems, we compute the entanglement entropy of a suitable bipartition of the sys- tem. The latter is defined as <LATEX>S _ { \mathrm { v N } } = - \mathrm { t r } \left( \rho _ { A } \ln \rho _ { A } \right) ,</LATEX> which can be understood as the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix <LATEX>\rho _ { A } = \mathrm { t r } _ { B } \left( \rho _ { A B } \right) ,</LATEX> obtained by splitting the set of lattice sites <LATEX>N</LATEX> into two disjoint sets <LATEX>A</LATEX> and <LATEX>B ,</LATEX> and performing the partial trace over subsystem <LATEX>B .</LATEX> For our purposes, it is sufficient to fix <LATEX>A</LATEX> and <LATEX>B</LATEX> as two patches that are symmetric about the central site (see Appendix B). We denote the entropy associated with this symmetric center-site partition choice as <LATEX>S ,</LATEX> which is plotted in color in Fig. 4 and Fig. 9, panels (c) and (d).
iwn5 | MPS are constructed to target states of small entropy by truncating the reduced density matrix to a dimension <LATEX>\dim \left( \rho _ { A } \right) \leqslant M ,</LATEX> which yields an upper bound for the entangle- ment entropy of an MPS state, <LATEX>\widetilde { S } = \ln M ,</LATEX> a quantity on the order of <LATEX>1 \quad - \quad 1 0</LATEX> for typical simulations. The bulk of FP states can be approximated by product states of <LATEX>\sin - 1 / 2</LATEX> particles aligned to the axis of the magnetic field, and for those states, one finds <LATEX>S \approx 0</LATEX> up to small finite-size corrections. In contrast, for systems hosting a single quantum skyrmion, we obtain val- ues for the entanglement entropy in the range <LATEX>0 . 2 < S < 0 . 7 ,</LATEX> which demonstrates the presence of significant entanglement in the <LATEX>s p i n - 1 / 2</LATEX> quantum skyrmion and indicates that they can- not be expressed as a classical product state. Finally, in the HS phase, we find the strongest entanglement <LATEX>\left( 0 . 7 < S \right) .</LATEX> While we focus mainly on skyrmions with ferromagnetic exchange interaction <LATEX>\left( J < 0 \right) ,</LATEX> we find strong signatures of skyrmions and skyrmion lattices for antiferromagnetic exchange <LATEX>\left( J > \right.</LATEX> 0) as well. However, this phase differs from the ferromag- netic skyrmions and skyrmion lattices, most apparently in the entanglement, which is significantly larger. We postpone a detailed investigation of quantum skyrmions and skyrmion lattices for antiferromagnetic exchange couplings to future work.
uooz | The von Neumann entropy targets quantum correlations between a bipartition of the system but does not provide local information about the entanglement between individual spin- <LATEX>1 / 2</LATEX> pairs. To access the spatial distribution of entanglement, it is therefore more convenient to calculate the concurrence <LATEX>C _ { r _ { 1 } r _ { 2 } } ,</LATEX> defined for two lattice sites at positions <LATEX>r _ { 1 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>r _ { 2 } .</LATEX> For a generic state it can be expressed through the root of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian matrix <LATEX>R _ { r _ { 1 } r _ { 2 } } = \rho _ { r _ { 1 } r _ { 2 } } \widetilde { \rho } _ { r _ { 1 } r _ { 2 } } ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>\rho _ { r _ { 1 } r _ { 2 } } = \mathrm { t r } _ { r \notin \left[ r _ { 1 } , r _ { 2 } \right] } \left( \rho \right)</LATEX> is the reduced density matrix of the two sites <LATEX>r _ { 1 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>r _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>\widetilde { \rho } _ { r _ { 1 } r _ { 2 } } = \left( \sigma _ { \mathrm { y } } \otimes \sigma _ { \mathrm { y } } \right) \rho _ { r _ { 1 } r _ { 2 } } ^ { * } \left( \sigma _ { \mathrm { y } } \otimes \sigma _ { \mathrm { y } } \right)</LATEX> is a rotation of this reduced density matrix. The concurrence is constructed from the square roots <LATEX>\lambda _ { i }</LATEX> (ordered in decreasing order) of the eigenvalues of

jfsr | It is related to the entanglement of formation: for separable states <LATEX>C</LATEX> vanishes, and it increases monotonically toward the limit <LATEX>C = 1</LATEX> for two maximally entangled spin-1/2's [58]. Using the concurrence, we obtain the space-resolved entan- glement distribution between spin pairs in the different phases and present its qualitative distribution by green links in Fig. 5.
