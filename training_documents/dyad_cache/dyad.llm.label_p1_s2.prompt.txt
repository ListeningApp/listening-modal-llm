You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

dpv6 | Abstract
8r5j | The two American warning failures in the Korean War are unique cases in our category of events: The first, because the US intelligence community provided no warning at all prior to the North Korean invasion in June 1950, due to the poor quality of its collection capabilities and its distrust of South Korean warnings. The second case is even more unique. Despite China's public warnings, reliable information that massive Chinese forces had crossed the Yalu River, and the actual engagement with these forces, General MacArthur, supported by his intelligence officer General Willoughby, entirely ignored them when ordering his forces to complete the occupation of North Korea. Explaining this odd decision, the chapter pinpoints MacArthur's paranoia and narcissism and Willoughby's tendency toward centralism, mirror-imaging, and need for cognitive closure. These traits allowed the success of the sudden Chinese counteroffensive in late November that caused the US Army one of the worst defeats in its history.

tzt3 | Introduction
t8vv | The two American intelligence failures in the Korean War are unique cases in the category of events that make this book. The uniqueness of the first, the failure to warn that North Korea intended to invade South Korea in June 1950, derives from the fact that on the eve of the invasion, American intelligence organizations failed to provide any specific piece of information that could alert their consumers to the looming threat. This kind of a failure-at the level of collection-is rare in the history of surprise attacks. When compared to other cases in this book, it is a far cry from Barbarossa and the Yom Kippur war, when the intelligence organizations collected sufficient information to alert the decision-makers to the threat even if these warnings were ignored. 4

kggw | The second American failure is even more unique. In June 1950, the attack was against soldiers from the Republic of Korea and not the US Army, and prior to it the Korean Peninsula was ranked very low in the American intelligence order of priorities, as indicated in NSC-68, and this explains much of the outcome. But in late November 1950, the Chinese attacked American soldiers, and unlike in the June 1950 case, in the weeks before the attack a plethora of intelligence information concerning the looming threat had become available to General Douglas MacArthur and his staff. They were nevertheless caught unprepared, and the United States suffered one of the worst defeats in its military history. A number of factors explain this failure, but they mainly result from the lack of a proper learning process after the failure of June 1950.
xrd1 | Case Study I: Failing to Forecast the War
5746 | a. The road to war
7toz | When compared with Hitler's decision to launch Barbarossa before ending the war with Britain, Japan's decision to initiate a war against a far stronger American opponent at Pearl Harbor, or Sadat's decision to attack Israel despite the clear military superiority of the Israel Defense Force (IDF), the decision of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ([DPRK]; North Korea) to attack the Republic of Korea ([ROK]; South Korea) seems rather rational. The decision to attack was Kim Il-Sung's, but it was dependent on the approval of Stalin and Mao Ze Dong.
j346 | Kim's commitment to an "armed unification" of Korea dates back to the early 1940s, when he served as the head of the Korean battalion for the 88th brigade in the Soviet Far East Command.3 Earlier, he was a guerrilla commander in the war against the Japanese occupation in Manchuria and North Korea. He had moved to the USSR in 1939 or 1940, graduated from an officers school, and in 1945 was selected by Beria, with Stalin's approval, to be the leader of the Korean territories that were occupied by the Red Army toward the end of the war. Backed up by Soviet support, Kim took over the country in 1946 and established the Korean People's Army (KPA), which became, within a few years, a significant military force. Committed to the unification of Korea under his leadership, Kim rejected the Soviet-American understanding for a joint trusteeship of Korea reached at the February 1945 Yalta conference. Following the American military 4 withdrawal from South Korea in June 1949, he became convinced that the KPA was capable of defeating the far weaker ROK army, as well as the American dispatch forces.4 Kim's optimistic estimations, which were supported by the reports of the Soviet ambassador in Pyongyang, convinced Stalin that the "progressive forces" in South Korea were powerful enough and that it was in a state of "revolutionary readiness."5
v8uq | Until early 1950, Stalin, who feared a confrontation with the United States in the Far East, avoided giving a green light to Kim's military initiative. Unlike in Europe, where Stalin expanded Communist influence despite the risk of such a confrontation, concern about the American reaction ranked high in his Far Eastern strategy. In the case of Korea, it led him to agree to the division of the peninsula and the evacuation of the

4i0e | Red Army from the territory it had occupied in August 1945. In the Chinese civil war, it drove him to support the division of China between the nationalist and communist rivals along the Yangtze River instead of pledging full support for Mao. Only the Communist military achievements caused him to alter policy in the spring of 1949. Similarly, despite the optimistic reports he received from North Korea regarding the south's ripeness for unification under a communist rule, he expressed his reservations about it during the talks he held with Mao in Moscow in late 1949, and continued to reject any proposal for a military initiative until early 1950.6
h2l3 | Following the communist victory in the Chinese civil war, both Mao and Kim competed to win Soviet support for the unification of their countries: China with Tibet and Formosa and North Korea with the south." Influenced by Kim's optimistic reports, Stalin's reluctance to support him lessened. Nevertheless, when Stalin did give Kim the green light, in January 1950, he also made it clear that Korea ranked low in his order of priorities and that, therefore, he would not be able to provide "great assistance and support" in case of failure. In addition, Stalin demanded that Kim obtain the blessing of the Chinese.

u6ty | Apart from his increased optimism regarding a North Korean military initiative, other factors influenced Stalin's change of mind: the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, which was regarded as a model for 4 spreading the revolution in Asia; his belief that the United States had deserted Chiang Kai-shek and would act similarly in the case of Korea; the successful Soviet nuclear test in August 1949, which ended the American nuclear monopoly; and the early January 1950 declarations by secretary of state Dean Acheson and President Truman that excluded Korea and Formosa from the American defense perimeter in the east, signaling weakness in the American position in East Asia. According to a more updated analysis, which relies on recently released Soviet and Chinese documents, Stalin was also influenced by his interest in preserving an ice-free port in the Pacific. By this account, unification of the Korean peninsula under communist rule meant that the ports of Pusan and Inchon would become available to the Soviets. And if the North Koreans were defeated, the risk to the People's Republic of China (PRC) would compel Mao to ask the Soviets to maintain their presence in the ports of Lushun and Dalian.9
awvu | Mao was even more hesitant to approve Kim's proposal than Stalin. Until the spring of 1949, he and his colleagues had had little interest in Korea, and they only learned about Kim's "armed unification" intentions when they met with him in April 1949. During the meeting, they expressed concern that South Korea, under the militant Syngman Rhee, who was also committed to a unified Korea, might attack the north with Japanese backing. Mao promised that were that to happen, he would send some Chinese troops to aid North Korea, and he agreed to return two ethnic Korean divisions that fought under the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to North Korea. At the same time, he warned Kim against launching any military initiative in the south. In April 1950, the last ethnic Korean division that had participated in the Chinese Civil War returned to North Korea. From a Chinese perspective, this was done to increase the North Korean defensive rather than offensive capabilities.10
on9b | In light of Stalin's demand for a Chinese approval of the planned war, Kim visited Beijing in mid-May. At that time, Mao and his colleagues heard for the first time of the change in Stalin's view concerning the war, and they requested that he acknowledge that it was, indeed, the case. Stalin's telegram granting approval arrived on May 14. The Chinese leadership then reluctantly agreed to Kim's initiative, and in a meeting on May 15, Mao promised Kim that if American forces intervened in the war, the PLA would come to the KPA's assistance. Given this lukewarm Chinese support, however, Kim avoided informing the PRC about his intention to launch the 4 war until it started. Although Mao was outraged by this behavior, it did not undermine his intention to assist North Korea militarily.11
a8ge | Concrete North Korean preparations for war had started under a heavy veil of secrecy. The KPA attack plan was ready on May 29. It aimed at the fast occupation of all of South Korea "in order to prevent the landing of the American imperialists."1" On June 11, the KPA headquarters distributed a top-secret command for a

xmgs | large-scale military exercise in the border area. This was the cover for the military deployment that started on June 12 and took place over the following two weeks. The division commanders received their attack orders on June 18. At the same time, Pyongyang radio announced additional conciliatory moves toward South Korea, including the release of prisoners. The deception also included public calls for a peaceful reunification and false diplomatic initiatives aimed at calming Seoul's apprehensions by demonstrating Pyongyang's goodwill, thus refuting rumors of KPA's preparations for invasion."
bd9h | Altogether, the process that led to the North Korean invasion did not include any major miscalculations. Armed unification ranked certainly at the top of Kim's order of priorities but was far less important for the USSR and the PRC. Both Stalin and Mao made this clear to Kim, but they seem to have miscalculated the war dynamics that would involve not only strategic considerations but also reputational ones. Here they seem to have made a similar mistake to the one conducted by the American policymakers on the eve of the war.

gy8c | b. The American surprise
y4mj | i. The American intelligence assets
vpgq | In the period between the end of WWII and the breakout of the Korean War, the American intelligence system in the Far East was in a decrepit state. This was the outcome of deep cuts in the defense and intelligence budgets, a high level of bureaucratic competition, and a poor level of coordination among the various operating intelligence organs. Monitoring the Korean Peninsula, moreover, ranked low in the intelligence order of priorities. 4
ousl | Collection in the Far East was mainly made by Sigint and Humint as well as some open-source intelligence (Osint). Although visual aerial reconnaissance, which proved its value during WWII, was used extensively in the Korean War itself,14 this means of collection, which could have provided good information about the deployment of the KPA forces for war, was not used until June 1950.
m4ju | Sigint collection was divided between a number of relatively small army, air force, and naval units. Beginning in 1949, their activity was loosely coordinated by the newly established Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA),15 whose prime target was the USSR. Until 1948, AFSA had been "astonishingly lucky" in reading Soviet military, police, and industrial traffic. Then, based on information that was passed to the Soviets by an AFSA linguist named William Weisband who had been recruited by the KGB, the Soviet cipher systems stopped working, leaving communication intelligence (Comint), the United States' main source of collection, almost completely in the dark on the road leading to the war.16
a0mb | In addition, Comint collection in the Far East suffered from fundamental difficulties, such as a lack of skilled operators because of a high level of personnel turnover and a relaxed working manner that meant that interception facilities operated only five-and-a-half days a week, eight hours a day."The situation was even worse in the Korean case. Despite their being a source of concern, the US Communications Intelligence Board (USCIB) ranked Japan and Korea (with a lesser focus on Korea), number fifteen on its order of "high importance" priorities. Accordingly, when war broke out, North Korea was covered by two full-time and one part-time cyptanalyst, one linguist, and two analysts.1 4 AFSA, moreover, had no Korean dictionaries or typewriters and no books about the country.19
ki8m | Given its type of regime, North Korea constituted a challenging target for Humint. This task had become even more difficult because of the cumbersome organization of the various bodies involved in this mission. Following the withdrawal of US forces in June 1949, American military assistance to the South Korean army was provided by the Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG), which also passed information from ROK sources to the Pentagon. In addition, the United States maintained three small intelligence missions in Korea: the Korean Liaison Office (KLO), established by MacArthur's G-2, Gen. Charles Willoughby after the
km8w | American forces left South Korea in 1949 and tasked with intelligence collection and analysis;20 the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI); and a CIA element that was linked to the local police and intelligence services. Their main sources were the South Korean collection agencies." Although South Korean officers claim that the intelligence that they collected about the coming attack was valuable,22 there is a consensus that G-2 in Tokyo regarded it as conflicting and useless.23
