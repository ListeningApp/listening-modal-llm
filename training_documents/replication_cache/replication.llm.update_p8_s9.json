        "content": "mt0f | Flavivirus-induced vesicle packets contain the viral RNA replication proteins, dsRNA, and nascent RNA and are the site of genome replication. Three-dimensional electron microscopy tomography showed vesicle packets to comprise a bounding membrane vesicle bearing multiple spherule invaginations retaining necked openings to the cytosol, confirming parallels noted in electron microscopy tomography of nodavirus spherules. The convoluted membranes contain replicase proteins but no RNA, and they may be sites for replication factor production and storage preparatory to RC formation.\nawab | While most Flaviviridae form spherule RCs, HCV induces some closed single-membrane vesicles and more double-membrane vesicles. Further features and evolutionary implications of these double-membrane vesicles are reviewed below.\nixcc | Three. DOUBLE-MEMBRANE VESICLE RNA REPLICATION COMPLEXES\n8p6h | In contrast to positive RNA viruses forming spherule RCs, RNA replication by some positive RNA viruses, including coronaviruses, picornaviruses, noroviruses, and hepaciviruses, is accompanied by formation of single- and double-membrane vesicles or tubules lacking membrane openings to the cytosol. For coronaviruses, double-membrane vesicles were recently established as the major sites of viral RNA synthesis, while for other viruses in this category the respective relevance of single- and double-membrane compartments for RNA replication remains less clear. Below we briefly review these results and their implications.\npmgl | Three point one. Coronaviruses\n90no | Coronaviruses and in particular the beta-coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. They include the causal agents of the prior severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics and the current devastating COVID-19 pandemic. Coronaviruses have approximately thirty-kilobase genomes, the largest known genomes among positive RNA viruses. Over seventy percent of these genomes encode enormous, overlapping la and lab polyproteins that are essential for RNA replication and for coronaviruses' unusual discontinuous subgenomic mRNA transcription. These polyproteins are processed by two virus-encoded proteases into sixteen individual nonstructural proteins providing functions in RNA replication organelle formation plus enzymatic functions such as protease, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, RNA capping, helicase, exonuclease, and endonuclease. The structures of many nonstructural proteins have been solved, but how they collectively interact for RNA synthesis and export remains a question.\njt0y | Proteins nsp3, 4, and 6 each have multiple membrane-association domains and induce a network of interconnected, endoplasmic reticulum-derived membrane rearrangements including complex convoluted membranes and hundreds of two hundred- to three hundred-nanometer double-membrane vesicles. While viral RNA replication proteins are observed throughout this network, dsRNA is found only in double-membrane vesicles. Moreover, autoradiography of actinomycin-D-resistant tritium-uridine incorporation in coronavirus-infected cells identified double-membrane vesicles as the dominant if not sole sites of coronavirus RNA synthesis. Double-membrane vesicles arise approximately two hours postinfection. Their outer membranes are often interconnected through neck-like channels to other double-membrane vesicles and to convoluted membranes. Convoluted membranes arise later than double-membrane vesicles and, unlike double-membrane vesicles, do not harbor RNA. However, they abundantly immunolabel for coronavirus nonstructural proteins and, analogous to similar flavivirus-induced structures, could be sites for replicase production, processing, and storage.\nqb7o | A long-elusive path for the potential release of viral RNA products from double-membrane vesicle interiors was provided when cryo-electron microscopy tomography revealed a sixfold symmetrical pore that spans both double-membrane vesicle membranes and contains nsp3, the largest greater than one thousand nine hundred amino acid coronavirus RNA replication factor. This coronavirus channel or crown parallels the crowns previously recognized on spherule RCs in being a ringed complex of viral RNA replication factors that gates cytosolic release of viral RNA products and may assist in guiding their synthesis. Both the cytosolic and luminal portions of this coronavirus crown appear to interact with other viral and cellular factors. Potential luminal interactions with other viral RNA synthesis factors could help to coordinate synthesis and release of RNA replication and transcription products. On the crown's cytosolic side, nsp3's ubiquitin-like N terminus interacts with viral RNA and nucleocapsid protein, greatly enhancing RNA replication, likely by facilitating RNA delivery to the RC. As addressed below, in later infection these same nsp3/nucleocapsid interactions may guide encapsidation of progeny genomic RNA.\noae5 | Three point two.
