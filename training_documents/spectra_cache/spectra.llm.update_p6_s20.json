        "content": "s0fl | It is necessary to include also in this scheme reactions five through eight and fourteen. It is seen from scheme fifteen that the rate of luminescence quenching of H2O* and OH* species increases with the increase of water molecules concentration. This diminishes the total SL light emission and changes the spectra: the intensity of a short-wave part of the spectrum decreases more significantly as the \"resonant quenching\" is usually more effective. The difference in the spectra of water SL at high and low frequency is explained by SL quenching.",
