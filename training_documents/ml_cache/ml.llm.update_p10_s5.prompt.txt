You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

epbj | Model-based integration approaches facilitate the understanding of interactions amongst different omics for a certain phenotype (for example, survival in pancreatic cancer). The final multi-dimensional joint model in Stage 4 can be built using an ML algorithm (such as neural networks) which uses the most relevant variables from each omics models (from Stage 3). This approach allows the analysis of the improvement in the predictive power for individual models and also finds the best discriminating features.
nmn2 | The different model-based integration methods can be further classed as follows.
g3tm | 4.2.1. Supervised learning model-based methods
tfra | Model-based supervised learning methods include a variety of frame- works for developing a model, such as majority-based voting (Draghici and Potter, 2003), hierarchical classifiers (Bavafaye Haghighi et al., 2019) and ensemble-based approaches (such as XGBoost (Ma et al., 2020b) and KNN (Shen and Chou, 2006)).
5lm9 | Deep learning methods have also been adopted for model-based su- pervised learning (Poirion et al., 2020). MOLI (multi-omics late inte- gration) (Sharifi-Noghabi et al., 2019) method used type-specific encoding sub-networks to learn features from somatic mutation, CNA and gene expression data independently and then later concatenated them for predicting the response to a given drug. Lee (Lee et al., 2020) has proposed a deep learning-based auto-encoding approach for inte- grating four omics to create a survival prediction model. Also, HI- DFNForest (hierarchical integration deep flexible neural forest) frame- work (Xu et al., 2019a) was developed which uses a stacked auto- encoder (Vincent et al., 2010) to learn high-level representations from three omic datasets. Later, these representations are integrated to pre- dict cancer subtype classification. Similarly, Chaudhary (Chaudhary et al., 2017) has used autoencoders along with SVM for survival pre- diction in subgroups of hepatocellular carcinoma.
wp2c | In the past years, ATHENA (Analysis Tool for Heritable and Envi- ronmental Network Associations) was developed for analysing multi- omics data (Chung and Kang, 2019; Holzinger et al., 2014). It uses grammatical evolution neural networks along with Biofilter (Bush et al., 2009) and Random Jungle (Schwarz et al., 2010) to investigate different categorical and quantitative variables and develop prediction models.
us5v | Recently, MOSAE (Multi-omics Supervised Autoencoder) (Tan et al., 2020a) was developed for pan-cancer analysis and compared with conventional ML methods such as SVM, DT, naïve Bayes, KNN, RF and AdaBoost. Similarly, Denoising autoencoder has been incorporated along with L1-penalized logistic regression for identifying ovarian can- cer subtypes (Guo et al., 2020).
rs2m | 4.2.2. Unsupervised learning model-based methods
uz9y | Various model-based unsupervised learning methods have been implemented in the past. PSDF (Patient-Specific Data Fusion) (Yuan et al., 2011) is a non-parametric Bayesian model for clustering prog- nostic cancer subtypes by combining gene expression and copy number variation data. It uses a two-step process and limits the integration to only two datatypes. Similarly, CONEXIC (Akavia et al., 2010) also uses a BN to integrate gene expression and copy number variation from tumour
8ov0 | samples to identify driver mutations. On the other hand, clustering methods such as FCA (Formal Concept Analysis) consensus clustering (Hristoskova et al., 2014), MDI (Multiple Dataset Integration) (Kirk et al., 2012), PINS (Perturbation clustering for data integration and disease subtyping) (Nguyen et al., 2017), PINS+ (Nguyen et al., 2019) and BCC (Bayesian consensus clustering) (Lock and Dunson, 2013) are more flexible and allow late-stage integration of clusters.
mj9m | Different network-based methods are also available for association analysis. Lemon-Tree (Bonnet et al., 2015) implemented ensemble methods for reconstructing module networks which used somatic copy number alterations and gene expression in brain tumour samples. Furthermore, SNF (Similarity Network Fusion) (Wang et al., 2014) constructs networks of samples for respective data type and then effec- tively fuse them into a joint network which denotes the complete range of original data. It combines mRNA expression, DNA methylation and microRNA (miRNA) expression data from cancer datasets.
94h3 | 4.3. Transformation-based integration methods
9jx1 | Transformation-based integration methods transform each of the omics datasets firstly into graphs or kernel matrices and then combines all of them into one before constructing a model.
c3lz | Graphs provide a formal means to transform and portray relation- ships between different omics samples where the nodes and edges of a graph represent the subjects and their relationships, respectively. Similarly, Kernel methods enable the transformation of data from its original space into a higher dimensional feature space. These methods then explore linear decision functions in the feature space which were non-linear in the original space.
8bwk | The transformation-based integrative methods can be classed as follows.
ez9s | 4.3.1. Supervised learning transformation-based methods
mqot | In the past, various transformation-based supervised learning methods have been presented. Most of them are kernel and graph-based algo- rithms (Yan et al., 2017). The kernel-based integration approaches include SDP-SVM (Semi-Definite Programming SVM) (Lanckriet et al., 2004), FSMKL (Multiple Kernel Learning with Feature Selection) (Seoane et al., 2014), RVM (Relevance Vector Machine) (Bowd et al., 2005; Tipping, 2001) and Ada-boost RVM (Wu et al., 2010). Moreover, fMKL-DR (fast multiple kernel learning for dimensionality reduction) (Giang et al., 2020) has been used along with SVM for combining gene expression, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation data. Similarly, the graph-based integration approaches consist of graph-based SSL (semi-supervised learning") (Tsuda et al., 2005; Culp and Michailidis, 2008; Kim et al., 2015; Yue et al., 2017; Bhardwaj and Van Steen, 2020), graph sharpening (Shin et al., 2010; Shin et al., 2007), composite network (Mostafavi and Morris, 2010) and BN (Rhodes et al., 2005).
oc99 | Overall, it is evident from the literature that kernel-based algorithms have superior performance to graph-based approaches, but they usually need more time for the training phase. In contrast, graph-based ap- proaches can disclose the relations between samples while taking less computation time. Yan (Yan et al., 2017) provide an extensive
gipz | comparison between different graph- and kernel-based integration ap- proaches in a supervised learning context using various standardised test datasets. It highlights the better classification performance of RVM, Ada- boost RVM and SDP-SVM in comparison to SSL, graph sharpening, composite network and BN.
b4wj | Recently, MORONET (Multi-Omics gRaph cOnvolutional NETworks) (Wang et al., 2020) is introduced, which use graph convolutional net- works taking benefit of the omics features and the associations among patients (as defined by the patient similarity networks) for better clas- sification results.
