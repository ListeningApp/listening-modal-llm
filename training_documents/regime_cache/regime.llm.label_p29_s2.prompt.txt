You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

20z2 | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS
4cgs | In most practical applications, using a+ (€) is the choice of interest, as the points on the response curve are anyway computed with some numerical error, such as timestep discretization and statistical error. There is, however, a tradeoff to be considered. As one tightens the acceptable relative error by decreasing &, the value of na(€) is also decreased. In practice, values of & in the range 0.01 to 0.1 are small enough to lead to a bias of a few percent in relative magnitude, but large enough so that the benefit of the increased magnitude of the forcing is significant. We further illustrate the tradeoff in Section 4 with numerical results for several observables for overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics.
htre | As a final remark in this section, note that computing a+ (€) requires computing the full response curve. Although this is not practical, the aim here is to provide a proof of principle demonstrating the potential computational gains obtained by making use of synthetic forcings and decide, between various strategies, the most promising one in order to adapt the approach to actual systems of interest.
da3c | 3.4. Linearly combining extra forcings. As discussed in Section 3.3, with the addition of some extra forcing Lextra, it is possible to find a value of o which cancels the second-order response p2 due to the linearity of f2 in o, as shown in (3.12). We can extend this notion to linear combinations of extra forcings. In particular, one can combine k forcings in order to cancel the first k nonlinear orders of the response. That is, for a = (@1, ... , Ok), the synthetic perturbation Lphys +@1 Lextra, 1+. . . +@kLextra,k can be used, with a chosen such that p2,a ... = Pk+1,Q = 0. This is a nonlinear equation in o, with k unknowns scalar values and k conditions to solve.
890q | 4. Numerical results. The aim of the numerical illustrations presented in this section is to demonstrate the potential of the synthetic forcing approach, on the exam- ples given in Section 3.2. The numerical results are obtained by discretizing the PDEs determining the invariant probability measure of each system (namely the Fokker- Planck equation (3.3)) and the Poisson equation (2.23). The use of this method, particularly in low-dimensional systems, allows us to extensively and thoroughly ex- amine the quality of synthetic forcings, as we can easily compute full response curves and individual orders of the response, in contrast to Monte Carlo simulations, for which some statistical error and timestep discretization bias are present. This nu- merical method, however, cannot be used as such for higher dimensional systems, as solving the associated PDEs becomes too cumbersome a task. Thus, for higher dimensional systems, Monte Carlo simulations are usually preferred (see discussion in Section 5).
jomo | We first discuss in Section 4.1 the numerical methods used, then present the numerical results for the one and two-dimensional overdamped Langevin, and one- dimensional Langevin dynamics in Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4, respectively. We finally discuss in Section 4.5 the impact of the synthetic forcings approach on variance re- duction in the estimation of transport coefficients.
06fi | 4.1. Numerical method. The full response curve and the linear response are computed by solving the associated Fokker-Planck equation for each dynamics, and the Poisson equation (2.23), respectively. The main advantage of numerical methods based on solving partial differential equations is that the discretization error can be systematically reduced to a very small value by refining the mesh used to represent the functions at hand. There are two situations in which the solutions to PDEs are required to determine the response to external perturbations, which we outline below.

1ews | Approximation of the linear response <LATEX>\rho _ { 1 } .</LATEX> The linear response is obtained by com- puting <LATEX>\mathfrak{f} _ { 1 }</LATEX> and approximating the integral on the right-hand side of (2.26). To approx- imate <LATEX>\mathfrak{f} _ { 1 } ,</LATEX> we solve the Poisson equation (2.23), which we recall here for convenience:
afyn | (4.1)
8sye | <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { * } \mathfrak{f} _ { 1 } = - \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } ^ { * } 1 .</LATEX> For overdamped Langevin dynamics, we directly solve (4.1) as we consider a bounded position space, namely the torus <LATEX>\mathbb{T} ^ { d } .</LATEX> For Langevin dynamics, instead of solving for <LATEX>\mathfrak{f} _ { 1 }</LATEX> in the expansion (2.21), we solve for <LATEX>\bar { \psi } _ { 1 }</LATEX> in <LATEX>\psi _ { \eta } = \psi _ { 0 } + \eta \bar { \psi } _ { 1 } + \eta ^ { 2 } \bar { \psi } _ { 2 } + \cdots , \imath ,</LATEX> i.e. <LATEX>\bar { \psi } _ { 1 } = \mathfrak{f} _ { 1 } \psi _ { 0 } .</LATEX> This function satisfies the Poisson equation
r04h | (4.2)
orpr | <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { \dagger } \bar { \psi } _ { 1 } = - \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } ^ { \dagger } \psi _ { 0 } ,</LATEX> which is equivalent to reformulating (4.1) in terms of the <LATEX>L ^ { 2 } - \mathrm { a d j o i n } .</LATEX> Due to the unbounded momentum space for Langevin dynamics, solving (4.2) makes the problem easier to solve numerically than (4.1). Indeed, the unbounded momentum space needs to be truncated. A natural choice when solving for <LATEX>\bar { \psi } _ { 1 }</LATEX> is to set Dirichlet boundary conditions at the boundaries of the domain in <LATEX>p ,</LATEX> which is consistent with the fact that <LATEX>\bar { \psi } _ { 1 } \left( q , p \right)</LATEX> is expected to vanish as <LATEX>| p | \rightarrow + \infty .</LATEX> In contrast, there is no natural boundary condition for <LATEX>\mathfrak{f} _ { 1 }</LATEX> in (2.26) when the momentum space is truncated.
k36m | Once an approximation of <LATEX>\mathfrak{f} _ { 1 }</LATEX> or <LATEX>\bar { \psi } _ { 1 }</LATEX> is obtained, we perform a quadrature on one of the following integrals to directly find the linear response
wnuz | <LATEX>\rho _ { 1 } = \int _ { \mathcal{X} } R \mathfrak{f} _ { 1 } \psi _ { 0 } = \int _ { \mathcal{X} } R \bar { \psi } _ { 1 } .</LATEX> More generally, this procedure can be extended by using the recursive formula (2.25), which allows for the computation of response terms of arbitrary orders; this is used in particular to compute <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 , \mathrm { p h y s } }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 , \mathrm { e x t r a } }</LATEX> when computing the value of <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star }</LATEX> defined in (3.13).
sy14 | Approximation of the full response <LATEX>r _ { \alpha } \left( \eta \right) .</LATEX> In this work, we compute the full re- sponse in order to quantify how much, and how quickly the response deviates from the linear regime. In actual applications, one typically does not compute the full response curve, in particular when using Monte Carlo simulations. The quantity of interest, namely the transport coefficient, comes from the linear response, which can be obtained from computing a single point (or typically two to ensure linearity), so computing the full response curve is not of interest.
ghss | The full response curve can be computed by solving the Fokker-Planck equa- tion (3.3), which we recall for convenience
3s61 | (4.3)
s3rm | <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { \eta , \alpha } ^ { \dagger } \psi _ { \eta , \alpha } = 0 ,</LATEX> and then performing a quadrature on the integral
pqxb | <LATEX>r _ { \alpha } \left( \eta \right) = \int _ { \mathcal{X} } R \psi _ { \eta , \alpha } .</LATEX> Solving the PDE. For the discretization of the PDEs (4.1), (4.2) and (4.3), we use a finite-difference scheme. Periodic boundary conditions are used in the spatial variable since we always consider <LATEX>q \in \mathbb{T} ^ { d }</LATEX> for both overdamped Lanvegin and Langevin dynamics, with <LATEX>d = 1</LATEX> or <LATEX>d = 2 .</LATEX> For overdamped Langevin dynamics, we use a centered finite-difference scheme. For the one-dimensional Langevin dynamics, the momentum

We ensured that our truncated value of the momentum Pmax = 6 is large enough so that it does not affect the numerical results. A centered scheme is also used for Langevin dynamics, except for the transport term -p M-1q in the Fokker-Planck equation (2.17), where an upwind scheme is used (refer to Appendix B for the precise expressions of the aforementioned numerical schemes). All computations were performed with the Julia language.
g8m3 | 4.2. Overdamped Langevin dynamics - one-dimensional case. We pres- ent in this section the numerical results for the one-dimensional overdamped Langevin dynamics (2.13) on X = T, with potential energy
a9av | (4.4) V(q) = cos(2Tq).
73l3 | We consider the observable
ornm | (4.5) R(q) = (a cos(2Tq) + bsin(2Tq)) eBV(q),
u2z1 | where a, b E R. We choose this observable for two reasons. First, by construction, it has average zero with respect to the Gibbs probability measure, with density propor- tional to e-BV. Second, we can tune the coefficients a and b to control the magnitude of the individual orders of response. This allows us to choose a and b such that the first and second-order responses are normalized, i.e. P1 = P2 = 1, which makes it easier to compare the quality of each synthetic forcing.
atmh | Due to the symmetries of the potential energy function (4.4), we can directly compute the values of a and b such that p1 = P2 = 1. More precisely, it can be shown that f1 and f2 are respectively odd and even on [-1/2, 1/2] so that b controls the magnitude of P1 and a controls the magnitude of 02. The value of b such that p1 = 1 is easily computed using (2.34) to be

xwsv | (4.7) a = (Z-1 |_cos(27q)f2(q)dq X
756b | The spatial domain T = [0, 1) is discretized into m = 2000 points, with uniform step size h = 1/m. The simulations were performed with inverse temperature ß = 1 and mass M = 1, which is also the setting for the results in two dimensions obtained in Section 4.3. Moreover, we consider the forcing F = 1, as this is the only nongradient forcing in dimension one on the torus.
6bx7 | We present the full response curves and the associated linear response for each of the three synthetic forcings discussed in Section 3.2.2. Figures 3a, 3b and 3c correspond to the Feynman-Kac forcing (3.9), modified fluctuation-dissipation (3.8) and divergence-free vector field (3.5), respectively. Note that in dimension one, (3.5) reduces to a single option, namely

For each of the plots, we show the linear response, the full response curve <LATEX>r _ { 0 } \left( \eta \right)</LATEX> for <LATEX>\alpha = 0 ,</LATEX> the response curve for <LATEX>r _ { \alpha ^ { \star } } \left( \eta \right)</LATEX> for <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star }</LATEX> computed using (3.13), and response curves for some additional values of <LATEX>\alpha \in \mathbb{R}</LATEX> for illustrative purposes. In some cases, in particular when the response curve associated with <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star }</LATEX> sees marginal improvement in extending the linear regime, we also compute the curve for <LATEX>\alpha _ { \star } \left( \varepsilon \right) ,</LATEX> where we choose <LATEX>\varepsilon = 0 . 0 5 .</LATEX> Lastly, Figure 3d includes all synthetic forcings. Note that the maximal value of the forcing is much larger for Figure 3d, where we compare the best choices for the magnitude of each synthetic forcing; this is also the setting for the illustrations presented in Sections 4.3 and 4.4.
