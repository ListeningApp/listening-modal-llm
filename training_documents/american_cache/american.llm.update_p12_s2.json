        "content": "rut3 | By taking the pictorial turn, American educators worked in the tradition of revolutionary linguistic movements dating back to the mid-seventeenth century. Following the Thirty Years' War and the English Revolution, European linguists and political theorists blamed much of the social violence on miscommunications resulting from the variety and ambiguity of national languages. After decades of political instability and the related loss of meaningful forms of signification, Europeans searched for an ideally prelapsarian or Adamic universal language. As the idea of a universal language became the common goal of linguistic reform, pictures in particular were tapped for their ability to transmit meaning concretely, unambiguously, and free from verbal interferences.\nm3cp | In the context of the post-Revolutionary United States it was thus not a surprise that American educators rediscovered the seventeenth-century philosopher Johann Amos Comenius, who created pedagogic schemes that first anchored the political order in the pictorial and only then turned to the written word. In his primer Orbis Sensualium Pictus: Visible World; or, A Picture and Nomenclature of All the Chief Things That Are in the World (originally published in sixteen fifty-nine and reissued in the United States as late as eighteen ten), difficult abstract subjects, such as \"Philosophy\" and \"Humanity\" as well as geopolitical constructs like \"Kingdom\" and \"Region,\" were represented through illustrations of material objects. \"The Kingdom and the Region,\" for example, was established in a concrete and stable form through a woodcut with a neatly modeled landscape depicting the various elements of the early modern state. Through the picture, the student learned to read and comprehend the social order. The corresponding text is in the service of this image:\nmq4s | Many Cities and Villages make a Region and a Kingdom. The King, or Prince, resideth in the chief-City; one. the Noblemen, Lords, and Earls, dwell in the Castles two. that lye round about it, the Countrey-people dwell in Villages. three. He hath his toll-places upon navigable Rivers four. and High-Roads, five. where Portage and Tollage is exacted of them that Sayl, or Travell.\n95el | The picture thus functions not only as a mnemonic device for learning a basic political vocabulary but also like a map, illustrating the spatial organization of the state. The messy realities of human existence and complexities of political order vanish in the tidy graphic simplicity of the landscape overview.\na0a5 | In American hands, picture primers assumed a dual function. First, just as in their European context, primers carried forth a latent ideology of universal language schemes. Second, and more particular to the post-Revolutionary order, pictorial primers worked to negotiate the representational tensions spurred by the Federalist debate; the picture, more powerfully than the word, was able to reconcile the political concepts of \"union\" and \"states.\" But, while the pictorial primers like Comenius's were adopted because of their availability and status of promoting a universal language, these primers' European heritage entailed historic and practical limitations. Although picture primers paved the way for the entrance of the visual into America's language handbooks, the primer's traditional representation of words and images relating geopolitical spaces like the \"kingdom\" was no longer applicable. The invention of a new type of nation-state with a precarious and experimental relationship of the parts to the whole could not, many feared, be given proper expression through the pictorially mediated letters of the English language. Moreover, federalist educators feared that the sustainability of this new political form depended not so much on written decrees and charters and international treaties as it did on citizens' absorbing and comprehending the social relationships of this political hybrid.\ngocl | Maps, themselves a hybrid form of word and image, provided primers with this language. Map images were not new to picture primers; after all, Comenius's Visible World contained maps showing the world as a\nob1z | \"Terrestrial Sphere ... divided into five Zones\" and Europe, containing \"the chief Kingdoms.\" Eighteenth-century American primers and ABC books, following in Comenius's footsteps, incorporated the textual materials of the geographer into the display of alphabetized objects. For instance, primers such as The Child's Museum, Containing a Description of One Hundred and Eight Interesting Subjects, following the schoolbook definition that \"a Map is a picture of the earth,\" included the picture of a globe (and the written subtitle, \"A Globe\") in the array of alphabetized objects. The seemingly arbitrary inclusion of the globe into the primer is a first comment on the materiality and availability of cartographic texts in the early American linguistic stock.\nm4cb | More than simply illustrating the alphabet, the figure of the map worked conceptually to teach abstract principles of literacy. This is suggested by the primer The Mother's Gift; or, Remarks on a Set of Cuts for Children. This primer presents the student reader with a picture of a map, a subtitle spelling out the words, \"A Map,\" and a narrative description: \"MAP. As you get forward in the study of geography you will find great entertainment in maps. How pleasant is it to trace the progress\nm61y | of a traveller of whom we read; and still more interesting where a friend is on a voyage or journey.\" Here, map literacy is taught as a reading skill and a life skill: maps are understood to inform the student's future geography lessons; they are considered textual companions of the leisured reader who consumes travel narratives and novels; maps provide the material link through which friends and families communicate with each other. As the titles of primers like The Mother's Gift suggest, alphabetic literacy was the product of a domestic ideology in which the child was the focus of alphabetic instructions provided by the ideal republican mother; in this context the map was introduced to the child reader by the most intimate member and designated disciplinarian of the early national household.",
