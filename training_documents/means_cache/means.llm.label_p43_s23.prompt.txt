You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

pmgl | 'Mum is in hospital,' he said as the blood drained from Jane's legs.
90no | 'I don't care,' she replied, but she did. She also wanted to see Brian, because he was the closest thing she had to a friend in this town.
jt0y | 13.13 What next?
qb7o | At the age of 13 I met my heroes, Iron Maiden, and very nice they were too. I've met them a couple of times since (not because they're my best buddies or anything exciting like that, but over the years the fan club put on various events where you were allowed to stand next to them and gibber like a fool while they humoured you politely). You'll notice that the photo at the start of this chapter is signed by Dave Murray. This wasn't possible because I had my own darkroom installed backstage at the Hammersmith Odeon in which I could quickly process photographs, or because I had access to time travel (sadly), but because I took the photo with me when I met him in 2000. I recounted the tale of how terrified I had been about meeting him in 1986. If he thought I was some strange stalker he certainly didn't let on. Uncharacteristic of most people who've sold millions of albums, they're lovely blokes.
oae5 | Anyway, having seen Iron Maiden in their glory, I was inspired. They still inspire me: I still rate them as the best live band I've ever seen (and I've seen them over 35 times, so I ought to know). Although I had briefly been deflected from my destiny by the shock of grammar school, I was back on track. I had to form a band. There was just one issue: no one else played a musical instrument. The solution was easy: through several months of covert subliminal persuasion I convinced my two best friends (both called Mark, oddly enough) that they wanted nothing more than to start learning the drums and bass guitar. A power trio was in the making.

gc7v | · Task 1: A few years back I was stalked. You'd think they could have found someone a bit more interesting to stalk, but apparently times were hard. It could have been a lot worse, but it wasn't particularly pleasant. I imagined a world in which a psychologist tried two different therapies on different groups of stalkers (25 stalkers in each group - this variable is called Group). To the first group he gave cruel-to-be-kind therapy (every time the stalkers followed him around, or sent him a letter, the psychologist attacked them with a cattle prod). The second therapy was psychodyshamic therapy, in which stalkers were hypnotized and regressed into their childhood to discuss their penis (or lack of penis), their father's penis, their dog's penis, the seventh penis of a seventh penis and any other penis that sprang to mind. The psychologist measured the number of hours stalking in one week both before (stalk1) and after (stalk2) treatment (Stalker.sav). Analyse the effect of therapy on stalking behaviour after therapy, covarying for the amount of
wqfv | stalking behaviour before therapy.
j30a | · Task 2: Compute effect sizes for Task 1 and report the results.
7bdk | · Task 3: A marketing manager tested the benefit of soft drinks for curing hangovers. He took 15 people and got them drunk. The next morning as they awoke, dehydrated and feeling as though they'd licked a camel's sandy feet clean with their tongue, he gave five of them water to drink, five of them Lucozade (a very nice glucose-based UK drink) and the
fim0 | remaining five a leading brand of cola (this variable is called drink). He measured how well they felt (on a scale from 0 = I feel like death to 10 = I feel really full of beans and healthy) two hours later (this variable is called well). He measured how drunk the person got the night before on a scale of 0 = as sober as a nun to 10 = flapping about like a haddock out of water on the floor in a puddle of their own vomit (HangoverCure.sav). Fit a model to see whether people felt better after different drinks when covarying for how drunk they were the night
ojro | before.
l6t9 | · Task 4: Compute effect sizes for Task 3 and report the results.
1ujy | · Task 5: The highlight of the elephant calendar is the annual elephant soccer event in Nepal (google search it). A heated argument burns between the African and Asian elephants. In 2010, the president of the Asian Elephant Football Association, an elephant named Boji, claimed that Asian elephants were more talented than their African counterparts. The head of the African Elephant Soccer Association, an elephant called Tunc, issued a press statement that read 'I make it a matter of personal pride never to take seriously any remark made by something that looks like an enormous scrotum'. I was called in to settle things. I collected data from the two types of elephants (elephant) over a season and recorded how many goals each elephant scored (goals) and how many years of experience the elephant had (experience). Analyse the effect of the type of elephant on goal scoring, covarying for the amount of football experience the elephant has (Elephant Football.sav).
qzor | · Task 6: In Chapter 4 (Task 6) we looked at data from people who had been forced to marry goats and dogs and measured their life satisfaction and also how much they like animals (Goat or Dog.sav). Fit a model predicting life satisfaction from
a0by | the type of animal to which a person was married and their
u1ky | animal liking score (covariate).
htm9 | · Task 7: Compare your results for Task 6 to those for the corresponding task in Chapter 11. What differences do you
8hul | notice and why?
87vz | · Task 8: In Chapter 10 we compared the number of mischievous acts (mischief2) in people who had invisibility cloaks to those without (cloak). Imagine we also had information about the baseline number of mischievous acts in these participants (mischief1). Fit a model to see whether people with invisibility cloaks get up to more mischief than those without when factoring in their baseline level of mischief (Invisibility
