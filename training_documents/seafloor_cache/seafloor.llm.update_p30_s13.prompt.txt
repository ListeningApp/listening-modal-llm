You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

73l3 | from nontronite (136°-138℃), to chamosite (124°-205℃),
ornm | corrensite (207°-227℃), and rectorite (256℃), with the
u2z1 | highest temperatures close to trapping temperatures of fluid inclusions in the anhydrite and sphalerite. The 818O value of the hydrothermal fluid in equilibrium with the analyzed
atmh | clay minerals could have been closer to 5.0%%, if we assume a temperature of formation of 240℃ (Table 6), following Sheppard and Gilg (1996). The large range of calculated 8180H20 values at the inferred temperatures of alteration is
7hgg | consistent with boiling of the hydrothermal fluids (e.g., Hus- ton, 1999; see Fig. 21).
xwsv | Values of ODv-SMOw range from -92 to -86%% for nontron- ite, -65 to -52%% for chamosite, -85 to -80%% for corrensite,
756b | and -69%% in the single sample of rectorite. There is a gen- eral increase in <LATEX>\delta \mathrm { D } _ { \mathrm { V S M O W } }</LATEX> with depth, consistent with the downhole increase in calculated temperature. Importantly, no accepted hydrogen isotope fractionation factors exist for 2:1 phyllosilicate minerals in order to calculate initial <LATEX>\delta \mathrm { D } _ { \mathrm { w a t e } }</LATEX> values. Gilg and Sheppard (1996) proposed approximating the fractionation factors of Al-rich and Fe- and Mg-free smectites using kaolinite factors; however, the smectites in this study are Fe-rich nontronite. Initial <LATEX>\delta \mathrm { D } _ { \mathrm { w a t e r } }</LATEX> values in equilibrium with chamosite, using a chlorite-water fractionation factor of <LATEX>\alpha = 0 . 9 5 4</LATEX> from Marumo et al. (1980), are -18.7 to -9.8%o (Table 6). However, hydrogen isotope fractionation in chlorite is strongly dependent on mineral chemistry (e.g., Marumo et al., 1980; Savin and Lee, 1988), thus adding uncertainty to the initial <LATEX>\delta \mathrm { D } _ { \mathrm { w a t e r } }</LATEX> values.
6bx7 | High <LATEX>\delta ^ { 1 8 } \mathrm { O } _ { \mathrm { w a t e r } }</LATEX> values have been reported for Kuroko-type hydrothermal fluids (up to 10.8%%; Ohmoto, 1983, 1996). The shifts in <LATEX>\delta ^ { 1 8 } \mathrm { O } _ { \mathrm { w a t e r } }</LATEX> to lower values at higher temperatures (e.g., minimum of 0.8%% in equilibrium with rectorite dur- ing chalcopyrite deposition) are typical of the stringer zones
spl6 | of ancient VMS deposits (e.g., Cathles, 1993). The 18O-rich fluids at Tinakula may be derived from isotopic exchange with 18O-rich rocks, boiling, or direct contributions from magmatic fluids. At high temperatures, water-rock interactions can shift <LATEX>\delta ^ { 1 8 } \mathrm { O } _ { \mathrm { w a t e r } }</LATEX> but not <LATEX>\widehat { \delta } \mathrm { D } _ { \mathrm { w a t e r } }</LATEX> (Huston, 1999). We interpret the combination of higher <LATEX>\delta ^ { 1 8 } \mathrm { O } _ { \mathrm { w a t e r } }</LATEX> and lower <LATEX>\delta \mathrm { D } _ { \mathrm { w a t e r } }</LATEX> at Tinakula as a result of subseafloor boiling, which is likely because of the shallow water depths there and the fluid inclusion trapping temperatures, which are close to the boiling curve (Fig. 22). The lack of low-pH mineral assemblages and the seawater- dominated S isotope signature (see below) suggest that there was no magmatic contribution to the hydrothermal fluids or only a limited one.
7wzm | Sulfur isotopes
e9xj | The 834S values of chalcopyrite range from -0.8 to 2.0%% and are, on average, slightly lower in the Cu-rich chimneys than in the Zn-rich chimneys (Fig. 23A). Pyrite has 834S values of -0.4 to 3.1%% (Fig. 23B), and sphalerite has <LATEX>\delta ^ { 3 4 } \mathrm { S }</LATEX> of 0.3 to 3.4%% (Fig. 23C), both minerals having higher values in <LATEX>\mathrm { Z n }</LATEX> rich chimneys. Fe-poor (light-colored) sphalerite has slightly higher 834S values than Fe-rich (dark-colored) sphalerite from the same sample. However, there is no systematic spatial variation in 834S of the sulfides along the main NS-trending fissure at Tinakula, suggesting that the sulfur source was uni- form. Barite from chimney samples yielded <LATEX>\delta ^ { 3 4 } \mathrm { S }</LATEX> of 19.3 to 22.5%% (Fig. 23D). Anhydrite from the altered volcaniclastic rocks has <LATEX>\delta ^ { \bar { 3 } 4 } \mathrm { S }</LATEX> of 20.6 to 22.2%%, whereas gypsum has 834S of 21.3 to 21.8%% (Fig. 23D), all close to that of seawater sulfate <LATEX>\left( \delta ^ { 3 4 } \mathrm { S } = 2 1 . 2 4 \% o \right.</LATEX> Tostevin et al., 2014), with a slight decrease with depth (App. Table A5).
