You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

320g | The future of higher education in a disruptive world
tp8g | Executive summary
gxfd | The Golden Age of universities in the developed world is passing and life is becoming tougher. Rising costs are no longer matched by a willingness of governments and students to pay for them. And yet the traditional operating model of a university cannot produce sufficient productivity gains to cover the gap.
s2v1 | Even before the pandemic, the relentless rise in costs was going to bring matters to a head. The broad support for universities that has been a feature since the 1960s is faltering and real increases in per-student funding are unlikely in many jurisdictions.
jkp9 | In addition, universities are being buffeted by other forces. Technological change and a new world of work are generating calls for new types of post-secondary education. Demographic change will likely mean smaller domestic cohorts of students in most liberal democracies. Climate change is leading to expectations that public bodies will be carbon neutral in their operations. Competition from non-traditional entrants investing in large scale digital delivery threatens a portion of their markets. The Age of the Customer has arrived and students have higher expectations about the experience and what it will lead to.
z8tt | Traditional universities are approaching a crossroads. They must decide whether to transform themselves into new kinds of entities, optimize their existing operations in a search for further efficiencies and increased capability, do nothing in the hope that if no rescue appears they will have time to decide what to do later, or do nothing in the belief that they are invulnerable.
9g22 | This report analyzes the current state of higher education in a disruptive world and suggests four building blocks for a way forward, in terms of strategy, capabilities, operating model and technology. The result will be a 'connected university' able to keep delivering the extraordinary benefits that higher education can deliver for its communities.
41fx | The future of higher education in a disruptive world
7um8 | Introduction
uow2 | The Golden Age of universities enjoyed in the developed world since the mid- twentieth century is passing. Good times are giving way to tough times. Success will be harder to come by.
iat7 | This was already the case in 2019, but 2020 saw the black swan event of the pandemic, with the closure of international borders and the lockdown of domestic economies.
ywwr | For many universities, the future arrived ahead of schedule, abruptly and without invitation.
0i6j | Universities have been caught up in the post-COVID-19 trends affecting society but they have also experienced a world of pain uniquely their own, starting in Australia, where the new academic year was about to begin when borders were closed in February 2020. By the end of the year, many OECD members will have seen clearly what international education has really meant to their economy.
87cq | Bail-out packages for universities which were initially assumed to be coming, didn't arrive early, on the scale expected, or in some cases at all. Society, it turns out, had higher priorities.
0qs3 | Large numbers of lectures were put online, quickly, by scholars who had previously vowed never to have anything to do with it. Large numbers of adjuncts or sessional teachers were laid off, and faculty members were left with ... the students!
z8f7 | The business and operating models of many universities were exposed as critically reliant on the good times continuing.
7w7j | Real and painful as all this has been, most of the consequences of the pandemic were at least evident as emerging trends. Little of what follows in this report changes as a result of it; only the timing and urgency. The future has just arrived inconveniently early.
51vd | As with all discussions of the future, one makes educated judgments based on trends and the experience of sectors which were exposed earlier to the same drivers of change. In this, universities are lucky. The transformations many industries and organizations have gone through can be examined, and better practice adopted. Much of what follows in this report about the future state of universities is based on and adapted from hard evidence about what has worked elsewhere. Of all the claims and predictions that follow, perhaps the one most-confidently made is that higher education will move from relative uniformity to great diversity.
baj1 | Different types of providers and forms of provision will proliferate. Physically, we will see a mix of actual campuses, augmented campuses (where mixed reality and the analogue world fuse) and virtual learning environments. Educationally, we will see much more experimentation with content and delivery.
n1wo | And of all the forces impelling this diversity, the most powerful will be the search to meet the needs of individual students. The quality of personalized student learning will be key to institutional success.
5bq3 | This report is part of a wider project on KPMG Connected Enterprise for Higher Education, a framework for university transformation in the interests of stakeholders.
ezla | Much of the hard work of this transformation will be behind the scenes, invisible even. Transformation is not only about the curriculum, learning delivery, student support and research. It is about the back office, the operating model, the technology and, fundamentally, the sum of capabilities that reside in the organization: to be flexible, agile, deliberate and led by insights from the evidence.
rsbu | No one is guaranteed of success, but those institutions that have high levels of these capabilities will be far better equipped to survive disruption and, in turn, create it. And to be blunt, they will likely be more efficient, cost less to run and have more resources for their core purposes of learning and discovery.
magd | The focus of this report is higher education, and for practical purposes that means universities, which at this point in our history are by far the dominant providers. 'Higher education' itself is defined differently around the world, with some systems including within it quite practical, training institutions.
tb74 | Broadly, we are focusing on those institutions that deliver bachelor degrees and above, whether or not they also conduct research. However, much of what follows will still be relevant to vocational education in jurisdictions where that is clearly separated out as a sector.
8l69 | The focus is also on the institution rather than the system, but post-secondary systems around the world will need to be reimagined as well. The good news is that leading, transformed member institutions of those systems will have the most influence on the redesign.
1jyv | Universities are at or approaching a crossroads: Do they transform? Optimize? Do nothing and hope there is time to react? Or simply do nothing because they are invulnerable? This report, and the framework it introduces, is intended as a guide to the choice of roads to take.
olce | Transformation is not only about the curriculum, learning delivery, student support and research. It is about the back office, the operating model, the technology and, fundamentally, the sum of capabilities that reside in the organization.
erx1 | End of a golden age for universities
b3bt | The combination of human capital theory, equality of opportunity, the emergence of an export industry and the need for research combined to create a Golden Age of expansion and esteem. "
0w8m | Higher education since the Second World War has been an extraordinary growth story, moving from an elite system to a mass- or high-participation system in most jurisdictions. On average globally, one in three young people now enter higher education and more than three in four do so in Europe and North America.1 This expansion has contributed greatly to life-enrichment, nation-building, social well- being and technological progress.
vcu3 | Higher education growth has far outpaced other forms of growth. Higher education grew by a factor of 6.12 between 1970 and 2013, while population multiplied by 1.93 and real GDP by 3.63.2 The growth was advocated and justified on various grounds, all of which commanded popular support. 'Human capital theory' gave it an economic justification, showing that spending on higher education was actually an investment in economic growth. Equality of opportunity gave it a social justification. It is hard to argue against the idea of equality of opportunity or its close cousin, meritocracy.
