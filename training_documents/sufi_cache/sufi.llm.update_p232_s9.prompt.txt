You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

3vhx | Mention this, and you will most surely be accused of giving
1lk7 | yourself airs and graces.
rkgd | Try to live down this reputation, and you will have a hard time of it-
jbj0 | you may have to associate people with yourself literally for years before die fact penetrates into their minds that you are not a monster, not a mahatma, but a man trying first of all to teach them the basic tools of their own possible learning process, which should have been in their possession years before. It is these tools that should have been conveyed by the secondary type of teacher who passes on traditional learning.
f7b0 | Take another instance. Primitive thought depends strongly upon regularity, upon rhythm, upon reassurance. This is per- petuated in our time in the atavism whereby people have been encouraged to believe that they must be taught at a certain time (preferably the same time each day or week) in the same surround- ings, in the same manner. Tell them that this belongs to children and they may take it in one way, but they will tend to become confused and refuse, in effect, to take it in another.
9bdp | But do the reverse: give them authority figures, canonical books, hierarchies of authority, symbols, chants and costumes, and they will worship you and believe that you are on the 'right lines', whether they are or not; whether or not you have made up the cult the day before.
b1jn | This, too, real teachers have been compelled to demonstrate in actual instances before people would credit it.
f02j | If you cannot rationalise their previous learning with your teaching, you will have a hard time of it. You will be like a man telling a bedtime story to a child who refuses to agree that the wolf did not really eat up Red Riding Hood's grandmother after all.
uc93 | You will break the primitive totems at your peril. The irony here is that, if you allow yourself to be discredited in the eyes of the learner, you will harm him as well: for he has no other recourse, more often than not, than to adhere to some other system: one which will reassure him while inhibiting his progress.
24jr | Now there is another category of people. Those are the ones, who listen to, or read, entire expositions like the foregoing, and feel that they are exactly right. This feeling leads them to suppose
weol | that they must surely be first-class material. The real fact is that people who can attain a higher knowledge are those who can feel it in the right way: not just the people who decide that they are the 'right people'.
zo3w | In contemporary civilisations there is hardly a real thought about the possibility that people who feel a thing strongly may be feeling it in an erroneous and unconstructive manner except in delusion situations; let alone a word or words to describe the various states in which one can feel the conditioned conscience.
bqsc | The bitter truth is that, if a real metaphysical path is to be opened and maintained, it has to be mainly recruited from and staffed by people who have perhaps never heard of 'higher con- sciousness' or 'self realisation' in their lives. This is because the associative mechanism which does so much harm to man has long ago taken over the major part of the mentation of the would-be illuminated. Those who can save them are those whom they tend to discount, even to despise. They are people who are often younger, less experienced.
c2j4 | Esoteric studies today, as viewed by someone from outside, are an oldster's world, redolent of all the bitternesses and stupidities of the unregenerate old. A bitter thought in itself? Only if you are yourself bitter. If you can see a little more objectively, these remarks are statements of fact, and therefore of constructive potential.
k611 | What is so amazing is that people will so readily throw away the promise of a lifetime for what Rumi called the 'nuts and raisins and games' of shallower satisfactions.
6s1a | No wonder riper minds, hearing of esoteric studies, laugh and shrug them off.
xwwb | Are you innocent of confabulation, rationalisation, of accepting lower satisfactions, of calling self-indulgence 'higher activity', of oppressing others in the name of an assumed seniority, a little brief authority, of suppressing your own inklings and of mas- querade?
otfh | At the risk of adopting unfashionable terminology, I have to say that for all these and many other ways of thinking, feeling and acting, payment has some time to be made.
6dzi | The question of the present-day receptivity of people to Sufi
nk46 | ideas has not changed since the times when, 1,000 years ago, Hujwiri in his Revelation of the Veiled gave a little story which pointed out that you cannot receive if your mind is blocked with crude aspirations.
sbg4 | FAVOURS AND SLAVES
0vsm | A dervish and a king met. The king, following the custom in the East when a ruler meets a subject, said: 'Ask me a favour.'
rrsc | The dervish said: 'I will not request a favour from one of my own slaves.'
xjfg | The king asked him how he could see him as a slave.
iw9o | The dervish answered: I have two slaves who are your own masters: greed and expectation.'
enxg | The receptivity of man to Sufi ideas, which you ask about, is sometimes clouded by the demand for "being given' something. I say clouded, because there are really three conditions which have to be looked at. First, there is the potential of the human being- the endowment which he already has; second there is the inter- vention of the teaching function; lastly there is the effort which the individual makes in accepting the teaching and preserving the endowment.
vmnz | The last item is one about which people seem to have the least idea. Human potentiality is an endowment: and one which can be preserved, enriched and also spent.
82g8 | So, in addition to getting something, how about some attention to the matter of not losing something? Although I admit that this is a matter more easily understood by perception of how people are wasting their assets in this direction, at least the question can be stated in so many words.
l3g2 | THOUGHTLESSNESS
5ah7 | There is a parable about this, attributed to Jesus, but which does not appear in the approved gospels: though this does not make the analogy itself any less true. It is found in the putative Gospel of Thomas, which was found in Egypt in 1945.
cq8x | In this story, reference is made to a, woman carrying a container
dxup | of meal and walking a long distance. Unknown to her, the meal flows out behind her 'and she did not know how to work'. When she arrived at her house, she put down the container and found it to be empty. This parable refers to the 'Kingdom of the Father", and its applicability to our contention about the imperceptible loss of potentiality, through a form of thoughtlessness (called by the Sufis 'heedlessness') is very apposite to this subject
0xhz | SELLING HALF THE HOUSE
thwq | About giving and getting, Nasrudin visited a house-agent one day: 'I want to sell one half of the house I live in' he said.
nmx1 | 'But Mulla, I know your house - you only own one-half of it'
ng95 | That is exactly the point. I want to sell my half to buy the other half with the money I raise from the deal.'
ldw4 | The Giving of Charity
gynb | Q: Have you any remarks to make on the giving of Charity among Sufis?
yp2i | A: One commanding principle of all Sufis, binding upon them, is secret charity. Charity takes many forms. As to monetary charity:
