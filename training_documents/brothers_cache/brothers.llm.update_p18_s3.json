Likewise, two months after the Nobel Committee awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (in beginning of December twenty nineteen), neither President Isaias Afwerki nor any of his spokespeople had publicly commented upon the award or congratulated their 'brother in peace'.\nb780 | The absence of any institutionalisation of the peace declaration is obviously an increasing concern. Without this, considering the history of outbreak of war in nineteen ninety-eight, the unpredictability of the process is glaring. Currently, the 'peace' and 'reconciliation' content of the formal agreement are concepts held hostage by the political elites in both countries, without any border-population input or influence. Similarly, the resecuritisation of the border restricts its permeability and the possibility of advancing reconciliation and renegotiation of borderlands' identities.\nccmb | Consolidating peace and reconciliation bottom-up?\nma93 | Notwithstanding the hobbled formal top-level negotiation process and the set-back of closing the border, informal people-to-people reconciliation continues. Border populations are reconnecting as individuals and families, neighbouring communities, and even as local government administrators, and security forces on both sides of the border. Eritreans in the borderlands cross back and forth every day, although in dwindling numbers, for petty trade, to buy necessities, to visit friends and family, or to participate in religious or social ceremonies.\nc6hh | Paradoxically, the peace rapprochement led to a huge surge in Eritrean refugees into Ethiopia, a trend which continued after the border crossing was closed. The opening of the border in September twenty eighteen radically increased the flight of Eritrean refugees, as they no longer fear being shot by the Eritrean border patrols. Numbers from the spring of twenty nineteen given by local authorities in northern Ethiopia indicates that about two hundred fifty Eritreans cross every day and register as refugees. In addition, a sizeable group cross over and settle in Tigray or elsewhere in Ethiopia without registering as refugees. Elsa (name altered) is a representative of this category. I met her in the border town of Zalambessa, where she stood in the doorway of her small guesthouse and restaurant. 'All I want is to start a business and establish a future, without interference by the government', she explained. Elsa left her mother and father behind in her hometown of Senafe after the border between Eritrea and Ethiopia opened for free crossing in mid-September twenty eighteen. Her small business in Zalambessa is capitalising on the renewed cross-border traffic, as the town experiences an economic up-turn as its peace dividend. When asked if she has\ny7ea | been back to Senafe, she looked puzzled and claimed: 'Why? Whatever should I do in Senafe when the situation is as it is in Eritrea? I feel at home here in Zalambessa now'.\nnav4 | Local Tigrayan authorities in Zalambessa, as well as zonal authorities in Adigrat, confirmed that they communicate with their local government counterparts in Eritrea on issues of mutual concern. Likewise, both the front line force commander and security head in Zalambessa also stated that they talk regularly with their Eritrean counterparts, in order to 'administer' the fragile situation on the ground for the betterment of the border populations on both sides. It is doubtful, however, whether this localised cross-border communication between public entities is channelled through their respective capitals; this is a pragmatic approach adopted by state representatives on the ground, for various reasons and motivations. For instance, in lieu of a formal bilateral agreement regulating cross-border employment and business activities, in order to support themselves, the Tigray regional government has allowed all Eritreans to establish businesses without any licence and under temporary tax exemption. This situation has arisen because the TPLF believes it is best for Eritrea's future if as many Eritreans as possible stay in Tigray. This will enable a quick return after the situation changes in Asmara; they consider that the dire demographic haemorrhage of the Eritrean population will constitute the key challenge to rebuilding the country after a change of government.\ngem8 | Machinations and reconciliation: concluding remarks on the politics of peace\ne8nr | Complicating the consolidation of a sustainable people-to-people reconciliation process is the increasingly politicised and polarised context within Ethiopia, where the government party is de facto split, rendering the federal government incapacitated and unable to implement policy in several regions, in particular Tigray. As it seems clear that the peace rapprochement was entered into by President Isaias Afwerki due to the loss of power in Addis Ababa, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has kept the TPLF in the dark regarding the formal bilateral process. But, it is not Addis Ababa which controls the main border to Eritrea, but Mekelle. The tripartite elite power struggle between Asmara-Addis Ababa-Mekelle over defining the inter-state border and conditions on the ground, have thus a direct impact on grassroots people-to-people reconciliation.\nk78w | This is made explicitly in relation to the return of the Eritrean territories of Badme and Irob. The local populations in these two areas have articulated fear and\ng9du | insecurity in relation to the peace process and the possibility of displacement if their home areas are given to Eritrea (or 'coerced' to become Eritrean). A particular concern is expressed by the Irob minority group, whose homeland is nestled up against the Eritrean border, a part of which is granted to Eritrea according to the ruling. The local Irob administrator Nigussie Hagos explains:\nf682 | The decision would pose a big threat to the survival of the Irob people. We are not against the peace deal. But peace should not come at the expense of losing sovereignty. We are one hundred percent Ethiopians. If our peoples are divided between two countries, our very survival would be in question.\nli1k | Abba Tuum, Irob's Catholic parish priest, insisted that the only way to maintain peace in the Irob borderlands would be for any border-delineation process to include local elders from both sides of the border who would use customary mechanisms of reconciliation to settle the demarcation. In this way, the decision, anchored in international law, would be translated to the ground through customary law, and would thus obtain local legitimacy and respect.\npbea | The temporary reopening of the border in September twenty eighteen proved that the deep-rooted relationships between the people straddling the border are intact, even after twenty years of separation. It is thus doubtful that the renewed separation will recreate new enemy images. As the border peoples understand that the political conflict over the last two decades is an elite driven one, they are increasingly aware that, so too, is the formal politics of peace. It seems plausible that sustainable reconciliation in the Eritrean-Ethiopian borderlands would need to rely on grassroots-anchored processes, rather than politically motivated and irresolute formal peace declarations.\nccpt | Notes on contributor",
