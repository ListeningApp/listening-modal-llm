Nonetheless, well-designed translational materials and strategies that reflect an understanding of the constraints that policymakers face certainly have a greater chance of carrying the day than do research reports that are physically and cognitively inaccessible to policymakers. In addition, building strong relationships with public health law practitioners can help ensure that researchers and their work are responsive to practitioners' needs. When the streams of problem, policy, and politics merge, events often move quickly. Policy actors thus need answers to specific questions when the time is right for them, not when it serves the needs of funding, peer-reviewed publication, and promotion. As a field, public health law research must be dedicated to both the long-term work that builds a rigorous evidence base for policy and to a practice of \"translational service.\" The latter includes maintaining contact with policy actors, pursuing models of scholarship that can generate answers on a policy-relevant timeline (such as synthesizing existing evidence and applying it to current issues, or conducting simulation studies), and taking time from academic pursuits to serve as consultants. In the long run, all participants in public health law research-researchers, funders, consumers-have to work to narrow the gap between research that is fundable and research that is needed, and to invest in knowledge translation for its own sake. None of this is peculiar to public health law research, but researchers in this emerging field can aspire to be exemplary in their efforts, attending to and putting into practice the insights of research on translating evidence into policy.\n7xi5 | Conclusions\nw8r5 | Lawyers have long proclaimed the maxim that \"the health of the people is the supreme law,\" but in practice, making law work for public health is a constant challenge. Public health law research's contribution is to provide the evidentiary foundation for these efforts. Through policymaking studies, public health law research can identify forces that shape public health policy and strategies for effecting policy change. Mapping studies can show what has been done and thus what kind of action various government units can take. Through implementation studies, public health law research can provide information about how best to ensure that \"law on the books\" becomes effective \"law on the streets.\" Through intervention studies, it can determine which legal approaches are most efficacious in improving health environments, behaviors, and outcomes and can identify harmful legal side effects. Finally, public health law research mechanism studies can tell us why laws have the effects they do, and what mechanisms we can use to improve the effectiveness of legal interventions.\nybik | Although researchers carrying out this work and collectively advancing this vision face significant challenges, a combination of forces has brought us closer to meeting these challenges than ever before. The interest of research sponsors, the broader trend toward interdisciplinary research, the increasing number of legal scholars trained in social science disciplines, and signals from Washington that policy will increasingly be driven by evidence and expertise are all cause for optimism.\ngii5 | A recent posting on a law professor's blog raised the question of \"whether empiricism is a methodology or a philosophy.\" We argue it is both. We urge scholars of public health law to explore and recognize the value of empirical methods. We also hope that scholars and policymakers will adopt the philosophy that evidence derived from rigorous research ought to inform, if not drive, health policy decisions. Through the production of knowledge and conscientious efforts to translate research findings for decision makers, public health law research can make the case for laws that improve health.\nq5eu | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health\na7ao | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health\n29a3 | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health\nsb1e | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health\nw2yn | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health\nap6l | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health\n```",
