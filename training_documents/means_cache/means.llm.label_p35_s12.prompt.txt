You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

dgcw | · When the linear model is used to compare several means adjusted for the effect of one or more other variables (called covariates) it can be referred to as analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).
gvwz | · Before the analysis check that the covariate(s) are independent
sk5m | of any independent variables by seeing whether those independent variables predict the covariate (i.e., the covariate should not differ across groups).
qws8 | · In the table labelled Tests of Between-Subjects Effects, assuming you're using an alpha of 0.05, look to see if the value in the column labelled Sig. is below 0.05 for both the covariate and the independent variable. If it is for the covariate then this variable has a significant relationship to the outcome variable; if it is for the independent variable then the means (adjusted for the effect of the covariate) are significantly different across categories of this variable.
877u | · If you have generated specific hypotheses before the experiment use planned contrasts; if not, use post hoc tests.
rzhj | · For parameters and post hoc tests, look at the columns labelled Sig. to discover if your comparisons are significant (they will be if the significance value is less than 0.05). Use bootstrapping to get robust versions of these tests.
bfax | . In addition to the assumptions in Chapter 6, test for homogeneity of regression slopes by customizing the model to look at the independent variable × covariate interaction.
f2y8 | We have already looked at robust confidence intervals and p-values for the model parameters that were computed using bootstrapping and heteroscedasticity robust standard errors (Section 13.6.2). In addition, the companion website contains a syntax file (robustANCOVA.sps) for running a robust variant of ANCOVA (ancboot) that works on trimmed means and is described by Wilcox (2017). We need the Essentials for R plugin and WRS2 package installed (Section 4.13). This test is limited to the situation where the independent variable (the categorical predictor) has two categories and there is one covariate. But it does enable you to ignore assumptions and get on with your life. Because this syntax only works when you have two groups, I have provided a data file called PuppiesTwoGroup.sav, which contains the example data for
o7qm | this chapter but excluding the 15-minute condition, so it compares the control (no puppies) with the 30-minute group (Dose), and has the scores for the love of puppies covariate too (Puppy_love). The syntax to run the robust test is as follows: BEGIN PROGRAM R.
d52l | library(WRS2)
qlbb | mySPSSdata = spssdata.GetDataFromSPSS(factorMode = "labels") ancboot(Happiness ~ Dose + Puppy_love, data = mySPSSdata, tr = 0.2, nboot = 1000) END PROGRAM.
nhsg | Select and run these five lines of syntax (see SPSS Tip 10.3). As Output 13.13 shows, the test works by identifying values of the covariate for which the relationship between the covariate and outcome are comparable in the two groups. In this example it identifies five values of Puppy_love (2, 3, 5, 6, and 8) for which the relationship between love of puppies and happiness is comparable. At each of these design points, we're told the number of cases for the two groups (n1 and n2) that have a value of the covariate (Puppy_love) close to these design points (not exactly x, but close to it). Based on these two samples, trimmed means (20% by default) are computed and the difference between them tested. This difference is stored in the column Diff along with the boundaries of the associated 95% bootstrap confidence interval (corrected to control for doing five tests) in the next two columns. The test statistic comparing the difference is in the column statistic, with its p-value in the final column. Output 13.12 shows no significant differences between trimmed means for any of the design points (all p-values are greater than 0.05).
hy0l | 13.9 Bayesian analysis with covariates
4jmz | Because the model we have fitted is a linear model with a categorical predictor and a continuous predictor, you can use what you learned in Section 9.13 to run a Bayesian regression. You would need to manually create dummy variables (as in the file Puppy Love Dummy.sav) and drag these to the box labelled Factor(s) and drag Puppy_Love to the box labelled Covariate(s) see Figure 13.10. You would interpret in the same way as the model we fitted in Section 9.13.

0b39 | 13.10 Calculating the effect size
qecd | In the previous chapter we used eta squared, n2, as an effect size measure when comparing means (Section 12.10). When we include a covariate too we have more than one effect and we could calculate eta squared for each effect. We can also use an effect size measure called partial eta squared (partial n2). This differs from eta squared in that it looks not at the proportion of total variance that a variable explains, but at the proportion of variance that a variable explains that is not explained by other variables in the analysis. Let's look at this with our example. Suppose we want to know the effect size of the dose of puppy therapy. Partial eta squared is the proportion of variance in happiness that the dose of puppy therapy shares that is not attributed to love of puppies (the covariate). If you think about the variance that the covariate cannot explain, there are two sources: it cannot explain the variance attributable to the dose of puppy therapy, SSpuppy therapy, and it cannot explain the error variability, SSR. Therefore, we use these two sources of variance instead of the total variability, SST, in the calculation. The difference between eta squared and partial eta squared is illustrated by comparing the following two equations:
1o7p | 2 SSEffect
cp13 | nº= > SS Total
bgre | (13.6)
57lp | Partial 72= SSEffect + SSResidual SS Effect
ukth | (13.7)
kpvt | SPSS Statistics will produce partial eta squared for us (see Jane Superbrain Box
jie2 | 13.3), but to illustrate its calculation look at equation (13.8), where we use the sums of squares in Output 13.6 for the effect of dose (25.19), the covariate (15.08) and the error (79.05):
d0ik | Partial nDose= SSDose + SSResidual SSDose 25.19 25.19 25.19+ 79.05 104.24 = 0.24
0x0s | (13.8)
4exe | Partial nPuppy_love SS Puppy_love + SSResidual SS Puppy_love 15.08+79.05 15.08 15.08 -= 0.16 94.13
0myz | You can also use omega squared (@2). However, as we saw in Section 12.8, this measure can be calculated only when we have equal numbers of participants in each group (which is not the case in this example). So, we're a bit stumped! Not all is lost, though, because, as I've said many times already, the overall effect size is not nearly as interesting as the effect size for more focused comparisons. These are easy to calculate because we selected to see the model parameters (see Output 13.8) and so we have t-statistics for the covariate and comparisons between the 15-and 30-minute groups and the control and 30-minute group. These t-statistics have 26 degrees of freedom (see Section 13.6.1). We can use the same equation as in Section 10.9.5:6
xh3i | 6 Strictly speaking, we should use a slightly more elaborate procedure when groups are unequal. It's a bit beyond the scope of this book, but Rosnow, Rosenthal, and Rubin (2000) give a very clear account.
syiw | "Contrast = Vt2 + df t2
kg3t | (13.9)
lvae | Therefore, we get (using t from Output 13.8) values of 0.40 for the covariate, and 0.48 and 0.11 respectively for the comparison of the 30-minute group and control, and the 15-and 30-minute groups:
o9sc | <LATEX>r _ { \text { Covariate } } = \sqrt { \frac { 2 . 2 3 ^ { 2 } } { 2 . 2 3 ^ { 2 } + 2 6 } } = \sqrt { \frac { 4 . 9 7 } { 3 0 . 9 7 } } = 0 . 4 0</LATEX> <LATEX>r _ { \text { 30 minsvs. control } } = \sqrt { \frac { \left( - 2 . 7 7 \right) ^ { 2 } } { \left( - 2 . 7 7 \right) ^ { 2 } + 2 6 } } = \sqrt { \frac { 7 . 6 7 } { 3 3 . 6 7 } } = 0 . 4 8</LATEX> <LATEX>r _ { 3 0 \text { vs. } 1 5 \text { mins } } = \sqrt { \frac { \left( - 0 . 5 4 \right) ^ { 2 } } { \left( - 0 . 5 4 \right) ^ { 2 } + 2 6 } } = \sqrt { \frac { 0 . 2 9 } { 2 6 . 2 9 } } = 0 . 1 1</LATEX> (13.10)
121u | For the effect of the covariate and the difference between the 30-minute and control groups the effects are not only statistically significant but also substantive in size. The difference between the 30-and 15-minute groups was a fairly small effect.
zh03 | 13.11 Reporting results
1mvw | When using covariates you can report the model in much the same way as any other. For the covariate and the experimental effect give details of the F-statistic and the degrees of freedom from which it was calculated. In both cases, the <LATEX>F -</LATEX> statistic was derived from dividing the mean squares for the effect by the mean squares for the residual. Therefore, the degrees of freedom used to assess the <LATEX>F -</LATEX> statistic are the degrees of freedom for the effect of the model <LATEX>\left( d f _ { M } = 1 \right.</LATEX> for the covariate and 2 for the experimental effect) and the degrees of freedom for the residuals of the model <LATEX>\left( d f _ { R } = 2 6 \right.</LATEX> for both the covariate and the experimental effect) - see Output 13.6. The correct way to report the main findings would be:
6d4s | The covariate, love of puppies, was significantly related to the participant's happiness, <LATEX>F \left( 1 , 2 6 \right) = 4 . 9 6 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>p = 0 . 0 3 5 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>r = 0 . 4 0 .</LATEX> There was also a significant effect of puppy therapy on levels of happiness after controlling for the effect of love of puppies, <LATEX>F \left( 2 , 2 6 \right) = 4 . 1 4 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>p = 0 . 0 2 7 ,</LATEX> partial <LATEX>\eta ^ { 2 } =</LATEX> 0.24.
mqah | We can also report some contrasts (see Output 13.8):
xxr8 | Planned contrasts revealed that having 30 minutes of puppy therapy significantly increased happiness compared to having a control, <LATEX>t \left( 2 6 \right) =</LATEX> -2.77, <LATEX>p = 0 . 0 1 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>r = 0 . 4 8 ,</LATEX> but not compared to having 15 minutes, <LATEX>t \left( 2 6 \right) =</LATEX> -0.54,
rl4j | <LATEX>p = 0 . 5 9 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>r = 0 . 1 1 .</LATEX> 13.12 Brian's attempt to woo Jane
vz32 | The encounter in Blow Your Speakers had been beyond weird. Jane felt terrible. This Brian guy was so nice to her, and she'd just told him where to go - again! It
ncb0 | had been easy to dismiss Brian at first, he'd seemed like a loser, a waste of her time. But there was more to him than that: he'd been working hard to learn statistics, and he'd made impressive progress. She liked how awkward he was around her, and how he always defaulted to talking stats. It was endearing. It could derail her research, though, and he could never know about that. She was a monster, and if he found out the truth it would be another let-down. Best to keep her distance.
8mp0 | Figure 13.11 What Brian learnt from this chapter
xjyk | The phone rang. It was her brother, Jake. She loved and admired Jake like no one else. Until he left home, he'd been her sanity in the madhouse that they grew up in. Their parents, both highly successful academics, were at home only long enough to pile the pressure on them both to succeed. Jane reacted by spending her youth in books, in a futile pursuit of their attention. Every set of straight As was met with 'these are just a step towards the exams that really matter, you'll need to up your game'. She was tired of trying to impress them. Jake was her opposite - he'd realized early on that he could never win. He let the pressure roll off him, and left home as soon as he could. But he always looked out for Jane.
mt0f | 'Mum is in hospital,' he said as the blood drained from Jane's legs.
awab | 'I don't care,' she replied, but she did. She also wanted to see Brian, because he was the closest thing she had to a friend in this town.
ixcc | 13.13 What next?
8p6h | At the age of 13 I met my heroes, Iron Maiden, and very nice they were too. I've met them a couple of times since (not because they're my best buddies or anything exciting like that, but over the years the fan club put on various events where you were allowed to stand next to them and gibber like a fool while they humoured you politely). You'll notice that the photo at the start of this chapter is signed by Dave Murray. This wasn't possible because I had my own darkroom installed backstage at the Hammersmith Odeon in which I could quickly process photographs, or because I had access to time travel (sadly), but because I took the photo with me when I met him in 2000. I recounted the tale of how terrified I had been about meeting him in 1986. If he thought I was some strange stalker he certainly didn't let on. Uncharacteristic of most people who've sold millions of albums, they're lovely blokes.
