You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0yab | DESIGN, TESTING, AND APPLICATION OF MOISTURE IMPERVIOUS CABLE
w95z | Abstract - Moisture barriers can effectively protect the insulation of medium voltage cables from water treeing. Activities to study and qualify the performance of moisture barrier cable have progressed on a global scale. Design concepts for three types of moisture barrier cable are presented. One design includes wire neutrals with a separate moisture barrier over the neutrals and under the jacket. In the second design, the moisture barrier acts as both a radial water block as well as a shield. Materials for the sheath, such as plastic coated metals, water- blocking tapes, cushion layers for thermal expansion, and adhesives for sealing are discussed. The third design utilizes a thin lead/plastic laminate placed directly over the insulation semi-conducting screen. This is called an "on-core design." Standardization activities for watertight cable are proceeding on an international scale. Application of watertight cables in several power systems indicate reduced fault rates and lack of failures associated with treeing.
0i1k | INTRODUCTION
dqlg | A research project sponsored by the Canadian Electrical Association (CEA) evaluated the performance of an XLPE insulated cable with a plastic coated aluminum foil as a moisture barrier.' The work showed that "Moisture barriers can be very effective in reducing the ingress of moisture into the cable to the extent that water treeing is not a problem."
p6pq | A research project sponsored by the Electrical Power Research Institute (EPRI) examined both materials for moisture barriers and the preparation of. cable models to test these materials.2 In the final phase of the project, prototype cables were evaluated with coated copper or coated aluminum under-jacket moisture barriers. The tests run were: 1) 60 cable loading cycles of four hours up to 90℃, four hours at 90°C, and sixteen hours of cooling; 2) bending around a 14 inch (356mm) mandrel for three cycles; and 3) moisture penetration using weight loss. There was no failure in any of the tests. The conclusion was that "the moisture barrier metal foil/ polyolefin laminates essentially protect the cable from moisture ingress without any adverse effect on the mechanical properties of the cable."
zse6 | Activities such as these to study and quantify the performance of moisture barrier cable are progressing on a global basis. The data continue to indicate that the common sense approach to prevent water treeing is to keep moisture out of the cable. Along these lines the concept of moisture impervious cable
p2n3 | is emerging. Moisture impervious cable can be defined as a cable that is designed to block both the longitudinal and radial ingress of moisture to the cable. The objective is to prevent moisture from reaching either the inner or outer surface of the insulation. Radial moisture transmission is blocked by a layer of metal between the outer surface of the insulation and the inner surface of the protective jacket. Longitudinal moisture transmission is blocked by strand filling of the conductor and by the use of swellable powders or tapes within the air spaces or interfaces between the insulation system, the metallic shield or neutral and the protective jacket.
ohh7 | There are other related terms that have also come into use in defining cables that include some form of protection against the effects of moisture. A moisture barrier cable can be defined as a cable with a metallic layer over the core to block radial ingress of moisture. A moisture resistant cable can be defined as a cable designed to accept moisture ingress, but incorporating design measures and/or materials to reduce susceptibility to moisture.
vbni | This paper will review the design concepts for under-jacket and on-core moisture impervious cable, discuss the material requirements for such cable, cover standard- ization activities for moisture impervious cable, including test development, and provide application data.
dgcw | DESIGN CONCEPTS FOR MOISTURE BARRIER CABLE
gvwz | Under-Jacket Moisture Barrier With Wire Neutral
sk5m | Coated aluminum moisture barriers, bonded to the jacket, are recommended for use with wire neutrals. Table I describes the construction of a cable design utilizing coated aluminum. The aluminum is not acting as a shield, but should be grounded to the neutrals at their ground points to insure that there is no build-up of voltage on the moisture barrier. For this reason, a one-side coated tape is recommended. The uncoated side is in contact with the semi-conductive water- blocking tape and the neutrals. The moisture barrier should be at ground potential over its entire length.
qws8 | By bonding the moisture barrier to the cable jacket, the coated aluminum or copper can be applied smooth rather than corrugated. A significant advantage of bonding the aluminum to the jacket is improved mechanical properties, such as bend and crush resistance. The bond between the jacket and the moisture
877u | barrier forms a longitudinal water block. The seal in the overlap blocks moisture in this interface. The moisture barrier forms a radial moisture block. The water swellable tapes form a longitudinal water block at the moisture barrier - core interface. If a strand filled conductor is used, then the cable can be described as moisture impervious. The strand filling or solid conductor forms a longitudinal conductor water block.
rzhj | Use of semi-conductive water-swellable tapes, longitudinally folded, will usually reduce costs and increase line speeds versus the use of helically wrapped tapes. There are several choices for the waterblocking tape. Combinations of higher or lower swelling ratio tape can be used.
bfax | Charge transfer through the semi-conductive tape to the bare side of the moisture barrier will bring the barrier to the electrical . potential of the neutral. This eliminates grounding concerns over the cable length. Corrosion should not be a problem in case of sheath puncture or exposed ends. Water flow is limited by the swelling of the water blocking tape.
f2y8 | Under-Jacket Using Combination Moisture Barrier And Shield
o7qm | A cable construction using coated copper as both a radial moisture barrier and shield is described in Table II. This type of cable may be used in industrial applications and as substation feeder cable by power companies. The coated copper can function as both the shield or neutral as well as the moisture barrier. The use of a longitudinally folded coated copper
d52l | 0.15 mm (0.006 in) is recommended to replace spirally wrapped shields of copper tapes. Economics are improved with the combination shield/moisture barrier as compared to constructions with separate components.
qlbb | The copper tape can be applied smooth or corrugated. However, the use of corrugated copper shields for power cable is increasing due to a number of factors. First, the longitudinally applied corrugated shield has many electrical and mechanical advantages over helically applied copper tape shields or copper wire shields. equipment and operation for applying Second, the forming corrugated shields has advanced significantly in recent years, allowing the use of longitudinally folded shields on large diameter power cables. Generally use of smooth tape on the larger cables is a difficult manufacturing operation. Third, the experience history of cables with longitudinally corrugated and folded shields is approaching 20 years. This experience has been excellent which is now leading to increased utilization of this type of shield.
nhsg | On-Core Moisture Barrier
hy0l | In this construction, a laminate of lead coated on both sides with a semi-conducting adhesive copolymer is utilized. The lead is quite thin, usually 2 mils, and the laminate is designed to expand and contract with the cable core. The moisture barrier laminate is placed directly over the semi-conducting
4jmz | screen and under the concentric neutral or shield. A semi-conducting bedding tape is normally used to protect the moisture barrier from the cutting effect of the neutral wires. Any jacket material may be utilized.
b7cq | The principle advantage of the "On-Core" type of moisture barrier is that it directly protects the outer surface of the insulation screen and thus guards against longitudinal water migration around the neutral wires as well as radial permeation through the jacket. Thus, a water blocking tape at the neutral jacket interface is not a necessity. However, a semi-conducting bedding tape over the moisture barrier is required to prevent damage to the moisture barrier by the neutral wires when the insulation is expanded by load cycling. The moisture barrier must also be able to expand and contract with the insulation under such conditions.
