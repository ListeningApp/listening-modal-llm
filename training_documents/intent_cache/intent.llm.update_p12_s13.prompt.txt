You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

mnaf | At the same time, sharing all this information would have taken time out of the therapy session
0yxe | and would have taken the focus off of Vera and her unique experience of cancer. Therefore, the best responses would have been those described as ther- apeutic in the preceding paragraphs.
erre | Nonverbal Cue
835g | An interpersonal event that took place follow- ing Erika's disclosure involved a nonverbal cue. Rather than saying something compassionate or empathetic, Vera was not satisfied with Erika's disclosure and, instead, stared blankly.
x3l9 | Therapeutic Response
d2fj | At this point one example of a therapeutic response might have involved asking about the nonverbal cue. Knowing that one of Vera's central interper- sonal characteristics involves a high need for con- trol, Erika might have said, "I am wondering if my responses are not hitting the mark for you? I am wondering if there is anything else I can do to help understand your experience and to show you how I might be able to support your rehabilitation?" By venturing an interpretation of Vera's blank look and asking a question such as this, Erika would have reasserted her central goal, which was to understand Vera's cancer experience. Additionally, it would have allowed Erika to maintain an appropriate (and, in this case, necessary) leadership role within the ther- apeutic relationship, limiting the extent to which Vera could continue her excessive questioning.
geyi | Suboptimal Response
2181 | Erika either did not recognize Vera's blank stare as a nonverbal cue or chose not to respond to it. This al- lowed Vera to continue to challenge Erika's credibil- ity and assume a more dominant position within the interaction. In many cases, it is desirable when our clients take charge within the therapeutic relation- ship. Participation and independence are among the core values of our profession. However, there are situations in which a client may assert dominance during an interaction in a way that is uncomfortable, condescending, or overly assertive. The interaction between Vera and Erika is one such circumstance.
9ubl | Power Dilemma
o8pj | Unabated, Vera continues questioning and con- fronting Erika whenever she feels that she is avoid- ing a question or does not have the correct answers
27b9 | about cancer treatment and rehabilitation. Erika tries to avoid openly arguing with Vera, but she now feels as if she is trapped within an uncomfortable interaction. The undercurrent to Vera's behavior is that she is angry and unhappy about the fact that her breast cancer and all the requisite treatments have interrupted her life and functioning. Because she has always felt in control of her own destiny and now feels out of control, Vera is having difficulty not lashing out at others around her.
09xa | Therapeutic Response
yi97 | At this point, Erika should attempt to stop the negative dynamic in order to avoid the occurrence of additional interpersonal events and the possible deterioration of a new relationship with her client. To do this, she might say something such as, "I am getting the feeling that my responses to your ques- tions are not aligning with your experience. I am wondering if there is anything else I can do to help understand your experience and better support your experience here?"
4zj7 | Suboptimal Response
3wgh | Erika thought she was being as kind and empathetic as possible with Vera by actively ignoring her overly assertive questions and provocative comments. Instead, Vera experienced Erika's behaviors as dis- missive, and her passivity only stoked Vera's need for control and dominance.
uvo3 | Empathic Break
yjbv | Having been pushed to the limits of her patience, Erika communicated an empathic break by in- troducing a research article touting the virtues of chemotherapy to Vera. She missed or ignored the fact that Vera did not respond and only learned that Vera did not appreciate the therapy session when her supervisor informed her that Vera had requested to work with a different therapist.
l6it | In summary, Erika missed several opportunities to interrupt the interpersonal event cascade that developed with Vera. Had she learned and practiced the skills and concepts of the IRM, she might have approached the interaction with a greater level of intentionality and a more therapeutic approach to developing an empathetic understanding of her client.
h8x1 | Interpersonal Skill Base
6qtq | The therapist's interpersonal skill base comprises a contin- uum of skills that are judiciously applied by the therapist to build a functional working relationship with the client. The perspective of the model is that, depending on the unique experiences, knowledge, and innate capacities of the ther- apist, some of these skills come naturally whereas others require significant effort and practice to develop.
wm3n | These interpersonal skills are summarized in terms of nine categories.
1anr | Therapeutic communication
600w | · Interviewing skills and strategic questioning
60w7 | · Establishing productive relationships with clients
1a5g | Working effectively with spouses, partners, families, social systems, and groups
0oof | Working effectively with supervisors, employers, and other professionals
p930 | Understanding and managing difficult interpersonal behavior
xhc7 | Resolving empathic breaks and conflicts
6a60 | ·Professional behavior, including maintaining appropri- ate interpersonal boundaries, values, and ethics
dfgj | · Therapist self-care and professional development
6ptp | The first category, therapeutic communication, involves activities such as verbal and nonverbal communication skills, therapeutic listening, assertiveness, providing clients with direction and feedback, and seeking and responding to client feedback. Interviewing skills comprise another skill set that involves being watchful and intentional about the way in which one approaches the process of asking a client questions. Strategic questioning is a specific ap- proach to questioning born out of cognitive psychology (e.g., Beck, 1995). It involves asking questions in a way that guides the respondent to think more broadly or dif- ferently. Establishing relationships with clients includes rapport building, matching your therapeutic style to the interpersonal demands of the client, managing a client's strong emotion, judicious use of touch, understanding the roles of spiritual and religious diversity in occupational therapy, and cultural sensitivity.

ssp0 | aspect of occupational therapy practice. It includes using the guiding principles of IRM in combination with prom- inent systems theories to gain the collaboration of part- ners, parents, other family, and friends to serve the goals of therapy. It also involves understanding the structure, process, and interpersonal dynamics of group therapy.
108o | Another fundamental skill involves knowing how to work collaboratively with supervisors, employers, and other professionals. It involves knowing how to commu- nicate with other professionals about clients both in the presence and in the absence of those clients. Additionally, it requires understanding the power dynamics and value systems that underlie supervisor and student, as well as employer and employee, relationships. Understanding and managing clients' difficult behavior is another category of necessary interpersonal skills required in many practice situations. It involves knowing how to respond effectively to behaviors that involve manipulation, excessive depen- dence, symptom focusing, resistance, emotional disengage- ment, denial, difficulty with rapport and trust, and hostility. Responding effectively helps limit the extent to which this behavior disrupts the goals and processes of therapy.
