The initial 'just act like that' and the 'we wanna have fun' are constructed in the iterative present tense, suggesting a regular action and motive pattern. The repeated use of 'just' works to downplay the seriousness of the scripted action and motives, and the 'that's just the way we are' is a dispositional account for their motives and actions. The claim is that they have been misunderstood by the moderator and that they are not really complicit with immaturity here, although it may look that way from an outsider's perspective. By privileging an interior realm of motives and playing it against an exterior world of particulars, Don is able to claim misinterpretation, which allows him to counter the dispositional inference that they are immature by scripting the event as 'just having fun' and their disposition as 'just the way we are', thus inoculating themselves from appearing literally or seriously preoccupied with girls' physical appearances. He is also able to position the moderator as a member of the 'na√Øve adult category', uninformed about what is really going on. Maturity is accomplished in the subtle and shifting discursive space where empirical particulars, motives, and dispositions are played off one another.\nqf11 | In the following excerpt, the boys position themselves as being motivated in their voyeuristic interest for seeing girls in bathrooms and locker rooms, and thus not responsible or immature. In order to manage the moderator's challenges, they work up a dispositional and scripted account of the girls' motives as having causal force. Although maturity is not explicitly mentioned, the boys defend against the charge that they are habitually 'invading' the girls' privacy, which is hearable as a general index of immaturity.\n8oqt | Excerpt two Participants: M: Moderator, E: Ernie, J: Jasper, W: Wilson, A: Aaron\n6zah | W: I've really gone into a girls' bathroom and I've gone into a girls' locker room=\n4v5o | J: =oh: the nastiest thing in the world=\nha9e | W: =one time was kinda' on accident\nxrnt | M: whadaya' think the girls think about it=\nc8ra | J: =no (.) they didn't see us=\np1l0 | W: =I thought it was cool when I walked in\n1i8b | M: but still (.) don't you think you are invading their :=\n5sfj | J: =I wasn't (.) cause I thought it was CO-ED\nvk4h | W: I had to pee I had to pee and when I walked in and saw the toilets (.) and I\nnsm3 | didn't see ours (.) well (.)

There are four soft challenges by the moderator that construct the boys as potentially immature. The first two are minimized by being constructed as misplaced concerns ('they didn't see us'), by playing dumb ('I thought it was co-ed'), or by claiming an emergency ('I had to pee'). These forms of mitigation are fairly common in our data as flippant excuse-making strategies. The third challenge of the moderator comes in line twelve. It is hearable as a more general concern, as indexed with the dramatic 'so wait' preface, followed by a general request ('let's think about that') and the generalized action sequence of 'that guys are walking into girls' locker rooms or bathrooms. Unlike the first two, this challenge is a generalized challenge that scripts the boys' actions as potentially reoccurring or habitual, which can be heard as dispositional immaturity. As such, managing this kind of challenge requires special work. It makes relevant a rejoinder where motives are central.\n5lm9 | Interestingly, Wilson and Ernie's reply is a scripted account of the girls' behaviour. They draw up a generalized account of what the girls are doing by using the following devices: the iterative present tense ('be always trying', 'be doing', 'be like'), event pluralization with extreme case formulations ('AL :: WAYS trying to model'), and manner expressions ('they'd be like OHH lemme see'). The account works to secure that the phenomena of concern (the boys' voyeuristic activity and interest - and by extension, their immaturity) are habitually 'in the object', rather than being caused by the boys, who can be held accountable. It is the girls who regularly motivate them to be interested in seeing the girls' bodies, because it is the girls who model for them. In addition, Ernie seems to create a bit of symmetry between the sexes by noting that 'girls do the very same thing', even going so far as to impersonate a girl gawking over seeing a guy's 'package'. The moderator's final challenge takes issue with such a symmetrical characterization of girls ('not girls'), which makes relevant Wilson's rather robust statement that girls 'are just as perverted as guys', and to think they are not is a 'misconception'. Again, this positions the moderator as 'misunderstanding', and it positions girls as having actual motives which contradict their supposed 'politeness'. This places girls' motives on a symmetrical footing with boys' motives. By doing this, the boys are able to characterize their motives as normative, and not deviant or immature in any kind of unique way.\nwp2c | Denials with built-in concessions\nus5v | Another way the boys maintain a position of 'maturity' while not appearing overly preoccupied in their attraction to girls' looks is to craft denials with built-in concessions. This type of denial often comes in three parts. The concession often follows an initial proposition in order to soften and repair the original overstated claim and is then followed by a revised, weaker statement than the original proposition. The structure is as follows:\nrs2m | One. Initial proposition (hearable as extreme)\nuz9y | Two. Concession (positions the original proposition as disputable)\n8ov0 | Three. Revised, weaker statement (hearable now as more reasoned)\nmj9m | In the extract below, Don and Hal build two rather robust concessions to manage\n94h3 | Excerpt three\n9jx1 | Participants: M: Moderator, D: Don, H: Hal, A: Andy\nc3lz | M: so looks (.) important (.) not that important really, or=\n8bwk | D: =no (.) not=\nez9s | M: =although good looking is not bad\n```",
