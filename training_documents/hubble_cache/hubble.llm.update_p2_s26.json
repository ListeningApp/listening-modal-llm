(six)\nsk5m | The model has two free parameters namely q and H sub zero in the entire parametric space array We perform a grid search left parenthesis q greater than negative one and H sub zero greater than or equal to zero right parenthesis to end array find the best fit model. We find that the best fit values of q equals negative zero point one eight and H sub zero equals sixty-eight point four three together array the parameters are q equals negative zero point one eight with chi squared sub nu equals one point four nine, where chi squared sub nu equals end array chi squared sub min over (degree of freedom). Here and in what follows H sub zero is in the units of kilometers per second per megaparsec. The negative value of q suggests that the newly obtained H left parenthesis z right parenthesis data confirms the accelerating nature of the present-day Universe.

The apparent magnitude M of the supernova is related to the luminosity distance dL of the supernova through\nrzhj | m equals M plus five log ten one megaparsec dL plus twenty-five, (seven)\nbfax | where M is the absolute magnitude, which is believed to be constant for all SNe Ia.\nf2y8 | It is convenient to work with Hubble free luminosity distance given by\no7qm | DL(Z) equals Ho dL(Z).

(ten)\n0b39 | The Hubble free luminosity distance DL, in the present case, for a geometrically flat Universe reads as\nqecd | DL(Z) equals left parenthesis one plus Z right parenthesis integral H left parenthesis Z right parenthesis dZ prime equals left bracket left parenthesis one plus Z right parenthesis minus left parenthesis one plus Z right parenthesis to the negative nine. (eleven)\n1o7p | SNe Ia are always used as standard candles, and are believed to provide strongest constraints on the cosmological parameters. In the present analysis, we use recently released Union two set of five hundred fifty-seven SNe Ia from Supernova Cosmology Project. In this case, we define the chi squared as\ncp13 | chi squared sub SN left parenthesis q comma Ho right parenthesis equals the sum from i equals one to five hundred fifty-seven of left bracket m sub i left parenthesis z sub i comma q comma Ho right parenthesis minus m sub obs left parenthesis z sub i right parenthesis right bracket squared over sigma sub i\nbgre | (twelve)\n57lp | After performing a grid search in the entire parametric space (q greater than negative one and Ho greater than zero), we find that the best fit values of the parameters are q equals negative zero point thirty-eight and Ho equals sixty-nine point eighteen together with chi squared equals zero point ninety-nine. Again, the power-law cosmological model fitted with the five hundred fifty-seven SNe Ia data confirms the cosmic acceleration with q equals negative zero point thirty-eight. The likelihood contours at sixty-eight point three percent (inner contour), ninety-five point four percent (middle contour) and ninety-nine point seventy-three percent (outer contour) confidence levels around the best fit values point (negative zero point thirty-eight, sixty-nine point eighteen) (indicated by star symbol) in the q minus Ho plane are shown in Figure two. The errors at one sigma level are derived as q equals negative zero point thirty-eight plus or minus zero point zero five and Ho equals sixty-nine point eighteen plus point fifty-five minus point fifty-four.\nukth | Five BEST-FITTING MODEL FROM THE JOINT TEST: H(Z) PLUS SNE IA DATA\nkpvt | In order to obtain tighter constraints on the model parameters and to avoid degeneracy in the observational data, we combine H(z) and SNe Ia data. Since H(z) and SNe Ia data are obtained from independent cosmological probes, the total likelihood is considered to be the product of separate likelihoods of the two probes. Therefore, we define\njie2 | chi squared total equals chi squared sub H plus chi squared sub SN\nd0ik | (thirteen)\n0x0s | In the joint analysis, we find that the best fit values of the parameters are q equals negative zero point thirty-four and Ho equals sixty-eight point ninety-three together with\n4exe | chi squared sub nu equals one point zero one. The joint test also confirms the cosmic acceleration with q equals negative zero point three four.
