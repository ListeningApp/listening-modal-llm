You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

q1q2 | Speaking of that, I wanted to ask you about the guitar sound at the very top of "The Bells and the Birds." It's incredibly transporting, mesmerizing, rhythmic. That's just the two guitars?
cb7r | G.W .: Yeah. That's two guitars. [Laughs.]
68xu | D.R .: Well, it would've started with Gill coming up with a finger-style guitar part of reasonable complexity.
hd35 | G.W .: Probably one of the more complex parts I play.
2zpk | D.R .: You were imagining trying to write something that felt a little bit like CSNY's "Guinevere."
epu7 | G.w .: Something that floats. I wanted something that wasn't primitive, wasn't minimalistic.
7od1 | D.R .: And you had the phrase "The Bells aAnd the Birds." I was thinking about old classical music, how they'd try to illustrate language with the instruments-I love that literalism. So I wanted there to be bell-ish sounds that went along with the title. I wanted to think about a part that would float above it. I just wanted to come up with a little part that would be chime-y and would drift and intertwine. That would have a landscape to it. We ended up recording it in a way where we used microphones between us to catch the sound already combined, as opposed to microphones closer to the guitars.
0bqy | G.w .: The music had actually combined in the air before the mike picked it up. So it has that organic swirling.
b780 | In general, your work tends to be a little mournful, a little melancholic. I'm always curious about the animating impulse for songwriters-what sort of feeling, or what sort of idea, is most likely to get them to pick up a guitar or a pen. Do you find that you both tend to write through moments of contemplation or sadness more than moments of pleasure?
ccmb | G.W .: Yes. Yes, for me.
ma93 | D.R .: Yeah, I would agree. The songs all deal with a certain kind of melancholy something, but-
c6hh | G.W .: Our narrators are never defeated. As low as they are, it's not the end. I do believe I'm an optimist. I have profound faith in the human spirit, that people can get through the unimaginable. I think that's in the songs, and it's related to us and to me and those moments when I pick up a guitar. And they do tend to be sorrowful moments. But that's just part of the human response. You don't get through something by ignoring it. You get through it by really feeling it. I have yet to find anything in my life that cannot be expressed through folk music.
y7ea | I was a pretty obsessive music listener as a kid, and in a way, I think I learned what feelings were that way.
nav4 | G.W .: I think about that all the time. It was my first glimpse of a world I felt like I wanted to be part of. I didn't want the boring world. I wanted the world with the drunks and the clowns and the suitcases. I had to work my way up to the more raw and primary emotions that are present in a Stanley Brothers song. That was a lot to handle. The drunk husband, the man damned to a life in jail-I had to work my way up to processing that. But now, you know, I'm kinda there. I'm a grown woman now, and-excuse my language-some shit has happened.
gem8 | It seems to me as if your lyrics are a mix of pure fiction and what could maybe be called autofiction. How often are your songs rooted in personal experience?
e8nr | D.R .: Sometimes you're writing a song about something completely different, and then you realize that there's an experience that you can draw upon that creates this beautifully incisive verse, and changes the course of the song. Maybe it wasn't what you were starting out to express, but all of a sudden you have this avenue to express it. I think in our world, we're not trying to . . . the things we're trying to express are always more complicated than just sitting down and saying, "I'm gonna write a song about this last experience that I had."
k78w | G.W .: That's exactly it. I feel like we're right on the bull's-eye when there's mystery. When there's mystery, we're in the right place. We can't help but put true experiences into the songs. Lately, it has seemed to me that there's no such thing as truly random. You can put eight words on the table and my brain will connect them with something true.
g9du | D.R .: There are things on this record that are incredibly autobiographical. When I say everything was colored by the experiences of the past five years, that's very true. But it narrows and obscures it to try and talk about it specifically.
f682 | Last question: what's the hardest part of doing this job, and what's the best part?
li1k | G.W .: You know, only with the onset of the pandemic did I fully realize that I had not spent a birthday at home in probably twenty-five years. And I didn't even know that I cared. But it was interesting to live in one place again. It reminded me of when we first moved to Nashville and I was getting to know Tennessee. I got to appreciate those little transitional weeks where you actually feel the seasons start to shift. And I loved that awareness. That was obliterated by life on the road. Also, when you move so much, it's hard to actually change. The world around you is changing so much that you just roll with it. But I felt, with Dave and myself, that we actually kind of changed. And that change is present in this album. It's one of my favorite things about this record. What do I love about this job? It brings me a kinship with the world. I'm a very solitary person, and I have virtually no family.
pbea | The music, and the people that hear our music, that's probably my No. 1 anchor to the world.
ccpt | D.R .: The hardest part for me is not being able to focus on one thing. That's what being a musician has become. Forty years ago, you could drive into Laurel Canyon and be a decent songwriter, and there was an entire infrastructure in place.
0fpw | G.w .: All you had to do was play guitar and sing.
dqn8 | D.R .: But at this point, you have to wear a hundred hats, and it's very, very difficult. I don't like shifting gears. The flip side of this is that I've been able to experience all of these separate careers. All of a sudden being like, O.K., I have to stay up to write string parts, and I have to learn how to do that. What a wonderful thing to have the opportunity to do in your life. There's something really amazing about the size and complexity of the world that we've built around ourselves. But then when we go out and play shows, it's just the vehicle that we're driving, it's a couple guitars and a couple notebooks, a garment bag-
cop0 | G.W .: A suit and a dress.
lhkq | D.R .: And you stand up onstage in front of all these people and play. It's such an honor to have all of your energy focussed on this one thing that you care about so much. And to know that all the work you've done in the past-all the thinking about what the next line's going to be, or what the next story you're going to tell is, or what the next note you're gonna play is, or what you played last night that really was fun and you need to remember how to do that again because people enjoyed it so much and you enjoyed it, that you have this North Star. It's unreal.
82ju | G.w .: It's so heartening that, with everything that's going on in everybody's lives and in the world, people still feel that impulse. They still want to go and sit in a dark room and listen to people sing.
