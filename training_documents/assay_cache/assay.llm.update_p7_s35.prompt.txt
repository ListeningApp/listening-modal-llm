You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0myz | We found that Xpert was 100% sensitive for MTB detection in stool among children with microbiological confirmation from a respiratory specimen and 50% sensitive in children with microbiologically and/or clinically diagnosed TB. Other studies [8, 13, 14] conducted in Ethio- pia, Kenya and Pakistan have also reported excellent sensitivity (ranging from 88.9% to 100%)

kg3t | of stool Xpert compared to gastric aspirate culture. The lower sensitivity of stool Xpert com- pared to CRS (microbiological and/or clinically confirmed TB) is possibly due to the presence of paucibacillary disease in patients clinically diagnosed for TB.
lvae | The specificity of stool Xpert in our study when compared to culture was consistent with other previous studies conducted in Ethiopia, South Africa and Egypt which have demon- strated specificities ranging from 99.3 to 99.7% [6, 8, 15]. The specificity of stool Xpert in our study when compared to CRS was similar with another study conducted in Pakistan [14]. One culture negative gastric aspirate specimen was found to be positive on both stool and gastric aspirate Xpert tests. This may be due to the presence of non-viable bacilli during decontamina- tion process of gastric aspirate specimen.
o9sc | In this study, stool Xpert identified all of the gastric aspirate Xpert positive cases, suggesting stool as a potential alternative for use to gastric aspirate in the routine diagnosis of PTB. Gas- tric aspiration may be used to retrieve pulmonary specimen from patients who cannot expec- torate sputum but it is an invasive procedure and needs trained health workers. As a non- invasive sample, stool is considered to be safe, easy for collection and has the potential to be used for detection of MTB. Moreover, stool Xpert test is performed by simple stool testing pro- tocol adapted from KNCV TB foundation [11], which omits some labor intensive steps such as homogenization, decontamination and centrifugation of stool specimen prior to Xpert testing done by other studies [13-15]. This approach significantly reduces sample processing time, minimizes the workload on the laboratory personnel and also minimizes costs.
121u | In our study, unfortunately, none of the clinically diagnosed TB cases were detected by stool Xpert. Poor performance of stool Xpert in the clinically diagnosed (microbiologically negative) children has also been reported in other studies [15, 16]. This could potentially indi- cate the limitation of the stool Xpert since patients with such clinically-diagnosed unconfirmed TB are more likely to have paucibacillary disease. Children with a high clinical probability of TB despite a negative stool Xpert should be started on ATT until better and more sensitive tools are available.
zh03 | Older children are able to expectorate sputum and may produce more adult-type sputum. However, in our study, none of the expectorated sputum samples were positive for M. tubercu- losis. This could be due to the poor sample quality in the expectorated sputum samples.

xxr8 | However, we did not assess the quality of the sputum sample in the current study which might be taken as a limitation.
rl4j | Our study has some limitations. We used small sample size due to resource constraints. An additional limitation of our study is the fact that, we collected only single respiratory and stool specimen rather than successive specimens which could have probably increased the yield of the tests done.
vz32 | Conclusion
ncb0 | The sensitivity of stool Xpert is comparable to that of gastric aspirate Xpert. Stool is a potential alternative to pulmonary specimen in the diagnosis of PTB in patients who cannot produce sputum. Moreover, stool collection is easier and relatively safe compared to pulmonary speci- men and can be easily implemented at lowest level of health care system. However, the diag- nostic yield of stool Xpert still requires further validation and optimization using larger sample size.
