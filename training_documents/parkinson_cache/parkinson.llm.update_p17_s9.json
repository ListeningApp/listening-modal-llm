        "content": "```\n3rqe | Mechanisms for LRRK two-mediated autophagy defects are still elusive. The ability of LRRK two kinase inhibitors to reverse autophagy dysfunction suggest that kinase activity may be significant. Mutant LRRK two is also a substrate for chaperone-mediated autophagy, impairment of which could exacerbate pathological implications. Accumulation of MVBs and malformed autophagosomes were noted in LRRK two R one four four one C mutations. Intra-axonal autophagic vacuole defects in nigral dopaminergic projections were seen in mice expressing human LRRK two. It also regulates synaptic autophagy through phosphorylation of endophilin A. G two zero one nine S mutations are known to induce autophagy through MAPK/ERK kinases, and some studies suggest LRRK two-mediated autophagy regulation is largely independent of mTOR. Since RAB-mediated trafficking is crucial for autophagy, which is also affected in LRRK two mutations, it is important to evaluate if autophagy defects are the consequences of RAB dysregulation or a direct effect of LRRK two mutations.\n```",
