        "content": "ki0m | The second case is weird and interesting. It's named after Rolf Hagedorn, who in nineteen sixty-four noticed that this was a possibility in nuclear physics. He considered a model of nuclear matter where the energies E sub n approach positive infinity in a roughly logarithmic way. As you heat it, its expected energy keeps increasing, but its temperature can never exceed T sub H. This model turned out to be incorrect, but i t super gamma varsigma interesting anyway.\n6wrx | Now let's solve some puzzles on systems with a countable infinity of states. Some of these show up in quantum mechanics, but you don't need to know quantum mechanics to do these puzzles.\nu4q7 | Puzzle twenty-seven. Show that for a system with a countable infinity of states, if thermal equilibrium is possible for some negative temperature, it is impossible for positive or infinite temperatures.\njd7m | Puzzle twenty-eight. Work out the Boltzmann distribution when E sub n equals n E for some energy E, and show that it is well-defined for all temperatures\nsknv | zero is less than T is less than positive infinity. The next puzzle is a lot like the previous one a bit more messy, but worthwhile because of its great importance in physics.\nusuw | Puzzle twenty-nine. For a system called the quantum harmonic oscillator of frequency omega we have E sub n equals open parenthesis n plus one-half close parenthesis h-bar omega, where h-bar is the reduced Planck's constant. Work out the Boltzmann distribution in this case, and show it is well-defined for all temperatures\nd4hr | zero is less than T is less than positive infinity. Puzzle thirty. For a system called the primon gas we have E sub n equals E ln n for some energy E. Show that the Boltzmann distribution is well-defined for small enough positive temperatures, but there is a Hagedorn temperature. Give a formula for the Boltzmann distribution in terms of the Riemann zeta function:\nph8j | zeta open parenthesis s close parenthesis equals the sum from n equals one to infinity of n to the power negative s. You can show that for the primon gas the sum of the series from n equals one to infinity of exp open parenthesis negative E sub n divided by k T close parenthesis diverges at the Hagedorn temperature. But it can go the other way, too:\nbemf | Puzzle thirty-one. Find energies E sub n with a Hagedorn temperature such that the sum of the series from n equals one to infinity of exp open parenthesis negative E sub n divided by k T close parenthesis converges at the Hagedorn temperature.\ns9l9 | Various other strange things can happen, as you should expect when dealing with infinite series. For example, it's possible that the Boltzmann distribution is well-defined at some temperature but the expected value of the energy is infinite! But I'll resist the lure of these rabbit holes and turn to something much more important: systems with a continuum of states. We will need to get good at these to compute the entropy of hydrogen. Now our sums become integrals, and various new things happen.\nbs07 | THE FINITE VERSUS THE CONTINUOUS\ny6eq | THE FINITE\n0tl4 | THE CONTINUOUS\nvbq2 | p a probability distribution on open curly brace one, two, up to n close curly brace Gibbs entropy Gibbs entropy\npfrt | p a probability distribution on R\niws8 | S(p) equals negative k sum of i equals one to n of p sub i ln p sub i equals negative k integral of p of x ln p of x dx\nn452 | S(p) always greater than or equal to zero S(p) not always greater than or equal to zero\nztct | S(p) always finite S(p) not always finite\nenir | S(p) invariant under permutations of open curly brace one, two, up to n close curly brace\ne4d4 | S(p) not invariant under reparametrizations of R\nd8ta | You can switch from finite sums to integrals in the definition of entropy, and we'll need to do this to compute the entropy of hydrogen. But be careful: a bunch of things change!\nc9cw | We need to switch from finite sums to integrals when we switch from a finite set of states to a measure space of states. I'll illustrate the ideas with the real line, R. We define a probability distribution on R to be an integrable function p colon R arrow open square bracket zero, infinity close square bracket with\nb93o | Such a probability distribution has a Gibbs entropy given by\ntjqy | S(p) equals negative k integral of p of x ln p of x dx from negative infinity to positive infinity.\n58xg | We can also define Shannon entropy, where we leave out Boltzmann's constant k and use whatever base we want for the logarithm:\n70zf | H (p) equals negative integral of p of x log p of x dx from negative infinity to positive infinity.\nxnbe | I should warn you that many writers reserve the term 'Shannon entropy' only for a sum\nuv86 | H (p) equals negative sum of p sub i log p sub i as i varies over some index set.\ngksi | While that convention has advantages, I want to use the term 'Shannon entropy' to signal that I'm leaving out the factor of k.\noh7q | Unlike the entropy for a probability distribution on a finite set, the entropy of a probability distribution on R can be negative! This is disturbing. Earlier I said that the Shannon entropy of a probability distribution is the expected amount of information\n6gn8 | you learn when an outcome is chosen according to that distribution. How can this be negative?\nyun5 | The answer is that this interpretation of entropy, valid for probability distributions on a finite or even a countably infinite set, is not true in the continuous case! We have to adapt our intuitions.\nvdx2 | Look at an example. Let P sub epsilon be the probability distribution on R given by\n4k9e | P of x equals one divided by two epsilon if x is between negative epsilon and positive epsilon\nkeds | and P of x equals zero otherwise. For small epsilon it's a tall thin spike near zero. Let's work out its Shannon entropy: H(p) equals negative integral of p of x log p of x dx from negative infinity to positive infinity\nugy5 | equals negative integral from negative epsilon to positive epsilon of one divided by two epsilon ln one divided by two epsilon dx\nyhw8 | equals log epsilon.\no7zq | We're just integrating a constant here, so it's easy. When epsilon equals one the entropy is zero, and when epsilon becomes smaller than one the entropy becomes negative!\nhqd5 | Why? We need a distance scale to define the entropy of a probability distribution on the real line. If I measure distance in centimeters, I'll think the entropy of a probability distribution is bigger than you, who measures it in meters. And if I measure it in kilometers, I'll think the entropy is smaller-and possibly even negative.\ns1l7 | Let's see how this works. If I measure distance in different units from you, my coordinate y on the real line will not equal your coordinate x: instead we'll have y equals c times x\n12yz | for some c greater than zero. Then my probability distribution, say q, will have\n0xfx | q of y dy equals q of c x d of x equals c q of x dx so we must have\nbg91 | q of c x equals one divided by c p of x\nbsog | to make this integral equal to one. In other words, stretching out a probability distribution must also flatten it out, making it less 'tall'-and its entropy increases. Indeed:\no7e8 | Puzzle thirty-two. Show that H of q equals H of p plus ln c.\nxjy8 | Thanks to this formula choosing zero is less than c is less than one compresses a probability distribution and makes it taller, reducing its entropy. Inevitably, this can make the entropy negative if c is small enough.",
