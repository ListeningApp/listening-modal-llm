You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ccmb | In the qualitative interviews, the respondents were given the opportunity to elaborate more in-depth on the same topics, based on the questions in the interview guide in Table 2. We treat the three topics information needs, information availability and information quality in three sub-sections, with respondents' views on materiality integrated therein.
ma93 | 352
c6hh | Information needs
y7ea | The respondents differed substantially in accordance with their roles and the purposes of reading sustainability reports in those contexts. The portfolio manager differed from most of the others by desiring information about how sustainability improvements could lead to new business opportunities: "We are as interested in information about such opportunities as we are about risks and damages," he pointed out. The compliance officer took an opposite stance, in stating that "I am not looking for profitability - I am looking for traces of real sustainability."
nav4 | The financial analyst took a different view and stated: "Our perspective is somewhat more short-term - we are largely looking at the next quarter." Importantly, however, he also emphasized that this implied a stronger emphasis on dynamic materiality - information that was often not readily available in sustainability reports. Still, he pointed out that "[t]he reporting needs to be as consistent as possible over time in order to allow for comparison - even on issues that change in importance and materiality over time." The portfolio manager also pointed out the trade-off between the desire for as much relevant information as possible on the one hand and quantified and verifiable information on the other hand: "The reports should be based on good and preferably quantified, variables. But preferably less words and pictures and information that cannot be verified - that only drowns out the material information."
gem8 | The sustainability manager who worked for a large bank had the view that the information that was developed in a way that catered to investor needs was also the most interesting for other stakeholder groups. He said: "Sustainability reports should be tailored for investors - that will make them more useful for other stakeholders as well. The target audience for such reports is often unclear and developing them in a way that is more concentrated around pure facts and figures will most likely make them useful for the largest number of stakeholders." The public funding manager somewhat echoed this by stating that

82ju | "[t]he information needs of users are converging - they are becoming more and more similar and that is a good thing. When the banks and the government agencies start adopting the same perspectives and the same language that helps in making better and more consistent decisions."
y2qo | Information availability
1piq | The respondents largely echoed the same viewpoints that were captured in the survey questions about information availability. In particular, they found it difficult to distinguish between sustainability performance information that was financially material and information that was more broadly important for other stakeholder groups or for making inferences about real sustainability impacts. The financial officer argued that "there seems to be good intentions in the reporting, but it is hard to discern information that can be verified and that allows for comparisons - over time and between companies." The portfolio manager emphasized how the reports alone were usually not sufficient to provide the full information required for his purposes: "Many of the things we are looking for do not necessarily appear in the reports - for instance information about emerging topics. If the information is contested or appears risky to disclose, we often need to be in dialogue with the companies to get hold of the information we need."
7fqw | The compliance officer emphasized that the information tended to "flow together and become muddled" and that information that should have been readily available was often presented "in unexpected form in unexpected places" in the reports. She also lamented that there seemed to be differences between companies' reporting that could be a consequence of differences in their information provision: "The companies are very different in what sustainability efforts they choose to carry out and they similarly seem to report differently in a manner that reflects those activities, their priorities and which issues they can provide information about."
rhaz | Finally, several of the respondents pointed out that they believed that sustainability reports were becoming increasingly overflowed with information. The sustainability manager argued that there was too much "prose" and "wordiness" on issues of varying materiality, while there was often lacking information about issues one would consider financially material. The financial analyst argued that there was a large variation in how available and clearly communicated the different information was. He believed that there was still a lack of high-quality quantitative information but pointed out that "financial analysts always want more numbers."
wak1 | Information quality
wtfz | The financial officer pointed out that the narrative style dominated sustainability reports and made a distinction between goals, efforts and results: "Different users might differ in their interests of whether they want to know more about the efforts in themselves or simply about results. The information quality is often better and more concrete for the latter, but many users really want to know about what the company has actually done and how its efforts actually produced the results they report." The public funding manager argued that environmental performance information was generally of higher quality than social performance information. She moreover added: "There is concrete information - tons of CO2, OK. Percentage of women on the board, OK. But the overall picture, actually getting a grasp of the ESG characteristics of the company - then, the report itself comes short."
qy1i | The financial analyst pointed at comparability as a key problem, which echoes the results from the survey. He added: "Take oil companies as an example: They seem to arbitrarily select years as point of comparison in order to make improvements appear larger.
1k9e | Sustainability reporting and materiality
5bjs | 353
uodj | SAMPJ 13,2
k16v | 354
b2lm | This renders comparisons hard to interpret." The compliance officer believed that the disclosed information is generally of high relevance, but pointed out that "many companies seem selective in their information disclosure and seem to write more about themes where they have performed well and less about areas in which they have done less, but that are still important." Several of the respondents, including the portfolio manager, the financial analyst and the sustainability manager, argued that comparability was a key weakness - both within and between firms. The sustainability manager elaborated: "Comparison with peers is difficult - even for companies that are quite similar. The problem is exacerbated when companies merge, spin out sub-units and so on, at which point the basis for comparison changes." However, the portfolio manager pointed out a maturing of companies in their disclosure practices: "We're seeing a run of new firms becoming listed on the stock exchange and their ESG disclosures are often insufficient in the early stages. But as they become more experienced, the quality of information in disclosures normally improves."
ti7f | Discussion
oksu | The results of our survey and qualitative interviews shed light on the tensions between the two approaches to materiality and the implications for users of information in sustainability reports. While the different financial market stakeholders included in our sample had somewhat different information needs, they were in relative consensus about the challenges and shortcomings of discerning between various forms of material information in sustainability reports. Our findings thus contribute further to the understanding of how the materiality of sustainability information may lie "in the eye of the beholder" (Reimsbach et al., 2020), or at least be assessed and consumed very differently by different users of information.
wtow | Tensions in the uses of the materiality concept
o22k | The results of our survey showed that the different users of information in our sample - all of whom have roles related to financial markets - desired information about various types of material information (i.e. both in GRI and SASB approaches to the concept). However, they similarly expressed a belief that it is challenging to discern between sustainability issues that are financially material and those that are (only) material in a GRI sense. As shown in the survey, the respondents in our study judged sustainability reports to provide relevant information, but lacking in comparability, timeliness and verifiability.
nwfz | In follow-up interviews with selected users of information from the survey sample, we dug deeper into the tensions experienced by these users of information and their practical implications. As outlined in the results section above, the respondents generally found it difficult to discern between:
nvfy | · financially material sustainability information;
mror | · information of broader importance for other stakeholders; and
zlxc | · information useful for making inferences about real sustainability impacts.
k0bw | This perceived difficulty echoed the tension between assessing sustainability tensions "not only assessed relative to when but also according to whom" (Haffar and Searcy, 2017). Our respondents pointed out that the increased standardization of sustainability reports favored some user groups (in particular financial market professionals) over other groups. Nonetheless, they argued that the information is still presented in a manner that was too muddled for real discernment between different types of material information that respond to the various information needs of these user groups.
aq5a | The respondents judged materiality to be a crucial dimension of their information needs and emphasized the need for both disclosure on financially material issues and issues that are material in a GRI sense. Hence, they expressed a preference for disclosure in line with double materiality, which directly addresses the problem of clearly delineating financially material from non-financially material sustainability issues. This problem is even more comprehensive when taking into account, as pointed out by the European Lab Project Task Force on preparatory work for the elaboration of possible EU non-financial reporting standards (PTF-NFRS), that "the financial materiality of a sustainability matter is not constrained to matters that are within the control of the reporting entity" (European Financial Reporting Advisory Group, 2021, p. 7). That is, the financial materiality part of double materiality goes beyond sustainability issues that are under the control of the reporting entity itself, i.e. within the boundary of financial reporting.
sc5y | In its Guidelines on reporting climate-related information, the EU (2019, pp. 6-7) outlines a double materiality perspective in the context of reporting climate-related information (Gibassier, 2019). Here, there is a clear argument for reporting both issues that are financially material "to the extent necessary for an understanding of the company's development, performance and position" and those that are socially and environmentally material in order to account for the "impact of its activities." Perhaps the movement towards explicitly reporting on material issues in a double materiality perspective can lead to more clarity that benefits users of such information. Importantly, as pointed out by Global Reporting Initiative and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (2021, p. 5) in the document "A Practical Guide to Sustainability Reporting Using GRI and SASB Standards":
0yab | SASB's industry-specific standards identify the sustainability-related risks and opportunities most likely to affect a company's financial condition (i.e. its balance sheet), operating performance (i.e. its income statement), or risk profile (i.e. cost of capital) [6]. All of these factors impact a company's current and future market valuation. The GRI Standards focus on the economic, environmental and social impacts of the activities of a company and hence its contributions - positive or negative - towards sustainable development. It is the underlying assumption that if not already financially material at the time of reporting, these impacts may become financially material over time.
w95z | Thus, in their recent collaborative efforts, GRI and SASB have emphasized how double materiality is important both to discern between these two types of materiality. Furthermore, as indicated in the last sentence of the quote above, the two institutions also suggest that such disclosure may be important to account for dynamic materiality.
0i1k | Our respondents expressed a desire for more dynamic materiality information but at the same time expressed concern that such information was difficult to produce as well as to verify. Thus, the respondents implicitly addressed another widespread tension in the field of sustainability - namely, the time dimension, which in turn influences the scope of disclosures. In this regard, as pointed out by the respondents, there is a tension between demands for:
dqlg | · high-quality information that is verifiable, which may often be the case for well- established indicators such as CO2 emissions or energy consumption; and
p6pq | · timely information on emerging topics that may become financially material, which may often have less standardized and well-developed measures and indicators.
zse6 | Therefore, the introduction of dynamic materiality may necessitate a tolerance for less standardized and less comparable information, at least in the period when new reporting themes emerge.
p2n3 | Sustainability reporting and materiality
ohh7 | 355
vbni | SAMPJ 13,2
dgcw | 356
gvwz | Taken together, then, tensions of several varieties are perceived and pointed out by the respondents of our study. First, there are tensions arising from different information needs and appetites of different user groups - specifically, between financial market professionals (investors, portfolio managers, financial analysts, etc.) on the one hand and stakeholders more oriented towards real sustainability impacts on the other hand. Thus, in addition to being tied to the practical nature of these groups' different decision-making purposes, this type of tension may also relate to a deeper-lying ideological tension. The dividing line then goes between those that believe that sustainability reporting should first and foremost be a tool for better informing decision-makers in financial markets about the financial implications of sustainability issues and those that believe that sustainability reporting should serve to increase the transparency of sustainability impacts in a manner that can drive real sustainability improvements.
