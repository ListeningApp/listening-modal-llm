You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

ywwr | Some MI countries have isolated cases of sectoral success where nar- rower business coalitions pushed the creation of complex, enduring upgrading institutions. Standout cases include wine and software in Argentina, ethanol and airplanes in Brazil, aquaculture in Chile, and rubber-based manufactured goods and electronics in Malaysia.90 Core factors contributing to the successes across these cases were brisk inter- national competition, perceptions of crisis, and effective state promo- tion (especially in Brazil and Malaysia), all of which fostered strong, concerted business engagement in upgrading sectoral institutions, es- pecially related to training and innovation. MNCs in these sectors were mostly conspicuous by their absence (other than Malaysian electron- ics and Argentine software). Overall, this rare combination of factors helps to explain why these are more the exceptional sectors that prove the general rule of social fragmentation and the absence of upgrading coalitions.
0i6j | Turning to cross-national heterogeneity, comparisons between Ma- laysia and Thailand offer another window into the pivotal role of coali- tions. Among our nine large MI countries, Malaysia has the highest GDP per capita while Thailand's is below average for the group. In societal terms, Malaysian labor is less fragmented, with roughly 80 percent of
87cq | MIDDLE-INCOME TRAP
0qs3 | the labor force in formal occupations in contrast to only 42 percent in Thailand;91 inequality generally trends lower in Malaysia.92 These dif- ferences correspond to contrasting coalitions and associated institutions found in the two countries. Sustained growth in Malaysia occurred under a broad, elite-led coalition, known as the National Front (Barisan Nasi- onal, or BN), consisting of ethnic Malays (60 percent of the population), ethnic Chinese (30 percent), and ethnic Indians (roughly 10 percent). The BN's most powerful component is the cross-class, highly institu- tionalized United Malays National Organization (UMNO), though the BN also comprises key ethnic Chinese and Indian parties, each of which includes both business and labor.93
z8f7 | Although UMNO imposed some discriminatory policies against the economically powerful ethnic Chinese, it largely practiced a "hegemonic pragmatism."94 The focus was on reducing income differences across ethnic groups through a combination of gradual affirmative action and structural changes via agricultural reform and industrial promotion. After the turmoil of the late 1960s, fears of social unrest ("internal implosion") further promoted elite cohesion and more effective devel- opment policy.95 This led to a "dual bureaucratic structure" in which UMNO promoted and monitored institutions, especially rural develop- ment bureaucracies implementing long-term reforms at the local level, but also in key sectors such as rubber.96 By contrast, fragmented inter- est groups and poorly institutionalized parties in Thailand, in part the result of higher levels of inequality and informality, have contributed to "a policy environment where needed public goods, reforms and invest- ments were chronically undersupplied."97 In short, upgrading coalitions helped nudge Malaysia close to the HI threshold but were weaker in Thailand and other large MI countries.
7w7j | Another potentially illuminating set of comparisons is between cur- rent large MI countries and countries that became HI in the late twenti- eth century. Most recent, second-wave graduates to HI status had special circumstances that helped them elude the MI trap by overcoming the
51vd | political obstacles discussed in Section III and by facilitating collective action and coalition building. The thirteen countries that escaped MI in the 1980s and 1990s comprised three distinct groupings:98 East Asian countries with developmental states (Japan, Korea, Taiwan), late en- trants into the European Union (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain), and very small countries with populations under eight million (Equato- rial Guinea, Hong Kong, Israel, Mauritius, Puerto Rico, and Singapore). Security threats in the East Asia cases, as well as in Israel-combined with contentious politics from below and a dearth of exportable natural resources-greatly facilitated elite cohesion and coalition building.99 EU accession similarly helped forge consensus, especially among elites, and the economic benefits and direct transfers within the EU were also sub- stantial.100 For Southern European entrants, accession in the 1980s was associated with huge jumps in education spending.101
baj1 | In addition, small size can facilitate elite unity, though it does not guarantee it. Collective action is generally easier to achieve in countries with a few million inhabitants-with their correspondingly smaller and more geographically concentrated elites-than in countries with tens or hundreds of millions. For the small countries of Northern Europe, Peter Katzenstein emphasizes how smallness and a resulting sense of vulnerability fostered an ideology of social partnership, better organized social groups, and closer personal ties (as political and economic elites from different spheres all knew one another).102 In smaller countries, rifts within business are less common, either because foreign business is absent, as in Finland, or because MNCs are dominant and well incor- porated into a national coalition that promotes upgrading, as in Ireland and Singapore. 103
n1wo | Some of these special circumstances may also help to explain China's rapid growth into-and possible early shift out of-middle income. True, inequality increased dramatically (.47 Gini coefficient), raising debates about possible "Latin Americanization." Yet on other dimen- sions, China shows that it is already advancing out of MI status with lower informality (a shadow economy of 12 percent), extremely high investment (49 percent), low FDI (10 percent), high R and D spending
5bq3 | (2 percent, not far below the OECD average), and educational institu- tions producing large numbers of engineers and technicians, includ- ing 21 percent of secondary students enrolled in technical education.104 This potential for moving quickly through MI status reflects China's resemblance to earlier Asian developmental states by virtue of a clear connection for political elites between development and the capacity to address geopolitical challenges,105 a connection missing in other MI countries, and by virtue of the stability of its authoritarian regime.
