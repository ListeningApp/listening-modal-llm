Ernst Jünger, a literary hero not just on the outer reaches of the right, could elevate and beautify the violence of total war as the image of the coming 'modern', and 'hard' society - one dependent upon manliness and ruthlessness. The imagery of the war in the east, ingrained in military minds, of 'deepest Russia, without a glimmer of Central European Kultur, Asia, steppe, swamps, claustrophobic underworld, and a godforsaken wasteland of slime', as one contemporary description had it, fed meanwhile into the stereotypes that would promote the barbarisation of nineteen forty-one and after. Such views were reinforced by the images brought home by the Freikorps units which continued the most bitter fighting after the end of the First World War, in Poland and then in the Baltic on the side of the Whites during the Russian civil war. Back home, many Freikorps members slotted seamlessly into the paramilitary scene of the postwar years, including the infant Nazi movement, and were responsible for at least three hundred fifty-four political murders between nineteen nineteen and nineteen twenty-two - practically all of them leniently dealt with (in contrast to the smaller number of political crimes committed by the left) by a judiciary prepared to tolerate right-wing violence as long as it was targeting left-wing opponents. The same sentiments were apparent in the acceptance by good law-abiding Bürger and pillars of their society of the mounting violence that accompanied the Nazi rise to power after nineteen thirty, and particularly in the summer and autumn of nineteen thirty-two. The scene was set for the widespread welcome given to the Nazi assault on the left in nineteen thirty-three, the establishment of concentration camps, attacks on minorities (particularly Jews) and the undermining of legal constraints on state power. When, the following summer, Hitler openly admitted responsibility for the murder of some of the leaders of his own movement, accusing them of treason, corruption and homosexual practices, he could register widespread approval and a surge in his personal popularity.\nli1k | Meanwhile, a number of Germans too young to have fought in the war, most with a university education, a good number of them with doctorates - who fervently believed in the cold, rational use of violence to purge Germany of its perceived 'unhealthy', racial impurities - were beginning to establish their careers in the security police and the SS. They would later become not just the planners of the Nazi 'new order' in eastern Europe, with a target of eliminating thirty-one million mainly Slavs over the next twenty-five years, but the leaders of the extermination squads that launched the 'Final Solution'. It was the culmination of a lengthy process in the escalation of political violence, whose starting-point was the First World War.\npbea | War and Political Violence in Twentieth-Century Europe\nccpt | The impact of that war on existing political culture seems to have been the decisive factor. Indelible though the experience, memory and imagery of the First World War were, not all countries that went through the war turned into politically violent societies. Great Britain (apart from Ireland) and, though their participation in the war was relatively short, the United States, would be two obvious examples. It seems possible, in fact, turning to my second question, to conceive of a spectrum of violence in which the impact of the First World War is placed alongside elements of existing political culture shaping the relative propensity to violence or non-violence in the succeeding decades.\n0fpw | A relatively low level of political violence appears to relate in some way or other to the following: established democratic structures, values and mentalities; being on the winning side in the First World War (or neutrality in that war); muted ideological conflict and a corresponding absence of revolutionary or counter-revolutionary circumstances; lack of disputed territorial claims; satisfied (or non-existent) imperialist ambitions; and, finally, a sense of national identity drawn from constitutional statehood rather than ethnicity and culture. Even if these features were not equally weighted, they seem to apply to the United Kingdom (with the partial exception of Ireland), the Netherlands, Belgium (for the most part), France (with qualifications), Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland - all countries (apart from Switzerland) on the north-western periphery of Europe.\ndqn8 | Exactly the opposite characteristics apply to an array of countries where political violence was highly pronounced in the inter-war period. Here we see in general terms the absence of solidly established pluralist-democratic structures, values and mentalities; defeat in the First World War and a resultant profound sense of national humiliation; major ideological cleavages and the corresponding existence of revolutionary and counter-revolutionary conditions; territorial losses, disputed territorial claims, and unfulfilled imperialist ambitions; also an ethnocultural basis of nationality, frequently going hand in hand with a culturally rooted mentality of ethnic superiority and an aggressive, integral-organic ideology of nationalism which gained definition by exclusion of ethnic minorities, often sharing the same territory. To a greater or lesser extent such features related to much of central, eastern and south-eastern Europe, to Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia (in part), Poland, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia and Russia (where the vicious ethnic conflict of the civil war period was then overlain with the ideological struggle to extirpate class enemies).\ncop0 | A number of the features, though not the heavy weighting attached to ethnicity, also applied to the Mediterranean region, to Italy (despite its nominal inclusion in the victorious powers in nineteen eighteen), and Spain (with the notable exception of its non-participation in the war). In these countries, too, the weakness of the state and its contested legitimacy opened the door to deep ideological conflict, the politicisation of violence (leading in the case of Spain to bitter and brutal civil war) and, eventually, to the imposition of right-wing authoritarianism and repression. In Italy, the resentment on the nationalist right over frustrated territorial ambitions, together with utopian hopes on the left, soon dashed, of a brave new socialist world, exposed the impotence of the liberal state and created the political space for Fascism to triumph in a\nlhkq | climate shaped by political violence. In Spain, despite that country's neutrality, the First World War sharply intensified political violence as existing class tensions and social conflict were heightened in the wake of major economic upheaval, fatally undermining the legitimacy of the liberal-monarchical state and eventually ushering in authoritarian rule. A preview of the battle lines in the Spanish Civil War can be seen in the ideological, political and social fissures opened up during the period of the First World War, even without Spain joining the belligerent powers. Portugal is something of an oddity. It did not suffer defeat, since it had joined the war on the Allied side in nineteen sixteen, was fairly homogeneous, had no ethnic minorities or frontier revanchist tendencies, and had experienced no colonial amputation. Nonetheless, its parliamentary system was weak and struggled for legitimacy in an underdeveloped country where authoritarianism had strong roots. The First World War brought internal political crisis, strengthened support for integral nationalism with fascist colouring, deepened ideological divisions and saw an increase in political violence (though of mild proportions compared with many other countries). Political as well as economic backwardness hindered the establishment of parliamentary democracy, but also posed a barrier to the worst excesses of authoritarian violence. Lack of wide political mobilisation was the main reason why repressive, though relatively non-violent, conservative authoritarianism eventually prevailed without outright fascism getting a toe-hold on power.\n```",
