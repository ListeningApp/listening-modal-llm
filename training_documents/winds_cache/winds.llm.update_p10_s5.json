Individuals between ten point zero and twelve point nine centimeters made up thirty-four point six percent of the population and those less than six point zero centimeters made up seventeen point zero percent. Diameter of jellyfish collected from Cable Beach on fifth October ranged from four point three to twenty-one point five centimeters in diameter with a peak in abundance at ten point zero to ten point nine centimeters. This sample had fewer small jellyfish (seven point five percent less than six point zero centimeters), but there was no significant difference in mean size of medusa collected on nineteenth September and fifth October between the two samples (nine point nine centimeters standard deviation equals three point five and ten point one centimeters standard deviation equals three point zero respectively), Mann-Whitney U test, U equals fourteen thousand zero seventy-six, P equals zero point four four two. Despite having equal variances F test: F equals one point two nine eight, P equals zero point zero eight seven, the samples were non-normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test, W equals zero point nine seven nine, P equals zero point zero one five and W equals zero point nine eight three, P equals zero point zero two five respectively) and could not be satisfactorily transformed, so the non-parametric test was applied instead of a t test. Biomass of C mastigophora collected offshore of Gantheaume Point increased exponentially with diameter, as estimated from the equation W equals zero point two six six five times D raised to the power of two point eight nine four three where W is whole wet weight in grammes and D is bell diameter in centimeters. The linear regression of log ten W against D was highly significant with R squared equals zero point eight four four, P less than zero point zero zero zero one. In the population, sampled\ndgcw | Descriptive measures of goodness of fit are provided for each variable by log likelihood, McFadden's rho squared, Cox and Snell R squared, Nagelkerke R squared and receiver operating characteristic analysis. Models with combined variables were evaluated using Aikaike's information criterion and Bayesian information criterion. The best parameter or model determined by each statistic is underlined and those that were significant are bolded\ngvwz | individuals greater than or equal to thirteen centimeters made up forty-six point six percent of the biomass but only seventeen point six percent of the abundance. The mean water content of the jellyfish after drying was ninety-five point eight percent standard error equals one point two five, n equals twenty-one, and after ashing, the mean percentage of dry weight that was found to be organic matter was thirty-four point zero percent standard error equals one point two six, n equals ten. The mean organic carbon and total nitrogen content of the dried tissue were seven point five percent standard error equals zero point four, n equals twenty-one and two point zero percent standard error equals zero point one, n equals twenty-one, respectively. The tissue of the jellyfish had carbon (partial thirteen C) and nitrogen (delta fifteen N) isotopic signatures of negative twenty point seventy-nine standard error equals zero point zero six, n equals twenty-one and eight point fourteen fifteen N standard error equals zero point zero eight, n equals twenty-one, respectively. Mean C to N ratio was three point nine\nsk5m | plus minus zero point zero two standard error, n equals twenty-one. Abundance and biomass of C mastigophora stranded on Cable Beach\n```",
