You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

6d4s | Nonetheless, Haier has largely been unable to diffuse Rendanheyi across its global subsidiaries. In the United States, for example, larger micro-divisions called "platforms" have been created instead of xiaowei, and-in contrast to xiaowei in China-every employee was part of several platforms, and remuneration was not entirely based on platform performance. In Russia, the top management team formed a xiaowei along the Chinese xiaowei lines; however, rank-and-file employ- ees continued to work in a hierarchical organization without forming ZZJYTs or xiaowei. Low adoption levels outside China raise important questions about the applicability of Rendanheyi in different national contexts, which underlines the importance of understanding how context matters for management innovations.
mqah | How Context Mattered to Haier's Rendanheyi
xxr8 | In our research, we used the six categories mentioned earlier, that is, three categories in the environmental context and three categories in the organi- zational context.
rl4j | Environmental Context
vz32 | The three categories of environmental context are the competitive, tech- nological, and institutional environments-all of which are characterized by increasing VUCA forces that have affected the development of Rendanheyi.
ncb0 | Competitive. Haier has been operating in a VUCA environment for more than a decade. The competitive environment for Haier has become more uncer- tain since the early 2000s. Foreign rivals such as Panasonic, Sanyo, Whirlpool, Bosch-Siemens, and Electrolux already entered the Chinese market in the 1980s and 1990s. But it was in the early 2000s that Chinese white goods manufactur- ers came under considerable competitive pressure from foreign competitors in the Chinese market. In December 2001, China formally joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) and opened the white goods sector to competition. The previous sales quotas on white goods were scrapped, and foreign manufacturers were allowed to also engage in distribution and service activities in the Chinese market. The most important foreign home appliance brands (with the notable exception of GE) started manufacturing and R&D activities in China. Whirl- pool (which previously withdrew from China) re-entered the Chinese market in 2002 through strategic partnerships with local firms Gome and Suning, while other foreign rivals also expanded their presence in China.
8mp0 | With increased volatility from domestic competition, Chinese white goods firms experienced production overcapacity for the first time as the market share of foreign firms in refrigerators quickly went up from 26% to 31%, and in washing machines from 31% to 38%, within a year. A fierce price war broke out. Domestic competition from foreign rivals and lower margins pushed Haier to expand glob- ally to counter foreign rivals on their home turf in the United States and Europe. In anticipation of China's WTO membership, Haier opened manufacturing and R&D centers in Italy and Germany (2001) and established a U.S. factory (2002).
xjyk | As Haier became a truly global company with presence in more than 100 countries, it faced a more complex environment consisting of many different mar- kets, all with unique market characteristics and consumer preferences. It also faced further uncertainty due to slower demand and greater competition amid the global recession and a sharp decline in China's property market. Haier's senior management believed that its workers were not productive enough compared with global competitors.
mt0f | The development of Rendanheyi 2.0 coincided with slower growth rates in China's economy, which declined in each consecutive year from 10.6% in 2010 to 6.9% in 2015, while total investment in China's economy declined from 47.9% of GDP in 2010 to 44.7% in 2015.23 As an additional burden, the value of the Chinese currency has steadily appreciated, from 8.2765 yuan per U.S. dollar to 6.1248 yuan per U.S. dollar between the start of 2005 and the start of 2015.
awab | There were also signs that the white goods sector would become more consolidated. In 2005, Whirlpool acquired Maytag, once considered one of the most admired premium brands. China's entry into the WTO and greater global
ixcc | Management Innovation Made in China: Haier's Rendanheyi
8p6h | competitive uncertainty persuaded Zhang that Haier needed to reinvent itself and become a user-oriented organization. Today, we know that fears about global con- solidation were justified as a merger wave has swept through the white goods industry. In 2016, Whirlpool purchased Indesit, Midea bought Toshiba's white goods business, Arçelik took over Dawlance, Bosch bought out its partner Siemens, and, in 2017, Haier completed a US$5.6 billion takeover of GE's white goods busi- ness. Competitive pressures were, therefore, also a driver for Haier to start intro- ducing Rendanheyi.
pmgl | Technological. The white goods sector was traditionally a slow-moving, mature industry. But there was increasing ambiguity about the directions for future con- sumer demand, amid booming e-commerce, demand for niche products, and a shift toward a customized user experience. Zhang was an early web enthusiast. When he conceived his early ideas on Rendanheyi around 2005, he assumed that the Internet would change the relationship between companies and cus- tomers. Zhang recognized that the Internet brought about (in his own words) "zero-distance access to information," meaning customers can get information more quickly than companies. In his view, this required a shift from mass pro- duction to mass customization. When the ZZJYT model was introduced around 2010, Zhang developed a vision of complementary physical and virtual networks and envisaged that Haier's online platforms should be used as vehicles for close collaboration with users to develop new products and to provide a customized user experience.
90no | Zhang was influenced by authors such as Don Tapscott and Jeremy Rifkin, who painted a picture of communications-driven technological revolutions in the business world.24 He invited many such authors to visit Haier in the Qingdao headquarters. When the "Maker Movement" (related to digital fabrication) sur- faced, Zhang invited the editor-in-chief of Wired Magazine Chris Anderson in for talks and workshops, identifying everyone as a "maker" on their business cards and job descriptions. Zhang became convinced that technology would fundamen- tally alter the basis of competition in future, moving from competition between close-ended hierarchical companies toward competition between open online platforms that can link companies with users and external partners to jointly cre- ate value. One of Zhang's favorite quotes is "the world is your R&D department," which suggests that R&D resources can be acquired through collaboration with users, through collaboration with external partners, or through purchases from third parties. He made a distinction between a traditional "customer" for a one- time money transaction, and a "user" for continuous interaction and participa- tion. Zhang wanted to create a community of users.
jt0y | Zhang also observed technological advancements made by other compa- nies. He was particularly impressed by Apple's iPad, which became "magical" once app designers were invited in to populate the iPad boxes with their ideas, and once Apple's customers could personalize their iPads with the variety of apps becoming available, in the process transforming each iPad into a truly unique device. Zhang argued that the iPad was a "platform" for expressing and realizing
qb7o | the dreams of other ecosystem players-app designers and users-and that Haier could similarly be transformed into a platform for the dreams of others, and, in the process, would become faster, more open, and without boundaries.
