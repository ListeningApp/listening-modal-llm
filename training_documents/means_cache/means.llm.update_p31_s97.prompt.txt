You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

a63r | Output 13.10 shows the result of the contrast analysis specified in Figure 13.6 and compares level 2 (15 minutes) against level 1 (control) as a first comparison, and level 3 (30 minutes) against level 1 (control) as a second comparison. The group differences are displayed: a difference value, standard error, significance value and 95% confidence interval. These results show that both the 15-minute group (contrast 1, <LATEX>\left. p = 0 . 0 4 5 \right)</LATEX> and 30-minute group (contrast 2, <LATEX>\left. p = 0 . 0 1 0 \right)</LATEX> had significantly different happiness compared to the control group (note that contrast 2 is identical to the parameter for Dose=1 in the previous section). Output 13.11 shows the results of the Sidak corrected post hoc comparisons that were requested in Section 13.5.6. The bottom table shows the bootstrapped significance and confidence intervals for these tests and because these will be robust we'll interpret this table (again, remember your values will differ because of how bootstrapping works). There is a significant difference between the control group and both the 15- <LATEX>\left( p = 0 . 0 0 3 \right)</LATEX> and 30-minute <LATEX>\left( p = 0 . 0 2 1 \right)</LATEX> groups.

r17u | 13.6.4 Interpreting the covariate
3c47 | I've already mentioned that the parameter estimates (Output 13.8) tell us how to interpret the covariate: the sign of the b-value tells us the direction of the relationship between the covariate and outcome variable. For these data the b- value was positive, indicating that as the love of puppies increases, so does the participant's happiness. Another way to discover the same thing is to draw a scatterplot of the covariate against the outcome.
g345 | Anxious people tend to interpret ambiguous information in a negative way. For example, being highly anxious myself, if I overheard a student saying 'Andy Field's lectures are really different,' I would assume that 'different' meant rubbish, but it could also mean 'refreshing' or 'innovative'. Muris, Huijding, Mayer, and Hameetman (2008) addressed how these interpretational biases develop in children. Children imagined that they were astronauts who had discovered a new planet. They were given scenarios about their time on the planet (e.g., 'On the street, you encounter a spaceman. He has a toy handgun and he fires at you ... ') and the child had to decide whether a positive ('You laugh: it is a water pistol and the weather is fine anyway') or negative ('Oops, this hurts! The pistol produces a red beam which burns your skin!') outcome occurred. After each response the child was told whether their choice was correct. Half of the children were always told that the negative interpretation was correct, and the reminder were told that the positive interpretation was correct.
svhz | Over 30 scenarios children were trained to interpret their experiences on the planet as negative or positive. Muris et al. then measured interpretational biases in everyday life to see whether the training had created a bias to interpret things negatively. In doing so, they could ascertain whether children might learn interpretational biases through feedback (e.g., from parents).
oaen | The data from this study are in the file Muris et al (2008).sav. The independent variable is Training (positive or negative) and the outcome is the child's interpretational bias score
5u67 | (Interpretational_Bias) - a high score reflects a tendency to interpret situations negatively. It is important to adjust for the Age
dvms | and Gender of the child and also their natural anxiety level (which they measured with a standard questionnaire of child anxiety called the SCARED) because these things affect interpretational biases also. Labcoat Leni wants you to fit a model to see whether Training significantly affected children's Interpretational_Bias using Age, Gender and SCARED as covariates. What can you conclude? Answers are on the companion website (or look at pages 475-476 in the original article).
qrd3 | 13.7 Testing the assumption of homogeneity of
rxrg | regression slopes
tf43 | Remember that the assumption of homogeneity of regression slopes means that the relationship between the covariate and outcome variable (in this case Puppy_love and Happiness) should be similar at different levels of the predictor variable (in this case in the three Dose groups). Figure 13.3 shows that the relationship between Puppy_love and Happiness looks comparable in the 15-minute and control groups, but seems different in the 30-minute group. To test the assumption of homogeneity of regression slopes we need to refit the model but customize it to include the interaction between the covariate and categorical predictor. Access the main dialog box as before and place the variables in the same boxes as before (the finished dialog box should look like
fcco | Figure 13.5). To customize the model, click Model ... to access the dialog box in Figure 13.9 and select Custom. The variables specified in the main dialog box are listed on the left-hand side. We need a model that includes the interaction between the covariate and grouping variable. To test this interaction term it's important to also include the main effects otherwise variance in the outcome (happiness) may be attributed to the interaction term that would otherwise be attributed to the main effects. To begin with, then, select Dose and
8uji | Puppy_love (you can select both simultaneously by holding down Ctrl, or Cmd on a Mac), change the drop-down menu to Main effects , and click
df3e | to transfer the main effects of Dose and Puppy_love to the box labelled Model. Next specify the interaction term by selecting Dose and
53eu | Puppy_love simultaneously (as just described), change the drop-down menu to
a5u1 | Interaction and click to transfer the interaction of Dose and Puppy_love to the box labelled Model. The finished dialog box should look like
ry7u | Continue
5mda | Figure 13.9. Click
i4li | to return to the main dialog box and
r8sm | OK
cuin | to run the analysis.
n1i7 | Output 13.11 shows the main summary table for the model including the interaction term. The effects of the dose of puppy therapy and love of puppies are still significant, but so is the covariate by outcome interaction (Dose x
0r5m | Puppy_love), implying that the assumption of homogeneity of regression slopes is not realistic (p = 0.028). Although this finding is not surprising given the pattern of relationships shown in Figure 13.3, it raises concerns about the main analysis.

sqxn | · When the linear model is used to compare several means adjusted for the effect of one or more other variables (called covariates) it can be referred to as analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).
6pmo | · Before the analysis check that the covariate(s) are independent
195r | of any independent variables by seeing whether those independent variables predict the covariate (i.e., the covariate should not differ across groups).
