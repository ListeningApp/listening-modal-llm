You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

nhsg | THE MAN WHO WILL DO ANYTHING FOR TRUMP
hy0l | Why Kash Patel is exactly the kind of person who would serve in a second Trump administration
4jmz | K ASH PATEL WAS dangerous. On this both Trump appointees and career officials could agree.
b7cq | A 40-year-old lawyer with little government experience, he joined the administration in 2019 and rose rapidly. Each new title set off new alarms.
0b39 | When Patel was installed as chief of staff to the acting secretary of defense just after the 2020 election, Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, advised him not to break the law in order to keep President Donald Trump in power. "Life looks really shitty from behind bars," Milley reportedly told Patel. (Patel denies this.)
qecd | When Trump entertained naming Patel deputy director of the FBI, Attorney General Bill Barr confronted the White House chief of staff and said, "Over my dead body."
1o7p | When, in the final weeks of the administration, Trump planned to name Patel deputy director of the CIA, Gina Haspel, the agency's head, threatened to resign. Trump
cp13 | Who was this man, and why did so many top officials fear him?
bgre | It wasn't a question of ideology. He wasn't a zealot like Stephen Miller, trying to make the bureaucracy yield to his agenda. Rather, Patel appeared singularly focused on pleasing Trump. Even in an administration full of loyalists, Patel was exceptional in his devotion.
57lp | This was what seemed to disturb many of his colleagues the most: Patel was dangerous, several of them told me, not because of a certain plan he would be poised to carry out if given control of the CIA or FBI, but because he appeared to have no plan at all-his priorities today always subject to a mercurial president's wishes tomorrow. (Patel disputes this characterization.)
ukth | What wouldn't a person like that do, if asked?
kpvt | Most Americans had no idea Patel existed, yet rarely a day passed when administration leaders weren't reminded that he did. In a year and eight months, they had watched Patel leapfrog from the National Security Council, where he became senior counterterrorism director; to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, where he was principal deputy to the acting director; to the Department of Defense, where his influence rivaled that of the acting secretary himself.
jie2 | But in the officials' warnings about the various catastrophic ways the rise of an inexperienced lackey to the highest levels of government might end, all Patel seemed to detect was the panic of a "deep state" about to be exposed. Such officials understood, as Patel later wrote, that he "wouldn't sit quietly and accept their actions to stonewall direct orders from the president."
d0ik | Patel was ultimately denied a role at the pinnacle of the national-security establishment, but Trump has promised to learn from his mistakes. Should he return to the White House, there will be no Milleys, Haspels, or even Barrs to restrain him as he seeks revenge against his political enemies. Instead, there will be Patels-those whose true faith and allegiance belong not to a nation, but to one man.
0x0s | Kash Patel Will Do Anything for Trump - The Atlantic "Get ready, Kash," Trump said before a gala of young Republicans this past December. "Get ready."
4exe | A CURSORY APPRAISAL of Patel's activities since the Trump administration might suggest that his days as a senior official in the United States government are behind him-that Patel, like countless others on the right, has learned the art of commodifying his association with the former president.
0myz | There is, for example, merch: "the official K$h wine!" ($233.99 for six bottles) and the Fight With Kash Punisher Intarsia Reversible Scarf ($25), which Patel wore for his remarks at this year's Conservative Political Action Conference. There are TAKE A LAP RHINO tank tops ($35), JUSTICE FOR ALL #16PC tees (also $35), and Kash Krew Golf Polos ($50-$53).
xh3i | There are the books. Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth, and the Battle for Our Democracy is Patel's account of his years fighting the "corrupt cabal" of federal officials trying to take down Trump. And in The Plot Against the King, a children's book, Patel tells the story of a wizard named Kash who sets out to save King Donald from the sinister machinations of Hillary Queenton and a "shifty knight." Head over to fightwithkash.com, and for a "special low offer" of $19.99, one can purchase playing cards ("the collector's item of the century") featuring the story's characters; the king card belongs to "Kash, the distinguished wizard and corruption combatant."
syiw | There is at least one song: Patel produced "Justice for All," a version of the national anthem sung by jailed January 6 defendants and played by Trump at his first 2024 campaign rally. Patel professes to make no money from the song or the merch-he says proceeds go to January 6 defendants and their families, or to the Kash Foundation. Few details are available about the charity, but according to Patel, it has funded meals for needy families and defamation lawsuits on behalf of Ric Grenell, Patel's friend and former boss at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence,
kg3t | Kash Patel Will Do Anything for Trump - The Atlantic and Daniel Bostic, a "Stop the Steal" activist. (Just as this article was going to press, most of the merch was removed from Patel's online shop.)
lvae | All the while, Patel churns out promotional content on Truth Social-for a conservative cellphone carrier ("Freedom in cell phones, switch today") and a Christian payment processor ("Why not just give your money to the enemy, or switch now")-and hawks pills that he says "reverse" the effects of COVID vaccines ("Mrna detox, reverse the vaxx n get healthy").
o9sc | He has also worked as a national security adviser to Trump (bringing in more than $300,000 over the past two years from the former president's Save America PAC, according to campaign-finance records) and as a consultant for Trump Media & Technology Group, the owner of Truth Social ($130,000 last year, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing). In addition, Patel has spoken of work abroad, though public paper trails are hard to come by-he has claimed, for example, that he worked as a security consultant for Qatar during the 2022 FIFA World Cup, in Doha.
121u | Nevertheless, Patel has at times vented that he deserves more, according to two people I spoke with. "He complains about money all the time-like, he doesn't have any money, can't make any money, nobody will hire him," a longtime Trump adviser told me. "Anybody who was as big of a deal as he was in the past administration would come out and they'd be on the board of Raytheon and Boeing." (This person, like many of the nearly 40 Patel associates I spoke with for this story, requested anonymity for fear of retribution. Patel, who declined to be interviewed, denied this through a spokesperson.)
zh03 | From the time Patel left the administration, he appeared committed to finding opportunities to reinforce his loyalty to Trump. In spring 2022, after the FBI opened a criminal investigation into Trump's handling of federal records at Mar-a-Lago, Patel insinuated himself into the story, telling Breitbart News that he witnessed Trump verbally declassify "whole sets of materials" before leaving the presidency. The claim ensured a starring role for Patel throughout the probe-ending with Patel testifying before a federal grand jury in exchange for a grant of limited immunity. More
