You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

zoj6 | Designed as a socially responsible public good, a local currency may be administered by a tax-exempt non-profit organization. Operating as a recognized non-profit organization is beneficial in terms of federal policy. For local fiat currency systems that are not pegged to the U.S. dollar, operating as a non-profit allows the currency organization to be exempt from the Securities Act of 1933 (Solomon, 1996a). Without this exemption, currency organizations would have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, abide by disclosure, privacy, and other administrative requirements, and pay related fees (Securities Act of 1933). For time banks and LETS, the IRS has provided private guidance that operating as a non-profit is a condition which might help ensure a time bank is not considered a "barter exchange" (Swennen, 2012), thus avoiding additional 1099-B reporting responsibilities under the U.S.
q6uz | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT
h12f | Treasury regulations (26 C.F.R. § 1.6045-1). Though nonprofits may gain trust and promote community values (Solomon, 1996b), without sufficient resources they may face difficulties in administering local currencies. In fact, nonprofit currency managers often rely on volunteer staffing and tend to use on word-of-mouth advertising rather than employing more professional marketing methods (Lepofsky & Bates, 2005; Seyfang, 2002; Williams, 1997).
fte7 | Other federal laws apply to the look and denomination of complementary currencies. These restrictions are most applicable to proxy and fiat currency systems that print and distribute bills. The production of metal coins (18 U.S.C. § 486), money similar in look to U.S. national currency (18 U.S.C. § 491), or currencies with denominations of less than one dollar (18 U.S.C. § 336) is banned. Notably, the Supreme Court has ruled that the prohibition of denominations of less than one dollar does not apply to currencies with "only a neighborhood circulation" (United States v. Van Auken, 1877). This suggests that local currencies may be able to issue denominations of less than one dollar, but the legislation remains in the U.S. Code with no modern ruling to clarify the meaning of neighborhood circulation. As a result of these laws, printed local currencies have unique design features that set them apart from U.S. national currency. If currency systems desire coins, they may use materials other than metal to make coins, but the prohibition of denominations less than one dollar could inhibit the currency's usefulness for small purchases.
xay6 | There are at least two situations in which federal laws with administrative requirements may apply to local currency systems. LETS are considered barter exchanges (26 C.F.R. § 1.6045-1(a)(4)) in the United States and the reporting responsibilities for barter exchanges can be substantial. Specifically, the U.S. Treasury requires barter exchanges with over 100 transactions per year to issue a 1099-Bs for each transaction in excess of one dollar made by a non-corporate
57xn | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT
xfyq | member. LETS like the Green America Exchange, which have only business members, are able to issue 1099-Bs on an annual basis (Green America Exchange, n.d.) because their members are businesses, but LETS with individual members are required to provide the paperwork at the time of each individual exchange.
c0te | The second potential set of administrative requirements comes from the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 which applies to money transmitters. It is possible that local currency systems with electronic exchanges (e.g., LETS) may be subject to it. Businesses covered by the act must become licensed and provide reports to regulatory agencies. Though the regulation suggests that local currency systems might not fall under its reach, it states that whether or not a business is covered is "a matter of facts and circumstances" (31 CFR §1010.100(ff)(5)(ii)) without a precise explanation of what the facts and circumstances entail. FinCEN, the branch of government that enforces the act, has not provided guidance on the applicability of the act to local currencies (United States Department of the Treasury, n.d.). If the act does apply, small local currency operations could find compliance with the act burdensome.
1rvy | In addition to currency managers, participants are also affected by federal policy. For a currency system to be viable, it must attract and retain members who use the currency. One major disincentive to full use of local currency is that money earned in local currency is taxable income, yet the federal and state taxes must be paid in U.S. dollars (Eisenstein, 2011). In fact, the U.S. Constitution prohibits states from accepting "any Thing but gold and silver coin" (U.S. Const. art. I, §10) as payments. Even though payment by gold and silver coin is no longer customary, it does not follow that local currency can be accepted. This provision means that users of local currency must also acquire enough U.S. dollars to pay their tax liabilities, even when the liabilities are incurred in local currency. The ability to pay taxes in a particular

vzfi | currency is what validates it (Wray, 1998) and without this characteristic, local currency may struggle. Consider some fiat systems in which currency accumulates with businesses who are unable to spend it in the same amount they receive it due to the lack of commercial vendors who will accept the currency (Eisenstein, 2011; Lepofsky & Bates, 2005). As a result, the businesses may limit the amount they accept or decline to participate in the system altogether. A healthy local currency system needs participating businesses. If participating businesses could pay taxes in local currency, this problem would be diminished (Eisenstein, 2011).
qzy5 | State Law
b5u1 | With some notable exceptions, most states allow private local currency. Arkansas prohibits its issuance by individuals or corporations (Ark. Code Ann. § 4-17-102; Ark. Code Ann. § 4-17-103). Massachusetts bans the issuance and use of currency that is not created by a bank incorporated in the state (Mass. Gen. Laws ch 267, § 21). Lastly, Virginia prohibits issuance of local currency without specific authorization by law (Va. Code Ann. § 6.2-202). Florida and Massachusetts have state laws that prohibit counterfeiting (Solomon, 1996b), but appropriately designed community currencies would not be considered counterfeits.
zfcz | Supporting Local Currency through Policy
q56v | Widespread use of community currency is difficult to achieve without government support (Eisenstein, 2011). After a massive review of complementary currency literature and publications, Schroeder and colleagues (2011) concluded the need for policy change to help local currencies prosper. Internationally, government support has been given to currency systems and may serve as a model for policy support in the United States. Examples of international as well as domestic policy support illustrate how government bodies can encourage local currencies.

t894 | Although municipalities in the United States are not allowed to issue their own currency, they can nonetheless aid privately run systems. First, they can provide funding. In Toulouse, France, the city is the primary funder for the local currency SOL-Violette (OuiShare TV, 2013). The city gave the project 120,000 euros for startup, and in the first year of operation, the currency grew to 1,000 users and 95 participating businesses and became a model for communities across Europe (Paracchini, 2012). In England, local governments have also provided funding ("Brixton People," 2013; Seyfang, 2002). While cities may not have their own funding for currency project, they may be able to leverage support from other sources. The City of Montpelier, VT, used grant money from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (n.d.) to help create the REACH Time Bank.
ea8p | The second way in which local governments can aid local currency is by accepting it for payment of taxes, fees, and services. As noted earlier, the U.S. Constitution prohibits states from doing so (U.S. Const. art. I, §10), but this does not extend to municipalities. Accepting fees and taxes in a currency creates a demand for the currency and drives local production and consumption (Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011). In the city of Bristol, England, strong support from the city council propelled the Bristol Pound to success. In its first year, it recruited over 600 businesses and issued over £250,000 of currency and now the city council accepts it for payment of taxes, fees, and services ("Council will take tax payments," 2013; Harvey, 2012). Similarly, the London district of Brixton council accepts their local currency for payment of business taxes and offers to pay portions of their employees' salaries with it (Shakhli, 2013). In the United States, a smaller scale example occurred when the public transit system in Ithaca agreed to accept up to $5 worth of Ithaca HOURS as payment toward a monthly bus pass ("Ithaca HOURS Accepted," 2009).

ywgv | State Policy Supports
hkyg | State governments can also play a role. Those that prohibit complementary currencies (Arkansas, Massachusetts, and Virginia) could revise their statutes to allow local or social purpose currency systems to operate. Indeed, the State of California recently did just that by repealing a section of their Corporations Code that prohibited the issuance or circulation of complementary currencies (2014 Cal. Stat. 1951). The bill passed with wide support: 28 to 12 in the Senate and 52 to 27 in the Assembly ("AB-129 Lawful Money", 2014).
r7wa | Though states cannot accept local currencies for payment of taxes or debt (U.S. Const. art. I, §10) unless there is federal legislation (U.S. v. Rifen, 1978), there are other means of support they can provide. They can educate the public about local currencies, hold trainings for potential currency managers, publicize existing local currencies and administer currency accreditation services. Without violating federal law, states can create their own time banks. For example, Vocational Rehabilitation and Unemployment Offices could run time banks to help clients develop skills or Parks and Wildlife Departments could develop innovative uses of time banks to encourage volunteerism and facility use.
62ej | The state of Vermont has passed legislation (Vt. Stat. Ann., tit. 11, §§ 921-938) that gives the state and local governments influence in the creation of local currency without actually issuing it. The statute provides for the formation of "scrip corporations" for the sole purpose of issuing complementary currency (Vt. Stat. Ann., tit. 11, § 921). If the scrip corporations issue currency backed by deposits in a Vermont bank, they can operate without government involvement in the creation of currency. However, the amount of currency that can be issued cannot exceed 1/3 of the principal on deposit. Compared to the BerkShares currency which is issued at a rate of 105% of the cash deposits (New Economy Coalition, 2013), this is quite
x3xe | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT
f4bh | restrictive. However, the statute also allows for the issuance of "scrip" based on "short term notes and obligations of towns, cities or other municipalities" (Vt. Stat. Ann., tit. 11, § 926). In effect, this allows local currency to be created by local governments in the same way the United States government creates dollars by issuing treasury bonds to the Federal Reserve Bank (Wray, 1998). By working with a scrip corporation, the state or a city could, in essence, borrow local currency into existence. While this is an important model for local governments wishing to be involved in the creation and circulation of local currency, in reality it does not appear to be currently utilized. A search of the Vermont Secretary of State corporate database (Vermont Secretary of State, n.d.) revealed no existing scrip corporations.
jlnu | Federal Policy Supports
448v | Federal policy change could have a tremendous effect on local currencies. As indicated by the Supreme Court, Congress can pass legislation to allow local governments to issue their own community currency and allow states to accept local currency as payment of taxes and other debt (The Mayor v. Ray, 1873; U.S. v. Rifen, 1978). Either one of these actions would create an entirely new and supportive policy environment in which participation in local currencies is fostered.
rxqp | Other federal changes could assist with currency administration. Local proxy and fiat currencies could gain flexibility if the ban on currency denominations of less than one dollar was repealed. Exemptions for local social purpose currency organizations to money transmission and securities regulations could ease administrative burdens for LETS. These regulations were not crafted for the unique circumstances of local currency, but were intended to prevent money laundering and protect investors (Bank Secrecy Act of 1970; Securities Act of 1933). Another administrative obstacle for LETS could be removed if legislation were passed to allow 1099-Bs

ejmn | for individuals to be issued on an annual basis rather than at the time of each transaction. Another important consideration is to ensure Congress minimizes unintended adverse effects on local currencies when it creates future legislation to regulate large commercial virtual currencies like BitCoin.
d2bj | Conclusion
fvm9 | By providing economic opportunities, stimulating the local economy, and encouraging social connections, local currencies can assist communities meet their goals and support their unique values. Local currencies across the globe support socially and ecologically responsible businesses, the arts, education, and economic development, and address the needs of vulnerable populations. They are an innovative people-centered tool for community development which can succeed even when the national currency is scarce. However, challenges emerge from their policy environment which threaten their full success.
ee07 | To address policy barriers to local currency, community leaders and organizations can engage in policy advocacy on a variety of levels. As the State of California has shown, efforts to repeal state prohibitions can be successful. Citizens of Arkansas, Massachusetts, and Virginia can request their representatives to sponsor and support bills to repeal the restrictive laws. Similar advocacy can be done at the federal level where legislators can be encouraged to repeal the ban on currencies of less than one dollar, provide exemptions for local currency systems in the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 and Securities Act of 1933, and revise the reporting requirements for barter exchanges.
l40k | Policy change is not without risk. Because local currency research is still in an early stage, communities cannot ensure the currencies will bring the social and economic gains suggested by theory. To deal with this uncertainty, policies can be piloted on the state and local
4kdu | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT
rm23 | level, especially in regions where currencies are already operational. For example, municipalities can experiment with accepting community currency for public transportation fares, parking fees, or other services. Strict requirements could be implemented allowing select businesses to pay fees in the local currency. In time, successful pilots can be made permanent. With local and state support, local currencies can enjoy additional success.
eerb | As they flourish, federal policy changes will become more appropriate. At this point, advocacy for federal legislation to allow states to accept local currency as payment and allow local governments to create their own currency may prevail. In the meantime, currency advocates can educate their representatives about local currencies and the communities that support them. They can also monitor potential legislation on virtual currency to ensure it does not contain provisions that would harm local currency.
