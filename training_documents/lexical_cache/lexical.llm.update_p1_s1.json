        "content": "awab | Eleven Lexical Stress\nixcc | Stress is accentuation of syllables within words, or of words within sentences. This chapter deals with the first of these phenomena: lexical, or word stress. In lexical-stress languages, the syllables of any polysyllabic word are not created equal. Some syllables may serve as the locus of accentual prominence; others may not. Perceptually, this results in a distinction in salience between the syllables within a word. Thus syllable has initial stress: SYLlable. Syllabic is stressed on the second syllable: sylLABic (upper case denotes a stressed syllable).\n8p6h | Although the term stress is properly an abstraction, speech perception deals with physical realities, and so, as Section Eleven point one describes, research on stress perception has largely been concerned with the acoustic characteristics of stressed versus unstressed syllables, and how listeners exploit the acoustic information to make decisions about where stress occurs. Differences across languages in the realization and function of stress have important perceptual consequences; this issue is considered in Section Eleven point two. Only in some languages is stress a potential contributor to spoken-word recognition; the empirical evidence on this question is surveyed in Section Eleven point three.\npmgl | Eleven point one Acoustic Realization and Perceptual Apprehension of Stress\n90no | Eleven point one point one The scope of this survey\njt0y | Like speech perception research in general, research on the perception of stress came of age when it became possible not only to measure the acoustic properties of speech signals, but to manipulate them. This was in the middle of the twentieth century.\nqb7o | The research described in this section concerns word stress in free-stress languages, although the manifestation of stress in free- versus fixed-stress languages has not always been kept apart in the literature (Section Eleven point two, below, will address this distinction). Also it has not always been the case that word stress has been kept apart from phrase and sentence stress, especially in earlier literature; however,\noae5 | prominence within the utterance more properly belongs in the domain of intonation research.\ns0fl | In words, stressed syllables very often differ from unstressed syllables in nature - phonological systems assign stress to heavier syllables but not to lighter syllables, for instance. But stressed syllables also differ from unstressed syllables in their acoustic realization. Figure Eleven point one shows spectrograms of the utterance say the word pervert again, spoken by a male speaker of American English. In the top spectrogram the verb reading (perVERT) is shown, in the bottom spectrogram the noun reading (PERvert); although the syllables have the same segmental structure in each reading, the acoustic realization is clearly different.\n43ia | Speech perception research paid great attention to acoustic realization. The measurements and manipulations concerned the suprasegmental parameters of speech: that is, those dimensions within which any speech signal must be realized, but which in principle can vary independently while the segmental identity of a syllable remains constant. In practice this involved three acoustic dimensions: the durational patterning of the utterance, the fundamental frequency F zero of the voice, and the signal amplitude. Perceptually these correspond to utterance timing, pitch, and loudness.\n3g2y | Eleven point one point two Multiply determined stress judgments\ngc7v | Fry (Nineteen Fifty-Five, Nineteen Fifty-Eight) conducted a systematic study of word stress in English minimal noun/verb pairs such as OBject - obJECT. Fry measured the duration and peak amplitude of each vowel, and found almost non-overlapping distributions for the stressed versus unstressed versions of comparable syllables, with the stressed syllables being longer and with higher amplitude than the unstressed. He then synthesized versions of the same words, varying these two parameters independently in five steps each, and varying F zero in sixteen steps. Listeners' judgments of which syllable bore stress in the resulting synthetic words showed more effect of the durational manipulation than of the amplitude manipulation; change in F zero had an all-or-none effect, such that a syllable with a noticeably higher peak F zero, or a clear F zero movement, was always judged to be stressed. The function of stressed syllables in stress languages is to serve as possible locations for accentual prominence within utterance intonation contours, and this result suggests that listeners are highly sensitive to where intonational prominence is realized; wherever this occurs, the location is judged to be a stressed syllable. Fry (Nineteen Fifty-Eight) thus cautiously concluded that this F zero effect may be strongest for stress perception, with the effect of duration also being significant, but that of amplitude negligible. However, he also pointed out that vowel quality needed to be investigated, and he undertook this task in a subsequent study (Fry, Nineteen Sixty-Five), in which shifts of the vowel formant ratios (e.g., for object, stepwise from D to A in the first syllable or from E to I in the second) were compared to durational and amplitude manipulations. The suprasegmental factors here proved more closely related to stress judgments than this type of vowel change.\nwqfv | If subjective impressions suggested that stressed syllables were louder than unstressed, this impression was quickly disconfirmed even by some of the earliest studies. Mol and Uhlenbeck (Nineteen Fifty-Six) reversed the amplitude relationship of stressed\nj30a | versus unstressed syllables while leaving other parameters unchanged, and found that the reversal did not affect perceived stress; Bolinger (Nineteen Fifty-Eight) added amplitude to pitch accents realized in synthesized sentences, and found that listeners' naturalness judgments if anything favored accents with less added amplitude. Ladefoged, Draper, and Whitteridge, introducing their pioneering Nineteen Fifty-Eight electromyographic study of speech muscle activity, reported that \"it is generally agreed\" that stress has no single acoustic correlate.\n7bdk | This was also the conclusion of studies by Lehiste and Peterson (Nineteen Fifty-Nine), and Lieberman (Nineteen Sixty). Lehiste and Peterson further drew attention to the non-independence of the acoustic parameters measured in stress studies and segmental factors - consonants and, especially, vowels can differ in intrinsic duration, amplitude, and pitch. Lieberman's study aimed to derive an algorithm for determining which of two syllables is stressed. Measurements of the three acoustic parameters in over seven hundred tokens of bisyllables (twenty-five minimal pairs, produced in context by sixteen speakers) showed that greater duration, higher average F zero and amplitude measures were all strongly correlated with stress. Where one measure was not in the predicted direction, there was almost always a trade-off because other correlates of stress were present (in no fewer than ninety-seven percent of cases). Lieberman concluded that no single acoustic cue to stress is necessarily important, but that all cues may be evaluated together.\nfim0 | Eleven point one point three In search of a unitary underlying factor\nojro | Should there be, no matter how complex the realization, some unitary underlying factor distinguishing stressed from unstressed syllables? The concept of articulatory effort figures in this role in many early studies. The latter two papers propose an explicitly perceptual account: \"perception of linguistic stress is based upon judgements of the physiological effort involved in producing vowels\"; \"the perceptual effect is a pitch contour which could have been produced with an increment of subglottal pressure\".",
