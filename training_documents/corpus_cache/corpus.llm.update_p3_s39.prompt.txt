You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

g9du | CC outcomes and VNS outcomes was performed using the Fisher exact text. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and <LATEX>p</LATEX> <LATEX>< . 0 5</LATEX> was considered significant.
f682 | 3 - RESULTS
li1k | Of 145 cases submitted by 26 centers, 127 fulfilled the in- clusion criteria (0-15 per center). Eighty were males, and 47 were females. Age at epilepsy onset was 0-120 months (median=6, <LATEX>\left. I Q R = 3 . 1 2 - 2 2 . 7 5 \right) .</LATEX> Etiology was genetic in 31, structural/congenital in 17, structural/acquired in 15, and unknown or not reported in 64. Dominant sei- zure types included atypical absence in eight, drop at- tacks (tonic or atonic) in 102, generalized tonic-clonic in 25, and focal with impaired awareness in 15, in addition to the mandatory tonic seizures. Duration of experienc- ing drop attacks before VNS was 0-15 years (median=5, <LATEX>\left. I Q R = 2 . 5 - 8 \right) .</LATEX> Forty-eight children were reported to have severe, 30 moderate, and 22 mild or borderline intellectual disability. Three children had prior resective epilepsy sur- geries, and 45 were on the ketogenic diet.
pbea | 3.1 Vagus nerve stimulation
ccpt | Age at VNS surgery was 3 months to 15years <LATEX>\left( m e d i a n = 7 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. I Q R = 4 - 1 0 \right) .</LATEX> Children were on up to six ASMs <LATEX>\left( 3 . 1 \pm 1 . 1 \right)</LATEX> before VNS. Apart from two patients who had their VNS setting on 1.5 mA, all other patients were titrated to a minimal output current of 1.75mA. Seizure outcomes following VNS, and as evaluated before CC surgery (at a follow-up of up to 17years, <LATEX>m e d i a n = 3 . 3 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. I Q R = 2 - 6 \right) ,</LATEX> are summarized in Table 1.
0fpw | 3.2 Corpus callosotomy
dqn8 | A total of 127 children underwent CC surgery at 2-18 years <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { m e d i a n } = 1 1 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. I Q R = 8 . 7 6 - 1 5 \right) ,</LATEX> up to 17years following VNS (median=3.3, <LATEX>\left. I Q R = 2 - 6 \right) .</LATEX> Eighty-six underwent a complete callosotomy, and 41 an anterior callosotomy
cop0 | (40 were of the anterior two thirds, and one of half the callosum extent). We did not collect data regarding the reason for the extent of disconnection. The surgical ap- proach for a complete CC included an open anterior in- terhemispheric approach <LATEX>\left( n = 8 4 \right)</LATEX> and endoscopic <LATEX>\left( n = 2 \right) .</LATEX> Of the 41 anterior CCs, 38 were performed via an anterior interhemispheric approach, and three used laser intersti- tial thermal therapy (LITT).
lhkq | Ten children underwent additional CC surgery, com- pleting the posterior disconnection. The time from first to second CC surgery was 2-86 months <LATEX>\left( m e d i a n = 1 6 . 3 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. I Q R = 6 . 7 - 3 4 . 3 \right) .</LATEX> Surgical approaches included anterior in- terhemispheric in six, posterior interhemispheric in three, and LITT in one. We were therefore evaluating the results following 96 complete CC procedures and 31 partial CC procedures, with a total of 137 surgical procedures. The 137 procedures included an anterior interhemispheric approach <LATEX>\left( n = 1 2 8 \right) ,</LATEX> endoscopic <LATEX>\left( n = 2 \right) ,</LATEX> LITT <LATEX>\left( n = 4 \right) ,</LATEX> and posterior interhemispheric
82ju | <LATEX>\left( n = 3 \right) .</LATEX> Surgical complications were reported for 18 of 137 CC procedures (13% [127 primary <LATEX>C C s + 1 0</LATEX> CC-completion disconnections]). Following the 127 primary CC pro- cedures, complications included wound complications (four infections, two not specified), pneumonia <LATEX>\left( n = 2 \right) ,</LATEX> neurological (a total of 6 cases, 4 transient, one perical- losal artery infact, and one not specified), one noninfec- tious fever, one plate removal several years after surgery, and one general deterioration. Following the 10 CC- completion procedures, only one wound infection was reported.
y2qo | 3.3 Follow-up and seizure outcome
1piq | Follow-up after the primary CC was 2-191 months (me- <LATEX>\mathrm { d i a n } = 4 2 . 4 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. I Q R = 1 6 - 8 5 \right) .</LATEX> The number of ASMs at the last follow-up after the primary CC procedure was similar to that prior to CC <LATEX>\left( 3 . 3 \pm 1 . 3 \right.</LATEX> after vs. <LATEX>3 . 3 1 . 2</LATEX> before CC). Seizure outcomes are presented in Table 2. Overall, 83% had at least a 50% reduction in drop attacks, and a 60%
