You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

lvae | infra), mass balance determinations were made to ensure that the amount of unreacted substrate and products corresponded to the amount of substrate added to the reaction. In addition, reactions containing 0.8 mM 1b as well as the usual quantity (8 mM) of 1 were carried out to deter- mine if the latter would survive the hydroxylation conditions and/or compete with 1 for the enzyme. Mock experiments were carried out without addition of NADH, and the substrate was recovered following the usual extraction and concentration procedures.
o9sc | Isotope Effect Studies. Reactions with MMO from <LATEX>M .</LATEX> capsulatus (Bath) were investigated with 1 and its mono-, di-, and trideuterated derivatives at the methyl position. An intramolecular isotope effect was investigated through studies of the mono- and dideuterated derivatives. The product alcohol la from reactions with each substrate was analyzed by GC/MS. The isotope effect was then calculated by comparison of the intensities, after statistical corrections, at <LATEX>m / z \quad 1 4 8</LATEX> and 149 for al- cohols arising from the monodeuterated substrate and at <LATEX>m / z \quad 1 4 9 \quad a n d</LATEX> 150 for alcohols derived from the dideuterated substrate.
121u | Intermolecular isotope effects were evaluated by comparison of the rate of formation of la in MMO-catalyzed reactions with the undeu- terated and the trideuterated derivatives. The experiment was performed in two ways, as a competitive reaction and as separate reactions with each substrate. Competition experiments were performed with equal amounts (0.5 uL) of both derivatives present in the reaction vial. The mass spectral intensity at <LATEX>m / z \quad 1 4 8 ,</LATEX> representing reaction of the undeuterated substrate, was divided by the intensity at <LATEX>m / z \quad 1 5 0 ,</LATEX> representing reaction with the trideuterated substrate, and the ratio was taken as the inter- molecular isotope effect. In separate reactions with the two derivatives, 2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane (1c), a product of the enzymatic reaction (vide infra), was used as an internal standard for the purpose of quantitation. The amount of la relative to 1c was calculated for each derivative. The ratio of alcohol to phenol for the undeuterated derivative was divided by the same ratio for the trideuterated derivative to provide the intermolecular isotope effect.
zh03 | Results
1mvw | The hydroxylation of 1 yielded two products as revealed by both GC and GC/MS analysis. They were identified as alcohol la and 2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane (1c)38 by comparison of their retention times and mass spectra with those of authentic standards. Quantitation of the peaks revealed that the two products are formed in approximately equal concentrations and at equal rates over a 20-min reaction period (Figure S1, sup- plementary material). To ensure that all added material was accounted for in the analysis, mass balance studies were carried out. The amount of material recovered in control reactions run in the absence of reductant corresponded to <LATEX>8 4 . 4 \div 0 . 6 \%</LATEX> of the substrate initially added, the remainder apparently being lost
6d4s | through the various extraction manipulations. When NADH was present to initiate and sustain enzyme turnover, 85.0 ± 0.5% of the material added was recovered, 5.0 ± 0.2% of which was la, and 5.1 ± 0.1%, 1c. No rearranged alcohol 1b was detected. The possibility that 1b formed but was unstable under the hydroxy- lation conditions was investigated through analysis of a reaction containing 8 mM 1 and 0.8 mM 1b. In the presence of NADH, 78.6 ± 1.3% of 1b was recovered, compared to 78.2 ± 1.0% in control reactions without NADH. This result indicates that 1b is unaffected during the hydroxylation reaction. The yields of la and 1c remained unchanged.
mqah | Hydroxylation studies of the mono- and dideuterated derivatives of substrate 1 gave values for KH/kp of 5.15 ± 0.38 and 5.03 ± 0.42, respectively, for the intramolecular isotope effect. The intermolecular isotope effect was determined by comparing results for 1 with those for its trideuterated derivative. A value of 1.18 ± 0.15 was obtained for reactions that were performed separately, whereas competitive reactions performed with both derivatives present in the reaction mixture yielded a value of 0.89 ± 0.10 (see Experimental Section). In the competition study, the ratio of phenols (1c-do:1c-d3) was 1.1.
xxr8 | GC analysis of hydroxylation reactions with 2 revealed only a single product, which was identified by comparison to an au- thentic standard as the alcohol 2a. No peaks that might arise from rearranged alcohol 2b or aromatic hydroxylation products were detected. A plot showing the rate of product formation is given in Figure S2.
rl4j | Analysis of the extracts from reactions with trans-1,2-di- methylcyclopropane (3) revealed only one product, the concen- tration of which increased linearly with time over a 10-min period (Figure S1). It was identified as the unrearranged alcohol, trans-(2-methylcyclopropyl)methanol (3a), through comparison of its GC retention time with that of an authentic standard. No 4-penten-2-ol (3b) or 2-methylbut-3-en-1-ol (3c) was detected.
