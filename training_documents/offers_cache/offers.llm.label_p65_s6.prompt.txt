You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

njvp | Then I realized people pay for certainty. They value certainty. I call this "the perceived likelihood of achievement." In other words, "How likely do I believe it is that I will achieve the result I am looking for if I make this purchase?"
s8b5 | For example, how much would you pay to be a plastic surgeon's 10,000th patient versus their first?
p450 | If you're a normal, sane person, a lot more. I mean heck, you might even ask them to pay you if you are their first patient ever.
rsvo | So you can see even from this simple example that while the service you are receiving is technically the same, the only thing that changes is your perceived likelihood of getting what you want.
z4m8 | Both surgeons take the same amount of time to do the surgery (if anything, the guy who has done it 10,000 times would likely get it done faster and still charge more). The more-experienced surgeon has a track record of achieving a result, which incentivizes their desirability.
ukf0 | People value this perceived likelihood of achievement. Increasing a prospect's conviction that your offer will "actually" work for them, will make your offer that much more valuable even though the work remains the same on your end. So to increase value with all offers, we must communicate perceived likelihood of achievement through our messaging, proof, what we choose to include or exclude in our offer, and our guarantees (more on these later).
k38m | #3 Time Delay (Goal = Decrease)
nkj9 | Time delay is the time between a client buying and receiving the promised benefit. The shorter the distance between when they purchase and they receive value/the outcome, the more valuable your services or product is.
35a8 | There are two elements to this driver of value: Long-term outcome and short-term experience. Many times, there are short- term experiences that occur while en route to the long-term outcomes. They happen "along the way" and provide value.
337o | It's good to understand both. The thing people buy is the long-term value, aka their "dream outcome." But the thing that makes them stay long enough to get it is the short-term experience. These are little milestones a prospect sees along the way that shows them they are on the right path. We try and tie as many of these as possible into any service we offer. We want clients to have a big emotional win early (as close as possible to their purchase). This gives them the emotional buy in and the momentum to "see it through" to their ultimate goal.
cuth | For example, it takes a while to add an extra $239,000 per year to a gym. But that's what they're buying. So, once they have purchased, we need to create emotional wins fast. One way we do this is to get their ads live and get them to close their first $2,000 sale within their first seven days. By doing this, their decision to work with us is reinforced, and they immediately trust us more. This makes them more likely to follow the rest of our systems and get to their ultimate destination.
09z2 | Pro Tip: Fast Wins
13fv | Always try and incorporate short-term, immediate wins for a client. Be creative. They just need to know they are on the right path and that they made the right decision trusting you and your business.
v5pj | Let me give you another example. If I sell someone a bikini body, their time delay to realize that outcome may be 12 months
trab | or even longer. Along the way, though, as they change their bodies, they may experience higher sex drive, more energy, and an increased community of friends.
grxs | They aren't initially buying those things, but those things may become short-term benefits that keep them in the game long enough to achieve their ultimate outcome. They buy the dream, but they stay for the benefits they discover along the way. The faster and more clearly you can demonstrate those benefits, the more valuable your service will be. For a weight loss customer, we would get them to meet someone else so they immediately had some social benefits from the program, and we usually gave them a more aggressive diet in the beginning. Why? Because we wanted them to have a big, fast emotional win, so we could get them to commit to the long term. This is also backed by science. People who experience a victory early on are more likely to continue with something than those who do not.
u9dn | That being said, having to wait 12 to 24 months to get what you want is a long time when you can do liposuction and be done in an afternoon. This shows just one of the reasons people pay $25,000 for liposuction with a tummy tuck, while people will barely pay $100/mo to join a bootcamp.
t25w | But that's not the only reason, is it?
x62u | That leads me to the last driver of value - effort and sacrifice.
aoc8 | Pro Tip: Fast Beats Free
3mdu | The only thing that beats "free" is "fast." People will pay for speed. Many companies have entered free spaces and done exceedingly well with a "speed first" strategy. A few notable examples: The MVD vs DMV wait in line forever or pay $50 you can skip the line and get your license renewed privately. Fedex vs USPS (when it absolutely positively has to be there overnight). Spotify vs Slow Free Music. Uber vs Walking. Fast beats free. Many will always be willing to pay (price) for the (value) of speed. So if you find yourself in a market competing against free, double down on speed.
m04v | #4 Effort & Sacrifice (Goal = Decrease)
3aip | This is what it "costs" people in ancillary costs, aka "other costs accrued along the way." These can be both tangible and intangible.
q3gu | Using the fitness versus liposuction example, let's look at the difference in effort and sacrifice:
txab | liposuction effort and sacrifice:
dov0 | Fitness Effort and Sacrifice:
xd5o | Wake up one to two hours earlier in the morning
3gny | Fall asleep
ws73 | Five to ten hours per week of time lost
vyos | Wake up thin, guaranteed
w4hq | Stop eating the foods you love
ghbe | Be sore for two to four weeks
1lkf | Constant hunger
uobn | Physical soreness
3194 | Feelings of embarrassment at not knowing how to exercise
r22o | Risk of injury
nupw | Actual nausea working out
37xs | Meal prepping
hoi0 | New groceries/more expensive
tffb | New clothing (can be a benefit for some folks)
ewwt | Fear of gaining it back after all this effort (impermanence)
2tj1 | Etc ...
nbhq | Massive difference, right?
w251 | In fact, in looking at the marketing of plastic surgeons, these are the exact pain points they hit on when they say things like: "Tired of wasting countless hours in the gym. . . . tired of trying diets that just don't work?"
1vgx | This is why when you sell fitness, you have to spend an hour arm-wrestling a client to give over 1/10th to 1/100th of the amount of money they pay for surgery. There's just not a lot of perceived value because the perceived likelihood of achievement, the time delay to achievement, and the effort and sacrifice are so high.
yjnk | So even though the outcome is the same, the value of the vehicles are dramatically different, hence the difference in price.
9zmh | Decreasing the effort and sacrifice, or at least the perceived effort and sacrifice, can massively boost the appeal of your offer.
mi3g | In an ideal world, a prospect would want to simply "say yes" and have their dream outcome happen with no more effort on their behalf.
ntjg | This is why "done for you services" are almost always more expensive than "do-it-yourself" because the person doesn't have all the effort and sacrifice. There is also a component of "perceived likelihood of achievement" difference as well. People believe that if an expert does it, then they will be more likely to achieve the outcome than if they try on their own.
86at | My hope is that you now have a foundational understanding of the components of value and how the interplay between each
bpd2 | of the components creates or detracts from the value someone might be willing to pay.
hkd8 | Putting It All Together
sptg | As I said earlier, these elements of value don't happen in a vacuum. They happen together, in combination. So let's look at a few examples that utilize all four components of value at once.
2k40 | In an effort to quantify the value, I'll rate them on a binary scale of 0 or 1. 1 being value achieved. 0 being missing. Then I will add all four together to give you a relative value rating of a type of service. Our goal as marketers and business owners is to increase the value of the dream outcome and its perceived likelihood of achievement, while decreasing the time delay of achievement and the effort and sacrifice one has to put in to get there.
krk7 | To start I will do a side by side comparison of two "vehicles" with identical Dream outcomes: Meditation and Xanax. Both offer the buyer relaxation, decreased anxiety, and feelings of well-being. I will demonstrate how the other three variables dramatically shift the value of delivering that dream outcome and ultimately, the price.
4tyc | Example : Dream Outcome: "Relaxation," "Decreased Anxiety," "Feelings of well-being" Meditation vs Xanax

6d9q | Meditation
wsc1 | Dream Outcome
or3l | "Relaxation"
fbyc | "Decreased Anxiety"
vceo | "Feelings of well-
kd78 | being"
896u | Perceived Likelihood
o0si | Low, since most people get distracted and don't actually think they'll follow through with daily meditation
1fx8 | Time Delay
tfms | Long time to yield long term results. Some immediate benefits after 10 to 20 minutes (assuming you don't get frustrated)
pfv5 | Effort & Sacrifice
8gxa | Physical discomfort (numb body limbs often). Mental discomfort (feeling like you are failing at it constantly). Time sacrifice (you have to set time aside everyday to do it).
fsvi | Overall Value
068d | Low
ysz7 | And that is why Xanax is a multi-billion dollar product while I know of almost no multi-billion dollar meditation businesses . . . value.
k5db | I'm not here to argue about whether meditation is better than Xanax (obviously it is) but that doesn't mean it's perceived as more valuable.
7jzh | This is also the reason that the supplement industry ($123B, Grandview Research) is twice the size of the health club industry ($62B, IHRSA). They both accomplish the same perceived objectives - "being healthy," "losing weight," "looking good," "increased energy," etc. - but one is perceived as more valuable because it has lower "costs."
vm00 | People are more willing to pay $200 for supplements than they are a $29/mo membership. Taking a pill, or drinking a shake, is so much faster and easier than going to the gym everyday. Hence . . . valued.

0uje | I want to do an exercise with you right now. I want to show you the difference between convergent and divergent problem solving. Why? So that you can actually create the Grand Slam Offer that will become the cornerstones of your business.
apx3 | Convergent & Divergent Thinking
kcrm | In simple terms, convergent problem solving is where you take lots of variables, all known, with unchanging conditions and converge on a singular answer. Think math.
mbsp | Example:
zynb | You have 3 salespeople who can each take 100 calls per month each.
8h0u | It takes 4 calls to create one sale (including no shows).
b09f | You need to get to 110 sales . . .
zutp | How many sales people must you hire? Deduced Information:
qgmy | 1 salesperson = 100 calls
40wi | 4 calls = 1 close
a418 | 100 calls/4 calls per close = 25 Closes Per 100 Calls
e9lu | 25 closes per rep
a278 | Goal: 110 sales total / 25 sales per rep = 4.4
ffto | Since you can't hire 4.4 reps, you decide you must have five.
ak21 | ANSWER: And since you have 3, you hire two more.
i7n1 | Math problems are convergent. There are lots of variables and a single answer. We are taught all our lives in school to think this way. That is because it's easy to grade.
