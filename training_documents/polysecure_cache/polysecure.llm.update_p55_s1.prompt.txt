You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

wulb | nonmonogamous as orientation describe their nonmonogamy not as a choice, but as who they essentially are and how they are fundamentally wired. I often hear these people say that they feel most themselves when they are with multiple peo- ple, be it sexually or romantically. Some people who identify as nonmonogamous by orientation are fortunate enough to have been nonmonogamous from the time they started dating or being sexual. But many people come into their non- monogamy orientation a bit later, often after having suffered from the belief that they are broken or defective in some way after struggling to be faithful to their part- ners or feeling that monogamy was never fully right for them.
le9r | THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONSENSUAL NONMONOGAMY
34uj | There are numerous ways that people practice non-monogamy and for every per- son, couple, triad, quad or polycule that says they are practicing a certain type of CNM, there are manifold ways that their version might be enacted. Even when peo- ple tell me the specific style of nonmonogamy they practice, I still ask, "what ex- actly does that look like for you?" There is no one right way to practice CNM and it is more of a "create your own relationship" than a one-size-fits-all approach, but there are still certain distinctions in the ways that people practice CNM that are important to name.
u3ij | Each different style of CNM or CNM relationship structure will have different de- grees of openness to sexual and/ or emotional engagement with others, as well as different types of relationship agreements or rules. In Figure 4.1, I plot some of the main relationship structures or styles within CNM based on the two dimensions of emotional exclusivity and sexual exclusivity. On the horizontal axis, we find high emotional exclusivity on the left and low emotional exclusivity on the right. The ver- tical axis has high sexual exclusivity at the top and low sexual exclusivity at the bot- tom. Please note that these two dimensions are not the only way to comprehend the different types of CNM, so please take what helps and dismiss the rest. Addi- tionally, although I place certain types of CNM in specific regions on this graph, there will always be exceptions to where someone else would plot their own ver- sion of that same type of CNM.
x0aw | Monogamy: Monogamy is found in the upper left quadrant because it is tradi- tionally high in both sexual and emotional exclusivity. Some couples that consider themselves monogamous do vary on how emotionally open or closed they are to people outside of the relationship, but it is common for monogamous couples to consider each other as their only sexual partner and emotional primary. In monog- amous couples, a partner is usually considered to be cheating if they engage sexu- ally with another and/ or if they share deep or romantic emotions with others.
rx1a | Monogamish: Coined by sex columnist Dan Savage, this term refers to couples who are mostly sexually and emotionally exclusive, but periodically engage in extra- marital or extra-relational sex or sexual play. These exceptions might include occa- sional one-time hookups, sex with others while traveling apart, or even kissing other people at certain types of events.
agnr | Polyfidelity: A romantic or sexual relationship that involves more than two people, but these people are exclusive with each other. This could include a group rela- tionship of three or more people that is closed to any additional outside partners, or it could be a person who has more than one partner and their partners are not dating each other, but they are also closed to additional relationships.
t1o7 | Swinging: The practice of couples engaging in sexual activity with other couples, individuals or groups. The focus of those encounters is primarily sexual rather than romantic or emotionally intimate and couples who consider themselves as swingers typically sexually play with others while they are together in the same room or at the same event, rather than completely separately from each other. In my practice, I've encountered many swingers who do want to feel some level of connection with the people they are swinging with, but often prefer to keep emo- tional involvement to a minimum in order to maintain the emotional primacy of their marriage or primary relationship.
2830 | Open Marriage/Relationship: A relationship where one or both partners in a rela- tionship have sexual or romantic relationships outside of their primary partnership. Open relationships tend to be more focused on having sex and limiting the degree of emotional involvement with others in order to keep the primary, dyadic rela- tionship as the first priority.
q9nf | Polyamory: The practice of having many (poly) loves (amory), where everyone in- volved is aware and consenting of partners simultaneously having multiple roman- tic and sexual relationships. People who identify as polyamorous tend to focus on the falling in love part of being nonmonogamous, where the intention of having multiple partners is to be in love and have multiple emotionally invested relation- ships. People practicing polyamory can differ in the degree to which they imple- ment hierarchy in their different relationships.
5q5q | Hierarchical Polyamory: A subset of polyamory where there is a ranking system
4cbq | among romantic/sexual relationships and some relationships are considered more important than others. A person's primary partner(s) would be at the top of this ranking system since primaries usually cohabitate, share resources, make deci- sions together and organize their schedules so that they are spending the most amount of time together. Hierarchical relationships tend to use the terms primary, secondary, and sometimes tertiary, describing various levels of importance, com- mitment and who has the rights to create relationship agreements. Typically, the people in a primary relationship with each other set the rules for all subsequent relationships, which might include restrictions on certain recreational or social activities, limits on certain sex acts or on how strong, deep or invested other rela- tionships can become. Many polyamory experts caution against hierarchical rela- tionship structures that create asymmetrical balances of power in which people in secondary or tertiary positions have little or no say about how their relationship un- folds, or are subject to vetoes or rules from their metamours.
33ef | In More Than Two, Franklin Veaux and Eve Rickert make the distinction between prescriptive and descriptive hierarchy.51 Prescriptive hierarchy occurs when a couple predetermines that their status as primaries will not change and all future relation- ships will be subordinate to theirs. All of the relationship styles in the lower left side of this chart could be described as being hierarchical forms of consensual nonmonogamy and in the upper left quadrant, hierarchy would be assumed. De- scriptive hierarchy is less about a given relationship prescription for the future. The term describes a hierarchy that might include several primaries that have emerged more organically and have become more domestically, financially or emotionally entangled than other relationships, but there is still an openness to things chang- ing or new people entering the hierarchy.
xfue | Nonhierarchical Polyamory: The practice of having multiple simultaneous relation- ships without imposing hierarchies. This means that there is no ranking system of primary and secondary. It means that no one person has extra influence over a per- son's relationships, including veto power or more privilege because they live to- gether or have been together longer. All important people get a seat at the table and
pmnr | everyone gets to have a voice. Each relationship is allowed to grow into what it naturally wants to be. In some cases, nonhierarchical polyamory may include pri- oritization of certain relationships in instances where people have children together or live together, but the nonhierarchical structure does not endorse power differ- entials and allows for more flexibility in how relationships can change and evolve over time.
