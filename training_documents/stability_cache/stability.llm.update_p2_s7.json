        "content": "1k9e | Our study addresses several knowledge gaps to further improve the understanding of stability and change in symptoms of psychopathology from childhood into adolescence. First, prior work by Basten et al. within the current sample, assessed the stability and change of psychopathology symptoms until early childhood, not yet covering late childhood and early adolescence. Studying the stability and change of psychopathology symptoms in this age period is crucial, given the rapid changes in behavior that occur during adolescence and since many psychiatric disorders emerge during adolescence. Second, despite the fact that the two previous longitudinal studies applied similar analyses, they used different measures of psychopathology. Basten et al. used parent reported questionnaire data, assessing psychopathology as symptoms along a continuum, whereas McElroy et al. used a structured clinical interview, implemented as a parent reported questionnaire, generating binary variables for the presence of psychiatric diagnoses. Thus, it remains unclear whether the substantial differences in prevalence can be attributed to age differences or to differences in sample or methodology.\n5bjs | Within this context, it is the primary goal of this study to assess developmental trajectories of children with psychopathology symptoms as they progress into adolescence.\nuodj | We evaluate which psychopathology subgroups are present in the general population at different ages and the probability that individuals remain within or transition between the observed psychopathology subgroups over time. Based on previous literature, we hypothesized that we would observe four psychopathology subgroups (no problems, internalizing, externalizing, and DP) in all age groups, and that the psychopathology subgroups become more stable with age, except for the DP group. We hypothesize that this group will begin to diverge during adolescence, transitioning to primarily either internalizing or externalizing subgroups.\nk16v | Method\nb2lm | Participants\nti7f | This study was embedded within the Generation R Study, which is a large longitudinal birth cohort in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, in which pregnant women with a delivery date between April two thousand two and January two thousand six were invited to participate. Since recruitment, the children and their families have been invited for multiple waves of data collection. Children were included in this study if their parents filled out the Child Behavior Checklist at five to eight years of age, nine to twelve years of age, or at thirteen to sixteen years of age. This resulted in a total sample of six thousand nine hundred thirty participants who were eligible for inclusion. Of these participants, seven hundred thirty-six had missing data at time point one, two thousand forty-six had missing data at time point two, and two thousand two hundred twenty-five had missing data at time point three. The majority of participants participated in all measurement waves, one thousand five hundred eighty-seven participated in two measurement waves and one thousand seven hundred ten participated in one measurement wave. Demographic information is provided in Table one and a flowchart of the\noksu | Child Psychiatry and Human Development (twenty twenty-two) fifty-three: one thousand three hundred thirty to one thousand three hundred thirty-nine\nwtow | study sample is provided in Figure one. The study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from the legal representatives and, when children were older than twelve years of age, children also provided informed assent.\no22k | Instruments\nnwfz | Child Behavior\nnvfy | Child behavior was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist. The Child Behavior Checklist version one point five to five years consists of ninety-nine items, with a three-point Likert scale (zero equals not true, one equals somewhat true, two equals very true). Seven empirically derived syndrome scales were calculated, being Anxious/Depressed, Aggressive Behavior, Emotionally Reactive, Somatic Complaints, Withdrawn, Sleep Problems and Attention Problems. Similarly, the Child Behavior Checklist version six to eighteen years consists of one hundred twelve items, of which eight syndrome scales were derived, Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn/Depressed, Somatic Complaints, Thought Problems, Attention Problems, Rule-breaking Behavior and Aggressive Behavior. Both versions are reliable and valid questionnaires for assessing behavioral problems. The primary caregiver completed the questionnaires, which was the Child Behavior Checklist version one point five to five years at time point one and version six to eighteen years at time points two and three. Notably, given the age range included at time point one, for some children the version one point five to five years and for other children the version six to eighteen years would have been age appropriate. The version one point five to five years was used at time point one for all participants to keep the version consistent with earlier measurement waves of Generation R. T-scores of all syndrome scales were computed based on normative data for both the version one point five to five and the version six to eighteen using ASEBA-PC.\nmror | Demographic Characteristics\nzlxc | Sex was obtained from birth records. Maternal education and household income were assessed through questionnaire. Maternal education was categorized into low (no education, primary school), middle (high school, vocational training) and high (higher vocational training, university). Household income was scored low in Generation R when parents had less than two thousand euros a month and high when parents had more than two thousand euros a month. Child national origin was based on the birth country of the parents and categorized as western (Dutch, American western, Asian western, European, Indonesian and Oceania) and non-western (African, American non-western, Asian non-western, Cape Verdean, Dutch Antilles, Moroccan, Surinamese and Turkish).\nk0bw | Statistical Analyses\naq5a | Latent Profile Analysis\nsc5y | Psychopathology profiles at time point one were previously derived using the same procedures described below. In earlier work, the Sleep Problems syndrome scale of the Child Behavior Checklist was not included in the analyses. Here, we applied Latent Profile Analysis to define\n0yab | psychopathology subgroups at time points one, two and three, using Child Behavior Checklist T-scores of all available syndrome scales as indicators, including Sleep Problems. Consistent with earlier work within Generation R, we used five criteria to determine the optimal number of profiles. The Bayesian Information Criterion and the bootstrapped likelihood ratio test were used to evaluate the fit of each model. The Bayesian Information Criterion is a measure of model fit considering the rule of parsimony, with a lower Bayesian Information Criterion indicating a better fit. The bootstrapped likelihood ratio test is a likelihood ratio for k classes versus k minus one classes, with a P-value greater than zero point zero five indicating that k minus one classes are sufficient. Entropy of the models was evaluated with values closer to one indicating better classification. Moreover, all profiles obtained should include a minimum of one percent of the participants. Lastly, all profiles were inspected visually to ensure each additional profile had a distinct severity or shape pattern.",
