        "content": "ob1z | The number of photons emitted by the excited hydroxyl radical OH star in the two hundred seventy to three hundred fifty nanometer region was compared with the total quantity of hydroxyl radicals OH which were formed inside the individual cavitation bubble. The initial rates of hydroxyl radical formation @0 OH were calculated as wo OH equals two thousand times H two O two which follows from the balance equation OH plus OH forms H two O two. Thus, we assumed here that the reactions of radicals with hydrogen peroxide or others inside the bubble or in the solution after a bubble collapse are insignificant; at least they do not play a prevailing role in most cases. Actually, it is an overestimation, and this will be shown in the Discussion section. On the other hand, the number of OH star photons is evidently overestimated too because the bands of OH star species emission are superimposed in the two hundred seventy to three hundred fifty nanometer interval with the emission from other particles. Nevertheless, we guess that the OH star divided by OH or, similarly, OH star divided by two times H two O two ratio is an important parameter for studying the mechanism of sonoluminescence and sonochemistry, and the changes of it in the order of noble gases support this assumption.\nm4cb | Results\nm61y | The spectra of sonoluminescence from noble gas-saturated water were studied in the papers, but in the work the spectra were not investigated at the wavelengths below two hundred seventy nanometers and in the papers they were not corrected with the spectral response of the detector. So the spectra presented in Figure one have an essentially higher intensity at wavelengths less than three hundred ten nanometers than previous ones. Besides, the spectra of helium-saturated water had not yet been reported, although the attempt to measure it was made in the work; however, the emission was too weak to observe any bands or a continuum.\nu2ob | The peak position of the OH star radical at three hundred ten nanometers does not depend on the dissolved gas, but the emission from excited\n2gnm | H two O star molecule has maxima at two hundred sixty-two, two hundred sixty-eight, two hundred fifty, and two hundred forty-two nanometers for helium, argon, krypton, and xenon, respectively (Figure one). The intensity\nemgw | of this part of the spectra grows in the order prime xenon (Figure one).\nxaqt | The total light power of S L increases in the order prime krypton less than xenon (see Table one) that is in accordance with the previously published results on the sonoluminescence intensity of noble gas-saturated water. The measurements of both hydrogen peroxide and sonoluminescence yields in one work were carried out also by Prudhomme and Guilmart. Calculated from the paper, the ratio of SL intensity to the yield of H two O two grows in the order helium less than neon less than argon less than krypton less than xenon, which agrees with our data: this ratio and also the OH star divided by OH ratio increase with increasing atomic weight of the dissolved gases from zero point two six helium to six point four xenon (see Table one).\n5rcb | Discussion\n524j | There are a few hypotheses explaining the mechanism of sonoluminescence and sonochemical reactions. In principle, they can be divided into two categories: thermal, when the origin of sonoluminescence and chemical-active particles is explained by the thermal heating of a cavitation bubble content, and electrical, due to electrical discharge inside the bubble or in the surrounding liquid. Electrical hypotheses were criticized and rejected, but Margulis proposed a new one, the essence of which is as follows.\nxd3m | The small size bubbles are breaking off from the bigger one that pulsates in a sound field. The neck is formed on the place of detachment, and the electrokinetic xi-potential can concentrate there because of the flow of a charged liquid around this neck. The value of the xi potential is excessively great, so the electrical discharge can occur inside the gas phase at the time of the bubble detachment.\n8qb6 | Note that the value of the 5-potential decreases when the concentration of salt in the solution increases. Thus, following reference twenty-two the SL intensity must also decrease in salt solutions. However, experimental results show an opposite dependence: sonoluminescence increases with the growth of salt concentration in salt solutions.\nwkbn | It has been shown recently that the small additives of perfluorocarbon gases C F four and C two F six in the mixture of argon C F four and argon C two F six substantially suppress sonoluminescence. Authors assume that these results are consistent with thermal mechanisms of SL, because these gases have low values of the ratio of specific heats gamma equals c p divided by c as compared with noble gases. Thus, the lower the value of gamma, the lower cavitational temperature and the less the intensity of SL. On the other hand, C F four is known as an efficient gas for plasma chemistry and will support an electrical discharge. Thus, the results are in direct contradiction with electrical discharge hypotheses and support the thermal mechanism for sonochemistry and sonoluminescence.\nftfg | It was found recently that the SL flash from the synchronously repeating stable SL, which originates from nonlinear motion of a single bubble, occurs in the final stage\n7xi5 | Didenko and Pugach\nw8r5 | of its implosion. Note that the authors of the papers were working at the intensity of ultrasound that is higher than the threshold of instability of the bubble surface, i.e., at conditions where the bubble disruption and the detachment of tiny bubbles from the bigger one seem incredible.\nybik | The sonoluminescence spectra of hydrocarbons show no emission lines or bands of charged particles, which is also in disagreement with the electrical discharge hypotheses.",
