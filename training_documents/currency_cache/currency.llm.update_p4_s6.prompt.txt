You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

jxk6 | There are many ways to design local currency. In the United States, communities select designs to reflect their goals and values, while operating within the boundaries of state and

znlx | federal policy (Solomon, 1996b). There are four basic types: (1) proxy, (2) fiat, (3) local exchange and trading systems (LETS), and (4) time banking. To better understand the effects of policy on local currency, a brief description of each type is provided.
yf7f | Proxy currencies are pegged to, backed by, and exchangeable for the national currency (Eisenstein, 2011). They stimulate the local economy through supporting buy local campaigns and raise awareness of local businesses. They have been promoted as a way to increase the tax base and create jobs (New Economy Coalition, 2013). The BerkShares currency in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, is a proxy currency. One-hundred BerkShares can be purchased for $95 U.S. at participating local banks (New Economy Coalition, 2013). BerkShares are recognized by local businesses as having the same value as a U.S. dollar, an incentive which provides a built-in discount for patrons using BerkShares.
lhgm | Local Fiat Currencies are not backed by a currency or commodity (Solomon, 1996b). They are put into circulation through member enrollment, no-interest loan programs, or other agreed upon conditions. The worth of a fiat currency is established by the willingness of users to agree to it as a means of exchange and a measure of value. Local fiat currencies can give unemployed and underemployed individuals increased earning, and thus spending, opportunities. In addition to stimulating the local economy, they help promote community values (Eisenstein, 2011; Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011; Solomon, 1996b). For example, they can be can be issued to participants in health promotion events, community arts projects, environmental cleanup activities, or any type of activity that the community chooses to sponsor (Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011). The Equal Dollars currency in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is a local fiat currency (New Economy Coalition, 2013; "Equal Dollars," n.d.). Equal Dollars are issued when members create accounts and volunteer with local service organizations. They can be spent at an online

2phz | marketplace, farmers' market, consignment store, community bicycle program, and other local businesses. Equal Dollars provides low-income individuals with access to necessary goods and services while supporting human service organizations, promoting healthy behaviors, and stimulating the local economy.
6bw5 | Local Exchange and Trading Systems, or LETSs, are mutual credit systems used for the exchange of goods and services. Though not common in the United States (Collom, 2011; Solomon, 1996b), LETSs are perhaps the most prevalent type of local currency in the world (Schroeder et al., 2011; Seyfang, 1997). Upon joining a LETS, members have an account balance of zero. At the point of purchase, the buyer's account is debited and the seller's account is credited for the purchase amount in the currency of the system. Fourth Corner Exchange, a for-profit LETS in Bellingham, WA, coordinates trades using Life Dollars (Fourth Corner Exchange, n.d.). It has a social justice-based mission and has facilitated the exchange of over $1.4 million of goods and services since its inception in 2004 (Fourth Corner Exchange, n.d.). Green America Exchange is run by a non-profit association of 3,000 socially and ecologically conscious business members (Green Business Network, n.d). It uses "Trade Dollars" and a system of buyer and seller ratings and reviews (Green America Exchange, n.d.).
n0yi | Time banking systems are similar to LETSs, but instead of an exchange currency, the unit of account is time (Cahn, 1999). Members offer and seek services in a directory and exchange hours of service throughout the network. In time banking systems, every member's time is valued equally. This egalitarian system is intended to support the "[c]ore [e]conomy of home, family, neighborhood and community" (Cahn, 2001, p. 2) and values domestic and service work. Time banking builds relationships and helps people with low incomes (Eisenstein, 2011). Time banks are prevalent in the United States (TimeBanks USA, 2013). In 2009, the City of

zxxt | Policy Environment for Local Currency in the United States
0pqj | Although many citizens may be unacquainted with local currency, many forms of it are legal in the United States (Solomon, 1996b). Federal law permits private entities to issue currency; however states (U.S. Const. art. I, §10) and local governments (The Mayor v. Ray, 1873) are not allowed to create currency. This is unfortunate for local currencies because municipal governments have staffing, community relationships, citizen communications, infrastructure, and experience in navigating federal regulations and are well positioned to be successful currency managers. Urban geographer Michael Pacione (1997) argues that "currency issued by a public authority, such as a municipal government, is ... likely to attract a high level of credibility particularly if it can be used to pay fees and taxes" (p. 68).
rmbb | Designed as a socially responsible public good, a local currency may be administered by a tax-exempt non-profit organization. Operating as a recognized non-profit organization is beneficial in terms of federal policy. For local fiat currency systems that are not pegged to the U.S. dollar, operating as a non-profit allows the currency organization to be exempt from the Securities Act of 1933 (Solomon, 1996a). Without this exemption, currency organizations would have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, abide by disclosure, privacy, and other administrative requirements, and pay related fees (Securities Act of 1933). For time banks and LETS, the IRS has provided private guidance that operating as a non-profit is a condition which might help ensure a time bank is not considered a "barter exchange" (Swennen, 2012), thus avoiding additional 1099-B reporting responsibilities under the U.S.

phvu | Treasury regulations (26 C.F.R. § 1.6045-1). Though nonprofits may gain trust and promote community values (Solomon, 1996b), without sufficient resources they may face difficulties in administering local currencies. In fact, nonprofit currency managers often rely on volunteer staffing and tend to use on word-of-mouth advertising rather than employing more professional marketing methods (Lepofsky & Bates, 2005; Seyfang, 2002; Williams, 1997).
