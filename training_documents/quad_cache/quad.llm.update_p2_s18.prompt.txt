You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

hntf | In the case of a > co, the power on ui ap- proaches 0 so all voters buy exactly one vote in the direction of their preference as in 1p1v. In this sense, QV is an optimal intermediate point between the extremes of dictatorship and major- ity rule. It is the one vote pricing rule under which voters who intend only their own gain are led, as if by an invisible hand, to advance the in- terests of society. We refer to voting based on a quadratic pricing rule as Quadratic Voting (QV) for obvious reasons.
99fo | III. Practical Promise
y5r7 | While price-taking is a useful heuristic, it is unlikely to literally hold in game theoretic mod- els of voter behavior. In other work, we have considered a variety of these models. In Lalley and Weyl (2017) we consider the most canonical case from the game theoretic literature, in which voters values are drawn independently and iden- tically from a known value distribution and act as rational, risk-neutral expected utility maxi- mizers. We show that under appropriate condi- tions and in all symmetric Bayes-Nash equilib- ria in large populations the price-taking assump- tion approximately holds for almost all voters and thus that the welfare losses from QV decay, generically at a rate - as the population grows. In another parallel to markets, this is the same rate of convergence of private goods markets to- wards efficiency as competition grows.
lrry | The structure of game theoretic equilibrium is quite subtle and thus our rigorous mathematical proof of this result is long and technical. How- ever, taking the approximations that we rigor- ously prove hold in this case to hold, appropri- ately adjusted, in other cases and using numeri- cal methods, allows analysis of QV for other en- vironments. In Chandar and Weyl (2017) one of us, with another co-author, considers the base- line model in smaller populations for a range of distributions numerically and finds that the wel- fare lost from QV relative to the optimum is very small (rarely more than a few percentage points) while that lost under 1p1v may easily be near one hundred percent.
hvhm | In Weyl (2017) one of us uses these approxi- mations to allow for collusion, uncertainty about the value distribution and the possibility that vot- ers are not perfectly rational and consequential- ist. In some of these settings QV performs better than in our baseline and it rarely has more than a very small welfare loss, again in contrast to 1p1v. Furthermore, laboratory experiments on QV (Goeree and Zhang, 2017; Cárdenas et al., 2014) are largely consistent with these robust- ness conclusions. While participants do not play precisely as game theoretic equilibrium would predict, votes are generally linearly proportional to values with some noise, leading to outcome much closer to optimal than 1p1v.
863b | Each of these results has important limitations on its own; some are in stylized, or specific ex-
fj24 | perimental, settings, while others are approxi- mate or numerical. Together, however, we be- lieve they suggest significant promise as they illustrate the robustness of this simple yet (ap- proximately) optimal voting rule. This contrasts with other voting rules which are either optimal, but widely seen as too fragile to apply in prac- tice, or which do not aim at optimality.
uz3c | In the first category, the most famous pro- posal was Vickrey's original scheme as refined by Clarke (1971) and Groves (1973), the first fully optimal mechanism. However, this ap- proach is extremely sensitive to collusion by even a very small group (Ausubel and Milgrom, 2005). It also requires large and highly uncer- tain expenditures of money that make it heavily dependent on using real money rather than voice credits (Greenberg et al., 1977), a possibility that may be unjust given the inequality of wealth in most societies (Laurence and Sher, 2017; Ober, 2017). As noted in our introduction, to address these problems, Groves and Ledyard (1977) and Hylland and Zeckhauser (1980) proposed mech- anism closely related to QV, but only applica- ble to continuous public goods problems, which rarely arise in practical applications. Other op- timal mechanisms proposed in the literature are even less robust (Weyl, 2017). Given this, prac- tical attention has primarily focused on mecha- nisms that do not aspire to even approximate op- timality, such as ones that do not allow expres- sion of preference intensity (Brams and Fish- burn, 1978) or are like QV but with a linear costly voting function (Casella, 2005; Hortala- Vallve, 2012) and thus induce dictatorship of the most intense voters.
d5bi | QV aims to combine the simplicity and practi- cality of this latter group of designs with an ap- proximation to the optimality of the first. This has allowed applications to polling and survey research (Quarfoot et al., 2017; Holland, 2017), where evidence from initial studies shows sig- nificant improvements over existing methods of preference elicitation. Higher-stakes applica- tions to politics (Posner and Weyl, 2015) or cor- porate governance (Posner and Weyl, 2014) re- main far more speculative and are not advis- able without further experimentation at smaller scales.
ba4l | IV. Radical Democracy, Radical Markets
ffx8 | However, cautious but increasingly ambitious experimentation seem warranted given the po- tential of QV to create a truly radical democ- racy in several senses. First, and most mechani- cally, QV may also be viewed as individuals re- ceiving votes equal to the square root or radi- cal of the voice credits they spend. Second, QV gets to the roots of what the framers of mod- ern democratic institutions, such as Alexander Hamilton, the Marquis de Condorcet and Jeremy Bentham, viewed as the aim of democracy: to ensure the state serves the general happiness of the people maximally. Third, QV radically ex- pands the rights of citizens to fully and freely ex- press their political views, liberating them from the straight jacket of 1p1v influence rationing. In this sense, it shows how mechanism design can suggest fundamental and yet also practical reforms of social institutions.
