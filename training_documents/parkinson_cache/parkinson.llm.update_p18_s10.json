        "content": "nsi3 | Eight. Future Directions:\nnil3 | LRRK2 regulates the SV cycle by interacting with endolysosomal system proteins that are also implicated in Parkinson's disease: auxilin, Synaptojanin-1, and endophilin A. LRRK2 overactivity phosphorylates auxilin in its clathrin binding domain, making their interaction weaker. This leads to disruption of SV endocytosis. This was noted in patient induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons, along with accumulation of oxidized dopamine, increased alpha-synuclein levels, and decreased Glucocerebrosidase one activity.\n68a1 | Hyperphosphorylation of endophilin A and Synaptojanin-1 by LRRK2 significantly altered synaptic endocytosis. A recent study showed that LRRK2 can directly bind to clathrin-light chains through its GTPase domain, affecting Rac1-mediated endosomal dynamics. LRRK2 also perturbs synaptic exocytosis through phosphorylation of N-ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor which upregulates SNARE disassembly. Furthermore, LRRK2 is highly expressed in dorsal striatal medium spiny neurons, the postsynaptic compartment of nigrostriatal pathway. G2019S mutation of LRRK2 lead to abnormally high activity of medium spiny neurons and morphological perturbations during development. Abnormal synaptogenesis and dopamine receptor activation in the developing medium spiny neurons mediated by dysfunctional protein kinase A was seen in LRRK2 R1441C mutation. These defects can permanently modify the circuit structure and function, predisposing the individuals to both motor and non-motor dysfunctions of Parkinson's disease. LRRK2 mutation-mediated endocytosis defects were noted predominantly in these medium spiny neurons, along with nigral dopaminergic neurons and not in cortical or hippocampal neurons. This suggests a heightened vulnerability in the endolysosomal system of nigrostriatal circuit for LRRK2 mutations.\nseik | Increased LRRK2 kinase activity mediated elevation of exocytosis may also be relevant for cell-to-cell transfer of misfolded alpha-synuclein. LRRK2 can selectively recruit to overloaded lysosomes and divert undegraded materials out of the kidney cells, along with secretion of alpha-synuclein from endosomes. Studies also demonstrate heightened uptake of alpha-synuclein fibrils through endocytosis in the presence of pathogenic LRRK2. However, LRRK2's role in prion-like spreading of alpha-synuclein remains speculative, until confirmation that similar mechanisms exist in neurons.\noq7c | Clinical description and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease has changed little since James Parkinson's characterization of the disease two hundred years ago. In the nineteen sixties, identification of dopamine deficiency as the cause of motor abnormalities led to symptomatic relief for patients. Though some success has been noted with deep brain stimulation, we are still relying on symptomatic relief. The last three decades of basic research have enriched our understanding of Parkinson's disease's cellular and molecular mechanisms, bringing tangible hope for disease modifying treatment strategies. Identification of risk genes and conceptual shifts in our understanding through genetic models point to the endolysosomal system dysfunction as the key mediator of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Further strengthening this concept, Parkinson's disease pathogenesis appears to begin at synaptic terminals where endo and exocytotic machinery is most active and where alpha-synuclein and LRRK2 exert their\nz4mi | effects through the endolysosomal system and vice-versa. Studies so far suggest that altered flux through the endolysosomal system in nigral dopaminergic neurons that have lesser threshold for degeneration is the key trigger for neurodegeneration. Moving forward, critical elucidation of the mechanisms behind sorting, trafficking, and recycling defects demands detailed studies of auxilin and other DNAJ family proteins, along with Synaptojanin-1, endophilin A, and the retromer complex. Studying these genes will also provide crucial insights into less explored roles of synaptic autophagy, axonal transport, and clathrin-independent endocytosis in Parkinson's disease. Recent surveys of Parkinson's disease patients note preservation of cognitive functioning as a major unmet need. Further investigation of GBA mutations implicated in Parkinson's disease is a promising avenue considering GBA's known involvement in cognitive disorders like Dementia with Lewy Bodies. Along with GBA, studying ATP13A2 and other lysosomal genes will enrich our understanding of lysosomal dysfunction, potentially bringing us closer to repurposing drugs used in Lysosomal Storage Disorders for Parkinson's disease. Affirming ongoing clinical trials targeting autophagy, alpha-synuclein, and LRRK2, an enhanced understanding of endolysosomal system-mediated pathogenesis will prove crucial in developing novel treatment strategies and diagnostic tools for Parkinson's disease.\njai3 | P D Parkinson's disease\np57i | S Npc Substantia Nigra pars compacta\nu5ug | E-L\ni9k5 | Endolysosomal\n20z2 | M six P\n4cgs | Mannose-six-phosphate\nhtre | T G N\nda3c | Trans-Golgi Network\n890q | C M E\njomo | Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis\n06fi | ESCRT\nhb4s | Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport\ncqq2 | ILVs Interluminal Vesicles\n1ews | MVBs Multivesicular Bodies\nafyn | CCVs Clathrin Coated Vesicles\n8sye | GAK\nr04h | Cyclin G Associated Kinase\norpr | GBA\nk36m | Glucosidase Beta Acid\nwnuz | D C Vs\nsy14 | Dense Core Vesicles\nghss | LRRK2\n3s61 | Leucine-rich repeat kinase two Parkinson's disease gene\ns3rm | PARK PRKN Parkin\npqxb | SNCA Alpha-synuclein gene\n08qc | G W A S Genome Wide Association Study\nhdj2 | SVs Synaptic Vesicles\na57g | PI four comma five P two Phosphatidylinositol four comma five-bisphosphate\ng8m3 | L-dopa Levodopa\na9av | K O Knockout\n73l3 | RME-eight Receptor Mediated Endocytosis eight\nornm | SYNJ1 slash SynJ one Synaptojanin-one\nu2z1 | PIPs Phosphoinositide Phosphates\natmh | ATP13A2 ATPase cation transporting thirteen A2\n7hgg | PINK1 P T E N Induced Putative Kinase one\nxwsv | V P S Vacuolar Protein Sorting\n756b | LAMP two a Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoprotein two\n6bx7 | AMPA a-Amino-three-hydroxy-five-methyl-four-isoxazolepropionic acid\nspl6 | G D Gaucher Disease\n7wzm | Gcase one Glucocerebrosidase one\ne9xj | GlcCer Glucosylceramide\n9vl6 | SNARE Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein Receptors\nc2fd | HSPGs Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans\njzvp | USP nineteen Ubiquitin Carboxyl-Terminal Hydrolase nineteen\nf71y | MAPK slash ERK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase slash Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase\n31e1 | GTPase Guanosine Triphosphatase\n40ry | PI four comma five P two Phosphatidylinositol four comma five-bisphosphate\nd1j2 | Hsc seventy Heat Shock Cognate seventy\nwstc | SÃ®RNA small interfering Ribonucleic acid\nba1e | iPSCs induced Pluripotent Stem Cells\nen95 | HSP forty Heat Shock Protein forty\nl3do | MSNs Medium Spiny Neurons",
