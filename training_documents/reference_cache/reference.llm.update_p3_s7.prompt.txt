You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

xxr8 | Other changes have been accelerating as well. For example, reference tools traditionally provided in print reference resources and housed in libraries are now readily available in bundled digital collec- tions (like CREDO Reference, Gale eBooks, and Oxford Reference). The digitization of millions of print books in mass digital collections (such as Google Books, Internet Archive, and the HathiTrust Digital Library) provides 24/7 direct access to scholarly resources-saving mass amounts of shelving space. The creation of a staggering amount of new web and digitized content13 over the last two decades has resulted in the rise of massive online repositories, such as the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA).14 Additionally, library access to print reference resources came to a complete halt when most

8mp0 | Recommending and interpreting print and online information sources continues to play a pivotal role in reference work in the twenty-first century, but intermediators of all types need to understand the information ecosystems with which they work so they are better able to help users locate needed information.17 Information professionals use this knowledge to develop and maintain subject guides, pathfinders, LibGuides, and more. These types of aids, for example, were instrumental in providing information on demand about COVID-19 when the pandemic first struck.18 Similarly, school librarians and media specialists developed Bitmoji virtual libraries as a fun and visual method of optimizing dis- covery tools to aid their students in locating needed information for class assignments when school libraries were closed.19
xjyk | Virtual Reference Tools
mt0f | The pace of technological change in the last quarter century has increasingly diversified and decentralized the ways that information services are offered; and this Check This Out has only accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic. To learn more about how libraries adapted their reference services in response to the pandemic, check out Appendix 13.1 COVID-19 Impact on Reference Services in Part IV: Chapter 13 of the Online Supplement. Reference help that was first only provided in person and then by phone can now also be delivered via email, chat, text,20 social media, and more. Additionally, ac- cess to information has become easier with the use of personal devices and software solutions such as smartphones and tablets, cloud computing, and app technologies. Users and information intermediators can also access a variety of new reference tools, including algorithm-based search engines, database search features, and citation tools to help answer questions (see also Chapter 17: Accessing Informa- tion Anywhere and Anytime: Access Services).
awab | Because information is more accessible to the public, digital reference sources no longer neces- sarily require information intermediation.21 Powerful online tools like search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, Yahoo!, Swisscows, DuckDuckGo, and WolframAlpha) provide easy access to everything from web- based images and books to maps, videos, patents, and even computational knowledge. As a result, ready reference questions, such as the resale value of a full-size 2015 Ford F-150 pickup truck in the Kelley Blue Book22 or content for a fifth-grader's class project on California missions, can now be easily obtained 24/7 online. These new tools assist patrons and information professionals alike by also providing Check This Out value by finding answers to more complex questions.23 However, this has also resulted in a self-service society where people with internet access routinely conduct their own unmediated online searches.24
ixcc | Expanded access to online information has had two unintended consequences. First, easy access to online tools has resulted in the decline of reference
8p6h | questions in general and ready reference questions in particular.25 Secondly, people on the other side of the digital divide have become increasingly informationally disadvantaged and disenfranchised, which became critically apparent when many people's access to the internet was restricted due to school and library closures in 2020 during the pandemic.26 End users without access to the internet continue to face challenges to accessing reliable and appropriate information to meet their formation needs.
pmgl | On a different note, the advent of seamless and multimodal virtual reference tools has provided users with multichannel points of entry to hubs of information. Virtual reference services, sometimes called digital or mobile reference services, have ex- 66 Web-based applications on smartphones and other mobile de- vices provide users with additional mobility, and the global reach and 24/7 anytime/anywhere point-of- need access of these new tools mean that reference services are not place bound. tended the reach of traditional reference services by offering users synchronous and asynchronous computer-mediated reference services via email, chat/instant messaging (IM), texting/short mes- sage service (SMS), voice chat and cloud-based vid- eoconferencing, and more. Web-based applications on smartphones and other mobile devices provide users with additional mobility, and the global reach " and 24/7 anytime/anywhere point-of-need access of these tools mean that reference services are not place bound.27 These tools proved invaluable to information intermediators for providing reference services at a distance during the pandemic.
