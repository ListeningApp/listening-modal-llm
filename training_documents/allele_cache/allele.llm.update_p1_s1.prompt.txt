You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

5bq3 | Sequence variants in gene regulatory regions alter gene expression and contribute to phe- notypes of individual cells and the whole organism, including disease susceptibility and progression. Single-nucleotide variants in enhancers or promoters may affect gene tran- scription by altering transcription factor binding sites. Differential transcription factor binding in heterozygous genomic loci provides a natural source of information on such regulatory variants. We present a novel approach to call the allele-specific transcription factor binding events at single-nucleotide variants in ChIP-Seq data, taking into account the joint con- tribution of aneuploidy and local copy number variation, that is estimated directly from variant calls. We have conducted a meta-analysis of more than 7 thousand ChIP-Seq experiments and assembled the database of allele-specific binding events listing more than half a million entries at nearly 270 thousand single-nucleotide polymorphisms for several hundred human transcription factors and cell types. These polymorphisms are enriched for associations with phenotypes of medical relevance and often overlap eQTLs, making candi- dates for causality by linking variants with molecular mechanisms. Specifically, there is a special class of switching sites, where different transcription factors preferably bind alter- native alleles, thus revealing allele-specific rewiring of molecular circuitry.

rsbu | S equence variants located in noncoding genome regions attract an increasing researchers' attention due to the fre- quent association with various traits, including predisposi- tion to diseases1,2. Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in gene regulatory regions may affect gene expression3 by altering binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) in gene promoters and enhancers and, consequently, efficiency of transcription4.
magd | On the one hand, parallel reporter assays allow massive assessment of variants in terms of gene expression alteration5,6 but do not reveal particular TFs involved. On the other hand, there are multiple ways to assess if a single-nucleotide substitu- tion changes TF-binding affinity, from detailed measurements of the TF affinity landscape in vitro7,8 to conventional experiments on individual sequence
tb74 | variants9,10 and computational modeling11-13. However, it is not trivial to utilize these data for annotating SNV effects at the genome-wide scale in a cell type- specific manner.
8l69 | The functional effect of single-nucleotide substitutions can be studied in heterozygous chromosome loci, where TFs differen- tially bind to sites in homologous chromosomes with alternative SNV alleles. Reliable evidence comes from modern in vivo methods based on chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq). ChIP-Seq provides a deep read coverage of TF-binding regions, and non-perfect alignments of reads often carry single-nucleotide mismatches arising from heterozygous sites. Statistical biases between the numbers of mapped reads containing alternative SNV alleles reveal the so-called allele-specific binding events1,14 (ASB, Fig. 1a).
1jyv | Chromatin accessibility often serves as a proxy for the reg- ulatory activity of a genomic region15. Massive assessment of allele-specific chromatin accessibility in more than 100 cell types16 reported more than 60 thousand of significantly imbal- anced sites. Yet, so far, only 10-20 thousand ASBs were reported per study (Supplementary Table 1), and the potentially vast landscape of allele-specific TF binding remains mostly unexplored.
olce | Reliable identification of ASBs (the ASB calling) requires high read coverage at potential sites, which results either from deep sequencing of individual ChIP-Seq libraries or from data aggre- gation across multiple experiments. Reprocessed ChIP-Seq data for hundreds of TFs and cell types are available in databases such as GTRD17 and ReMap18, opening a way to an integrative meta- analysis, which could yield raw statistical power to detect cell type- and TF-specific ASBs.
erx1 | Straightforward meta-analysis of the ASBs has two major limitations. First, many ChIP-Seq data sets are obtained in aneuploid cell lines, and copy-number variants (CNVs) are common even for normal diploid cells. Both the chromosome multiplication and local CNVs affect the expected read coverage of the respective genomic regions19 and bring about imbalanced read counts at SNVs, possibly generating false-positive ASB calls (Fig. 1a). There exist strategies to reduce this bias (Supplementary Table 2), in particular, the known CNV regions can be filtered out20 or predicted from a computational analysis of the corre- sponding genomic DNA21,22 (which is often used as the ChIP- Seq control sample) and incorporated in statistical criteria when evaluating the potential ASB calls19. However, in many published experiments, the input DNA data control was omitted in favor of other controls, such as preimmune IgG, or had a limited sequencing depth making it useless for CNV predictions. Fur- thermore, currently, there are no systematic data on global (chromosome duplications) and local (CNVs) structural varia- tions across all cell types with public ChIP-Seq data on TFs. Even when the external data on structural variation are available for particular cells, it is not guaranteed that the same estimates would
b3bt | be valid for ChIP-Seq data obtained elsewhere, since long- cultivated immortalized cell lines might keep accumulating unreported differences in genome dosage across chromosomes23.
0w8m | The second major problem in ASB calling is the so-called reference read mapping bias21,24. Standard read alignment tools generally map more reads to the alleles present in the reference genome assembly, as such mapping has lower or no mismatch penalties. To account for the reference read mapping bias, an ideal scenario involves mapping to individually reconstructed genomes22,25 or computational simulations20 that provide esti- mates of mapping probabilities to alternative alleles separately for each SNV (see Supplementary Table 2 for an overview). Yet, these solutions are not applicable to premade read alignments (which are usually obtained with a simple reference genome) and hardly applicable to understudied cell types or particular samples that do not provide enough data to reconstruct an individual genome.
vcu3 | In this work, we present a novel framework for ASB calling from existing read alignments or premade variant calls, accounting for the allelic dosage of aneuploidy and CNVs, and read mapping bias. With this framework, we have performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to identify ASBs in the human ChIP-Seq data from the GTRD database17. The database of Allelic Dosage-corrected Allele-Specific human Transcription factor binding sites (ADASTRA, http://adastra.autosome.ru) provides ASB events across 674 human TFs (including epigenetic factors) and 337 cell types. We demonstrate that the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with ASBs often overlap expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and exhibit associations with various normal and pathologic traits. A comparison of data for multiple TFs highlights the cases where different TFs pre- ferentially bind to different alleles, i.e., when a single-nucleotide substitution can change an entry point of the involved regulatory pathway. Finally, we discuss selected cases where the ASB at SNPs reveals molecular mechanisms of associations between SNPs and important medical phenotypes.
