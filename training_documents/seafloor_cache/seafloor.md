## Mineralization and Alteration of a Modern Seafloor Massive Sulfide Deposit Hosted in Mafic Volcaniclastic Rocks

Abstract

Tinakula is the first seafloor massive sulfide deposit described in the Jean Charcot troughs and is the first such deposit described in the Solomon Islands-on land or the seabed. The deposit is hosted by mafic (basaltic-andesitic) volcaniclastic rocks within a series of cinder cones along a single eruptive fissure. Extensive mapping and sampling by remotely operated vehicle, together with shallow drilling, provide insights into deposit geology and especially hydrothermal processes operating in the shallow subsurface. On the seafloor, mostly inactive chimneys and mounds cover an area of approximately seventy-seven thousand square meters and are partially buried by volcaniclastic sand. Mineralization is characterized by abundant barite- and sulfide-rich chimneys that formed by low-temperature (less than two hundred fifty degrees Celsius) venting over approximately five thousand six hundred years. Barite-rich samples have high SiO2, lead, and mercury contents; the sulfide chimneys are dominated by low iron sphalerite and are high in cadmium, germanium, antimony, and silver. Few high-temperature chimneys, including zoned chalcopyrite-sphalerite samples and rare massive chalcopyrite, are rich in arsenic, molybdenum, indium, and gold (up to nine point two six parts per million), locally as visible gold. Below the seafloor, the mineralization includes buried intervals of sulfide-rich talus with disseminated sulfides in volcaniclastic rocks consisting mainly of lapillistone with minor tuffaceous beds and autobreccias. The volcaniclastic rocks are intensely altered and variably cemented by anhydrite with crosscutting sulfate (plus minor sulfide) veins. Fluid inclusions in anhydrite and sphalerite from the footwall (to nineteen point three meters below seafloor; meters b.s.f.) have trapping temperatures of up to two hundred ninety-eight degrees Celsius with salinities close to, but slightly higher than, that of seawater (two point eight to four point five weight percent sodium chloride equivalent). These temperatures are ten to twenty degrees Celsius lower than the minimum temperature of boiling at this depth (one thousand seventy to one thousand two hundred four meters below sea level; meters b.s.l.), suggesting that the highest-temperature fluids boiled below the seafloor. The alteration is distributed in broadly conformable zones, expressed in order of increasing depth and temperature as montmorillonite/nontronite, nontronite plus corrensite, illite/smectite plus pyrite, illite/smectite plus chamosite, and chamosite plus corrensite. Zones of argillic alteration are distinguished from chloritic alteration by large positive mass changes in K2O (enriched in illite/smectite), magnesium oxide (enriched in chamosite and corrensite), and iron three oxide (enriched in pyrite associated with illite/smectite alteration). The delta eighteen O and OD values of clay minerals confirm increasing temperature with depth, from one hundred twenty-four to two hundred fifty-six degrees Celsius, and interaction with seawater-dominated hydrothermal fluids at high water/rock ratios. Leaching of the volcanic host rocks and thermochemical reduction of seawater sulfate are the primary sources of sulfur, with delta thirty-four S values of sulfides, from negative zero point eight to three point four, and those of sulfate minerals close to seawater sulfate, from nineteen point three to twenty-two point five.

The mineralization and alteration at Tinakula are typical of a class of ancient massive sulfide deposits hosted mainly by permeable volcaniclastic rocks with broad, semiconformable alteration zones. Processes by which these deposits form have never been documented in modern seafloor massive sulfide systems, because they mostly develop below the seafloor. Our study shows how hydrothermal fluids can become focused within permeable rocks by progressive, low-temperature fluid circulation, leading to a large area (greater than one hundred fifty thousand square meters) of alteration with reduced permeability close to the seafloor. In our model, overpressuring and fracturing of the sulfate- and clay-cemented volcaniclastic rocks produced the pathways for higher-temperature fluids to reach the seafloor, present now as sulfate-sulfide veins within the footwall. In the geologic record, the sulfate (anhydrite) is not preserved, leaving a broad zone of intense alteration with disseminated and stringer sulfides typical of this class of deposits.

et al., 2005). In extensional volcanic arc and back-arc envi- ronments, VMS deposits are typically hosted by volcanic suc- cessions including both clastic and coherent rock types (cf. Franklin et al., 2005; Hannington et al., 2005; Galley et al., 2007). Volcanic facies play a first-order control on the sizes and shapes of the deposits, the flow of hydrothermal fluids, and the nature of the footwall alteration zones. Coherent lavas that formed by effusive eruptions are relatively impermeable,


## Introduction

Volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits have been classified according to host-rock lithology, bulk composition, and tectonic setting.

and hydrothermal fluids tend to be focused along faults with minimal influx of cold seawater and form discordant pipe-like alteration zones. In contrast, volcaniclastic-dominated strata have high permeability and porosity, promoting lateral fluid flow, widespread mixing with seawater, and broadly stratiform alteration zones. There are numerous examples of ancient volcaniclastic-hosted volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits, including the Mattabi deposit in the Sturgeon Lake Caldera Complex, Canada, the Horne and Bouchard-Hebert deposits in the Noranda mining district, Canada, the Boundary deposit in the Newfoundland Appalachians, Canada, and the Rosebery deposit in the Mount Read Volcanics belt of western Tasmania. In these deposits, the massive sulfide orebodies occur as stratiform lenses that are interpreted to form in whole or in part below the seafloor. Underlying the massive sulfide lenses, stringer mineralization is vertically restricted, occurring as semiconformable zones of disseminated sulfide mineralization. In the immediate footwall of the volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits, zones of diffuse pipe-like alteration occur along synvolcanic faults, consisting of extreme leaching, silica mobility, and iron metasomatism. Typical alteration assemblages are sericite and chlorite, occurring as matrix cement and pervasive replacement of glass-rich clasts. These diffuse pipe-like zones merge outward into more widespread semiconformable alteration zones. The geometry of these zones can be distinguished using oxygen isotope mapping, where increasing eight one eight O values of altered rocks are associated with decreasing temperatures of hydrothermal activity. Importantly, silicified horizons tend to form near the seafloor, acting as impermeable caps that isolate high-temperature circulation from shallow, low-temperature hydrothermal regimes. This highlights the importance of early hydrothermal processes, such as silicification, in controlling the pathways of subsequent fluid flow. While hydrothermal fluid flow regimes and associated alteration processes are well studied in the ancient rock record, these processes are largely unknown in modern settings due to a lack of seafloor drilling to investigate the third dimension of these systems.

The Tinakula seafloor massive sulfide deposit is the first identified modern analog of a mafic volcaniclastic-dominated deposit of the type described by Morton and Franklin. It is located in the Jean Charcot troughs in the northern New Hebrides back arc, centered at one six seven degrees three six minutes five zero seconds east and one two degrees one two minutes one zero seconds south. This part of the Jean Charcot troughs is characterized by enhanced magmatism where regional structures, including the east-west-trending Tikopia fracture zone, extend into the back arc. The transition from the arc to the back arc is marked by an abrupt change from tectonic extension associated with normal faulting to magmatic-tectonic extension where dike-fed lavas have erupted along linear fissures. Unlike hydrothermal systems in many deep back-arc basins, which are localized along mid-ocean ridge-type spreading centers, hydrothermal activity at Tinakula is focused along a row of young mafic cinder cones on the flank of the Starfish stratovolcano. Cinder cones are common volcanic landforms but have not been widely described on the modern seafloor. These features form from the buildup of volcanic tephra associated with Strombolian-style eruptions, i.e., fire-fountaining. Submarine pyroclastic deposits associated with fire-fountaining eruptions have been described in the ancient rock record. This style of eruption may be more common in arc-proximal settings where mafic magmas have higher water contents compared to those in other tectonic settings.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive three-dimensional study of an actively forming massive sulfide deposit, with seafloor and subseafloor components, in a nascent back-arc setting dominated by bimodal mafic volcaniclastic rocks. We investigate how features of the volcaniclastic substrate have influenced the mineralization and alteration at Tinakula, including the possible roles of boiling, fluid mixing, duration of hydrothermal activity, host-rock compositions, and magmatic contributions to the hydrothermal system.


## Regional Geology and Exploration History

The Jean Charcot troughs in the northern New Hebrides, Vanuatu-Solomon Islands, constitute one of the youngest back arcs in the world, forming only approximately four million years ago in response to eastward subduction and rollback of the Indo-Australian plate beneath the Pacific plate. Unlike the simple graben morphologies of other young back-arc rifts, such as the Coriolis troughs to the south, back-arc extension in the Jean Charcot troughs is characterized by a complex series of horst-and-graben structures that are widely spaced up to approximately one hundred twenty kilometers from the arc front and have variable orientations. Seafloor depths range from approximately eight hundred to three thousand six hundred meters below sea level, and individual grabens range from twenty to sixty-five kilometers long and five to fifteen kilometers wide. The Jean Charcot troughs are bound to the south by the Hazel Holme fracture zone, a seismically active ridge that is considered to be an extensional zone related to the opening of the North Fiji basin. A second east-west-trending extensional zone, Tikopia fracture zone, occurs north of the Hazel Holme fracture zone. Like the Hazel Holme fracture zone, the Tikopia fracture zone displays a slow-spreading trough morphology to depths of approximately four thousand two hundred meters below sea level east of Tikopia Island. To the west of this island, the presence of volcanic ridges and aligned seamounts suggests that the basement structure that controls the location of volcanic activity extends at least as far as the volcanic arc. Where the Tikopia fracture zone crosses the back-arc region, there is a notable bathymetric high, interpreted to be recent volcanic complexes that obscure the horst-and-graben morphology of the back arc. The Jean Charcot troughs are separated from the North Fiji basin by the West Tikopia Ridge and the Duff Ridge, which are interpreted to be part of the prerift fossil volcanic arc. There is no consensus on the northern extent of the Jean Charcot troughs, although here we consider these to include the northwest-southeast-trending trough between the Duff Ridge and the Reef Islands. The current rate of extension of the

troughs increases northward from thirty-six to fifty-five millimeters per year to seventy to eighty-one millimeters per year; however, this extension may be distributed over the entire width of the back arc, in which case individual troughs could be opening much more slowly.

high-resolution (fifty meters or better) regional bathymetric data are lacking, and most of the region is unexplored, particularly in the north. The first indication of hydrothermal venting in the Jean Charcot troughs was a methane anomaly detected in the water column near the Starfish seamount during the KAIYO eighty-nine cruise. This anomaly was investigated on the SOLAVENTS cruise, which recovered fresh and

altered rhyodacite samples by dredging and recorded a number of temperature anomalies in the water column near the seafloor. Additional cruises in the area included the SEAPSO Leg two cruise, a GLORIA side-scan sonar survey, and the SOPACMAPS cruise. More recent work has been aimed at exploration for SMS deposits. The Tinakula deposit was discovered by Neptune Minerals, Incorporated, in September twenty eleven during the ASHR Leg two cruise aboard the MV Dorado Discovery. It is located in the Temotu Province within the exclusive economic zone of the Solomon Islands, approximately eight hundred ninety kilometers east-southeast of Guadalcanal. The discovery was initially made by locating the source of a seafloor-hugging hydrothermal plume, followed by dives with a remotely operated vehicle, which located sulfide chimneys. Additional mapping, ROV grab sampling, and shallow drilling occurred during four subsequent twenty eleven to twenty twelve cruises.


## Host Rocks, Volcanology, and Structure

The Tinakula SMS deposit is located at depths of one thousand seventy to one thousand two hundred four meters below sea level on the flank of the Starfish stratovolcano. The geology of the Tinakula area has been interpreted from seafloor observations and sampling during ROV dives,

drill core logging, and analysis of newly acquired high-resolution (twenty centimeters) bathymetry. The bathymetry details reveal a strong structural control on volcanic and hydrothermal features.

Volcanoes in the Tinakula area are composed of basaltic andesite (fifty-three point four to fifty-seven point three weight percent silicon dioxide) and dacite (sixty-three point zero to sixty-seven point nine weight percent silicon dioxide) and include composite cones, cinder cones, and the submarine equivalent of maars (craters without cones). The morphologies of these edifices are broadly similar to those of subaerial volcanoes, but the edifices are consistently smaller than their subaerial equivalents. In the central part of the map area, the volcanic cones are aligned along a large (approximately one point six kilometers long) north-south-trending fissure. The southern part of the fissure is dominated by a large composite cone with bimodal lava flows and blocky volcanic talus. This is followed northward by a nine hundred meter-long row of cinder cones, on which the deposit is centered, and two small maar-like craters at the northern end of the fissure. The volcanic material making up the cinder cones consists of variably altered basaltic andesite with vertical and lateral facies variations over several meters, including changes in clast size, shape, composition, and degree of sorting. The breccia facies include the following: (one)


## MINERALIZATION AND ALTERATION OF THE TINAKULA SMS DEPOSIT

monomict breccia characterized by clasts with glassy curviplanar margins, flow-banded phenocrysts, and local jigsaw-fit textures; (two) monomict breccia composed of vesicular volcanic clasts associated with variable amounts of juvenile clasts, glass shards, and crystal fragments and rare blocks or bombs; and (three) polymict breccia associated with mass-flow bedforms with rounded to subangular clasts, ranging from relatively unaltered to completely clay altered clasts. The predominant facies is massive to crudely bedded monomict breccia (lapillistone) with clasts containing up to twenty percent vesicles (uniformly distributed) and no evidence of welding. Basaltic-andesitic lava flows were the last products to be erupted along the row of cinder cones at Tinakula. These facies are consistent with cinder cones on land, which form via Strombolian-type eruptions, progressing from cone-building activity to lava flows during the waning stages as the magma loses most of its gas. Cinder cones of the type at Tinakula are generally considered to be monogenic, having formed during one eruptive cycle over a period of days to months.

Dark-colored mafic(?) volcaniclastic sediment covers most of the map area around the Tinakula deposit, interpreted to be fallout from nearby eruptions. The material ranges from coarse sand- to pebble-sized, with a few larger volcanic fragments or bombs (with elongate vesicles and quenched margins) and no fine ash-sized fraction. The sediment ranges in thickness from one point five to greater than eight meters and is massive to crudely bedded with weak grading. Abundant ripple marks are observed in the sediment, with large-scale dunes (up to seven meters wide and one hundred twenty-four meters long) visible in the bathymetric data.

Two large (fifty-five to eighty-seven meter tall and three hundred twenty-seven to five hundred twelve meter wide) composite cones with dacite lava flows in the northwest corner of the mapped area appear to be unrelated to the central fissure. Large dacitic lava flows in the southwest corner of the map have a distinctly different morphology, with sinuous ridges that are characteristic of channelized flow. The relative ages of the flows are interpreted from ROV dive observations of sediment thickness, with higher degrees of sediment associated with older relative ages. The ages of these flows relative to other eruptions in the area are unknown.


## Deposit Geology

The Tinakula SMS deposit consists of a series of over nine hundred chimneys and mound complexes distributed over a strike length of approximately one thousand fifty meters along the row of cinder cones and composite cones. The chimneys and mounds are located mainly at the tops and along the flanks of the cinder cones, as well as inside the summit craters. They also occur in the center of each of the maar-like craters in the north. West of the row of cinder cones, over a strike length of approximately four hundred meters, the chimneys and mounds are not spatially associated with observable volcanic features at the seafloor but instead appear to occur along two partially buried northeast-southwest and northwest-southeast structures.

The chimneys at Tinakula are less than one to fifteen meters high (typically two to eight meters) and include typical multispired sulfide structures with central vent orifices and, more commonly, chimneys with irregular morphologies (bulbous, drooping, with smooth or popcorn-textured outer surfaces). The bulbous chimneys lack central orifices and have a morphology similar to those of beehives or flange-type chimneys. The chimneys are commonly surrounded by sulfide talus and grow on top of low-relief hydrothermal mounds that typically rise approximately two to three meters from the seafloor. The extent of these mounds is largely unknown due to burial by volcaniclastic sediments, but they appear to make up the bulk of the mineralization at the seafloor, accounting for about two-thirds of the total amount of identified massive sulfide. Individual chimney mound complexes can be traced for up to seventy meters on the seafloor. Where exposed, the mound material is distinctly laminated with layers of barite and sulfide minerals up to zero point five meters thick, and they have unexpectedly smooth surfaces. The layered barite-sulfide mounds are most similar to features described from the East Diamante caldera in the Mariana arc. The sulfide deposits are mostly inactive, and the surrounding volcaniclastic sediment is widely indurated and locally mineralized. Active venting is limited to a few sites with shimmering water at the base of chimneys or along fractures in the indurated sediments, associated with bacterial mats. Venting of white to gray smoke from chimney spires is rare. Fe-Mn oxides are widespread along fractures in the seafloor, extending up to one hundred meters away from the chimney complexes and mounds. Abundant less than one-meter-tall Fe and Mn oxyhydroxide chimneys and silica-rich chimneys are associated with bacterial mats and occur along the fractures.

The surface expression of hydrothermal precipitates covers approximately seventy-seven thousand square meters, including approximately thirteen thousand eight hundred square meters of active chimneys and mounds, fifty-one thousand eight hundred square meters of inactive chimneys and mounds, and nine thousand three hundred square meters of partially buried chimneys and mounds. Areas of low-temperature venting, dominated by iron and manganese oxides, occur over an additional one hundred thirty thousand square meters (ninety-one thousand square meters of iron oxides and thirty-eight thousand square meters of manganese oxides), although these areas commonly overlap those of the chimneys and mounds. The area of subseafloor sulfide mineralization is not completely known, so the full size of the deposit could be much larger. The areal extent of this deposit is significant compared to others discovered along mid-ocean ridges and along arcs and back-arc basins; fewer than ten percent have dimensions larger than five thousand square meters. Modern sulfide deposits with comparable sizes (by area) include the Solwara one deposit in the Eastern Manus basin (ninety thousand square meters) and the Mir zone, Ashadze-one, and Ashadze-two deposits on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (fifty thousand square meters each). It should be emphasized, however, that the large areal footprint of the Tinakula deposit may not necessarily correlate with a large tonnage of massive sulfide.


## Methods

Ship-based multibeam bathymetry operating at fifty kilohertz was collected over six hundred eighty-five point six square kilometers in the Starfish-Tinakula area, and the data were gridded with a cell size of fifty meters. Higher-resolution bathymetry was collected over approximately two point two square kilometers that includes the Tinakula deposit, using an ROV-mounted multibeam system at four hundred kilohertz with inertial navigation and gridded with a cell size of zero point two meters. Bottom observations and grab samples were collected during thirteen ROV dives. Shallow seafloor drilling,

including push-coring and rotary diamond drilling, was carried out using the Benthic Geotech portable remotely operated drill. Approximately two hundred seventy meters of drill core was logged and sampled to establish between-hole correlations along the length of the north-south-trending eruptive fissure (sites A-D). Mineralogical and chemical data are reported here on forty-one ROV grab samples and twenty-one drill core samples of chimney and mound material and on sixty-one drill core samples of clay-altered volcaniclastic rocks. Polished thin sections of the sulfide-sulfate chimney samples and epoxy-impregnated clay-altered volcaniclastic samples were prepared by Dettmar Dissection Technology.

Whole-rock geochemistry was determined on forty-five bulk samples of sulfide-sulfate material and forty-seven samples of fine less than sixty-three micrometer clay-altered volcaniclastic material at Activation Laboratories. For the sulfide samples, a sodium peroxide fusion was used; major elements (aluminum, calcium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, silicon, titanium) were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry and trace elements

(boron, barium, beryllium, bismuth, cadmium, cobalt, cesium, copper, gallium, germanium, indium, lithium, manganese, molybdenum, niobium, nickel, lead, rubidium, tin, strontium, tantalum, thorium, uranium, vanadium, tungsten, yttrium, zinc, and rare earth elements) by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. For the clay-altered samples, a lithium metaborate-tetraborate fusion was used; the major elements (silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, ferric oxide, manganese oxide, magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, sodium oxide, potassium oxide, titanium dioxide, phosphorus pentoxide) were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry, and trace elements (barium, beryllium, bismuth, cobalt, cesium, gallium, germanium, hafnium, indium, molybdenum, niobium, rubidium, strontium, tantalum, thorium, thallium, uranium, vanadium, tungsten, yttrium, zirconium, rare earth elements) by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, with additional elements (silver, cadmium, copper, nickel, lead, zinc) analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry following a total acid digestion technique. In both sample types, cold-vapor atomic absorption spectrometry was used to determine mercury; infrared detection was used to determine total sulfur. Instrumental neutron activation analysis was used to determine gold, silver, arsenic, barium, bromine, chromium, iron, hafnium, iridium, lutetium, sodium, antimony,

scandium, and zinc in the sulfides and gold, arsenic, bromine, chromium, iridium, scandium, selenium, and antimony in the clay-altered samples. Duplicates and standard reference materials were analyzed after every ten to fifteen samples and indicated a precision of better than ten percent and accuracy of better than five percent for most elements in samples where the analytical values are well above the limit of detection, with values degrading rapidly as the limits of detection are approached.

Sulfide mineral compositions were determined in sixteen sulfide-sulfate samples using a JEOL-JXA eight thousand two hundred electron probe microanalyzer equipped with five wavelength dispersive spectrometers and one energy dispersive detector at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel. A fifteen keV accelerating potential and fifty-nanoampere probe (cup) current were used for the analyses. Standards used were chalcopyrite (iron Ka, sulfur Ka, copper Ka), rhodonite (manganese Ka) gallium arsenide

(gallium La, arsenic Kb), sphalerite (zinc Ka), silver telluride (silver La), indium antimonide (indium La, antimony La), cadmium sulfide (cadmium La), gold (gold La), cinnabar (mercury Ma), and galena (lead Ma).

Alteration mineralogy was determined by X-ray diffraction analysis of bulk samples of the altered footwall rocks. Fine less than sixty-three micrometer and coarse greater than sixty-three micrometer fractions were separated by wet sieving, followed by separation into silt (two to sixty-three micrometer) and clay less than two micrometer by settling in cylinders of standing water, following the technique of Moore and Reynolds. The mineralogy of the less than two-micrometer clay fraction from fifty-eight samples was determined using a Philips PW seventeen hundred ten X-ray diffractometer, equipped with a cobalt tube and an automatic divergence slit and monochromator, located at GEOMAR. Operating conditions were forty kilovolts and thirty-five milliampere. Oriented mounts were prepared by wet suspension followed by air drying and were measured with a two-theta scanning angle of three to forty degrees at a scan rate of one second per zero point zero one degree step. Samples were then saturated with ethylene glycol following a standard vaporization technique and reanalyzed. MacDiff version four point two point six software was used for mineral identification and display of the X-ray diffraction data.

Five samples consisting of hydrothermally altered and sulfate-cemented volcaniclastic material were selected from drill hole TKAD zero zero one for fluid inclusion studies. Doubly polished thick sections (approximately one hundred thirty micrometers) were prepared at Dettmar Dissection Technology using a water-free technique. Fluid inclusion petrography in barite, anhydrite, and sphalerite is described in detail in Anders two thousand sixteen. Microthermometric measurements were made on a Linkam™M THMS six hundred heating and freezing stage at GEOMAR. Salinities were calculated from freezing-point depression values following Bodnar and Vityk nineteen ninety-four. Homogenization temperatures were corrected for pressure at the sample depth (one thousand one hundred seven point six one meters below sea level; one hundred eight point six five bar) following Zhang and Frantz nineteen eighty-seven. Accuracy was determined by measuring phase transitions in synthetic fluid inclusions (Syn Flinc®); replicate measurements of homogenization and freezing-point depression temperatures were performed every five to ten analyses, resulting in estimated errors of less than ±zero point two degrees Celsius for salinity measurements and ±four degrees Celsius for homogenization temperature measurements. The critical points, bulk molar volumes, densities, and isochores were calculated using the program FLINCOR (Brown, nineteen eighty-nine).

Oxygen and hydrogen isotope analyses were performed on fourteen samples of monomineralic clays, less than two micrometers, free from iron and manganese oxides as determined by XRD. The analyses were carried out by the Queen's Facility for Isotope Research at Queen's University, Ontario, Canada. Oxygen was extracted from five-milligram samples at five hundred fifty to six hundred degrees Celsius using the bromine pentafluoride technique of Clayton and Mayeda. Samples were analyzed via dual inlet on a Thermo-Finnigan DeltaPlus XP isotope ratio mass spectrometer. For hydrogen isotope measurements, samples were weighed into silver capsules, degassed for one hour at one hundred degrees Celsius, and then crushed and loaded into a zero blank autosampler. Hydrogen isotope compositions were measured using a Finnigan thermos-combustion elemental analyzer coupled to a Thermo-Finnigan DeltaPlus XP continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer. All values are expressed in the conventional delta notation as per mil deviation from Vienna-Standard Mean Ocean Water, with analytical precision and accuracy for eighteen O values of plus-minus zero point one per mil and for D of plus-minus three per mil and plus-minus one point five per mil, respectively.

Sulfur isotope measurements were conducted on fifty-seven handpicked mineral separates, including anhydrite, gypsum, barite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite, at the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster, Germany. For thirty-five pure monomineralic samples, the sulfur isotope composition was determined directly without prior chemical treatment, using a Carlo Erba elemental analyzer interfaced to a ThermoFinnigan Delta Plus mass spectrometer. Repeat analyses showed a precision of better than plus-minus zero point three per mil, and standard measurements gave an accuracy of better than plus-minus zero point two per mil. For twenty-two samples of intergrown sulfide-sulfate mineral assemblages, a mineral-specific, wet-chemical pretreatment protocol was applied, yielding four different sulfur phases. Briefly, anhydrite and gypsum were dissolved using a ten percent NaCl solution for twenty-four hours, and dissolved sulfate was precipitated as BaSO4 using standard procedures. BaSOfour precipitates were then converted into silver sulfide using Thode solution, a mixture of hydrogen iodide, hydrochloric acid, and hypophosphorous acid. Sphalerite sulfur was liberated as hydrogen sulfide acid volatile sulfide with hydrochloric acid twenty-five percent for one hour at eighty-five degrees Celsius. Subsequently, disulfides such as chalcopyrite and pyrite were extracted using chromous-chloride solution, chromium-reducible sulfide fraction. Each time, resulting hydrogen sulfide was precipitated first as zinc sulfide using zinc acetate and ultimately as silver sulfide using silver nitrate as described in Canfield et al. and Rice et al.. Following the quantitative removal of all sulfide minerals using acidic hydrochloric acid chromous chloride solution, acid-insoluble sulfate, barite, was liberated as hydrogen sulfide, following Thode and Monster, and ultimately precipitated as silver sulfide. All silver sulfide precipitates, representing water-soluble sulfates such as anhydrite and gypsum, acid-insoluble sulfates such as barite, acid volatile sulfides such as sphalerite, and chromium-reducible sulfides such as chalcopyrite and pyrite, were subjected to fluorination isotope ratio mass spectrometer, following the procedure outlined by Ono et al., using a ThermoScientific Mat two five three mass spectrometer. Results are reported in the standard delta notation as per mil difference relative to Vienna-Canyon Diablo Troilite. Precision and accuracy were better than plus-minus zero point zero three per mil.

The radium-226 barium dating of hydrothermal barite from twenty-three sulfide-sulfate samples was carried out following the methods of Jamieson et al., modified after Ditchburn et al.. Samples were crushed and powdered, with one split used to

determine barium concentrations by instrumental neutron activation analysis and another split used to determine radium-226 activity via gamma spectrometry at the Elemental Tracer Laboratory at the University of Ottawa. The daughter product of radium-226 is radon-222, with a half-life of three point eight days. A daughter isotope from the decay of radon-222, lead-214, was measured as a proxy to avoid peak overlap with uranium-235. Prior to measurements, the sample tubes were sealed for twenty-one days to prevent the escape of radon-222 gas and obtain secular equilibrium between radium-226 and lead-214. Measurements were made using an XLB GWL SV digital gamma spectrometer, containing a high-purity germanium crystal, fifty-four point seven by sixty-six point two millimeters, with an active well depth of forty millimeters. Counting times ranged from two to twelve hours, depending on the activity of radium-226 in each sample. Spectral signatures were calibrated using IAEA three one two reference material and analyzed using a custom program developed and provided by Peter Appleby to correct for background, detector efficiency, sample volumes, and matrix effects. Ages were determined relative to a zero-age end member selected from one of the actively venting chimneys and assumed to represent the initial radium-226 barium ratio, one thousand twenty-two plus-minus sixty-eight becquerels per kilogram wet percent; sample GMA one three dash zero two four. All ages are considered minimum values, as incorporation of young barite in the samples cannot be ruled out.


## Drill Sites

Shallow seafloor drilling was focused along the main north-south trending fissure, sites A through E, targeting areas with accumulations of chimneys and mounds and spatially associated with buried circular structures that may be manifestations of the cinder cones, with an additional site to the west of this structure, site F. Three subseafloor rock types were encountered in most drill holes, in order of increasing depth: unconsolidated volcaniclastic sediment cover sequence, mineralized intervals consisting of mixed chimney talus, and intensely clay altered volcaniclastic material footwall sequence. In addition, several drill holes intersected intervals of oxidized ferruginous mud associated with rounded to subrounded chimney fragments, interpreted to be paleoseafloor horizons.


## Site A

Site A is a local topographic high at the northern end of the row of craters. It rises approximately ten meters above background sediments over an area of approximately one hundred by eighty meters. Chimneys and mounds are distributed around what may be a buried crater, partially covered by volcaniclastic material. The volcaniclastic cover sequence, up to thirteen point eight meters thick, is underlain by zero point seven to two point six meters of chimney talus, followed by intensely clay-altered monomictic lapillistone that is crudely bedded with both matrix-supported and clast-supported intervals, extending to the bottom of the drill holes. The northernmost drill hole, TKAD zero zero one, is located next to an active chimney complex and reaches a depth of twenty two point three meters below seafloor. The upper approximately fourteen meters consists of variably altered volcaniclastic cover material with three discrete oxidized intervals, followed by altered lapillistone. The upper part of the clay-altered lapillistone sequence is unconsolidated to poorly consolidated, with increasing cementation by anhydrite downhole, and is cut by a few anhydrite veins, two to five millimeters wide. Disseminated sulfides (pyrite, sphalerite, and minor chalcopyrite, galena, covellite, and bornite) occur with anhydrite that has been partly hydrated to gypsum, both in the cement and in the vein fill. To the south of this drill hole, TKAD zero fifteen and TKAD zero twenty-seven were drilled in close proximity, approximately three meters apart, to a maximum depth of seven point three meters below seafloor, next to a partially buried chimney complex. The volcaniclastic cover is less than one meter thick and contains fragments of chimney material, likely sourced by mass wasting from nearby (unknown) chimneys. The mineralized interval is an approximately one point five to two point six meter thick layer of chimney talus. As in TKAD zero zero one, intensely clay-altered and poorly sorted lapillistone occurs below the chimney talus in both drill holes. TKAD zero twenty-eight, located approximately twenty meters east of TKAD zero fifteen/zero twenty-seven, intersected zero point five meters of volcaniclastic cover material, followed at depth by a narrow, zero point seven meter, sulfide interval dominated by barite and sphalerite at the top and becoming pyrite rich downhole. This mineralized interval appears to correlate between the drill holes. The clay-altered lapillistone at the bottom of the hole is similar but better sorted than that found in TKAD zero fifteen/zero twenty-seven. Approximately thirty meters to the east, TKAD zero twenty-nine encountered only the variably altered volcaniclastic cover material to a depth of seven point eight meters below seafloor. This drill hole is located at the edge of the low-relief cinder cone where the volcaniclastic cover is thickest.

Site B is another crater-like feature, seventy by eighty meters, on a cone at the north end of the row of cinder cones. Chimneys and mounds occur along the crater walls and on the outer flanks of the cone and are variably covered by volcaniclastic material. Here, massive sulfide chimneys occur on top of chimney talus. At the western edge of the crater, TKAD zero sixteen intersected thin, zero point two meter, volcaniclastic cover, followed by a layer of pyritic chimney talus approximately zero point four meters thick and then poorly sorted and crudely bedded monomict, matrix-supported, and intensely clay-altered lapillistone. The upper part of the lapillistone is cemented mainly by gypsum with a few large crystals up to seven millimeters long; the lower part is mostly unconsolidated with patchy anhydrite cement that has been partially hydrated to gypsum, a few crosscutting veinlets of anhydrite, weak silicification, and disseminated sulfide minerals (pyrite with minor sphalerite near the top and minor to trace chalcopyrite near the bottom). At the southern wall of the crater, TKAD zero twenty-six intersected massive sphalerite-barite chimney material to a depth of one point four meters below seafloor. The substrate of lapillistone contains minor patchy barite cement in the upper part and anhydrite cement in the lower part, with gray-white clay alteration that generally decreases downhole. At the center of the crater, the mineralized interval of chimney talus is thicker, up to approximately three point nine meters, in TKAD zero thirteen, cemented by anhydrite-rich and clay-altered mud and fine-grained sulfide minerals. This interval was not recovered in TKAD zero twenty-five, located approximately three point six meters away, owing to poor drilling conditions. In the center of the crater, intensely clay-altered lapilli with minor disseminated sulfides occur to approximately four meters below seafloor, below which is a chaotic mixture of matrix-supported volcanic and chimney fragments. The volcanic clasts are polymict, altered and unaltered, subangular to angular, and variably infilled by late-stage silica. Several short intervals within the lapilli units contain gypsum crystals up to three centimeters long. On the upper rim of the volcanic cone in the east, a thin, zero point six meter, cover of unconsolidated volcaniclastic material is directly underlain by altered monomict lapillistone, with increasing sulfate cement and decreasing alteration intensity downhole to a depth of seven point four meters below seafloor. At this site, there are fewer disseminated sulfides compared to the other drill holes and decreasing sphalerite abundance downhole.

Site C is a large volcanic cinder cone, rising to approximately seventy meters above the seafloor and with a diameter of approximately one hundred twenty by ninety meters. Chimney complexes and mounds occur on the flank of this cone in the vicinity of a circular slump feature. TKAD zero three two intercepted unconsolidated volcaniclastic cover material to one point eight meters, followed by intensely altered volcaniclastic breccia to six point nine meters b.s.f. The altered sequence consists of monomict lapillistone with subrounded to subangular vesicular clasts but variable clay alteration. The uppermost lapillistone is matrix supported with variable sulfate cement and veins and disseminated pyrite, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite (decreasing downhole). Several horizons are clast supported (up to sixty percent clasts), with angular monomict clasts, and appear to be autobreccias. One gypsum-rich interval occurs at six point four to six point six meters b.s.f. TKAD zero three three was drilled at the edge of a small crater or collapse feature near the summit of the cone. The recovered rock types are similar to those in TKAD zero three two, with a transition between the volcaniclastic cover and the clay-altered footwall occurring at one point one meters b.s.f. Variable alteration intensity gives this rock a polymict appearance.

Site D is an irregularly shaped topographic high, approximately seventy by eighty meters in diameter, in the saddle between two cinder cones. Chimneys occur on the north flank, where there is local venting of milky fluids from fractures near the base of the chimneys. On the northern side of the chimney cluster, TKAD zero one seven intersected unconsolidated volcaniclastic cover material to approximately one point four meters, separated from an interval of chimney talus by a layer of oxidized mud and chimney fragments. The chimney talus extends to a depth of five point two meters b.s.f. but is interrupted by a second layer of oxidized mud at depths of two point six to three point three meters b.s.f. The altered footwall comprises subrounded, matrix-supported, monomict lapilli-sized clasts with minor disseminated pyrite and patchy anhydrite plus gypsum cement that increases downhole to a depth of seven point four meters b.s.f. A few subrounded fragments of chimneys are also found in the footwall. The upper oxidized layer between the cover sequence and the mineralized interval can be traced approximately twenty meters eastward to TKAD zero three zero. The lower oxidized layer was not recovered at TKAD zero three zero; instead, a buried sphalerite-rich chimney was intersected. The drilled sphalerite-rich chimney is underlain by chimney talus, which appears to be continuous with material in TKAD zero one seven. Altered lapillistone to five point three meters b.s.f. consists of several beds that are distinguished by changes in grain size and proportion of clasts to matrix and by a higher proportion of sulfate cement. The two oxidized intervals encountered in TKAD zero one seven were also traced twenty-five meters to the south in TKAD zero three one. The volcaniclastic cover sequence is absent in this drill hole, but a large chalcopyrite- and sphalerite-rich chimney block that likely came from a chimney complex located upslope to the south was drilled. The uppermost layer of chimney talus was similarly encountered here, extending to a similar depth (approximately five meters b.s.f.). The cover sequence is also absent in TKAD zero one eight to the east. This hole started in oxidized chimney talus that is continuous with the uppermost oxidized interval in the other drill holes. The chimney talus here is only approximately zero point six meters thick, grading to the clay-altered footwall at one point two meters b.s.f. The clay-altered lapillistone at this location contains a higher proportion of fine-grained material (tuff). In the southeast, TKAD zero one nine encountered only unconsolidated volcaniclastic cover material (to six point one meters b.s.f.) that accumulated within a topographic low at the periphery of a chimney cluster. Within the thick accumulation of cover material, there are several distinct intervals of intensely oxidized sediment, which may be continuations with the oxidized layers in the other holes.

Site E is on the southernmost cinder cone near several small craters. TKAD zero zero five is near an inactive chimney complex on the eastern margin of the northernmost crater; TKAD zero zero three is on a small ridge south of TKAD zero zero five, near a scarp that may be a crater wall or slump and adjacent to a site of active venting. Both drill holes recovered moderately sorted, clast-supported, monomict lapillistone with weak grading and intense clay alteration. The matrix consists of anhydrite cement with minor disseminated sphalerite and pyrite that decrease in abundance downhole and are locally oxidized to hematite.

Site F is located west of the main north-south-trending fissure, where chimneys and mounds are aligned in a circular pattern, but constructional volcanic features are absent. TKAD zero zero seven was drilled next to a site of active venting in a sequence of clast-supported, clay-altered monomict lapillistone characterized by moderately sorted subangular clasts. The lapillistone is cemented by anhydrite, which increases in abundance downhole and is locally fracture controlled. The breccia also contains minor disseminated pyrite and fracture-controlled patchy iron oxide. A few centimeter-wide pyrite-chalcopyrite veinlets associated with the most intense clay alteration occur at the top of the recovered core. Inactive chimney complexes and mounds surround the area of active venting and appear to be aligned along structural corridors. TKAD zero zero eight is located along one of these northwest-southeast-trending structures, one hundred two meters south of TKAD zero zero seven, on a low-relief ridge with numerous inactive chimney complexes and mounds. The upper part is matrix-supported lapillistone that grades downhole into a clast-supported lapillistone similar to that in TKAD zero zero eight. Increasing clast size and angularity and decreasing alteration intensity downhole suggest that this drill hole may be at the periphery of the main hydrothermal upflow zone.


## Seafloor and Subseafloor Mineralization

Isolated chimney complexes throughout the Tinakula area are most common on steep slopes that have not been completely buried by the volcaniclastic cover. Four main chimney types


## MINERALIZATION AND ALTERATION OF THE TINAKULA S M S DEPOSIT

are recognized: one chalcopyrite-rich, two zoned with variable proportions of chalcopyrite and sphalerite, three sphalerite-rich chimneys, and four barite-rich and/or silica-altered. Unlike the subseafloor breccia facies, the seafloor chimneys contain only minor anhydrite and gypsum. Different chimney types commonly occur together; however, higher-temperature copper-rich chimneys are more abundant near sites A and D, and lower-temperature barite-rich chimneys are common at site B. Mineralized volcanic breccia was recovered from the base of several chimney complexes, where the chimneys have overgrown volcaniclastic material.

The copper-rich chimneys comprise abundant, massive, coarse-grained chalcopyrite with minor pyrite. Locally, minor iron-poor sphalerite and barite line the chimney conduits. In one sample, trace amounts of microscopic gold are present as inclusions in the chalcopyrite. Distinctly zoned chimneys have layers that are chalcopyrite, pyrite with or without marcasite, and sphalerite rich. Both iron-rich and iron-poor sphalerite occur in different layers. The low-iron sphalerite commonly has inclusions of fine-grained lead-arsenic-antimony sulfosalts (jordanite) and minor galena. Late-stage, coarse tabular barite, amorphous silica, and iron oxyhydroxides occupy open spaces.

The zinc-rich chimneys are most abundant and consist of dendritic sphalerite and barite with pyrite and marcasite. These chimneys lack clearly defined vent conduits but have alternating layers of low- and high-iron sphalerite, similar to beehive chimneys that form by diffuse fluid venting. The low-iron sphalerite commonly contains inclusions of jordanite and galena; fine-grained inclusions of chalcopyrite are present at grain boundaries but are rare. Late-stage tabular barite is followed paragenetically by minor amounts of amorphous silica and trace iron and manganese oxyhydroxides. The barite-rich chimneys also form bulbous and beehive-like structures with variable amounts of amorphous silica filling or lining open spaces.

Chalcopyrite and pyrite show little compositional variation, although arsenic is relatively enriched in both pyrite (up to one point four two weight percent) and marcasite (up to two point seven one weight percent). Mercury is also present above detection limits in pyrite, together with lead and antimony. Iron sulfide contents of sphalerite range from zero point zero two to thirteen point nine eight mol percent, with more than fifty percent of the analyses reporting less than two mol percent iron sulfide. The most iron-rich sphalerite is in chalcopyrite-rich assemblages, and the widest range of iron sulfide values occur in the dendritic barite-rich chimneys. Cadmium (up to two point zero four weight percent), indium (up to one point three one weight percent), gallium (up to one point zero three weight percent), and mercury (up to one point two eight weight percent) are likely present in solid solution in the sphalerite. Cadmium concentrations in sphalerite decrease from an average of zero point three three weight percent in the chalcopyrite-rich chimneys to zero point zero three weight percent in the dendritic barite-rich chimneys, suggesting a strong temperature dependence, which is also reflected in the iron content. Galena contains up to one point two three weight percent silver, mainly in the barite-rich chimneys. The lead-arsenic-antimony sulfosalts have up to eleven point nine one weight percent arsenic and zero point two eight weight percent antimony, which is close to those of the arsenic end member of the jordanite-geocronite series.

Bulk compositions of the seafloor chimneys and mineralized volcanic breccias are listed in Table one. The seafloor chimneys contain abundant zinc up to fifty-two point sixty weight percent (average nineteen point twenty weight percent; N equals thirty-six) and copper up to thirty point zero zero weight percent (average five point eighty-two weight percent; N equals thirty-six) but generally low lead (less than zero point zero one to two point ninety-three weight percent lead; average zero point thirty-five weight percent; N equals thirty-six) compared to other modern back-arc basin sulfide deposits. Calcium concentrations are low in the chimneys (average zero point zero six weight percent; N equals thirty-six), but barium (average six point forty-nine weight percent; N equals thirty-six) and strontium (average two thousand one hundred fifty-seven parts per million; N equals thirty-six; up to zero point eighty-five weight percent in barite-rich samples) are high. The silicon dioxide contents average eleven point sixty-seven weight percent (N equals thirty-six), but one chimney contains seventy-five point zero nine weight percent silicon dioxide together with one point seventy-five weight percent barium. The copper-rich chimneys have high molybdenum (average three hundred forty-three parts per million; N equals two) and indium (average two hundred sixty-two parts per million; N equals two), with high gold (nine thousand two hundred sixty parts per billion) present in one sample. The zinc-rich samples contain very high gallium (up to one thousand five hundred forty parts per million), germanium (up to ninety-nine parts per million), mercury (up to ninety-five parts per million), and selenium (up to twenty parts per million). Concentrations of silver, antimony, arsenic, and gold are also higher than in the copper-rich chimneys, although high arsenic is found in both zinc- and copper-rich samples. Mercury concentrations are especially high in samples containing marcasite and late sphalerite plus galena. The four sampled barite-rich chimneys also have high lead (average seven thousand seventy-three parts per million), arsenic (average two hundred ninety-nine parts per million), antimony (average eighty-two parts per million), gold (average two thousand thirty-eight parts per billion), and silver (average one hundred twenty-one parts per million). Statistical correlations between the different trace elements clearly reflect the higher (greater than two hundred fifty degrees Celsius) and lower temperatures (less than two hundred fifty degrees Celsius) of the copper-rich and zinc-rich assemblages, respectively, as well as various lattice substitutions in the corresponding minerals (e.g., cadmium in sphalerite, strontium in barite, arsenic and antimony in lead-rich sulfosalts, etc.). Gallium is incorporated mainly in galena in low-temperature assemblages, whereas in higher-temperature assemblages it mainly resides in sphalerite with moderate to high iron contents. Arsenic is high in low-temperature assemblages, reflecting the presence of arsenic in low-temperature minerals such as galena and sulfosalts. In a single sample containing secondary bornite (chalcopyrite-rich chimney GMA thirteen dash zero ten), silver concentrations are one thousand two hundred fifty-three parts per million. Contents of cobalt, nickel, tin, tungsten, bismuth, and tellurium are generally below detection limits in all samples, unlike other arc-related hydrothermal systems that commonly contain discrete bismuth and tellurium minerals.

Subseafloor mineralization consists of (one) unconsolidated and locally hydrothermally cemented chimney talus, (two) chimney talus, mixed with altered volcanic clasts, that is generally hydrothermally cemented, (three) chimney talus associated with oxidized intervals , (four) disseminated to patchy sulfides (chalcopyrite, pyrite, sphalerite) within altered volcaniclastic rocks, and (five) sulfide minerals associated with late sulfate veins that extend to maximum depths of approximately twenty-one meters below sea level. Drilling shows that the majority of the mineralization at Tinakula comprises chimney talus that occurs directly beneath the unconsolidated volcaniclastic material (generally between zero point six and five point three meters below sea floor). The oxidized intervals contain variable amounts of sulfide material (mostly chimney talus). Disseminated and vein-controlled sulfide (pyrite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite) occur in the upper approximately zero point five to two point six meters of most drill holes. Seven samples of mineralized volcanic breccia down to five point eight meters below sea floor contain mostly pyrite (nine point seven to thirty point one weight percent sulfide sulfur) with minor anhydrite accounting for approximately zero point one to zero point five weight percent sulfate sulfur. Taking into account the dilution from wall rock, mineralized portions of the


## MINERALIZATION AND ALTERATION OF THE TINAKULA S M S DEPOSIT

samples contain slightly higher cobalt and selenium and lower cadmium, mercury, antimony, and silver than the seafloor chimneys, consistent with higher temperatures of mineralization.

Buried sulfide mineralization is estimated to have an area at least three times larger than that of the seafloor chimneys and mounds, although more drilling is required to establish the full extent and continuity.

The chimney talus and oxidized intervals appear continuous between drill holes at sites A, B, and D, but mineralization was not encountered in the two drill holes at site C. Since the drill platform required relatively flat slopes, drilling at this site was limited to the areas beside the known chimney mounds. Therefore, the occurrence of chimney talus below the mounds was not confirmed at the location. The


## Subseafloor Alteration

Below the mineralized interval, the volcaniclastic breccias have been intensely hydrothermally altered, with clay minerals occurring as replacements of volcanic material and infills of pore spaces. The predominant


## MINERALIZATION AND ALTERATION OF THE TINAKULA S M S DEPOSIT

lithology of the footwall is monomict to polymict lapillistone that is crudely bedded with both matrix- and clast-supported horizons. Alteration and late infill by patchy sulfate cement obscures many of the primary volcanic textures, resulting in a high degree of uncertainty regarding facies interpretations. The altered volcaniclastic material extends to maximum drilled depths of twenty-two point three two meters below sea floor; however, the full depth and areal extent of the alteration is unknown, with most of the drilling having been focused along the central row of cinder cones. Alteration minerals in the footwall breccias identified by XRD include dioctahedral smectite, chlorite,

with minor clinochlore, minor chloritoid, illite, and mixed-layer clays: illite/smectite, muscovite/illite, and chlorite/smectite. These minerals constitute five alteration facies that are distinguished in drill core by different colors: one, montmorillonite/nontronite, with yellow-orange, yellow-gray, and red-brown hues; two, nontronite plus corrensite, with greenish-yellow to greenish-gray hues; three, illite/smectite plus pyrite, with yellowish-gray to olive-gray hues; four, illite/smectite plus chamosite, with bluish-white, olive, olive-gray, and greenish-yellow hues; and five, chamosite plus corrensite, with greenish-yellow to pale olive, with minor brown to reddish-brown hues.


## MINERALIZATION AND ALTERATION OF THE TINAKULA S M S DEPOSIT

The alteration assemblages vary with location and depth, generally progressing downward from the seafloor in the order montmorillonite/nontronite to nontronite plus corrensite, to illite/smectite plus pyrite, to illite/smectite plus chamosite, to chamosite plus corrensite. Footwall breccias from site A are dominated by chamosite plus corrensite alteration, with localized illite/smectite plus chamosite alteration that varies in abundance over short distances and is interpreted to reflect proximity to inferred synvolcanic faults. Alteration at site B is semiconformable, varying downhole from illite/smectite plus pyrite, to illite/smectite plus chamosite, to chamosite plus corrensite. Site C is characterized by nontronite near the surface, followed by nontronite plus corrensite and chamosite plus corrensite at depth.

Alteration at site D varies from illite/smectite plus pyrite near the surface, to illite/smectite plus chamosite at depth. End-member illite and rectorite is present in all samples from site D, reflecting high temperatures (greater than two hundred twenty degrees Celsius) and a progression from argillic to phyllic alteration at depth. The variations in alteration assemblages identified at different sites along the NS-trending fissure appear to reflect variable thermal gradients and permeability structure.

Smectite is ubiquitous throughout the footwall in every alteration assemblage as discrete montmorillonite/nontronite replacing volcanic glass and/or mixed-layer clays. illite/smectite clays range in composition from fifty percent illite to approximately ninety-one percent illite, with an average of seventy-four percent illite.

The proportion of illite increases progressively downhole, indicating a process of continuous transformation of smectite to illite. Chlorite may form directly from smectite or through an intermediate corrensite step. At Tinakula, chamosite appears before corrensite in the downhole progression of alteration assemblages, suggesting that corrensite is not an intermediate phase. Corrensite appears after illite/smectite, following a transition from illite/smectite plus chamosite to chamosite plus corrensite. This suggests that corrensite forms as an alteration product of the mixed-layer illite/smectite clays.

and two thousand two hundred twenty-eight nanometers, with wavelengths of two thousand one hundred eighty-nine to two thousand one hundred ninety-five nanometers for paragonite and two thousand two hundred to two thousand two hundred thirteen nanometers for muscovite and illite. In addition, small absorption features are present at two thousand three hundred fifty and two thousand four hundred fifty nanometers for the white micas. Montmorillonite is distinguished by a narrow and symmetrical two thousand two hundred-nanometer feature with a small shoulder on the H two O plus OH absorption feature at one thousand four hundred fifty to one thousand four hundred sixty nanometers. Chlorite is identified by the strong absorption feature at two thousand three hundred forty nanometers, the wavelength of which increases from two thousand three hundred twenty-four nanometers for Mg-rich compositions to greater than two thousand three hundred fifty nanometers for Fe-rich compositions. Gypsum is identified by the OH plus H two O feature at one thousand four hundred nanometers, together with the OH feature at one thousand eight hundred nanometers. The alteration mineral assemblages observed in the SWIR analysis progress downhole from smectite (montmorillonite/nontronite), to white mica (paragonite

paragonitic illite, muscovitic illite, illite, to chlorite, consistent with the XRD results. However, SWIR analyses with both montmorillonite and white mica reflect the presence of mixed-layer illite/smectite clays rather than discrete end members, with progressive increases downhole in aluminum content that shift the Al-OH absorption feature to lower wavelengths.


## Alteration Geochemistry

Least altered volcanic rocks from the Tinakula deposit range from basaltic andesite and andesite to dacite, with basaltic andesite most abundant within and near the volcanic cones. Representative whole-rock geochemical analyses of altered volcaniclastic rocks from drill core are given in Table Four, with the associated alteration assemblages indicated. The least altered host rocks, described by Anderson, twenty eighteen, were identified petrographically by a lack of alteration minerals, loss on ignition less than one point two weight percent, low base metal values less than one hundred eighty-three ppm copper plus zinc plus lead, and no obvious Na two O depletion greater than four point zero weight percent. Data for the three least altered basaltic andesite samples lie on linear trends, with those for the altered samples in plots of Ti O two versus Zr and Ti O two versus Al two O three (Figure Thirteen). Excursions from this linear trend, for example, Zr greater than one hundred sixty ppm at approximately one point five weight percent Ti O two; Figure Thirteen A, may reflect variability in the parental rock compositions, as volcanic rocks in this area show progressive fractionation from basaltic andesite to andesite, for example, Anderson, twenty eighteen. The concentration ranges of immobile and mobile elements for each alteration assemblage are shown in Figure Fourteen. The narrow range of concentrations of Zr, Y, Sc, Nb, Ti, and Al reflect the fact that these elements are least mobile. Concentrations of Ba, Si, Al, Fe, S, Mg, Ca, Na, and K show significant variation, consistent with their inferred mobility during hydrothermal alteration. High Ba, Ca, and S T reflect the abundance of barite and anhydrite/gypsum in the samples. High Fe two O three T and S T are related to pyrite occurrence. Illite-smectite alteration is characterized by relative enrichments in

K two O compared to the least altered basaltic andesite, whereas chamosite plus corrensite alteration is dominated by Mg O addition. The bulk compositions are transitional between illite/smectite plus pyrite to illite/smectite plus chamosite to chamosite plus corrensite end members, Figure Fifteen.

The chondrite-normalized Rare Earth Element profiles for the altered volcaniclastic rocks and the least altered basaltic andesite samples, Figure Sixteen, show pronounced positive Eu anomalies, as Eu becomes concentrated in hydrothermal fluids after it is released from plagioclase during water-rock interactions. Smectite-rich assemblages nontronite/montmorillonite and nontronite plus corrensite show slight Rare Earth Element depletion and have flat profiles. The illite/smectite plus pyrite assemblage displays significant light Rare Earth Element enrichment and steeper profiles, whereas the chamosite-rich assemblages illite/smectite plus chamosite and chamosite plus corrensite show moderate light Rare Earth Element enrichment and flat profiles. The change in slope of the light Rare Earth Elements during the main stage of alteration illite/smectite plus pyrite relative to the least altered rock indicates strong mobility. In contrast, the heavy Rare Earth Elements have slopes similar to those of the least altered rocks, which indicates that they are immobile during hydrothermal alteration. The heavy Rare Earth Elements are simply moved up or down relative to the least altered values due to the total mass gain or loss of the rock during alteration.

Major element mass changes were calculated for all alteration assemblages following the single precursor method of MacLean and Barrett using the average concentration of the three least altered samples as the precursor. In this method, the ratio of the concentration of an immobile element in an altered rock to the concentration of that element in the least altered precursor is proportional to the total mass change in the rock due to hydrothermal alteration. We used the proportion of the least mobile element, Zr, in the precursor sample relative to the altered sample to calculate

The enrichment factor (EF). The reconstructed composition (RC) of the altered sample was calculated for each element by multiplying its concentration in the altered sample (normalized to one hundred percent volatile free) by the EF. Finally, the mass change for each element in the sample was calculated by subtracting the precursor concentration of that element in the least altered sample from the RC. The largest mass changes are associated with moderate to intense alteration, generally increasing with depth. Mass changes for each assemblage are outlined below:

Two. Nontronite plus corrensite alteration is associated with Si, Ca, and Na losses, Mg gains, no losses of Al or Fe (either conserved or gained), and no change in K.

Three. Illite/smectite plus pyrite alteration is associated with losses in Si, Mg, Na, and Ca and gains in both Fe (due to pyrite) and K.

Four. Illite/smectite plus chamosite alteration is associated with Si and Na losses, K gains, and variable gains and losses in Fe and Mg (Mg losses where illite/smectite is more abundant than chamosite; Fe losses where illite/smectite and chamosite are equally abundant).

Five. Chamosite plus corrensite alteration is associated with Si and Na losses, Mg gains, Fe gains when chamosite is more abundant than corrensite and Fe losses when corrensite is more abundant, K gains when minor illite/smectite is

One. Montmorillonite/nontronite alteration is associated with Si and Na losses in smectite-rich samples, Ca loss in all samples, no gains in Al or Fe (either conserved or lost), and no change in K.

present, and no changes in K where no illite/smectite is present.

Mass dilution effects caused by anhydrite and pyrite precipitation were partially mitigated through handpicking of individual altered clasts, avoiding veins and cement/infill. Despite this procedure, not all of these materials could be omitted, thus contributing CaO, Fe-two-O-three, and S, and accounting for some apparent loss of SiO-two. The main difference between the low-temperature alteration stage (dominated by illite/smectite plus pyrite) and the higher-temperature alteration stage (dominated by chamosite plus corrensite) is the mass change of MgO (higher in chamosite) and K-two-O (higher in illite/smectite), typical of VMS-style alteration in permeable volcaniclastic rocks.


## Conditions of Alteration and Mineralization

The high permeability of the volcanic substrate at Tinakula has had a large impact on the composition, size, and morphology of the seafloor mineralization and subseafloor alteration. The conditions of alteration and mineralization have been constrained in this study by fluid inclusion microthermometry, stable isotope data, and dating of the hydrothermal barite.


## Fluid inclusion microthermometry

Fluid inclusions were investigated in five samples of hydrothermally altered volcaniclastic rocks recovered in drill hole TKAD zero zero one between fourteen point eight and nineteen point three meters below seafloor. Details of the petrography and microthermometry are provided in Appendix Table A four. Fluid inclusions occur in three distinct paragenetic stages: early anhydrite in veins and rimming altered volcanic clasts, sphalerite at the margins of the early anhydrite veins in the deepest samples, and later infills of anhydrite and barite.

Primary and secondary inclusions in large (up to one point four millimeters), tabular anhydrite crystals are generally ten to twenty micrometers, reaching maximum diameters of sixty micrometers. All inclusions are liquid dominated with one to ten volume percent vapor.

Fractionation factors after Sheppard and Gilg, nineteen ninety-six; Savin and Lee, nineteen eighty-eight; and Buatier et al., nineteen ninety-five; initial and calculated for equilibrium temperature of two hundred forty degrees Celsius; hydrogen fractionation factor for chlorite-water after Marumo et al., nineteen eighty.

Large crystals of barite (up to one millimeter), after anhydrite, contain mostly secondary inclusions, between four and forty micrometers in size and with a maximum of ten volume percent vapor. The inclusions in sphalerite (after anhydrite) include both primary liquid-vapor inclusions up to fifty micrometers in diameter with five to thirty volume percent vapor and groups of smaller secondary inclusions (less than ten micrometers) distributed along healed cracks. Two inclusions in sphalerite contained a dark solid phase (three to five volume percent) with a tabular habit, likely a sulfide mineral.

Estimated trapping temperatures of primary fluid inclusions in anhydrite reach two hundred ninety-five degrees Celsius with salinities close to that of seawater (two point eight to three point eight weight percent NaCl equivalent). Inclusions in barite have slightly lower trapping temperatures (median two hundred eighteen degrees Celsius) with a bimodal distribution from two hundred two degrees to two hundred twenty degrees Celsius and two hundred fifty-six degrees to two hundred sixty-six degrees Celsius and salinities from two point eight to three point four weight percent NaCl equivalent. However, it is known that barite can stretch during

19B). However, it is known that barite can stretch during heating, so these homogenization temperatures may be biased toward higher values. Traption temperatures may be biased toward higher values. Trapping temperatures of primary fluid inclusions in sphalerite are up to two hundred ninety-eight degrees Celsius with salinities of two point six to four point five weight percent NaCl equivalent.

The highest inclusion trapping temperatures are only approximately ten degrees to twenty degrees Celsius lower than the minimum temperature of boiling for Tinakula fluids (three hundred eight to three hundred eleven degrees Celsius at one thousand seventy to one thousand two hundred four meters water depth), and the highest salinities clearly exceed that of seawater. Although coexisting vapor-rich and brine fluid inclusions associated with boiling were not encountered in the investigated minerals, elevated salinities in several inclusions likely reflect mixing between a brine (derived from boiling) and seawater. This strongly suggests that the highest-temperature fluids have boiled at depth and cooled by mixing on ascent to the seafloor. Cooling of deep fluids from a higher temperature at depth (e.g., three hundred fifty degrees Celsius for typical end-member hydrothermal fluids) would have resulted in the deposition of most of the copper-rich sulfides below the seafloor, which could account for the predominance of zinc-rich sulfide in the chimneys.

corrensite (two hundred seven to two hundred twenty-seven degrees Celsius), and rectorite (two hundred fifty-six degrees Celsius), with the highest temperatures close to trapping temperatures of fluid inclusions in the anhydrite and sphalerite. The Oxygen eighteen value of the hydrothermal fluid in equilibrium with the analyzed clay minerals could have been closer to five point zero percent, if we assume a temperature of formation of two hundred forty degrees Celsius, following Sheppard and Gilg. The large range of calculated eighteen OH two O values at the inferred temperatures of alteration is consistent with boiling of the hydrothermal fluids.

Values of delta D V-SMOW range from negative ninety-two to negative eighty-six percent for nontron- ite, negative sixty-five to negative fifty-two percent for chamosite, negative eighty-five to negative eighty percent for corrensite,

and negative sixty-nine percent in the single sample of rectorite. There is a gen- eral increase in delta D V-SMOW with depth, consistent with the downhole increase in calculated temperature. Importantly, no accepted hydrogen isotope fractionation factors exist for two to one phyllosilicate minerals in order to calculate initial delta D water values. Gilg and Sheppard proposed approximating the fractionation factors of aluminum-rich and iron- and magnesium-free smectites using kaolinite factors; however, the smectites in this study are iron-rich nontronite. Initial delta D water values in equilibrium with chamosite, using a chlorite-water fractionation factor of alpha equals zero point nine five four from Marumo et al., are negative eighteen point seven to negative nine point eight percent. However, hydrogen isotope fractionation in chlorite is strongly dependent on mineral chemistry, thus adding uncertainty to the initial delta D water values.

High delta eighteen O water values have been reported for Kuroko-type hydrothermal fluids (up to ten point eight percent; Ohmoto). The shifts in delta eighteen O water to lower values at higher temperatures (e.g., minimum of zero point eight percent in equilibrium with rectorite during chalcopyrite deposition) are typical of the stringer zones of ancient VMS deposits. The eighteen O-rich fluids at Tinakula may be derived from isotopic exchange with eighteen O-rich rocks, boiling, or direct contributions from magmatic fluids. At high temperatures, water-rock interactions can shift delta eighteen O water but not delta D water. We interpret the combination of higher delta eighteen O water and lower delta D water at Tinakula as a result of subseafloor boiling, which is likely because of the shallow water depths there and the fluid inclusion trapping temperatures, which are close to the boiling curve. The lack of low-PH mineral assemblages and the seawater- dominated S isotope signature suggest that there was no magmatic contribution to the hydrothermal fluids or only a limited one.


## Sulfur isotopes

The thirty-four S values of chalcopyrite range from negative zero point eight to two point zero percent and are, on average, slightly lower in the copper-rich chimneys than in the zinc-rich chimneys. Pyrite has thirty-four S values of negative zero point four to three point one percent, and sphalerite has delta thirty-four S of zero point three to three point four percent, both minerals having higher values in zinc-rich chimneys. Iron-poor light-colored sphalerite has slightly higher thirty-four S values than iron-rich dark-colored sphalerite from the same sample. However, there is no systematic spatial variation in thirty-four S of the sulfides along the main north-south-trending fissure at Tinakula, suggesting that the sulfur source was uni- form. Barite from chimney samples yielded delta thirty-four S of nineteen point three to twenty-two point five percent. Anhydrite from the altered volcaniclastic rocks has delta thirty-four S of twenty point six to twenty-two point two percent, whereas gypsum has thirty-four S of twenty-one point three to twenty-one point eight percent, all close to that of seawater sulfate, twenty-one point two four percent, with a slight decrease with depth.

The isotopic composition of the sulfate minerals records predominantly seawater sulfate in pore spaces of the volcaniclastic rocks. Sulfide values are generally close to mid-ocean ridge basalt values but lower than those of typical arc lavas. This pattern may result from degassing of magmatic volatiles, which can produce hydrogen sulfide with low delta thirty-four S values from the disproportionation of sulfur dioxide. However, there is no evidence at Tinakula of significant volatile contributions that elsewhere produce advanced argillic alteration and very light sulfide sulfur with negative delta thirty-four S values and no evidence of bacterial sulfate reduction that would also produce negative delta thirty-four S values.


## Timing of alteration and mineralization

Results of radium two hundred twenty-six barite dating of hydrothermal barite are shown in Table seven and Figure twenty-four. The calculated ages indicate that hydrothermal venting has been ongoing for at least five thousand six hundred ± two hundred forty years. Approximately sixty percent of the data yield ages between seven hundred ninety-two and two thousand three hundred sixty-nine years. Although there is no obvious spatial variation in the ages, the two oldest samples (greater than four thousand years, MA thirteen zero eleven and MA thirteen zero thirty) were collected from drill core, whereas younger samples were collected primarily from chimneys. Drilling at site D intersected two discrete oxidized intervals that are interpreted as paleoseafloor horizons. The upper paleoseafloor horizon displays lateral continuity over approximately twenty meters east-west and approximately twenty-five meters north-south, but the lower horizon was not recovered in drill hole TKAD zero thirty.

system appears to be in a waning phase of hydrothermal activity, with widespread late-stage precipitation of low-temperature amorphous silica and iron and manganese oxyhydroxides.


## Discussion and Conclusions

Drilling of the Tinakula deposits has revealed widespread hydrothermal alteration within approximately ten meters of the seafloor in the highly permeable volcaniclastic substrate. The alteration assemblages reported here are consistent with a near-neutral or slightly acidic pH.

Sodium chloride equivalent and isotopic data on the sulfide, sulfate, and silicate minerals indicate seawater-dominated fluids, possibly with a component of condensed vapor-phase liquid, and abundant fluid mixing between hydrothermal fluids and ambient seawater. The calculated temperatures of clay formation range from one hundred twenty-four to two hundred fifty-six degrees Celsius, lower than the calculated trapping temperatures of primary fluid inclusions in anhydrite and sphalerite, suggesting that the late sulfate-sulfide veins were likely transporting hotter fluids. The highest-temperature fluids likely boiled at a depth just below the deepest drill holes. Several lines of evidence indicate increasing temperature with depth: (one) the transition from barite near the surface to anhydrite at depth, (two) the progressive transition from smectite to mixed-layer illite/smectite (with increasing proportions of illite) to corrensite to chamosite, and (three) decreasing delta eighteen O and increasing delta D values of monomineralic clays. Calculated temperatures of formation increase by approximately one hundred thirty degrees Celsius from nontronite to chamosite to corrensite to rectorite. Downhole temperature gradients are as high as eighty degrees Celsius in just over one meter. However, several drill holes show reverse temperature gradients. In particular, data for TKAD zero twenty-six suggests decreasing temperatures from two hundred fifty-six degrees Celsius at two point nine meters below seafloor to one hundred sixty-one degrees Celsius at five point six meters below seafloor, reflecting the control of variable subseafloor permeability on lateral fluid flow and variable subsurface mixing with entrained seawater.

The alteration mineralogy at Tinakula is similar to proximal footwall alteration associated with Kuroko-type VMS deposits. In these deposits, the shallow subseafloor strata surrounding the fossil upflow zones is dominated by low-temperature montmorillonite/nontronite, with higher-temperature illite/smectite plus pyrite present in the immediate footwall of the massive sulfide and illite/smectite plus chamosite and chamosite plus corrensite at depth, similar to sites A, C, and D at Tinakula.

Sites A and D are interpreted to be at the center of the highest-temperature upflow, where there is active venting, chalcopyrite-rich chimneys, and extensive formation of illite. The alteration mineralogy at sites B, C, E, and F reflects relatively lower temperatures, consistent with the dominant sphalerite- and barite-rich chimneys.

The alteration assemblages are all associated with silicon loss, which may be partially related to dilution associated with anhydrite precipitation at depth, with net mass changes of as much as forty-nine percent. Similar loss of silicon has been documented in association with phyllosilicate alteration at the PACMANUS hydrothermal system in the Manus back-arc basin. In contrast, at Tinakula silicon gains occur at the tops of drill holes TKAD zero fifteen, TKAD zero thirty-two, and TKAD zero thirty-three, representing local silicification near the seafloor in the form of opaline silica filling void spaces. Large gains in calcium near the bottom of drill holes TKAD zero fifteen, TKAD zero twelve, and TKAD zero eighteen likely record the deposition of anhydrite at the higher subseafloor temperatures at depth, which could reflect incomplete removal of the anhydrite-rich matrix material during clast separations. Large mass gains in potassium oxide and light rare earth elements in the illite/smectite plus pyrite assemblages are similar to the observed mass changes in the feeder zones of VMS deposits hosted by felsic volcaniclastic rocks. Alteration in the immediate upflow zone at Tinakula might also be enhanced by the pyrite precipitation, which generates acid. In the surrounding permeable rocks, drawdown of seawater has added magnesium oxide. Intuitively, this process should be associated with cooling, but the higher temperatures of chlorite formation at depth in the Tinakula drill holes, based on delta eighteen O data, may also have increased the drawdown, resulting in the observed magnesium addition.


## Mineralization and alteration of the Tinakula SMS deposit

In permeable volcaniclastic rocks, an important question is how the permeability becomes sealed enough to allow focusing of the hydrothermal fluids to the seafloor. Here, we propose that the pervasive alteration of the volcaniclastic units close to the seafloor coincided with a progressive downward increase in subseafloor temperatures, from initial low temperatures during precipitation of nontronite, one hundred thirty-six to one hundred thirty-eight degrees Celsius, increasing to chamosite, one hundred twenty-four to two hundred five degrees Celsius, corrensite, two hundred seven to two hundred twenty-seven degrees Celsius, and eventually rectorite, two hundred fifty-six degrees Celsius. At one hundred fifty degrees Celsius, the temperatures were high enough to form anhydrite at depths of only a few meters below the seafloor, sealing off some permeability and focusing the fluids into channelized pathways to the seafloor. Continued hydrothermal circulation resulted in overpressuring and fracturing of this relatively impermeable layer, precipitating late sulfate veins with minor sulfide minerals, including sphalerite, at temperatures up to two hundred ninety-eight degrees Celsius. A similar model has been proposed for the anhydrite-cemented breccias in the Pacmanus deposit in the Manus basin and the Suiyo seamount and Iheya North Knoll field in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc. This process has been investigated using numerical modeling; in ancient deposits, anhydrite is rarely preserved because of its retrograde solubility; the only evidence remaining of an anhydrite seal would be the presence of alteration minerals formed at temperatures that would have caused anhydrite deposition. Chlorite-rich alteration pipes in otherwise permeable volcaniclastic sequences may have been shielded from infiltrating seawater by anhydrite that is no longer present in the rocks. Although rarely preserved in ancient VMS deposits, anhydrite and gypsum are locally abundant in the Kuroko ores and may have played an important role in the focusing of hydrothermal upflow in those deposits, as at Tinakula.

Barite and silica, which form close to the seafloor at much lower temperatures than anhydrite, may also have been important in forming an initial cap on the permeable units, promoting lateral flow of fluids and allowing subseafloor temperatures to reach the point of anhydrite precipitation (greater than one hundred fifty degrees Celsius). Early cooling of the fluids and mixing near the seafloor was likely, given the highly permeable volcaniclastic cover. The style of hydrothermal upflow also plays an important role in the nature of the seafloor mineralization. Jamieson et al. showed a high proportion of seawater mixing in chimneys with predominant dendritic barite; similar diffuse venting is likely responsible for the formation of porous beehive-like structures and unusual bulbous chimneys observed at Tinakula. This style of venting, which has been inferred for the origin of layered barite-sulfide mounds in the East Diamante caldera and at Clark seamount, may be common where seafloor venting occurs through permeable volcaniclastic substrates. Diffuse discharge over a large area is also consistent with the bottom-hugging plume signal originally detected at Tinakula.

The Tinakula SMS deposit is the first documented example of a modern SMS deposit developed mainly in bimodal-mafic volcaniclastic rocks. The particular mineralization and alteration styles recognized here are a direct result of the volcanic

Eight hundred ninety-three setting, which is dominated by a permeable substrate rather than the coherent lava flows typical of mid-ocean ridges. Morphologies of the volcanic cones at Tinakula and the volcaniclastic facies successions are consistent with extensive Strombolian-type eruptions, forming a row of cinder cones along a north-south trending fissure. The eruptions likely occurred over days to months, while geothermal activity at Tinakula may have lasted thousands of years. The massive sulfide mineralization may not be closely related temporally to formation of the cinder cones, but instead the hydrothermal systems most likely exploited the same structural corridor. Lateral fluid flow and semiconformable alteration at Tinakula are similar to those described in a class of ancient VMS deposits hosted by volcaniclastic rocks, such as the Sturgeon Lake VMS district. In ancient VMS deposits of this type, semiconformable alteration is commonly observed at depths of several hundred meters below the paleoseafloor, associated with subseafloor deposition of massive sulfide. What is unusual at Tinakula is that hydrothermal fluids affected such a large area so close to the seafloor: approximately one hundred fifty thousand square meters at the seafloor and possibly three times as large below the seafloor. The shallow alteration and anhydrite likely acted as an insulating layer for hydrothermal circulation and mineralization at depth, as seen in ancient VMS deposits.
