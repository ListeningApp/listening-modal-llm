        "content": "molj | The desire for an easy religion that requires no striving, no self-denial, no divorce from the follies of the world, has made the doctrine of faith, and faith only, a popular doctrine; but what saith the word of God? Says the apostle James: \"What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? ... Wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? ... Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.\"\n5pto | The testimony of the word of God is against this ensnaring doctrine of faith without works. It is not faith that claims the favor of Heaven without complying with the conditions upon which mercy is to be granted, it is presumption; for genuine faith has its foundation in the promises and provisions of the Scriptures.\nmo6k | Let none deceive themselves with the belief that they can become holy while willfully violating one of God's requirements. The commission of a known sin silences the witnessing voice of the Spirit and separates the soul from God. ... Though John in his epistles dwells so fully upon love, yet he does not hesitate to reveal the true\nzh6q | character of that class who claim to be sanctified while living in transgression of the law of God. \"He that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoso keepeth His word, in him verily is the love of God perfected.\" Here is the test of every man's profession. We cannot accord holiness to any man without bringing him to the measurement of God's only standard of holiness in heaven and in earth. ...\nkp04 | The claim to be without sin is, in itself, evidence that he who makes this claim is far from holy. It is because he has no true conception of the infinite purity and holiness of God or of what they must become who shall be in harmony with His character; because he has no true conception of the purity and exalted loveliness of Jesus, and the malignity and evil of sin, that man can regard himself as holy. The greater the distance between himself and Christ, and the more inadequate his conceptions of the divine character and requirements, the more righteous he appears in his own eyes.\n3e8r | Sanctification-Total Commitment\n8g7g | The sanctification set forth in the Scriptures embraces the entire being-spirit, soul, and body. Paul prayed for the Thessalonians that their \"whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" Again he writes to believers: \"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.\" In the time of ancient Israel every offering brought as a sacrifice to God was carefully examined. If any defect was discovered in the animal presented, it was refused; for God had commanded that the offering be \"without blemish.\" So Christians are bidden to present their bodies, \"a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.\" In order to do this, all their powers must be preserved in the best possible condition. Every practice that weakens physical or mental strength unfits man for the service of his Creator.\n5j4f | And will God be pleased with anything less than the best we can offer? Said Christ: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart.\" Those who do love God with all the heart will desire to give Him the best service of their life, and they will be constantly seeking\n4xe7 | to bring every power of their being into harmony with the laws that will promote their ability to do His will. ...\npg4b | A Changed Life\nb0d0 | The world is given up to self-indulgence. \"The lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life\" control the masses of the people. But Christ's followers have a holier calling. ...\nd7eu | To those who comply with the conditions, \"Come out from among them, and be ye separate, ... and touch not the unclean,\" God's promise is, \"I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\" It is the privilege and the duty of every Christian to have a rich and abundant experience in the things of God. ... The bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness shine upon the servants of God, and they are to reflect His rays. As the stars tell us that there is a great light in heaven with whose glory they are made bright, so Christians are to make it manifest that there is a God on the throne of the universe whose character is worthy of praise and imitation. The graces of His Spirit, the purity and holiness of His character, will be manifest in His witnesses. ...\nxndr | No Longer Condemned\nm6hi | While the Christian's life will be characterized by humility, it should not be marked with sadness and self-depreciation. It is the privilege of everyone so to live that God will approve and bless him. It is not the will of our heavenly Father that we should be ever under condemnation and darkness. There is no evidence of true humility in going with the head bowed down and the heart filled with thoughts of self. We may go to Jesus and be cleansed, and stand before the law without shame and remorse. \"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\"\nvpkf | Through Jesus the fallen sons of Adam become \"sons of God.\" \"Both He that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren.\" The Christian's life should be one of faith, of victory, and\n4d67 | joy in God. \"Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.\" Truly spoke God's servant Nehemiah: \"The joy of the Lord is your strength.\" And Paul says: \"Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.\" \"Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.\"\ne7j2 | Such are the fruits of Bible conversion and sanctification. -The Great Controversy, four hundred sixty-one to four hundred seventy-eight. Chapter titled \"Modern Revivals.\"\nlqzt | Faith-Belief and Trust\n1ocm | When God pardons the sinner, remits the punishment he deserves, and treats him as though he had not sinned, He receives him into divine favor, and justifies him through the merits of Christ's righteousness. The sinner can be justified only through faith in the atonement made through God's dear Son, who became a sacrifice for the sins of the guilty world. No one can be justified by any works of his own. He can be delivered from the guilt of sin, from the condemnation of the law, from the penalty of transgression, only by virtue of the suffering, death, and resurrection of Christ. Faith is the only condition upon which justification can be obtained, and faith includes not only belief but trust. ...",
