Understanding the mechanistic details of proton-coupled electron transfer reactions can allow control of these processes. A powerful mechanistic probe is the pH dependence of proton-coupled electron transfer reaction rates in aqueous solution. For example, a pH-independent apparent rate constant often indicates either a sequential mechanism with rate-limiting electron transfer or a concerted mechanism with water as the proton donor or acceptor. If the apparent rate constant K increases or decreases tenfold per pH unit, hydronium or hydroxide are often assumed to be the sole proton donor or acceptor, and a plot of log K versus pH should have a slope of plus or minus one. However, in several studies, a much weaker pH dependence of the proton-coupled electron transfer apparent rate constant has been observed. These examples include the homogeneous oxidation of tyrosine and tryptophan, as well as the interfacial reduction of ruthenium-based water oxidation catalysts. However, an explanation for these weak pH dependencies remains elusive. Herein, we will show that the weak pH dependence of some proton-coupled electron transfer reactions can be explained in terms of a competition among multiple mechanisms.\nhjzj | The idea of competing reactions has a long history in the proton-coupled electron transfer literature. Laviron developed a model to\nj79f | describe the pH dependence of the apparent standard rate constant for stepwise, electrochemical proton-coupled electron transfer reactions. In this model, the competition between two electron transfer reactions involving the protonated or deprotonated redox species is considered. The resulting pH-dependent standard rate constant has two plateaus at low and high pH limits connected by a V-shape curve. In the intermediate pH region, the rate constant first decreases due to the depletion of the protonated form and then increases due to the growing contribution from the deprotonated form, resulting in the V-shape curve. This model was then generalized by Finklea to stepwise multiproton multielectron proton-coupled electron transfer reactions. In addition to the stepwise case, recently, the Surendranath group developed a model that considers the competition between two concerted pathways with different proton donors on a graphitic conjugated catalyst interface. The predicted pH-dependent apparent standard rate constant also has a V-shape, which\n6tbv | agrees with the experimental results. All of these models were developed for electrochemical proton-coupled electron transfer reactions and rely on the Butler-Volmer equation. Furthermore, Costentin and coworkers developed competing reaction-based pH-dependent models for homogeneous proton-coupled electron transfer reactions with water as the proton donor or acceptor. Their work discussed various cases, such as the competition between concerted pathways with proton transfer within a local water cluster or directly to bulk solvent, the competition between concerted and stepwise pathways, and reactions involving buffer.\nxb13 | In this paper, we introduce a general, multichannel kinetic model to describe the pH dependence of homogeneous and heterogeneous proton-coupled electron transfer. This model yields a general expression for the pH-dependent apparent rate constants of both homogeneous proton-coupled electron transfer in solution and electrochemical proton-coupled electron transfer. The core concept of this model is that several electron transfer and proton-coupled electron transfer channels are accessible and actively contribute to the overall proton-coupled electron transfer process. The contribution of each channel is strongly influenced by the relative populations of the different forms of the redox species (i.e., protonated or deprotonated and various hydrogen-bonded complexes with the proton donor or acceptor). These populations, described by the mole fractions, are pH-dependent and therefore lead to a complex dependence of the apparent rate constants on pH. Furthermore, we employ this model to describe experimentally measured pH-dependent kinetic data for a representative interfacial electrochemical proton-coupled electron transfer reaction, namely, reduction of a ruthenium-based water oxidation catalyst attached to a tin-doped indium two oxide surface. Our model explains the origins of the previously observed weak pH dependence of proton-coupled electron transfer for this system using physically meaningful parameters. Moreover, our model's predicted behavior for a wider pH range is then confirmed by additional experiments. This example highlights the importance of considering all possible reaction channels instead of just the dominant channel when analyzing experimental proton-coupled electron transfer kinetic data. Although this application focuses on electrochemical proton-coupled electron transfer, a future study will focus on applications of this kinetic model to homogeneous proton-coupled electron transfer systems.\ncxqi | THEORY\nqfmx | We use the four-channel model shown in Figure one as a typical example. Derivations for the general cases are provided in the Supporting Information. In our model, both the oxidized and reduced species can exist in protonated and deprotonated forms: Ox, OxH+, Red, and RedH. These species can be converted to each other via electron transfer and proton transfer to or from an external source. The edges of the square diagram in Figure one represent sequential electron transfer proton transfer or proton transfer electron transfer pathways, and the diagonals of this diagram represent the concerted electron-proton transfer pathways. Herein, the term proton-coupled electron transfer encompasses both sequential and concerted mechanisms, and the term electron-proton transfer indicates concerted proton-coupled electron transfer. Assuming that buffer ions do not participate in the concerted pathways, either a hydronium ion H3O+ or a water molecule can serve as the proton donor for the reduction reaction, and either a water molecule or a hydroxide ion OH can serve as the proton acceptor for the oxidation reaction. If H3O+ or OH is the proton donor or acceptor in the concerted mechanism, the redox species must first form a hydrogen- bonded complex with the ion. These hydrogen-bonded complexes are denoted as {Ox ... H3O+} and {RedH ... OH}. The formation of these complexes is shown with black double\nrut3 | arrows in Figure one, requiring the displacement of a water molecule by either H3O+ or OH. On the other hand, if water is the proton donor or acceptor in the concerted mechanism, these additional hydrogen bond formation steps are not needed because the complexes with water are already formed upon solvation.\nm3cp | Next, we explicitly write the chemical reactions shown in Figure one. For the remainder of this paper, we use the following convention. For electron transfer, proton transfer, and complex formation reactions, water is considered as a solvent, and the notation {X ... H2O} is dropped. For concerted electron-proton transfer reactions, the notation {X ... H2O} must be written explicitly to ensure mass conservation. The electron transfer and electron-proton transfer channels (half reactions) are characterized by their standard potentials and rate constants, as given by the following expressions\nmq4s | OxH+ + e RedH, EEPT1\n95el | (one a)\na0a5 | Ox + e- Red, EEPT2\ngocl | (one b)\nob1z | Red Ox {RedH ...
