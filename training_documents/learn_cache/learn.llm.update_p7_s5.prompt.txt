You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

a3td | All the learning we have discussed involves memory. But people are most likely to remember what they have used and maybe invented, not what they have had drilled into their heads. Marshall and Albert began learning French in the sixth grade, but six weeks into the fall semester, Albert's parents moved to Paris, taking the young boy and his sister with them. By the time he graduated from high school, Marshall had taken six years of French, memorizing vocabulary and usually acing the exams. His parents drilled him, using all the sophisticated procedures of spaced repetition. It doesn't take much imagination or insight, however, to guess which one of the two boys read, spoke, and wrote French with almost perfect fluency when they met for a reunion right before going off to college, and which one struggled to keep up with the chatter.5 People learn deeply by doing in authentic situations.6
ex5k | Students are more likely to remember what they understand. When we comprehend we make rich associations between ideas and informa- tion, and the network of connections we lay down in our brains
9d4o | enhances our memories. If through speculation, someone has invented a solution, that person can more easily recall its steps and why you should take those steps than if the person had picked up the solution from watching someone else perform the process.
cjq2 | To engage in the difficult business of learning deeply people often need help. This is a tricky matter because it doesn't mean simply pro- viding them with "correct answers." That's largely what traditional lec- tures do. Rather students require assistance in constructing insights and inventing ways to solve problems. Maybe the help comes as a ques- tion that sparks thought and understanding, rather than as an explana- tion. Students need an opportunity to try, fail, and receive feedback. Novice learners who have recently struggled with the same problems can often provide the best assistance to the absolute beginner. Those novice learners remember the tough parts while experts have forgotten the potholes along the route. The scholar often uses shortcuts in think- ing while the neophyte may need to think through every step. But stu- dents also need far more than intellectual assistance. Emotional help is often crucial, not simply because humans harbor anxiety and misgiv- ings, but also because struggling with deeply held paradigms can prove traumatic.
5esx | If learners must meet new standards, they may require assistance in understanding them and practice in applying the criteria to their own work. To remain motivated, people need to believe that their work will matter and that it will have lasting consequences for themselves and perhaps for others, and that the standards will be applied honestly and fairly. That process begins with clearly defined standards and lots of practice in comprehending the criteria.
m5ka | Going Bad
byu8 | What can go wrong beyond those pitfalls we've already mentioned? Let's explore threats that emerge from a couple of strong social forces. You may have noticed that we've made no mention of "intelligence" as a factor in learning, even though many traditional educators have relied almost exclusively on that concept to explain who succeeds and who
76b0 | comes up short. "It doesn't matter what I do in class," a math professor in the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York Univer- sity once told us. "The gifted students will get it, and the weak ones won't." This genius theory of education pervades schools on all levels, but it doesn't set well with everyone, or with some important research on human development.
zxz6 | When Carol Dweck finished her doctorate in psychology at Yale in 1972, she had one burning question on her mind. Why do some people melt in the face of failure while others zip right through adversity, even using it to improve their work? "I grew up in an . .. era that worshipped IQ" she told her campus newspaper recently, "and thought that" it largely determined your future. "My sixth grade teacher even seated us around the room in IQ order."7 After more than forty years of research, the Lewis and Virginia Eaton Professor of Psychology at Stanford Univer- sity has found that people's conception of intelligence has more influence than does anything you might measure as an IQ. "If you believe your intelligence is just a fixed trait," Dweck explained, you're likely to de- velop a sense of helplessness. If you think you don't know and can't learn, you're not apt to try something. But that feeling of helplessness can also emerge among people who think they are smart and also be- lieve human brains can't grow.
xnth | Imagine a kid who has heard all his life, "You're really brilliant." He may then build his whole self-image around being a genius. Soon he may grow afraid to try anything new for fear he will fail and prove he's not so sharp after all. In contrast, "if you think .. . your talents, abilities and intelligence . .. can grow" then "you want to jump in and develop them," Dweck summarized. That can make a huge difference in some- one's learning.
vafm | Thus, people who believe their intelligence is fixed for life often have difficulty embracing failure. They tend to recoil from their mistakes rather than learning from them. If a teacher tries to put them in a situa- tion where their mental models do not work (creating a "model fail- ure"), they resist and learn little because they cannot stand to fail. Mean- while, students flourish with challenges to their thinking if they believe intelligence can grow.
2zmw | Fortunately, Dweck and her colleagues have found that fixed and growth mindsets, as she calls them, come from conditioning, not from any innate qualities of someone's brain or personality. They can change. In a series of powerful experiments, she and her colleagues discovered certain experiences that cause children to develop one mindset or an- other. People who hear a steady stream of person praise ("how smart you are"), for example, often grow a fixed view of intelligence and a feeling of helplessness, while those who encounter task-oriented feedback ("you must have worked hard on this") build a strong growth mindset. In her research, Dweck found that students with the fixed view gave up easily, sometimes complaining that they were "not a math person" (or 'writing person"), and growing easily bored with school, especially if they failed. Furthermore, and this is probably the most disturbing re- sult, their abilities actually decline in the face of failure. Meanwhile, students with growth perspectives sail right through adversity and often deliberately seek hard challenges.8
bf9k | None of this means we've discovered a magic cure. We continue to face enormous problems in changing anyone's mindset, especially as people grow older. Yet some of the Super Courses we will explore have devised some innovative approaches with promising results. They de- serve additional trials and careful research to find out what works and what doesn't.
otkr | Stereotype Threat
ibgs | Joshua Aronson and Claude Steele found different social forces shaping learning outcomes.9 If you are a member of a group about which there is a popular negative stereotype, that common belief can influence your performance in school and elsewhere even if you personally reject it. Obviously, if you accept the negative idea that "people like you" can't do something, you will give up easily. Failure will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. But you don't have to accept the negative stereotype for it to affect you. On a subconscious level it may simply bother you that others think of you in terms of that popular image, even if you never internalize a sense of inferiority. In a silent and unspoken dash to exonerate yourself
colo | and others, tensions grow. Nervousness increases, and your academic performance tanks.
d6r4 | Margaret Shih knew that research but asked a brand new question. We have lots of stereotypes in our culture, she noticed. Some positive. Others more negative. Many people believe, she pointed out, that women can't do higher mathematics as well as men can. At the same time, many Americans also think that people of Asian descent possess some kind of "math superiority" gene. But what about Asian American women? Which stereotype, negative or positive, will influence their performance?10
