You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

82qc | Stool-based Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in children at a teaching and referral hospital in Southwest Ethiopia
ls7d | Abstract
tzt3 | Background
t8vv | Diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in children is challenging mainly due to the difficulty of obtain- ing respiratory specimen and lack of sensitive diagnostic tests. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert here after) for the diag- nosis of pulmonary TB (PTB) from stool specimen in children.
qvnu | Methods
kggw | A cross-sectional study was conducted among consecutively recruited children (less than 15 years old) with presumptive PTB at Jimma Medical Center, Ethiopia. One pulmonary specimen (expectorated sputum or gastric aspirate) was collected from each participant and tested for TB by Xpert and Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) culture. In addition, one stool specimen per child was collected and tested by Xpert after a single step, centrifuge-free stool process- ing method adapted from KNCV TB Foundation. Diagnostic performance of Xpert was cal- culated with reference to LJ culture and to a composite reference standards (CRS) comprising of confirmed TB (positive by Xpert and/or culture) and unconfirmed TB (clinical diagnosis with improvement after anti-TB treatment).
xrd1 | Results
5746 | A total of 178 children were enrolled; 152 of whom had complete microbiological results. Overall, TB was diagnosed in 13.2% (20/152) of the children with presumptive TB. Of these, only ten had microbiologically confirmed TB (positive Xpert and/or culture) and the remain- ing ten were clinically diagnosed with positive response to anti-TB treatment and were clas- sified as unconfirmed TB. Stool Xpert had sensitivity of 100% (95%CI: 66.4-100) and specificity of 99.3% (95%CI: 96.2-100) compared to culture; however, the sensitivity was

h2l3 | Conclusions
dfzb | The sensitivity of Xpert for stool sample is comparable to that for gastric aspirate. Stool sam- ple is a potential alternative to pulmonary specimen in the diagnosis of pulmonary TB in chil- dren using Xpert.
u6ty | Background
awvu | Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading causes of death globally [1]. Children account for 11% of the global disease burden with an estimated 1.1 million new childhood TB cases and 205,000 pediatric TB deaths in 2018 [1]. Early detection of TB is critical for timely initiation of treatment but is challenging in children because of non-specific clinical presentations, diffi- culty of obtaining respiratory specimen and lack of sensitive diagnostic tests [2].
on9b | Sputum specimen remains being the most frequently used clinical sample to confirm the diagnosis of TB microbiologically [3]. However, in most cases, children are unable to expecto- rate sputum specimen and when sputum is available; the yield is expected to be poor because of the paucibacillary nature of childhood TB. As a result, specimen obtained through different procedures such as induced sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, and gastric aspirate have been studied to improve the sensitivity of microbiological examinations [4]. Though these proce- dures are well tolerated in adults, they are relatively uncomfortable for children, and the capa- bility to carry out these procedures may be lacking in many TB endemic settings. Thus, there is a need for non-sputum based specimen to diagnose TB in children who are unable to expec- torate sputum.
a8ge | Stool is an alternative specimen for TB diagnosis, because Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) can be swallowed with the sputum and detected in stool [5]. In particular, stool is easy to obtain from infants and young children who are unable to produce sputum [6]. The introduction of Xpert has revolutionized the diagnosis of TB and the World Health Organization (WHO) has endorsed Xpert for the diagnosis of TB from various types of specimen such as sputum, lymph node tissue and aspirate, cerebrospinal fluid, gastric lavage and aspirate [Z]. Recently, studies evaluating Xpert for detection of pulmonary TB (PTB) from stool have been published with highly variable sensitivities, ranging from 32% to 83.3% [6, 8]. In Ethiopia, there is a paucity of data on the diagnostic performance of Xpert on stool specimen for children who are unable to expectorate sputum. Therefore, this study is aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Xpert for the diagnosis of PTB from stool specimen in children with presumptive TB.

y4mj | the oldest public hospitals in the country. JUMC is a teaching and referral hospital that pro- vides services for about 15 million people in its catchment area. Each year, JUMC reports serv- ing approximately 15, 000 inpatient hospital stays, 160, 000 outpatient visits, and 11, 000 emergency department visits [9]. Most of the patients getting services at the center are from rural area. According to WHO 2021 report, Ethiopia is among the 30 countries with high TB and TB/HIV burden, with an estimated annual incidence of 151,000 cases and an estimated 19,000 TB-related deaths (excluding HIV associated TB deaths).
vpgq | Study participants
ousl | Participants were children aged less than 15 years presenting with a chronic cough of >2 weeks, weight loss, loss of appetite, persistent fever without an apparent cause, night sweats, or history of close contact with a TB patient within the preceding 12 months. They were classified as the presumptive PTB patients. Participants were excluded, if they had an already confirmed TB, had been on anti-TB treatment (ATT) for >72 hours before enrolment and clinical symp- toms or physical signs suggestive of extrapulmonary TB.
m4ju | Study procedures
a0mb | Children up to 15 years of age were screened for TB and those presumptive TB cases were enrolled into this study. TB screening was done as per standard of care, which mainly relies on self-reporting of symptoms suggestive of TB (cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss and his- tory of close contact with TB patients). Study subjects were diagnosed with confirmed TB based on positive microbiological test results (positive LJ culture and/or positive Xpert on gas- tric aspirate or sputum) or with unconfirmed TB based on a clinical diagnosis and positive response to ATT. Some of the patients with negative microbiologic results were given empiri- cal treatment based on the evaluation by the treating clinicians and were evaluated for response to treatment (resolution of symptoms, weight gain, and radiographic improvement) after two months. Demographic data and clinical information of the participants were col- lected through structured questionnaires. Clinical data such as radiologic findings, clinical improvement after ATT, HIV status, nutritional status, and BCG vaccination status were obtained from the participants' medical records.
ki8m | Specimen collection and laboratory procedures
km8w | One respiratory specimen (a minimum of 4ml) and one stool specimen (a minimum of 3gm) were collected per child. Xpert was performed at JUMC Laboratory from respiratory speci- mens as part of the routine practice at the medical center, whereas TB culture and stool Xpert were performed at Jimma University Mycobacterium Research Center (JUMRC) for the research purposes.
wzno | The respiratory samples were collected as per the standard of care. The treating physician collected single gastric aspirate or expectorated sputum. Gastric aspirate samples were col- lected early in the morning through nasogastric tube following an overnight fasting and tested by Xpert and LJ culture. Expectorated sputum instead of gastric aspirate was used in the patients who were able to produce sputum.
xagm | Respiratory specimens were divided into two parts; the first part was diluted (2:1v/v) with Xpert sample reagent, followed by vigorous shaking and incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Then, 2ml of liquefied specimen was aspirated using sterile pipette provided with Xpert kit and added to Xpert cartridge and loaded in to the GeneXpert instrument to run the test. The results were reported to the treating physicians as soon as possible for participants' management.

jfsr | The second part of respiratory specimen was neutralized with phosphate buffered solution (PBS) immediately after collection and stored at 4-8 ℃ for 2-3 days until processing for cul- ture. Equal volume of N-acetyl-L-Cysteine and 4% sodium hydroxide solution were added to the 50ml specimen tube. After mixing on the vortex, the sample tube was left standing for 20 minutes at room temperature for liquefaction and decontamination. Then, sterile PBS (pH6.8) was added up to 45ml to neutralize the alkaline solution, followed by centrifugation at 3000g for 15 minutes. After discarding the supernatant, the pellet was re-suspended in 2ml PBS and two drops of the resulting diluted deposit was inoculated on the slants of LJ medium.
u15r | Stool specimen (approximately 3-5g) was collected in a wide mouthed specimen collection jar on spot or submitted the following day and was stored at -20℃ until processed as described previously [10]. Stool Xpert was performed by single step, centrifuge-free stool processing pro- tocol adapted from KNCV TB foundation [10]. Briefly, 1 g of thawed stool was transferred to 50ml falcon tube using wooden applicator stick; 8ml of sample reagent was poured in the sam- ple tube and mixed very well, and left undisturbed for 20 minutes at room temperature. The supernatant was carefully aspirated and added to Xpert cartridge using sterile pipette.
lq35 | Diagnostic classification for analysis
3g9w | Children were classified into three categories based on their clinical, radiological, and labora- tory results. (i) "Confirmed TB" :- child has symptoms suggestive of TB and TB disease is con- firmed microbiologically (positive gastric aspirate Xpert and/or culture); (ii) "Unconfirmed TB" :- child has at least 2 of the following: symptoms suggestive of TB, chest radiograph consis- tent with TB, or documented exposure to MTB and positive response to ATT but TB disease is not confirmed microbiologically (negative gastric aspirate Xpert and/or culture); (iii) "Unlikely TB" :- no criteria for "Unconfirmed TB" was met and TB is not confirmed microbio- logically (negative gastric aspirate Xpert and/or culture). CRS is defined as either confirmed TB or unconfirmed TB in the definition of TB and cases that met "unlikely TB" criteria were classified as not TB.
d09o | Data analysis
ylhz | Data were entered in Epidata version 3.3 and analyzed using SPSS software package version 20. The Xpert sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated using the following as one of the reference stan- dards: i) LJ culture alone; ii) LJ culture and/or Xpert (confirmed TB); and iii) composite refer- ence standard (CRS) (confirmed TB and Unconfirmed TB). Differences and similarities between the two methods (stool Xpert versus gastric aspirate Xpert) was determined based on the 95%CI. Non-over lapping 95% CIs indicated a difference between the two methods (stool Xpert versus gastric aspirate Xpert) and vice versa.
