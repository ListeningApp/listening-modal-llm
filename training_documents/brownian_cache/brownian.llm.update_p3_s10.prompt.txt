You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

p930 | A. The Brownian Motion Path Integral
xhc7 | In order to bring the tools of Quantum Field Theory [11, 17] to bear, we will need to reformulate the stochas- tic differential equation (8) in terms of a path integral. In this subsection we will outline one known way to obtain this path integral, aiming to link this to Supersymmet- ric Quantum Mechanics. Our final expression, and the starting point of our subsequent analysis, is the Brownian Motion transition probability (24), expressed in terms of an integral over possible histories weighted by the action (25), to which the busy reader may progress if uninter- ested in the details of the derivation. We will be using a condensed functional notation of infinite dimensional functional integrals but all expressions can be considered as limits of finite, high dimensional ordinary integrals. This derivation is based on the path integral reformula- tion by De Dominicis, Peliti and Janssen [18-20] of the well known Martin-Siggia-Rose approach for stochastic dynamics, first developed in [21]. More details on these path integrals, including the corresponding finite discreti- sation of the stochastic process can be found in [22] - see also [23] for a pedagogical exposition.
6a60 | The dynamics of the (dimensionless) Langevin equa- tion (8) can be captured in terms of the Probability Dis- tribution Function (PDF) <LATEX>\mathcal{P} \left( x _ { f } | x _ { i } \right)</LATEX> of observing the par- ticle <LATEX>x _ { f }</LATEX> <LATEX>t = t _ { f }</LATEX> given that initially, at <LATEX>t = t _ { i } ,</LATEX> the particle was at <LATEX>x _ { i } .</LATEX> By definition this can be expressed as:
dfgj | <LATEX>\mathcal{P} \left( x _ { f } | x _ { i } \right) = \langle \delta \left( x \left( t _ { f } \right) - x _ { f } \right) \rangle</LATEX> (10)
6ptp | where the expectation value is taken over all possible re- alisations of the noise <LATEX>\eta \left( t \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>\delta \left( x \left( t _ { f } \right) - x _ { f } \right)</LATEX> is the Dirac delta function. Put another way, <LATEX>x \left( t _ { f } \right)</LATEX> is the position at <LATEX>t _ { f }</LATEX> for a given noise history <LATEX>\eta \left( t \right)</LATEX> and the brackets indicate averaging over all possible noise histories, or stochastic paths, which start at <LATEX>x _ { i }</LATEX> and end up at <LATEX>x \left( t _ { f } \right) = x _ { f }</LATEX> at <LATEX>t _ { f } .</LATEX> To express this in a path integral form, we can rewrite the PDF using a Gaussian measure for the <LATEX>n o i s e \left( 5 \right) a n d</LATEX> express the average as
qjlj | <LATEX>\mathcal{P} \left( x _ { f } | x _ { i } \right) = \int \mathcal{D} \eta \left( t \right) \delta \left( x \left( t _ { f } \right) - x _ { f } \right) \exp \left[ - \int \mathrm { d } t \frac { \eta ^ { 2 } \left( t \right) } { 2 \Upsilon } \right]</LATEX> (11)
