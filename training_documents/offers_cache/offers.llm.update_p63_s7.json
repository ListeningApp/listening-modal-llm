        "content": "pqyp | A prime example of this happened in the London tunnel system. The biggest increase in rider satisfaction, also known as value, was never from faster trains to decrease wait times. Instead, it was from a simple dotted map that showed them when the next train was coming and how long they had to wait. The dotted map, which only cost a few million dollars, decreased the riders' perception of time delay and sacrifice, being bored waiting, more than actually making the trains faster, which costs billions of dollars to do. Isn't that cool? This is how we need to think about our products.\nnev2 | Pro Tip: Logical versus Psychological Solutions\nlo13 | Most people naturally try and solve problems using logical solutions. But the logical solutions have usually been tried because they're logical. It's what everyone would try and do.\n1gm9 | As a business owner and entrepreneurs I increasingly approach problems to find psychological solutions, rather than logical ones. Because if there were a logical solution, it probably would have already been solved, thereby eliminating the problem. All that's left are the psychological problems.\n94yd | Psychological solution: decrease the pain of waiting by adding a dotted map. Psychological solution: pay models to be the hostesses on the trip. People would wish it took longer to get to their destination! Logical solution: make elevator faster.\nox3w | Psychological solution: add floor-to-ceiling mirrors so people are distracted staring at themselves and forget how long they were on the elevator. Logical solution: make it cheaper. Psychological solution: make fewer of them and raise the price which causes people to want it more.\n2ai3 | Often, most logical solutions have been tried and failed. At this point in history, we must give the psychological solutions a shot to solve problems.\ndu4q | As such, as business owners, it is up to us to communicate these value drivers with clarity to increase the prospect's perception of these realities. The extent to which you answer these questions in the mind of your prospect will determine the value you are creating. Only then, will we truly be able to realize the actual value of our product to the marketplace, and by extension, the egregious prices we want to charge.\nv86a | It's difficult to separate the four value drivers from another, as most vehicles combine many of these elements together, but I will do my best to isolate and clearly explain each below.\nexkc | Number one. Dream Outcome. Goal equals Increase.\nj83u | People have deep, unchanging desires. This is what marriages are lost over, wars are fought over, and people will willingly die for. Our goal is not to create desire. It's simply to channel that desire through our offer and monetization vehicle.\n6vco | The dream outcome is the expression of the feelings and experiences the prospect has envisioned in their mind. It's the gap between their current reality and their dreams. Our goal is to accurately depict that dream back to them, so they feel understood, and explain how our vehicle will get them there.\nrnzk | The dream outcome is simple; it's the \"getting there\" where the value gets enhanced or detracted.\ndflu | People generally, and our clients specifically, want:\nyat3 | To be perceived as beautiful.\ntp87 | To be respected.\n7wep | To be perceived as powerful.\n70t5 | To be loved.\nkwz0 | To increase their status.\nvool | These are all powerful drivers.\njwym | But multiple vehicles may accomplish the same thing. Take the desire to be perceived as beautiful for example, here are a lot of things that touch on this desire:\numh8 | Make up, anti-aging creams and serums, supplements, shapewear, plastic surgery, fitness.\n1zay | All these vehicles channel the desire to be perceived as beautiful.\nns7i | And if we further unpack the idea of a desire to be beautiful, we see that it may be a surface-level declaration of a deeper desire to achieve higher status in one's social group.\nfztd | The dream outcome value driver is most prominently used when comparing the relative value between two different desires being satisfied. In general, the dream outcome that most directly increases a prospect's status will be the one they value most. As such, a prospect may value that entire category of vehicles that satisfy one desire more than another category that satisfies a different desire. For many men, making money is more important than being handsome. Why? Because money drives status for men more than being handsome does. So, in general, they will value all offers that make them money more than offers that help them look good.\no5o5 | I once heard Russell Brunson tell a story about this concept. He explained how his wife, Collette, at first hearing about this status concept, rejected it. She claimed she wasn't driven by status and would never want to drive a Lamborghini. Instead, she favored her minivan. But, after talking further, she revealed it was because driving a Lamborghini would decrease her status amongst her mom friends, while driving a minivan would show she was a good mother, which is an increase in status. So it's not about the money, it's about the status, the perceived increase or decrease in relative standing when compared to others socially or professionally. Talk in terms of things your prospect believes will increase their status, and you will have your prospects drooling.\nr5z1 | Pro Tip: Frame benefits in terms of status gained from the viewpoint of others.\nj696 | When writing copy, you can make it that much more powerful by talking about how other people will perceive the prospect's achievement. Connect\n34d0 | the dots for them. Example: If you buy this golf club, your drive will increase by forty yards. Your golf buddies' jaws will drop when they see your ball soar forty yards past theirs, they'll ask you what's changed, only you will know.\n9ugn | That being said, when comparing two products or services that satisfy the same desire, the value from the dream outcomes will cancel out since they are the same. It will be the other three variables that drive the difference in perceived value, and ultimately price. For example, if we have two products or services that both help make someone beautiful, it will be the likelihood of achievement, time delay, and effort required that will differentiate the perceived value of each offer.\nzvft | Simply put: if two things make someone beautiful, what makes one worth fifty thousand dollars and another five dollars? Answer: The extent of the other three value variables.\nc1b3 | Number two. Perceived Likelihood of Achievement. Goal equals Increase.\nk969 | This was the last of the variables I added when trying to think through this framework a few years ago. I just felt like something was missing with only the other three.\nvt1d | Then I realized people pay for certainty. They value certainty. I call this the perceived likelihood of achievement. In other words, how likely do I believe it is that I will achieve the result I am looking for if I make this purchase?\n24sn | For example, how much would you pay to be a plastic surgeon's ten thousandth patient versus their first?\no0sh | If you're a normal, sane person, a lot more. I mean heck, you might even ask them to pay you if you are their first patient ever.\n3max | So you can see even from this simple example that while the service you are receiving is technically the same, the only thing that changes is your perceived likelihood of getting what you want.\nsysw | Both surgeons take the same amount of time to do the surgery, if anything, the guy who has done it ten thousand times would likely get it done faster and still charge more. The more-experienced surgeon has a track record of achieving a result, which incentivizes their desirability.\nnbik | People value this perceived likelihood of achievement. Increasing a prospect's conviction that your offer will actually work for them, will make your offer that much more valuable even though the work remains the same on your end. So to increase value with all offers, we must communicate perceived likelihood of achievement through our messaging, proof, what we choose to include or exclude in our offer, and our guarantees, more on these later.\nsqoe | Number three. Time Delay. Goal equals Decrease.",
