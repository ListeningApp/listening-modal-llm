You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ev9d | This is the major perennial reason for the cyclic emergence of living teachers. It is they alone who can restore harmony and balance in circles and individuals which have sacrificed these things in the search for continuity and reassurance in the hope of stabili- sation.
sroj | Were it possible to attain the object in a systematised way, the means to do so would have been enunciated and recorded many thousands of years ago: just as the laws of ordinary material stability and performance are recorded and employed in physics or in applied arts.
n8ae | The reactions of an audience to the efforts of a real teacher to redress the balance of an organisation are always predictable. They will include despair, confusion, desire for stimulus, fear that some- thing might be taken away, rejection, and a desire to accept in order to profit by the 'new phase'.

skze | THE SHIP IN A STORM
s807 | Mulla Nasrudin objected to the captain of a ship making fast the sails aloft, when as he said: 'Can't you see that the trouble is at sea-level !'
9c3r | The teacher, however much he may regret it, can never escape the necessity of saying that it is he who has the technical know- ledge: who decides whether the sails or the hull have to be attended to.
hqgv | If he calms the 'Mulla' by passing ropes around the hull, the ship may never reach port: though the 'Mulla's' death in the storm may take place in the circumstances of the utmost tran- quility, sure in the knowledge that his desires have been fulfilled.
tf20 | There are two kinds of community: one, the community pro- duced and maintained by what is today called indoctrination; the other, the one accumulated and harmonised by starting with the right materials and the right knowledge.
ar2w | The situation with regard to the understanding of the subtler potential of the group and its finer tuning has its analogy in Rumi's explanation of the difference between the different levels of perception of religion. As he says in Fihi ma Fihi:
u6pz | Some are but children on the Path, they drink the milk of the Koran, its literal sense. And those who have reached maturity have a separate perception and another understand- ing, that of the inward significance of the Koran.

6s2c | Concealment of Shortcomings
ugrk | Q: I have seen in an English translation of AW ARIF EL MAARIF, a Sufi textbook, a statement to the effect that a disciple should conceal his teacher's shortcomings. How can a man be a teacher if he has shortcomings?
teua | A: One might almost put it the other way round-how can a teacher be a man unless he has shortcomings? But your question is more properly and probably usefully answered by pointing out that the fact that someone is a disciple means that he is likely to regard some actions of a teacher, which he does not understand, as shortcomings. It is a matter of understanding.
v8g1 | If the student imagines that something said or done by his teacher is a shortcoming when it is not, and this student maintains publicly that his teacher has deficiencies, the results will be un- desirable for everyone.
2y4v | Mark Twain is reported to have said that as a youth he thought his father ignorant. When he grew up he was surprised how much the old man had leamt in so few years. Supposing, then, that in the years between his first and second assessments of his father, he has published the 'fact' that his father was ignorant, what would the consequences have been?
zl6z | But the statement is, above all, a reminder of the need for understanding being paramount.
xmyv | Furthermore, you should know that the Sufis have always main- tained that whatever comes into this 'abode of decay' - the world - must partake of its imperfections.
pu5p | Ghazzali, one of the greatest Sufis, said in the 12th century that: 'The learner should know that he gains more from mistakes of his teacher, even if that teacher makes mistakes, than he gains from his own tightness, even if he is himself right.' Everyone interested in Sufism should ponder this statement carefully.

6z51 | Saints and Heroes
hxt0 | Q: You talk about 'Heroes' and 'Saints'. How are these terms being used?
q1mg | A: A hero is a person who exerts himself at whatever cost, for the sake of values which are recognised by his community as vital. These are always regarded as vital because some form of assess- ment has arrived at them, and some form of acceptance has 'estab- lished' them in the mental set of the people. They are, in short, not necessarily truths, but certainly are agreed principles.
bi15 | A saint, on the other hand, is someone who exerts himself for the sake of what must be done, not what is assumed must be done. His source of knowledge about this necessity is factual (real knowledge, not assumption).
zm4q | Those religious people who sacrifice themselves because they are emotionally conditioned to a doctrine are heroes perhaps, but not saints. Those heroes who sacrifice themselves because of real knowledge, though this may appear to be logical or intellectual knowledge, are in reality saints, as Sufis use the word.
81dg | People tend to follow the 'heroic' trait in heroes and those whom they adopt as saints alike merely because, being prone to condi- tioning and emotional arousal, the public can recognise 'social sacrifice' which belongs to the domain of heroism, but not, in general, 'essential sacrifice', appertaining to the realm of saint- hood. The latter word, in Sufi usage, denotes objective knowledge, not simply miracles or the odour of sanctity.
8gco | Put it like this: If a man dies because by doing this he will save others, and the situation is obvious (an enemy is at the gates) he will be considered a hero, even a saint, or both. But if he dies, or does not die, and makes a sacrifice which is not always under- stood by his fellows, for a cause which they themselves are not heedful enough to perceive, he may be a saint. They may or may not canonise him, depending not upon their perception of his santliness, but upon their opinion of his saintliness or heroism,
0sc2 | 231
yufa | which is a very different thing.
4ggu | Our Mulla Nasrudin shows quite clearly in one of his adventures how people try things 'heroically', and still do not learn - but, on the other hand rationalise their situation so as to satisfy their own desire to prevail. The result is ludicrous to a detached observer, while it may still remain 'logical' to whoever subscribes to the assumptions which prompted the act
vbg6 | Invited to a grandee's court, Nasrudin was offered a horse to ride.
o5y1 | TRICKS AND HORSES
gxus | As soon as it was brought to him, he placed his right foot in the left stirrup, sprang up, and landed on its back, facing the animal's tail.
kfy5 | 'Perhaps you are not accustomed to the mount of gentlemen' sniffed the aristocrat.
eg1f | Terhaps not,' said Nasrudin. 'On the other hand, I prefer to believe that I can see through the tricks of people who try to palm off back-to-front horses on me.'

q93a | The Levels of Service
gxvi | Q. I have heard the 'Three Levels of the Service Situation', that does this mean? How does this accord with Wisdom and how does repentance accord with both?
igdg | A:
3u7c | 1. Structural Level: A man works, obtains money, his employer benefits by selling the product at a profit.
cx2c | 2. Psychological Level: Man 'A' serves, service makes him happy- Man 'B' and/or an organisation benefits through material or emotional gain from 'A's service.
uoim | 3. Higher Level: 'A' serves, acquires merit, avoids consuming it in the form of self-satisfaction or attention-demand. 'B' (or an organisation) benefits because of 'A's progress, and feeds back this benefit into its teaching.
dwsl | Q: But how can a person acquire the balance to derive just so much self-satisfaction from the Stage of Service, and no more, so that he will have 'savings' of constructive service to be of future avail to him?
lpnq | A: There are five requirements which make it possible:
c0cp | 1. The man (or woman) must be able to allow that the foregoing analysis may be correct.
vm3e | 2. He must familiarise himself with the argument, remembering that shallower contentions about analysis of situations and the nature of service are already rooted in his brain.
ky8f | 3- He must realise that merely supposing that he understands the foregoing is often simply a prelude to forgetting it.
gtxr | 4- He has to undergo specialised exercises which help to make it possible for his brain to work consistently in another manner as well as in the conventional one which is now customary to it
ehqu | 5- He has to examine himself to see whether he is expecting too much from his studies or from life in the immediate reward sense,
5hiy | 233
ghiq | and hence being forced to devour valuable experiential nutrition as emotional stimulus to assuage the tensions caused by his random expectations.
ytlm | As to the matter of wisdom and repentance, it is important to note that theologized thinking has assumed that religious people repent in order to gain Divine wisdom or acceptance.
fg9j | But if you realise that numerous authoritative Sufis make a point of the perenniality of Sufism, you will see that there is a stage apart from the current religious frame. In other words, the Sufis claim that before religion must come sense and understanding. Anything else is mechanical or emotional with a likelihood of insufficient depth of understanding.
wt58 | There are a large number of texts in which this point is made, so we can merely adduce one significant instance here. Abu-Nasr Sarraj in his important Kitab al-Luma, explains, after saying that Sufism stems from an era preceding the present Islamic one, that wisdom comes from repentance, partly. Repentance, for the Elect, the mystic, is repentance for forgetting God. But for disciples, learners, wisdom is through repenting one's own short- comings. Before the religious life and understanding comes, the mass of psychological blocks which cause shortcomings must be dealt with. The service situation, about which you have asked, involves activities which cut through these blocks, many of which are concerned with a fixation upon oneself.
gcgx | The matter of balancing the amount of personal stimulus which is permissible is dealt with in Book Six of Saadi's Boston in a memorable passage which enables one to keep the matter in mind. There was once an enlightened man who was given a silken scarf by the King of Khotan. He expanded like a blossom from pleasure, but kissed his hand and said: 'How good the honour of the Shah of Khotan - but how much better one's own [Sufi] mantle!'
xeng | I find this an interesting illustration, because it accords one the right to a necessary degree of emotional stimulus while maintaining the relative importance of the rest of life. This principle is seldom noted in theologized literature, where all things of the world are condemned very often without regard for the necessity for a certain degree of environmental stimulus.

9qk9 | Ritual and Practice
mki0 | Q: I have been told that you have said that it is not always worthwhile to discuss with questioners the status and value of rituals and practices of cults. Why is this?
din5 | A: It is only worthwhile discussing these with people who have the necessary basic information about cult-behaviour and human groups. This is, of course, already available in popular editions of sociological and psychological texts.
qc24 | Time is wasted if one has to explain elementary ideas to people who have come for advanced ones.
ktw4 | It is possible to communicate useful materials only to people who have taken the trouble to inform themselves about what is already known about, say, the social character of cult-groupings.
0wr0 | So many people who have in fact taken this trouble exist and want more advanced information and discussions, that it is unfair to them to try to perform at their expense the elementary educa- tional task which is just as well done by mass-circulation books.
01xg | It is lazy and unworthy of people to come for such information to people who are trying to do more advanced things. It is pre- posterously ignorant of people who are trying to teach to imagine and to lead others to believe that they can teach everyone.
i6d2 | If the applicants have not learnt the first steps, which they can do so easily from readily available materials on cult-formation describing pitfalls and imaginings about cults, what reason has anyone to suppose that they will be able - or willing - to learn the second steps? Such attitudes do not work in any other field; there is no evidence known to me which indicates that they work in our area.
lg8p | People who are willing to learn for themselves what they can on a lower level are thereby giving us evidence that they are ready to learn more. If we are given the reverse evidence, would we not be fools to try to teach them?
3fo4 | 235
bs9g | PRICE OF THE FIRST LESSON
wyx9 | It is worth remembering the tale of Nasrudin when he wanted to learn how to play a musical instrument The fee was five silver pieces for the first lesson, and three for the second and sub- sequent ones. 'Very well,' said the Mulla, 'I'll start with the second lesson.'
lmig | People talk and think endlessly about what rituals and other practices do for them or do not do for them. But what are then- qualifications for assessing such things?
63vd | Rumi gives us an arresting passage in Fihi ma Fihi when he recalls that someone may embrace a pillar in the dark, mistaking it for a loved one. He thinks, for that moment, that this is an experience of love. But what is it really?
ihsk | A person, he continues, may have a whole range of vivid experiences in a dream, which cause him great sorrow. When he wakes up he finds that it was a dream and he loses all his regrets in an instant, even though seconds before they were very real to him. Now he may have an exactly similar dream again, with all the former sorrow recurring. In his sleeping state he does not remember that it was a dream: this, then, becomes for the time being, 'reality' for him.

0qgi | To be Present
awut | If you believe that mechanical regularity in studies, or physical presence, are basic to higher knowledge, you are mistaking them for something else. This other thing is either a reversion to school repetition-learning days, or an unthinking assumption based upon your experience of imitators.
pjzb | Either realise this, and satisfy your attention-demanding and comfort-seeking appetites separately from your studies; or realise it and accept whatever the Teaching can offer you.
a2ry | In the latter case, you will have to follow a course dictated in its conditions and forming by effectiveness and not sentiment.
8zhz | It is the true discrimination between diversion and gen line aspiration which generally precedes the emergence of the capacity to learn.
nokn | Physical presence is not always real presence.
n0c4 | Mechanical performance of actions and reliance on totemistic objects and slogans, which is in fact what many people do and imagine that they are following a teaching, are forms of attachment to what are or amount to objects. Of course, genuine aspiration is hard to maintain, and it is the falling by the wayside of the people ('the birds') in Fariduddin Attar's classic Mantiq al-Tair, the 'Conference of the Birds', which is caused by their craving this attachment.
viyb | Even the intellect, as he reminds us in that book, cannot help - only what is called by the Sufis Love; and yet this itself is love of something to which one cannot attach as to a person or even to a familiar concept. Many Sufi practices, carried out in accordance with the right directions, aim at defeating this mechanical ten- dency and awakening the capacity for attachment to the Real.
dz2n | Being physically present, seeking system and a certain kind of familiar regularity in studies, is something which comes from automatistic thinking. To demand it because one has a predilec- tion for it is hardly constructive.
