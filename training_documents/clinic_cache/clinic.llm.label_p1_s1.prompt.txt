You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

8r5j | Prevalence of stable and successfully treated periodontitis subjects and incidence of subsequent tooth loss within supportive periodontal care: A systematic review with meta-analyses
2taz | Abstract
o3ya | Aim: To identify (i) the prevalence of meeting the endpoints of 'stable periodontitis' (probing pocket depth <LATEX>\left[ P P D \right] \leq 4 m m ,</LATEX> bleeding on probing <LATEX>\left[ B o P \right] < 1 0 ,</LATEX> no BoP at 4 mm sites), 'endpoints of therapy' (no <LATEX>P P D > 4</LATEX> mm with BoP, no <LATEX>P P D \geq 6 m m ,</LATEX> 'con- trolled periodontitis' (â‰¤4 sites with <LATEX>P P D \geq 5 m m ,</LATEX> 'PPD < 5 mm' and <LATEX>P P D < 6 \quad m m</LATEX> at the start of supportive periodontal care [SPC]) and (ii) the incidence of tooth loss in relation to not meeting these endpoints within a minimum of 5 years of SPC.
r5il | Materials and Methods: Systematic electronic and manual searches were conducted to identify studies where subjects, upon completion of active periodontal therapy, entered into SPC. Duplicate screening was performed to find relevant articles. Corre- sponding authors were contacted to confirm inclusion and retrieve required clinical data for further analyses to assess the prevalence of reaching endpoints and inci- dence of subsequent tooth loss, if available, within at least 5 years of SPC. Meta- analyses were carried out to evaluate risk ratios for tooth loss in relation to not reaching the various endpoints.
5gui | Results: Fifteen studies including 12,884 patients and 323,111 teeth were retrieved. Achievement of endpoints at baseline SPC was rare (1.35%, 11.00% and 34.62%, respectively, for 'stable periodontitis', 'endpoints of therapy' and 'controlled periodon- titis'). Less than a third of the 1190 subjects with 5 years of SPC data lost teeth-a total of 3.14% of all teeth were lost. Statistically significant associations with tooth loss, at the subject-level, were found for not achieving 'controlled periodontitis' (relative <LATEX>\left. r i s k \left[ R R \right] = 2 . 5 7 \right) ,</LATEX> PPD < 5 mm <LATEX>\left( R R = 1 . 5 9 \right)</LATEX> and
82qc | <LATEX>P P D < 6 \quad m m \left( R R = 1 . 9 8 \right) .</LATEX> Conclusions: An overwhelming majority of subjects and teeth do not achieve the proposed endpoints for periodontal stability, yet most periodontal patients preserve most of their teeth during an average of 10-13 years in SPC.

7toz | Clinical Relevance
j346 | Scientific rationale for study: The risk of tooth loss is determined by clinical periodontal parameters as established in the literature. Composite measures have been established to determine when it is appropriate to end active periodontal therapy.
v8uq | Principal findings: Only a small proportion of subjects reach currently defined endpoints of periodontal therapy, although tooth loss presents as a rare event in treated periodontitis. Practical implications: The findings are novel and can have a significant impact on clinical prac- tice, policy and research. It may be necessary to revisit the clinical endpoints of periodontal ther- apy to better reflect the risk of tooth loss during supportive periodontal care.
x972 | 1 INTRODUCTION |
cwrw | Defining periodontal health at the subject- and tooth-level is pivotal in establishing acceptable therapeutic endpoints and to evaluate indi- vidualized risk for periodontal disease progression. A successfully treated 'stable periodontitis' subject, as per the World Workshop Classification (WWC) 2017, is defined as one with probing pocket depth (PPD) â‰¤ 4 mm, no bleeding on probing (BoP) at 4 mm sites and BoP in <10% sites (Chapple et al., 2018). The European Federation of Periodontology (EFP) composed S3 treatment guideline-a four-step approach-to treat stages I-III periodontitis. Clinical guidelines for periodontal treatment should consider tangible outcomes-tooth sur- vival and re-treatment (Loos & Needleman, 2020). Based on evidence for disease progression (Claffey & Egelberg, 1995; Matuliene et al., 2008), EFP's S3 treatment guideline proposed 'endpoints of therapy' for a patient to enter supportive periodontal care (SPC)-no PPD > 4 mm with BoP and no PPD â‰¥ 6 mm (Sanz et al., 2020). A 'treat-to-target' approach has also been proposed. 'Controlled peri- odontitis', defined as having â‰¤4 sites with <LATEX>P P D \geq 5 m m ,</LATEX> incorporates the effects of different periodontal treatments (Feres et al., 2020).
4i0e | Guidance may present us with an ideal scenario where unless the endpoints are met, a subject should not enter into SPC. Yet, the evi- dence is unclear whether this is the reality within clinical practice. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the prevalence of treated periodontitis subjects who have met the following definitions:
h2l3 | Â· 'Stable periodontitis' (Chapple et al., 2018)
dfzb | Â· 'Endpoints of therapy' (Sanz et al., 2020)
u6ty | Â· 'Controlled periodontitis' (Feres et al., 2020)
awvu | .
on9b | <LATEX>P P D < 5 \quad m m</LATEX> .
a8ge | <LATEX>P P D < 6 \quad m m</LATEX> With tooth loss being the final sequela of periodontitis, the proposed endpoints should be based on whether their unachievement results in increased tooth loss. Therefore, the relationships between the aforemen- tioned endpoints and subsequent tooth loss during a minimum of 5 years of SPC were also assessed, leading to the following focused questions:

xmgs | Â· Focused question 2 (FQ-2): What is the incidence of periodontitis- related (when reported) or non-specific tooth loss among treated adult periodontitis subjects, using each of the above definitions, who have been in SPC for a minimum of 5 years?
bd9h | 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS |
m047 | 2.1 Protocol development and registration |
gy8c | A systematic review protocol was prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance (Moher et al., 2009). Details of the protocol were registered on PROSPERO on 16 February 2022 (ID: CRD42022310238). Amendments were made to the original protocol to expand the num- ber of endpoints assessed.
y4mj | 2.2 Eligibility criteria |
vpgq | 2.2.1 PICOS components |
ousl | Population: Adult human subjects with periodontitis (excluding as a manifestation of systemic or necrotizing disease), who have completed active periodontal therapy (APT). Studies with inclu- sion/exclusion criteria that would affect the outcome of this sys- tematic review (i.e., prevalence of reaching endpoints) were excluded.
m4ju | Intervention: APT encompasses many interventions ranging from behavioural changes to surgical interventions (Sanz et al., 2020). Stud- ies including a minimum of subgingival non-surgical periodontal ther- apy (NSPT) as part of their APT were selected (FQ-1).
a0mb | Comparison: Not applicable.
ki8m | Outcome measures: The primary outcomes were defined as follows:
km8w | Â· FQ-1 assesses the prevalence of subjects who achieved the afore- mentioned endpoints at the end of APT/start of SPC.
wzno | Â· FQ-2 was the incidence of tooth loss (periodontitis-related when available) for treated subjects who had been in SPC for a minimum of 5 years and its association with various endpoints.
xagm | RATTU ET AL.
iwn5 | Study design: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort (pro- spective/retrospective), case-control and cross-sectional studies pub- lished from 2017 were included. Cross-sectional studies were included if the original retrospective data from the study could be obtained. Studies selected for FQ-1 with a minimum SPC follow-up of 5 years were used to answer FQ-2.
uooz | 2.3 Literature search |
pxbq | A search strategy was formulated with an experienced librarian using a combination of MeSH and free-text terms (Supplemental Material S1), with no language restrictions. Electronic database searches included Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Con- trolled Trials (CENTRAL) and OpenGrey from 2017 to 18 February 2022. This was complemented by a manual search of the Journal of Dental Research, the Journal of Clinical Periodontology, the Journal of Periodontology and the Journal of Periodontal Research from 2017 to 18 February 2022. Reference lists of the included articles and relevant reviews were manually searched. Editors of the above-named journals were contacted about any articles in press that fit the inclusion criteria.
jfsr | 2.4 | Screening and study inclusion
u15r | Study selection was based on a two-step approach: (i) screening of titles and abstracts and (ii) full-text analysis, with reasons for exclusion (Supplemental Material S2). Full texts were obtained for those studies selected by at least one reviewer. Both steps were performed in dupli- cate by two independent reviewers (V.R. and D.R.). Disagreements were resolved by consensus. An arbitrator (L.N.) was consulted if the disagreement could not be resolved. Where studies showed duplica- tion of the subject sample or database, the first published study with all the required data or relevant multi-centre study were selected. Inter-observer agreement at both stages was assessed via the Cohen's kappa statistic. The corresponding authors were contacted to confirm inclusion, as individual patient data (IPD) are rarely reported.
lq35 | 2.5 Data collection |
3g9w | 2.5.1 Data extraction |
d09o | Data were extracted from journal articles based on the general study and population characteristics (Table 1). Subject-, tooth- and site-level data for periodontal parameters <LATEX>\mathrm { \left( P P D \right. } \pm \mathrm { B o P }</LATEX> were extracted from individual 6-point pocket charts or datasets, sent by the journal article authors, by one reviewer (V.R.). Alternatively, the authors completed <LATEX>a</LATEX> summary data collection form if they opted to do their own re- analysis (Supplemental Material S3). Depending on availability, data were for subjects accounted for in the sample size of the selected journal article or the whole database on which the journal article was based. Data were entered into tables stratified by study design on

ex5k | Microsoft Excel. Data consistency, completeness and sequence gener- ation were reviewed by the second reviewer (D.R.). Any disagree- ments were resolved by consensus. An arbitrator (L.N.) was consulted if the disagreement could not be resolved.
9d4o | 2.5.2 RoB assessment |
cjq2 | Quality assessment was carried out by one reviewer (D.R.) and reviewed independently by V.R. Included studies were assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) 2 Tool for RCTs (Sterne et al., 2019), the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort and case-control studies (Wells et al., 2011) and the AXIS tool for cross-sectional studies (Downes et al., 2016). Disagreements were resolved by consensus. An arbitrator (L.N.) was consulted if it could not be resolved.
5esx | 2.6 | Data analyses
m5ka | The data were used to assess the prevalence of achieving the aforemen- tioned endpoints at the subject-level and, when possible, tooth level. Although 'stable periodontitis' defines a case at the subject-level, the com- posite measures defining the endpoint <LATEX>\left( P P D \leq 4 m m \right.</LATEX> and <LATEX>P P D = 4 \quad m m</LATEX> + BoP) were used at the tooth level to identify the teeth responsible for not meeting the endpoint. The number of diseased teeth per patient, as per WWC 2017, was calculated using the total number of 'unstable' teeth divided by the total number of (i) subjects and (ii) 'unstable' subjects.
byu8 | Incidence of tooth loss within a minimum duration of 5 years of SPC was recorded at the subject- and tooth-level in relation to the various endpoints. The number of teeth lost per patient per SPC year was calcu- lated using the total number of teeth lost divided by the total number of subjects with tooth loss data divided by the weighted average SPC years.
76b0 | Authors of journal articles were contacted if any queries arose from the data. Where data were unavailable for a subject, the corre- sponding subject was eliminated from the analyses.
