        "content": "d09o | Alternative K equals negative one loop quantum cosmology\nylhz | An alternative quantization of the gravitational Hamiltonian constraint of the K equals negative one Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model is proposed by treating the Euclidean term and the Lorentzian term independently, mimicking the treatment of full loop quantum gravity. The resulting Hamiltonian constraint operator for the K equals negative one model with a massless scalar field is successfully constructed, and is shown to have the corrected classical limit. Compared to the former quantization schemes in the literature where only the Euclidean term is quantized, the new quantum dynamics of the K equals negative one model with a massless scalar field indicates that the classical big-bang singularity is replaced by an asymmetric quantum bounce.\na3td | One. INTRODUCTION\nex5k | How to quantize general relativity in a consistent manner is a great challenge to theoretical physics. One of the promising candidates is the so-called loop quantum gravity which is a nonperturbative approach to quantum general relativity. In the past three decades, loop quantum gravity has made remarkable progress, such as making the natural predictions of the discretized geometries and providing the microscopic interpretation of black hole entropy. The nonperturbative quantization procedure of loop quantum gravity has been successfully applied to the metric F of R theories, scalar-tensor theories, higher-dimensional gravity, and so on. Despite these achievements, the dynamics of full loop quantum gravity is still an unsolved issue. To gain a certain level of understanding of the dynamics, the quantization ideas and technologies developed in loop quantum gravity have also been applied to its symmetry-reduced models, such as the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models and the spherically symmetric black hole models, leading to loop quantum cosmology and loop quantum black hole models. The most successful feature of loop quantum cosmology is that it can resolve the classical big bang singularity by a quantum bounce due to the quantum geometry effects. We refer to more complete reviews on loop quantum cosmology.\n9d4o | In full loop quantum gravity, the gravitational Hamiltonian constraint is a combination of the so-called Euclidean term and the Lorentzian term. In the spatially flat, K equals zero Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model, the Lorentzian term and the Euclidean term are proportional to each other. Thus one often combines these two terms into one term proportional to the Euclidean term, and then quantizes the Euclidean term to obtain the well-defined gravitational Hamiltonian constraint operator. It turns out that in this quantization scheme the classical big-bang singularity is replaced by a symmetric quantum bounce for the K equals zero Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model with a massless scalar field in the framework of loop quantum cosmology. Note that in full loop quantum gravity, the Lorentzian term is quantized independently by employing the Thiemann's trick. Thus,\ncjq2 | to mimic the full loop quantum gravity quantization procedure in the K equals zero model of loop quantum cosmology, the Euclidean term and the Lorentzian term were treated independently. This alternative quantization scheme leads to an asymmetric quantum bounce, which relates the spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model with an asymptotic de Sitter universe, and thus an effective cosmological constant and an effective Newtonian constant can be obtained.\n5esx | As in the K equals zero model, the quantization technologies for the gravitational Hamiltonian constraint developed in loop quantum gravity have been extended to the K equals negative one and positive one models. Compared to the K equals zero model where the spin connection vanishes and hence the Ashtekar connection equals the extrinsic curvature multiplied by the Immirzi parameter, the Lorentzian term is not proportional to the total Euclidean term, but is proportional to the part of the Euclidean term involving the extrinsic curvature due to the nonvanishing spin connection for both the K equals negative one model and the K equals positive one model. Hence in the literature one often absorbs the Lorentzian term into a part of the Euclidean term, and then quantize the two parts of the Euclidean term, respectively. It turns out that, as in the K equals zero model with the similar treatment, the resulting K equals negative one loop quantum cosmology model also predicts a vacuum repulsion in the high curvature regime that would lead to a symmetric bounce. Moreover, the K equals negative one model of loop quantum cosmology also possesses some new features that never appear in the K equals zero model, for example, due to a vacuum repulsion in the high curvature regime, the scale factor has the minimum value as A min equals YV A. It is natural to ask whether the treatment of the Lorentzian term independently, mimicking the treatment in the full theory, can be directly carried to the K equals negative one model, and whether an asymmetric bounce can still be held for the K equals negative one model. This is the main motivation of the present paper. In this paper, we consider an alternative quantization of the gravitational Hamiltonian constraint in the K equals negative one model by treating the Lorentzian term independently.\nm5ka | This paper is organized as follows. The canonical formulation of the K equals negative one model is briefly recalled in Section two. Then we propose an alternative gravitational Hamiltonian constraint operator by treating the Lorentzian term independently, and provide a new quantum dynamics for the K equals negative one model in Section three. The effective theory of the new quantum dynamics and its asymptotic behavior are studied in Section four. Summary\nbyu8 | is included in the last section.\n76b0 | Two.
