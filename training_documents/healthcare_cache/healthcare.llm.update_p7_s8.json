        "content": "bqfb | A green health care insurance company would be accountable for environmentally sound practices. From fair-exchange coffee, to \"cruelty free\" cosmetics, to locally grown food, more customers are willing to support companies that unite ethics with the product they supply. Each year, a handful of articles call on health care to divest from fossil fuel sources. Sustainable energy and investment in renewable sources are two ways an insurance company can be green. Alternatively, a green insurance company might choose to partner only with health care facilities that are members of organizations which actively participate in sustainability initiatives, such as Practice GreenHealth, Health Care Without Harm, the Healthier Hospitals Initiative, and the Catholic Health Association.\nwwdt | To be sure, insurance companies are dependent on many different supply chains. For instance, pharmaceuticals are known environmental menaces and consistently one of the largest carbon emitters in health care. Requiring environmental accountability from drug companies would be a significant first step for greening insurance companies, with ample data to support the move. Once sustainability measures are in place, insurance companies can brand themselves as green, thus rising as visible leaders in green health care reform.\nmn1r | Five. Conclusion\n5vqw | While there is justified suspicion about American health care - which is capitalistic and atomized - the potential for individuals to change the system is also the greatest strength. Historically, health care policymakers have been amenable to stakeholder requests and willing to comply with patient and doctor demands. Such was the case with lowering the cost of HIV-medications. Many patients and physicians recognize that a healthy body and mind depend on a healthy planet. Their collective actions can stimulate green health care reform.\nmeyw | Cheryl Macpherson, Elise Smith, and Travis Rieder maintain, \"given the goals of health care, claims of\n2e62 | and calls for health promotion are hypocritical unless they involve strategies and policies that explicitly protect environments and natural resources.\" Patient and doctor participation in green initiatives, in tandem with advocacy, makes green health care reform not only possible, but truly a requirement of climate change.",
