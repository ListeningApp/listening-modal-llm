You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

cp13 | As expected, the cross section of the FP state in Fig. 7(c) is isotropic and exhibits a single broad peak centered at <LATEX>q = 0</LATEX> mainly caused by the component <LATEX>\mathcal{S} _ { z z }</LATEX> parallel to the external field. The contributions in <LATEX>\mathcal{S} _ { \alpha \beta }</LATEX> (& <LATEX>\in \left\{ x , y \right\} ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. \beta \in \left\{ x , y , z \right\} \right)</LATEX> are attributed to finite-size effects, caused by a helical winding of <LATEX>\langle S _ { r } \rangle</LATEX> near the boundaries due to the strong DMI interaction (see Fig. 2). The azimuthal average of the cross section in Fig. 7(c), defined as <LATEX>\left( 2 \pi \right) ^ { - 1 } \int _ { 0 } ^ { 2 \pi } d \varphi \left( d \sigma / d \Omega \right)</LATEX> can be well described by the form factor of a uniformly polarized thin circular disk with a radius <LATEX>R</LATEX> corresponding to the cluster ra- dius, i.e., <LATEX>d \sigma / d \Omega \left( q \right) \propto \left[ 2 J _ { 1 } \left( q R \right) / \left( q R \right) \right] ^ { 2 } ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>J _ { 1 } \left( z \right)</LATEX> the first-order Bessel function. To highlight this play the first two minima of <LATEX>\left[ J _ { 1 } \left( q R \right) / \left( q R \right) \right] ^ { 2 }</LATEX> (for <LATEX>\left. R = 4 a \right)</LATEX> by dotted white lines in Fig. 7(c) and find a very good agreement to the numerical data of the discrete system. The HS state in Fig. 7(a) is characterized by a superposition of spin spirals with wave vectors <LATEX>q \neq 0 ,</LATEX> resulting in six pronounced Bragg peaks <LATEX>\mathrm { i n } \mathcal{S} _ { z z } \left( q \right) .</LATEX> We observe in the SK phase a superposition of the two extreme limits: In particular, we find a Bragg peak at <LATEX>q = 0 ,</LATEX> together with an off-diagonal Bragg "ring" caused by the radial polarization winding of the skyrmion [see Fig. 7(b)]. The radius of the skyrmion can be as <LATEX>r _ { 0 } = q _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } \approx 3 a</LATEX> with <LATEX>q _ { 0 } \approx 1 / \left( 3 a \right)</LATEX> the momentum <LATEX>q \neq 0</LATEX> ring, consistent with the estimate given in Fig. 3. Hence, the predicted quantum skyrmion profile yields a distinct signature in the measurable neutron scattering cross section and allows a determination of its size. We want to stress that a classical spin
bgre | profile compatible to the (normalized) quantum mechanical expectation values can lead to a cross section in qualitative agreement with the ones reported here. However, quantitative deviations are expected because, for classical systems, the spin-spin correlation functions factorize since the zero tem- perature configuration is nondegenerate for B = 0. Therefore, a direct measurement of the connected spin-spin correlation function (a,rÔß,r) - («,r) {ỡß,r) will differentiate classical from quantum skyrmion states at zero temperature. Classi- cal and quantum states also differ locally in the spin norm, which is not necessarily conserved in general | (Sr) | ≤ 1/2. We find that the domain wall spin norm at the outer rim of the skyrmion (where the concurrence is large) is about 4% lower compared to the field-polarized environment.
57lp | VI. QUANTUM SKYRMION LATTICE PHASE
ukth | After having discussed the properties of individual quan- tum skyrmions in the preceding paragraphs, we now turn to the phase diagram of the system. Our numerical technique makes it possible to reach system sizes much larger than that of individual skyrmions, which in principle allows us to extrapolate toward a phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit. While the HS and the FP phase remain unchanged when increasing the system size, at intermediate magnetic fields, the ground state for large lattices features a regular lattice of quantum skyrmions (SKX). Similarly to their classical analogs, the individual skyrmions form a dense packing, and for larger system sizes, we thus find quantum skyrmion chains and lattices, for which we plot examples in Fig. 8.
kpvt | We elucidate the appearance and robustness of quantum skyrmion lattices as a function of the external magnetic field, the strength of DMI, and perturbations of the form Eq. (2) due to uniaxial anisotropy. For this calculation, we have concen- trated on a triangular lattice with disk boundary conditions of diameter L = 9 sites, for which we obtain a single centered skyrmion for B = J = - 0.5D in the unperturbed case K = 0 [see Fig. 2(e)]. We relax the fine-tuned parameter lines of Fig. 2 by variations of B, J, and consider nonzero uniaxial anisotropies for J < 0 by varying K.
jie2 | Based on our simulations, we predict the existence of at least three distinct quantum phases of our model: (i) a region hosting HS states for weak field amplitudes, (ii) a valley for field strengths of the order of B ~ - 0.5D, which features a lattice formed by quantum skyrmions of radius r ~ 3a (SKX3a), and (iii) an FP phase where spins align parallel to the external field.
