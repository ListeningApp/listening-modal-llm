  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

awvu | 3 Indicators for safe operations of hydrogen in pore storage systems
on9b | There are recommendations and evaluation schemes for the geotechnical and energetic use of the subsurface on a German and European level based on the operation of hydrocarbon reservoirs, underground storage facilities for both natural gas and CO2, the search for radioactive repositories and the utilization of geothermal resources (e.g., Sedlacek, 1999a; Sedlacek, 1999b; Chadwick et al., 2008; Reinhold et al., 2011; Alfarra et al., 2020; Stober and Bucher, 2021). Here we report positive and cautionary indicators for safe operations with hydrogen in underground pore storage systems based on a literature survey. The results are summarized in Table 1.
a8ge | 3.1 Biotic and abiotic reactions
h27a | Depleted fields and aquifers are composed of either sandstones or limestones. Sandstones, consist primarily of stable, non-reactive silicate minerals, namely, quartz and feldspar that will not react with hydrogen at reservoir conditions (Flesch, et al., 2018; Yekta et al., 2018). Major components in limestone reservoirs and mineral accessories in sandstones or in the caprock, however, may form reactions with hydrogen forming toxic gases such as hydrogen sulphide. Possible reactants include carbonate [CaCO3, MgCO3,

xmgs | (Ca, Mg) CO3], sulfate (CuSO4, CuSO4H2O), sulphide (S, FeS, FeS2, PbS, HgS, ZnS, Cu2S, CuFeS2, CS2), and oxide (Fe2O3, Fe3O4, FeO, MgO) minerals and reservoir gases such as CO, CO2, and hydrocarbons (Foh et al., 1979). However most of these reactions are insignificant at reservoir conditions, because hydrogen redox reactivity is kinetically limited due to its high bonding energy and thus most of the possible redox reactions remain insignificant at low temperature (Truche et al., 2013; Panfilov, 2016). However, experimental data by Truche et al. (2013) demonstrates that hydrogen induced reduction of pyrite into pyrrhotite is likely to produce sulphide at reservoir conditions and that the pH of the media is a critical parameter controlling the extent of the reaction at low temperature. This is consistent with field observations in the town gas storage field in Beynes, France, where pyrite reduction is believed to be responsible for the observed rise in hydrogen sulphide within the reservoir (Bourgeois et al., 1979). Although this represents a potential risk to underground hydrogen storage, the study by Truche et al. (2013) also shows that pyrite reduction could be prevented at acidic reservoir conditions.

gy8c | In contrast to abiotic reactions, the extent and impact of which is discussed in the literature (e.g., Foh et al., 1979; Truche et al., 2010; 2013; Yekta et al., 2018), it is widely agreed that biotic processes may endanger hydrogen quality and/or lead to hydrogen consumption (Šmigáň, et al., 1990; Buzek, et al., 1994; Reitenbach et al., 1995; Panfilov, 2016; Heinemann et al., 2021c; Zivar et al., 2021). Several classes of microorganisms present at reservoir conditions are known for consuming hydrogen, which are methanogens, hydrogenotrophic sulfate reducers, homoacetogens and hydrogenotrophic iron (III)- reducing bacteria (Reitenbach et al., 1995; Panfilov, 2016; Heinemann et al., 2021c). Possible implications might include the production of methane (CH4), acetic acid (CH3COOH), and hydrogen sulphide (H2S) in addition to hydrogen loss (Reitenbach et al., 1995; Panfilov, 2016; Heinemann et al., 2021c). A well-known example for such biotic hydrogen loss is the Czech underground storage facility Lobodice in which methanogens were shown to transform hydrogen and carbon dioxide to methane, resulting in significant hydrogen reduction from 54 vol% (input) to 37 vol% (output) over a time period of 7 months (Šmigáň et al., 1990). Optimum conditions

vpgq | where growth peaks and critical conditions beyond which no growth is possible were summarized for several classes of microorganisms by Heinemann et al. (2021c) showing that most bacteria favour moderate temperatures (20-40℃), salinity (<100 g/L) and pH (6-7.5) [Heinemann et al. (2021c) and references therein].
ousl | 3.2 Petrophysical properties of prospective pore storage systems
m4ju | The petrophysical properties of prospective pore storage systems are important factors to consider when selecting a site for underground gas storage (e.g., Hematpur et al., 2023). It is noteworthy that the optimal porosity and intrinsic permeability values for rock formations utilized in gas storage may vary depending on the specific storage application and the type of gas being stored. For instance, high-pressure storage applications may necessitate higher permeability than low-pressure storage. Other factors such as effective stress state, temperature, and deformation state must also be considered when evaluating the suitability of a rock formation for underground storage.
a0mb | Technically in UHS operations, a rock with high porosity and permeability is more desirable for hydrogen storage because it allows for higher storage volumes as well as higher injection and withdrawal rates representing the unloading and loading cycles, respectively. Higher energy efficiencies tend to be expected for high intrinsic permeability rock types when hydrogen is injected into them (Pan et al., 2021a). Furthermore, the hydraulic properties of the reservoir rock are a key factor influencing the interaction between fluid pressure and mechanical properties of the reservoir, known as hydro-mechanical coupling (e.g., Rutqvist and Stephansson, 2003; Bai and Tahmasebi, 2002). The permeability controls the fluid flow and thus the temporal and spatial distribution of fluid pressure, which in turn affects the effective stress state of the reservoir and its mechanical properties. This interaction must be considered and studied in the design and operation of UHS systems, as it can change the security and efficiency of the storage process to a significant degree. Zones of high permeability can reduce the risk of high fluid-pressure transients in the reservoir and around the wells, and thus the risk of inelastic rock deformation. Local high-pressure zones can form within low-permeability rocks, leading to aftershocks and induced seismicity in worst-case scenarios (e.g., Pawar et al., 2015; White and Foxall, 2016). In addition, low-pressure zones in the reservoir and around the wells can lead to a decrease in the production rate.
ki8m | Although hydrogen storage has been extensively researched, to the authors' knowledge, there is currently no recommendation as to which rock type, porosity, and permeability is best suited for UHS. Therefore, requirements for the effective porosity (i.e., connected porosity), intrinsic permeability and reservoir thickness for UHS operations are derived from the experience of the hydrocarbon and geothermal industry (Sedlacek, 1999b; May et al., 2004; Chadwick et al., 2008; Heidug, 2013; Stober and Bucher, 2021) as well as conceptual studies on potential international hydrogen storage in depleted reservoir settings: Chadwick et al. (2008) summarized that porosities and permeabilities of at least 0.20 and 500 mD (approx. <LATEX>5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 3 } m ^ { 2 }</LATEX> are considered ideal geologic storage conditions. Porosities of less than 0.1 and permeabilities of less than 200 mD (approx. <LATEX>2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 3 } m ^ { 2 }</LATEX> are considered cautionary indicators by these authors. Sedlacek (1999b) propounds that -from a geological and

iwn5 | reservoir perspective-porosities and permeabilities within the range of 18 to 15% and greater than 100 mD are suitable for gas reservoirs, respectively. All these indicative limits are consistent with the study by Pfeiffer and Bauer (2015) for subsurface porous media hydrogen storage, which used on-site and off-site porosities and permeabilities of the Middle Rhaetian (main sandstone) of Northern Germany of 0.33 and 572 mD, respectively. Similar porosities (0.1-0.3) and permeabilities in the range of 20-2,500 mD are also used by other studies on UHS (Amid et al., 2016; Heinemann et al., 2018; Hemme and Berk, 2018; Zivar et al., 2021; Lysyy et al., 2021). On the basis of these literature values, we suggest permeabilities and porosities greater than 500 mD and 0.2, respectively, for optimal and safe operation of UHS systems (Table 1). However, the range of porosity and permeability depends on the specific properties of the rock formation, so a thorough petrophysical characterization of the rock is required in advance to determine its suitability for hydrogen storage. In addition to the consideration of intrinsic permeability, the characterization of relative permeability in wet porous rocks is crucial for optimizing storage capacity and recovery efficiency. The determination of the relative permeability of hydrogen- brine rock systems is very complex as it depends on the number of hydrogen injection and reproduction cycles as well as the capillary forces responsible for residual hydrogen trapping. Accordingly, these parameters should be determined based on experimental measurements to determine the intrinsic permeability.
uooz | 3.3 Storage depth, sealing capacity, and integrity of caprock
pxbq | The seal capacity of a reservoir refers to the ability of the rock layers above the reservoir (seals) to prevent the upward migration of fluids or gases out of the reservoir. The seal capacity is therefore critical for the effective trapping and storage of hydrogen in a reservoir, allowing for the efficient extraction and utilization of the resource. The dominant trapping mechanism is the capillary properties of the cap rock that will trap a hydrogen column until the net buoyancy (i.e., difference between hydrogen and brine) exceeds the capillary displacement pressure of the seal (Watts, 1987). The properties that define the capillary entry pressure are the size of the largest interconnected pore throat of the cap rock, the hydrogen- brine interfacial tension (IFT) and wetting behavior of the cap rock with respect to hydrogen and brine, expressed by the brine-rock- hydrogen contact angle <LATEX>\theta</LATEX> (see detailed review by Aslannezhad et al., 2023). The height of the trapped hydrogen column can thus be expressed by balancing the buoyancy and capillary entry pressure:
jfsr | <LATEX>h = \frac { 2 \times I F T \times \cos \theta } { r \times g \times \Delta \rho }</LATEX> (1)
u15r | The hydrogen-water and hydrogen-brine interfacial tension was measured experimentally by Chow et al. (2018) and Hosseini et al. (2022) and was shown to decline with depth, but increase with salinity. However, under storage conditions (1,000 m and 50℃), the <LATEX>I F T</LATEX> remains relatively high <LATEX>\left( \sim 7 0 m N / m ^ { 2 } \right)</LATEX> and hydrogen and brine remain immiscible (Chow et al., 2018; Hosseini et al., 2022; Iglauer, 2022). Hydrogen wettability of selected minerals were also measured and calculated in a few studies. Hydrogen wettability of quartz (pure and aged with stearic acid) were reported to increase with organic acid surface concentration, pressure and temperature (Iglauer et al.,
