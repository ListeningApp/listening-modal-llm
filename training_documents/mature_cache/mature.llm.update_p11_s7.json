        "content": "7h0h | Initial proposition hearable as extreme\na64c | Concession positions the original proposition as disputable\ngi7n | Revised, weaker statement hearable now as more reasoned\n3pn1 | In the extract below, Don and Hal build two rather robust concessions to manage\nwjuz | propositions that display interest or importance in looks. They then partially weaken the force of such concessions through strategically designed reassertions.\n3yxv | Excerpt three\nd8zj | Participants: Moderator, Don, Hal, Andy\nywxn | Moderator: so looks Timportant not that important really, or=\nuxhs | Don: =no not=\ned6e | Moderator: =although good looking is not bad\n6qqm | Don: yeah but not unless like you don't know em' not unless only 5 when you don't know em then looks do everything for you\nonum | Moderator: but you know do you think guys are more interested in girls' 7 looks than girls are interested in guys' looks\n3iir | Hal: guys are more so but you have to go through a certain number of girls first like that number in growing up you know to\n7a0a | to see through girls I don't know if they've went through that I did and I don't really count on looks no more but it still has to be there you know you can't be like the ugliest girl you know it still has to be like half-and-half I don't want like the prettiest girl in the world=\no1qp | \njrik | \nxv78 | Don: =you can't always have it you can't always have the prettiest girl\nsdks | Hal: I did though remember Kayla\ny8fb | Andy: [ahh yea']\n521q | Don: [OHH: ah] yeah he did he 19 was like the luckiest man in the world\nyogo | Below is an abridged version of the way their propositions, concessions, and reassertions are sequentially arranged:\n2285 | Initial proposition - Only when you don't know them, looks do everything for you - line five\nys0g | Concession one - But as you grow older, you count on looks less and less - lines eight to eleven\n7zvp | Revised, weaker statement - Although looks are still necessary - line twelve\nww6u | Concession two - But you can't always have the prettiest girl - line fifteen\nhpi6 | Revised, weaker statement - But I once did have the prettiest girl, remember Kayla - line sixteen\n4uhb | The moderator opens with a three-part list on the topic of looks line one - looks as 'important', 'not that important really', and the 'or' seems to indicate a forthcoming third option or invitation to respond to the first two. Don cuts in and seems to orient to the 'not that important' option line two. The moderator quickly cuts back in line three and softly amends it to 'although good looking is not bad'. By doing this, he is able to offer a third option that maintains the importance of looks before Don can fully construct a position to the contrary. Don agrees with this more softened option, and goes on to draw up the initial proposition that when you do not know the person, 'looks do everything for you' line five. Hal's first concession comes several lines later lines eight to eleven, and it positions Hal in at least three ways. It softens the extremity of 'looks do everything' in Don's original proposition, it insulates guys' interests in girls' looks from appearing unaffected by maturation, and it makes Hal appear sexually mature, experienced, and reasonable. Despite his concession, however, Hal shifts back in line twelve to the tenor of the original proposition in saying 'but it still has to be there you\ny51p | know you can't be like the ugliest girl'. This weaker statement is designed to counter the concession itself, as if to make sure Hal doesn't now appear too mature, and thus totally uninterested in girls' looks. But then, both he and Don lines fourteen to fifteen soften again this already weaker statement by admitting that having the prettiest girl is not always possible, nor do they necessarily want it. Again, this concession is designed to fend off potential counter-arguments, and offers a more mature position that appears rational, in the sense of 'knowing' that always having the prettiest girl is not realistic. Thus, 'doing maturity' emerges as the discursive effect of concessive repair practices.\nx95m | However, in line sixteen, Hal's aside to Don 'I did though remember Kayla' and Andy and Don's celebration of it in lines seventeen to eighteen works yet again as a reassertion that undermines the maturity heard in the second concession. But because it is delivered as an afterthought with Hal turning to Don and Andy and saying it with a downshift in voice, it carries a kind of off-the-record quality, marking its status as a direct or serious reassertion of the original proposition as ambiguous. The ambiguousness is essential for bringing off the hearable immaturity of reassertion without trouble. The laughter constructs the reassertion as both ironic, and thus less serious, but yet still invested to some degree in bragging about it. In other words, while the concession allows Hal and Don to counter the threat of appearing immature and overly preoccupied or na√Øve about looks, the design of the reassertion allows them to buy back into a kind of sexual interest that celebrates Hal's status as a sexual man 'luckiest man in the world' for having had a really pretty girl. By strategically employing concessive repairs, the boys are able to position themselves as mature while simultaneously attending to their interest in heterosexual attraction.\nyfum | The next excerpt from a different group discussion involves a precarious negotiation of young males' interest in a particular girl whom they know from school and who they have characterized earlier in the discussion as someone who sleeps around a lot. In what follows, the moderator inquires about their potential interest in such a girl. Managing an interest is done in a delicate tongue-in-cheek way that protects them from appearing immature or desperate.\nppx4 | Excerpt four Participants: Moderator, Bob, Dirk, Carl\nqf11 | Moderator: okay different question and no need to uh but isn't there\n8oqt | a little bit of attraction there in this kind of stuff\n6zah | Carl: shakes head no\n4v5o | Dirk: YEAH RIGHT\nha9e | Bob: NOT HER Dirk and Bob look at each other and smile\nxrnt | Moderator: okay okay okay okay I just was asking=\nc8ra | \np1l0 | Dirk: =attraction between makes inquisitive smile face at moderator\n1i8b | Moderator: well if I if I uhh well I don't know I was just thinking gee if I=\n5sfj | Bob: =I don't find her attractive at all=",
