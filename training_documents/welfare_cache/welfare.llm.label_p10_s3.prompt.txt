You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ki8m | Characterizing the Norwegian reform trajectory since 2000, Breit et al. (2022) identify three phases. The first phase (2000-2007) involves the establishment of the new NAV organization, and experimentation with integrated work forms. The NAV reform included a merger between the two state administrations (for National Insurance and Labour Market) and municipal welfare services in one-stop local agencies, and the PES moved from a buyer-supplier model to integration and some decentralisation. With its weight on horizontal coordination and autonomy at the local level, the NAV reform displayed traces of a NPG paradigm that frontline managers during the reform process operationalised in a more integrated office.
km8w | In 2008-2014, a broader reform followed to increase efficiency, e.g. by re-centralization of the national insurance administration, (digital) standardized work tools for client services and performance indicators and requirements regarding documentation (Andreassen 2019; Jantz et al. 2015). This second phase involved a roll back and a return to NPM ideas, an effort to turn the frontline offices into single purpose organizations for employment services only (preferable
wzno | 10
xagm | to the most job-ready clients) by reducing the number of municipal services and the withdrawal of national insurance benefit case processing to regional administrative units. Additionally, the ministry and the NAV directorate governed the frontline offices through performance measures and efforts to standardise the organizational design and the work of the frontline offices (Jantz et al. 2015; Andreassen 2019). Unlike the Netherlands, rising unemployment did not led to cutbacks but to higher budgets for labour market measures.
iwn5 | From 2015, a third policy change breathed new life into the importance of professionalism in service provision. In many ways, the NAV returned to the original reform ideas of the early 2000s, underlining integrated services and local self-government in developing new forms of professionalism and experimentation at the street level (Fossest√∏l, Borg and Breit 2020). This phase included a return to NPG ideas of horizontal coordination within and outside the NAV offices, and a greater focus on professionalism and clients with more complex issues, in need
uooz | digitization of communication with clients, but depending on the local NAV manager. In recent years, the trend from 2015 has strengthened, but we also notice the merger of municipalities and NAV offices into much larger first-line organizations, which points to NPM ideas for efficiency at a decentralized level.
pxbq | In sum, in Norway we see a move from a TPA/NPM based system in the 1990s to NPG in the early 2000s, followed by more emphasis on NPM at the end of 2000s and a revival of NPG since 2015. The current trend is reinforcing the NPG reform but also a move towards more efficiency (NPM) with municipal mergers and larger regional NAV agencies, argued to strengthen professionalization and specialization. The next section will show that the Dutch reform of the welfare administration ultimately has many parallels with the Norwegian one (growing convergence), but along a completely divergent route.

lq35 | Traditionally, and similar to Norway, there was a strong division between the welfare administration of social benefits, PES, and social assistance. Social benefits in the Netherlands were executed by sectoral organizations governed by social partners; PES was a central government department and social assistance the traditional domain of municipalities. The welfare system was increasingly criticized in the 1980s for high unemployment and disability, and a low degree of activation (Van Oorschot 2006). The PES hierarchy increasingly came under fire for its inability to reverse this trend. After ten years of negotiations between government and social partners, this resulted in a radical reform (PES Act 1990) for a new governance structure with central and regional three-party boards with equal seats for government, employers' associations and unions (3-3-3). So we see here the idea of collaborative networks on a horizontal basis (NPG), in contrast with a principal-agent model (NPM) for PES in Norway in the 1990s.
3g9w | In 2002, the Dutch government implemented a much wider reform with the SUWI Act, encompassing a completely new organizational structure for both social benefits and the PES. The SUWI reform came after endless negotiations since 1994 for 'marketization' in the benefit administration that resulted in an impasse (Van Gestel and Hillebrand 2011). Different from the NAV reform in Norway, SUWI was a typical combination of TPA and NPM, with a minor role for NPG. A large national organization (UWV) was created from a merger of five sector organizations for the implementation of benefits, formerly led by social partners and now centrally managed by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment (a switch to TPA). At the same time, PES' job matching task was outsourced to private agencies, in a principal-agent model (NPM) where UWV, municipalities and employers had to act as principals. New Centers for Work and Income (CWI) were set up for the first registration for benefits and assistance.
d09o | The UWV, CWI and municipalities were expected to offer 'integrated services', but the how was left open.
ylhz | In 2008 we saw a merger of UWV and CWI which can be regarded as a re-establishment of the PES, but with limited tasks and significant cutbacks. NPM-type reform became even stronger in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis and growing unemployment. The already minor role of NPG in the original SUWI reform (2002) received even less political support these years: UWV and municipalities were no longer expected to provide integrated one-stop- shop services (SUWI Act 2012), justifying the closure of two-thirds of the 98 shared job centers which had been laboriously built up over the past decade. The national government made further major cutbacks at the UWV, as a result of which 50% of the work coaches lost their jobs and personal contact with clients was replaced by full digitization for most clients. In the general trend towards maximum efficiency (NPM), also sheltered workshops were no longer allowed to take on new clients that are supposed to find a 'regular job' at the labour market.
a3td | In 2015, as in Norway, but in the Netherlands boosted by a social agreement with the social partners in 2013, we see some revival of NPG in horizontal cooperation of government authorities (municipalities and UWV) and social partners in 35 'labour market regions'. Regional Boards (Work Chambers) should coordinate the implementation of the Jobs Agreement Act (2015) as part of the social agreement with social partners, aiming for 125.000 jobs in 2026 for people with physical and/or mental handicaps. With the Participation Act (2015), local governments should conduct and integrate diverse social services (next to income support) and the largest municipality in each region has to coordinate regional collaboration with public and private parties for implementing the Jobs Agreement.
ex5k | Although policy rhetoric was much about "decentralisation" in the Netherlands since 2015, national regulations and conditions, e.g. for one service point to employers in each region and subsidized labour market projects showed a gradual tendency toward recentralisation and
9d4o | 13
cjq2 | standardization. In 2020, the Dutch government together with social partners, UWV and municipalities initiated Regional Mobility Teams (RMTs) to deal with an expected high job loss due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Here NPG ideas of holistic services and collaboration between public and private partners returned to the reform agenda. In the latest revision of the SUWI Act (2021), the RMTs were legally grounded, and a wider reform for Regional Work Centres is initiated by the national government.3 So there is reinforcement of the NPG trend from 2015; but with a larger role of central government and social partners despite 'decentralization'.
5esx | In sum, the Netherlands initially took an opposite reform trajectory than Norway in the 1990s, with a move to NPG for PES instead of Norway with a more traditional administration (TPA) combined with a principal-agent model (NPM). In the next decade, both countries switched their system in opposite directions, with the SUWI reform in 2002 (TPA/NPM) and the NAV reform in 2006 (NPG). Reform in both countries thus shows major divergence, both over time and between the two nations. Since 2008, we have seen more convergence as both nations have adopted (or extended) NPM to increase efficiency. Subsequent convergence is also visible in reforms (2015) for decentralization and street-level professionalism (NPG); and most recently in recentralization and standardization (NPM) alongside a continued push for collaborative, person-centred services (NPG). So there is growing hybridity, but not necessarily more balance in welfare state governance.
m5ka | Divergence between Norway and the Netherlands in the current welfare administrations
byu8 | Despite growing convergence in reform trends over the past 15 years, there is significant divergence between the current two welfare administrations. We focus here on two key themes:
76b0 | the relationship between central and decentralized governance (levels) and the role and position of key stakeholders (clients, social partners).
zxz6 | Divergence in the relationship between governance levels (see Table 3)
xnth | At the ministry level in Norway, both the state and the municipal part of NAV are the responsibility of Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion. From the establishment of NAV in 2006, there were 456 local/regional offices, small and large. NAV consists of two hierarchies: 1) a state hierarchy of the directorate (national agency), regional offices and frontline offices, governed hierarchically, by instructions (although with a certain level of local autonomy), 2) a relationship from the national level (the directorate), via supervision authorities at the regional level inspecting that municipalities fill their legal obligation to provide social services to the citizens. Cooperation at the local level can be voluntarily extended with other municipal social services, for example social housing, dept counselling, or for integration of newly arrived
vafm | municipal services such as services for people with problems on (mental) health and drugs abuse.
2zmw | The NAV governance system is complicated in more ways: The regional offices (at the provincial level) are only "state" offices, with no role for municipalities. Also, the NAV directorate is both the highest management (of employment services and national insurances) with instructional authority, and supervisor (of municipal social services) but without instructional authority.4 As a result of mergers between municipalities and formalized cooperation between many NAV offices, the number of first-line offices was reduced to 268 since 2020, with a simultaneous increase in scale to enable more "robust", professional offices. This will probably result in more internal specialization and less voice for the municipalities.

otkr | Table 3 Central and decentralized governance in two welfare administrations
ibgs | The Dutch welfare administration is managed differently, but the relationship between levels of government is just as complicated. Unlike the NAV, the national state agency UWV and the 342 Dutch municipalities (2023) are separate public agencies. There is a split in regulation, clients and tasks: UWV is responsible for social benefits and employment services to the insured population of unemployed and disabled. Municipalities are responsible for social assistance and related services to the unemployed without acquired rights for insurance based benefits or other income means (partner income, savings, house etc.). As a national executive agency, UWV is governed within ministerial authority (but with a certain leeway). But municipalities have formal autonomy, even though many tasks are delegated and financed by the central state. The UWV and municipalities in 35 labour market regions are obliged to
colo | 16
d6r4 | cooperate with social partners for the Jobs Agreement Act 2015 (and for regional labour market projects subsidized by national government), but neither the central level nor the local government (or social partners) have instructional authority and they will all have to arrive at shared goals and decisions.
9mrz | Divergence between Norway and Netherlands in relationships with key stakeholders (Table 4) Increasingly the NAV offices are serving clients with reduced work capacity (not only caused by health conditions). Contact between jobseekers and employers is digitised and based on self- service. Retirement pension is digitised, so is income security under parental leave. Related to the NAV reform, the Directorate established "user councils" at the central, regional, and local level with members representing associations of clients as well as the employers (although not particularly well-functioning at the local level). New mandates for the councils were given in 2015. At the central level, the council is now described as a collaborative forum and an advisory body.
pk06 | The Dutch UWV is serving only the insured clients with a work history. Contact between jobseekers and UWV is digitised and based on self-service, with face-to-face contact especially for the 'hard-to-place'. Municipalities serve clients on social assistance. With the SUWI reform, the Ministry established "user councils" at the central and local level with members representing associations of clients. Municipalities also have client councils, often volunteers. At the central level, the client council (LCR) is described as an advisory body. They are only asked for advice by the government on policy implementation, not on policy or legislation itself.
7wn9 | Table 4 Welfare administrations: Relationships with clients and partners
wcd0 | In Norway, social partners do not have a governing role in the welfare administration for long now. Before 1999 the Directorate of labour had a board with members of the social partners; in 1999 this board was replaced by an advisory council, with additional employer and employee associations. The ministry argued that this was in compliance with the ILO obligations. From 2004 the Ministry has had a council for labour market and pension policy with social partners as members. Another kind of involvement of the social partners is the steady progress of so- called tripartite agreements on a more inclusive working life (the first concluded in 2001), aimed at preventing and reducing absenteeism and withdrawal from working life, previously also at the inclusion of people with disabilities and other groups outside the labour market. The latter goal has been removed from the agreement and replaced by a so-called "Inkluderingsdugnad" - a type of voluntary joint effort, introduced in 2018.
caos | In the Netherlands, before 2002, social partners had a strong governing role in the welfare administration. With the SUWI reform, the social partners lost all their power in the executive
qrvy | bodies of social benefits and the PES, which was a major shock in the Dutch corporatist landscape. The former governing role of the social partners in social benefits was moved to a national state agency (UWV) and their major role in the PES board was 'replaced' by an advisory body (the Council for Work and Income, 2002-2012). In 2013, the social partners reached a so called "social agreement" with the government, including a Jobs Agreement for people with (physical/mental) disabilities. In 2015, this led to a certain return of social partners in the governance of the Dutch welfare administration, as members of the Central and Regional Work Chambers of the 35 Dutch labour market regions. Despite this role, their current position is much less direct and powerful than it was before 2002.
pn9j | In short, divergence between current systems is expressed for both 'levels' and 'stakeholders'. Compared to the Netherlands, the Norwegian system has a much stronger degree of (compulsory) cooperation between the state and the municipalities (levels). However, the role of the social partners in the governance of the activation policy is stronger in the Netherlands. Clients are represented in advisory bodies in both countries, without a direct governing role.
1pmc | Discussion
5z6q | In this paper we analysed whether reform trajectories in two welfare administrations reflect NPM and NPG ideas, and how the relationships between levels of government and between public and private stakeholders evolved into the current design of the welfare administrations. Three main lessons about convergence and divergence can be learned from our longitudinal study.
