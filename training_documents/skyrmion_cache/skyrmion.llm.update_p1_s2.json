In most systems experimentally investigated to date, skyrmions emerge as classical objects. However, the discovery of skyrmions with nanometer length scales has sparked interest in their quantum properties. Here, we simulate the ground states of two-dimensional spin-one-half Heisenberg lattices with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and discover a broad region in the zero-temperature phase diagram which hosts quantum skyrmion lattices. We argue that the quantum skyrmion lattice phase can be detected experimentally in the magnetization profile via local magnetic polarization measurements as well as in the spin structure factor measurable via neutron scattering experiments. Finally, we explore the resulting quantum skyrmion state, analyze its real-space polarization profile and show that it is a nonclassical state featuring entanglement between quasiparticle and environment mainly localized near the boundary spins of the skyrmion.\noae5 | I. INTRODUCTION\ns0fl | Magnetic skyrmions are vortexlike quasiparticles characterized by a nontrivial topological invariant in real space. These states are typically found in noncentrosymmetric ferromagnets in a certain range of external magnetic field and temperature, and are stabilized by an antisymmetric spin exchange energy, termed Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. After their first detection in a magnetic system by a neutron diffraction experiment in two thousand nine, and a full tomography by electron microscopy in two thousand ten, intense follow-up studies revealed intriguing dynamical properties, rendering skyrmions potentially useful for memory and computing devices. Usually, the skyrmions encountered in these systems arise from thermal fluctuations and extend over length scales that are much larger than the interatomic distance and thus behave like classical objects. Other possibilities to create skyrmions are through suitable direct current devices, such as those proposed in references. However, smaller skyrmions do exist and have already created interest in possible quantum properties of skyrmions. Several works have predicted the quantum behavior of skyrmions by using classical magnetic textures as a starting point and studying quantum corrections in the semiclassical ferromagnetic regime.\n43ia | Beyond this semiclassical limit, some works have indicated that quantum analogs of classical skyrmions might exist in spin systems. The authors of reference used a multiscale\n3g2y | approach to demonstrate that mesoscopic magnetization vortices are stabilized by quantum fluctuations, which suggests the possibility of inherently quantum-mechanical counterparts of these states at zero temperature. So far, attempts to classify skyrmion excitations with sizes comparable to the interatomic spacing have been made in frustrated quantum lattice systems and ferromagnetic lattices with DMI. Several geometries have been studied to understand the quantum analogs of classical skyrmions, and quantitative results have been obtained by numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. Since the dimension of the quantum Hamiltonian scales exponentially with the number of lattice sites, such exact diagonalization strategies are limited to small system sizes containing at most approximately thirty spin-one-half sites without exploiting symmetries. Although DMI interactions are among the most popular to investigate the formation of classical skyrmion phases, their quantum analogs are analytically hard to handle and quantitative results beyond system sizes amenable for exact diagonalization are still lacking. As an alternative route to quantum skyrmions that avoids DMI, frustrated spin lattice systems were studied in reference. Using exact diagonalization for small systems and analytical spin-wave theory, the authors identified skyrmions with magnon bound states and developed a phenomenological theory based on a trial wave function.\ngc7v | Here, we use the density matrix renormalization group algorithm to explore ferromagnetic phases of quantum spin-one-half Heisenberg models with DMI and uniaxial anisotropy. As our main result, we discover a zero-temperature quantum phase with a nontrivial magnetic spin texture that signals an emergent quantum skyrmion lattice. This phase was previously overlooked because it appears only beyond a critical system size which for realistic parameters is larger than the system sizes amenable to exact diagonalization. We identify three ferromagnetic phases that can be directly observed and distinguished in the space-resolved magnetization profile. Furthermore, we argue that the polarization gives access to the zero-temperature phase diagram of the model under\nwqfv | investigation. Contrary to similar quasiparticles found in frustrated lattices or quantum skyrmions embedded in a classical magnet, we show that the skyrmion lattice phase reported here emerges from entangled spin-one-half pairs, which bear witness to a genuine quantum mechanical origin without classical analog, a feature that may pave the way toward a microscopic description of skyrmion qubits used for realizing quantum logic elements based on nanoscale devices.\nj30a | II. MODEL\n7bdk | We study the zero-temperature phase diagram of a quantum spin-one-half Heisenberg model with DMI and external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian reads:\nfim0 | H equals one-half sum over all nearest-neighbor r and r prime of J multiplied by S sub r dot S sub r prime plus D sub r prime minus r dot the cross product of S sub r and S sub r prime plus sum over r of B dot S sub r,\nojro | where S sub r equals h-bar sigma sub r divided by two, with Pauli matrices sigma sub alpha r for alpha in the set x, y, z, denotes a spin-one-half operator at position r. J is less than zero is the ferromagnetic exchange coupling strength, D sub r prime minus r, is the DMI vector, and B equals B e sub z denotes the applied magnetic field along the z axis. The notation brackets r, r prime implies a sum over all pairs of nearest-neighbor lattice sites. In Section six, we will also consider the impact of a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with strength\nl6t9 | K, H sub K equals one-half sum over all nearest-neighbor r and r prime K S sub r z S sub r z.\n```",
