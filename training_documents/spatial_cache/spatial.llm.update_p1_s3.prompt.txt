You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

4exe | The Analysis of Spatial Association by Use of Distance Statistics
0myz | Introduced in this paper is a family of statistics, G, that can be used as a measure of spatial association in a number of circumstances. The basic statistic is derived, its properties are identified, and its advantages explained. Several of the G statis- tics make it possible to evaluate the spatial association of a variable within a specified distance of a single point. A comparison is made between a general G statistic and Moran's I for similar hypothetical and empirical conditions. The empirical work includes studies of sudden infant death syndrome by county in North Carolina and dwelling unit prices in metropolitan San Diego by zip-code districts. Results indicate that G statistics should be used in conjunction with I in order to identify characteristics of patterns not revealed by the I statistic alone and, specifically, the Gi and G* statistics enable us to detect local "pockets" of dependence that may not show up when using global statistics.
xh3i | INTRODUCTION
syiw | The importance of examining spatial series for spatial correlation and autocor- relation is undeniable. Both Anselin and Griffith (1988) and Arbia (1989) have shown that failure to take necessary steps to account for or avoid spatial autocor- relation can lead to serious errors in model interpretation. In spatial modeling, researchers must not only account for dependence structure and spatial hetero- skedasticity, they must also assess the effects of spatial scale. In the last twenty years a number of instruments for testing for and measuring spatial autocorrelation have appeared. To geographers, the best-known statistics are Moran's I and, to a lesser extent, Geary's c (Cliff and Ord 1973). To geologists and remote sensing analysts, the semi-variance is most popular (Davis 1986). To spatial econometri- cians, estimating spatial autocorrelation coefficients of regression equations is the usual approach (Anselin 1988).
kg3t | A common feature of these procedures is that they are applied globally, that is, to the complete region under study. However, it is often desirable to examine pattern at a more local scale, particularly if the process is spatially nonstationary. Foster and Gorr (1986) provide an adaptive filtering method for smoothing param- eter estimates, and Cressie and Read (1989) present a modeling procedure. The ideas presented in this paper are complementary to these approaches in that we also focus upon local effects, but from the viewpoint of testing rather than smoothing.
lvae | This paper introduces a family of measures of spatial association called <LATEX>G</LATEX> statis- tics. These statistics have a number of attributes that make them attractive for measuring association in a spatially distributed variable. When used in conjunc- tion with a statistic such as Moran's <LATEX>I ,</LATEX> they deepen the knowledge of the processes that give rise to spatial association, in that they enable us to detect local "pockets" of dependence that may not show up when using global statistics. In this paper, we first derive the statistics <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>G \left( d \right) ,</LATEX> then outline their attributes. Next, the <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> statistic is compared with Moran's <LATEX>I .</LATEX> Finally, there is a discussion of empirical examples. The examples are taken from two different geographic scales of analysis and two different sets of data. They include sudden infant death syn- drome by county in North Carolina, and house prices by zip-code district in the San Diego metropolitan area.
o9sc | THE <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> STATISTIC
121u | This statistic measures the degree of association that results from the concentra- tion of weighted points (or area represented by a weighted point) and all other weighted points included within a radius of distance <LATEX>d</LATEX> from the original weighted point. We are given an area subdivided into <LATEX>n</LATEX> regions, <LATEX>i = 1 , 2 , \ldots , n ,</LATEX> where each region is identified with a point whose Cartesian coordinates are known. Each <LATEX>i</LATEX> has associated with it a value <LATEX>x</LATEX> (a weight) taken from a variable <LATEX>X .</LATEX> The variable has a natural origin and is positive. The <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> statistic developed below allows for tests of hypotheses about the spatial concentration of the sum of <LATEX>x</LATEX> values associated with the <LATEX>j</LATEX> points within <LATEX>d</LATEX> of the ith point.
zh03 | The statistic is
1mvw | <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right) = \frac { \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { n } w _ { i j } \left( d \right) x _ { j } } { \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { n } x _ { j } } , \quad j \text { not equal to } i ,</LATEX> (1)
6d4s | where <LATEX>\left\{ w _ { i j } \right\}</LATEX> is a symmetric one/zero spatial weight matrix with ones for all links defined as being within distance <LATEX>d</LATEX> of a given <LATEX>i</LATEX> i; all other links are zero including the link of point <LATEX>i</LATEX> to itself. The numerator is the sum of all <LATEX>x _ { j } ,</LATEX> within <LATEX>d</LATEX> of <LATEX>i</LATEX> but not including <LATEX>x _ { i } .</LATEX> The denominator is the sum of all <LATEX>x _ { i }</LATEX> not including
mqah | <LATEX>x _ { i } .</LATEX> Adopting standard arguments (cf. Cliff and Ord 1973, pp. 32-33), we may fix the value <LATEX>x ,</LATEX> for the ith point and consider the set of <LATEX>\left( n \quad - \quad 1 \right) !</LATEX> random permutations of the remaining <LATEX>x</LATEX> values at the <LATEX>j</LATEX> points. Under the null hypothesis of spatial independence, these permutations are equally likely. That is, let <LATEX>\mathrm { X } _ { j } ,</LATEX> be the random variable describing the value assigned to point <LATEX>j ,</LATEX> then
xxr8 | <LATEX>P \left( X _ { j } = x _ { r } \right) = 1 / \left( n - 1 \right) , \quad r \neq i ,</LATEX> and
