        "content": "z8tt | Does creatine lead to dehydration and muscle cramping? Speculation exists that creatine supplementation causes dehydration and muscle cramping. In the early two thousands, with limited data and based primarily on speculation, the American College of Sports Medicine recommended that individuals controlling their weight and exercising intensely or in hot environments should avoid the use of creatine supplementation. The physiological rationale suggesting that creatine supplementation may cause dehydration and muscle cramping is based on the premise that creatine is an osmotically active substance found primarily in skeletal muscle and may alter whole-body fluid distribution by preferentially increasing intracellular water uptake and retention, particularly over the short-term. In situations of body water loss, such as severe sweating from exercise and or increased environmental temperature, the bound intracellular fluid, in theory, may be detrimental to thermal regulation and lead to extracellular dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and muscle cramping or other heat-related musculoskeletal issues. The initial loading phase of creatine supplementation (i.e. twenty grams per day for five to seven days) typically results in a one to three kilogram increase in body mass, mostly attributable to net body water retention. Some anecdotal evidence indicates that creatine users perceive supplementation to result in some adverse effects. For example, in a survey involving two hundred nineteen athletes, ninety participants reported using creatine with thirty-four of them (thirty-eight percent) reporting perceived negative effects such as cramping (twenty-seven percent). Similarly, in National Collegiate Athletic Association Division one baseball and football players using creatine, twenty-five percent reported incidences of muscle cramping and thirteen point five percent reported symptoms of dehydration. Importantly, these studies failed to control for the use of other supplements and the dosage of creatine ingested. Greenwood et al. noted that ninety-one percent of participants exceeded the recommended creatine maintenance dose of five grams per day. However, these self-report surveys are in contradiction to experimental and clinical evidence. Greenwood et al. monitored injury rates in Division one A N C A A collegiate football players, aged nineteen point seven plus one point zero years, where environmental conditions were hot (twenty-seven point three plus or minus one zero point nine degrees Celsius) and humid (fifty-four point two plus or minus nine point seven). Participants chose to receive either creatine (thirty-eight participants at point three grams per kilogram per day for five days; followed by zero point zero three grams per kilogram per day for one hundred fifteen days) or a sports drink placebo (thirty-four participants) throughout the football season. Injuries treated by the athletic training staff were monitored. Creatine users had significantly less cramping (P equals zero point zero two one), heat illnesses and dehydration (P equals zero point zero four three), muscle tightness (P equals zero point zero two zero), muscle strains (P equals zero point zero two one), and total injuries (P is less than zero point zero zero one) compared to non-users. Non-contact joint injuries, contact injuries, illnesses, missed practices due to injuries, and players lost for the season were not different between groups. In\n\n9g22 | a clinical setting, haemodialysis patients (ten participants) who frequently reported muscle cramping were provided creatine (twelve grams) five minutes prior to haemodialysis. Creatine supplementation reduced the frequency of symptomatic muscle cramping by sixty percent. These beneficial effects from creatine may be explained by fluid distribution and electrolyte imbalances, as previously discussed.\n\n41fx | In summary, experimental and clinical research does not validate the notion that creatine supplementation causes dehydration and muscle cramping.\n\n7um8 | Is creatine harmful for children and adolescents?\n\nuow2 | Concerns regarding the safety of creatine supplementation in children and adolescents (less than nineteen years) continues to be highly prevalent. The overwhelming majority of evidence in adult populations indicates that creatine supplementation, both short- and longer-term, is safe and generally well tolerated. However, the question of whether or not this holds true for children and adolescents is relatively unclear. The physiological rationale supporting the potential ergogenic benefits of creatine supplementation in children and adolescents was first postulated by Unnithan and colleagues in two thousand one; which established a strong basis for future applications of creatine for younger athletes. More recently, in a comprehensive review examining the safety of creatine supplementation in adolescents, Jagim et al. summarized several studies that examined the efficacy of creatine supplementation among various adolescent athlete populations and found no evidence of adverse effects. However, it is important to note that none of the performance-focused studies included in the Jagim et al. review provided data examining specific markers of clinical health and whether or not they were impacted by the supplementation protocols.\n\niat7 | From a clinical perspective, creatine supplementation has been found to potentially offer health benefits with minimal adverse effects in younger populations. Hayashi et al. found improvements in pediatric patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and reported no adverse changes in laboratory parameters of hematology, kidney function, liver function or inflammatory markers after twelve weeks of creatine supplementation. Tarnopolsky et al. reported significant improvements in fat-free mass and hand grip strength in thirty pediatric patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy following four months of creatine supplementation. Importantly, the creatine supplementation protocol appeared to be well tolerated and did not adversely affect laboratory markers of kidney function, oxidative stress, and bone health. In addition, Sakellaris et al. reported significant improvements in traumatic brain injury-related outcomes",
