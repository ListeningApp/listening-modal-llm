You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

8bwk | That Willoughby falsified intelligence in order to please MacArthur is supported by good evidence from the X Corps and the Eighth Army staff officers. Almond's deputy chief of staff, Colonel William J. McCaffrey, who had served under Almond as the chief of staff of the 92nd Division in WWII, believed that Willoughby "was more interested in staying in MacArthur's good graces than in rendering objective assessment of the available facts" and that this was particularly the case regarding the estimate of the magnitude of the Chinese threat. Almond's G-3, Jack Chiles, remembered: "MacArthur did not want the Chinese to enter the war in Korea. Anything MacArthur wanted, Willoughby produced intelligence for In this case, Willoughby falsified the intelligence reports He should have gone to jail."24 Almond's G-2, Colonel James H. Polk, wrote that "we had the dope but old CAW (Willoughby) bowed to the superior wisdom of his beloved boss and didn't fight him as a good staff officer should."205
ez9s | In the Eighth Army, the situation was more complex. While Walker was not considered by MacArthur and his inner circle as "one of 'them,' " his G-2, Lieutenant Colonel James Tarkenton, had been nominated for his position by Willoughby, despite his lack of combat experience, and he owed Willoughby his loyalty. But Tarkenton had done a good job in the Pusan perimeter and won Walker's trust.200 Nevertheless, when it came to estimating the magnitude of the Chinese threat, Tarkenton followed Willoughby's methodology and estimates. This was not an innocent mistake. The Eighth Army's G-3, Colonel John Dabney, defined Tarkenton's estimates as "unduly influenced" and "colored" 4 by Willoughby's views. William Train, Dabney's senior planner who estimated the Chinese force as far greater than the official estimate, explained Tarkenton's motivation: "It was MacArthur's Command, not a US Army command, and if you crossed Willoughby it was not just a ticket out of there, it was probably a ticket straight out of your career."2Train did not mince words about Willoughby's behavior: "What he was doing in those days was fighting against the truth, trying to keep it from going from lower levels to higher ones where it would have to be acted on. "209
mqot | The impact of the Bataan Gang mentality was not limited to intelligence estimates alone. Both Walker and Almond received the same intelligence reports, yet their effect on them was very different. Walker, an
oc99 | experienced general, considered by Gen. Patton "the most eager to attack,"was aware of the lack of solid information concerning the enemy he faced. His G-2 estimated it at 27,000 CPVF and 23,000 KPA soldiers, altogether about 50,000 troops." Although the Eighth Army was more than 100,000 strong and enjoyed superior firepower and mobility, and despite pressure from MacArthur, Walker avoided pushing his 212
gipz | commanders to move too fast and cautioned them of potential dangers.'
b4wj | The commander of the X Corps, as a professional US Army study shows, acted differently: "General Almond and his staff had blindly followed the guidance of the supremely optimistic Far Eastern Command, which seemed to ignore or discount sign after sign of possible massive Chinese intervention. Almond directed his units to race to the Yalu without regard to their flanks or to the location of any enemy forces."213 Whether it was Almond's personal fault or his and his staff officers' is a matter of controversy. Post factum, his chief of staff wrote that the X Corps plan was "insane." Almond's deputy chief of staff explained it, "General Almond was not about to protest an order from Gen. MacArthur. After all, everyone said Inchon wouldn't work."214 Almond's Bataan Gang outlook made the X Corps offensive that started on November 27 "the most ill-advised and unfortunate operation of the Korean War."215 Others, who did not share Almond's
5xlt | Almond had a reputation for being an aggressive commander but Marines commanders are known to be aggressive too and Smith was no exception. Nevertheless, he took into account the reality of the battlefield and thus saved his division from a disaster. Conspicuously, Almond's optimistic estimate did not change even after the Chinese counteroffensive had begun. On November 28, he told the officers of an isolated task force: "The enemy who is delaying you for the moment is nothing more than remnants of Chinese divisions fleeing north. We're still attacking and we're going all the way to the Yalu. Don't let a bunch of Chinese laundrymen stop you."2" This "Gung ho" manner was unusual by any professional standard, but Almond was not a standard officer. He was a typical product of the Bataan Gang mentality, an officer who's "greatest weakness as a commander in Korea was his conviction that MacArthur could do no wrong."217 In Halberstam's words, Almond "was MacArthur's boy, the true loyalist, headstrong and arrogant, determined to make the reality of the Korean battlefield fit the dreams of the commander in the Dai Ichi [Macarthur's headquarters in Tokyo]."218
9bz4 | The Bataan Gang mentality penetrated also lower ranks. Maj. general John Coulter served under MacArthur in World War I, and MacArthur brought him to the Far East to command the US Seventh Division in 1948. After taking two more positions, he returned to the USA. When the war started, MacArthur brought him back to command the First Corps of the Eighth Army but actually to be his man in Walker's headquarters. Walker, who was not too impressed by Coulter's qualities as a battlefield commander, nominated him to command the IX Corps, which had only become operational in September. When the Chinese offensive of late November struck his forces, Coulter refused to grasp that a new reality thwarted MacArthur's intention to swiftly end the war. As Halberstam put it, his orders reflected "the vast distance that by then existed between the reality on the battlefield and the illusions that existed in Tokyo."2 4
yfv2 | Important as it was, the Bataan Gang mentality was not created in a vacuum, but according to the preferences of senior officers in the FEC. The intelligence failure of late November, moreover, was ripened in an atmosphere that was created by human beings. And to fully comprehend the sources of this failure, we have to understand certain aspects of the minds of the persons most responsible for this fiasco.
pujl | iii. The individual level
3rqe | Two prominent figures stand out in the process that led to the failure of November 1950. One is MacArthur, who inspired the Bataan Boys' mentality. He also exhibited groundless optimism concerning the magnitude of the Chinese threat and took unnecessary risks in pressuring his commanders to end the war by Christmas. The second is Willoughby, his G-2 beginning 1941 and the officer most closely identified with this fiasco.
nsi3 | MacArthur: paranoia and narcissism
nil3 | Until his April 1951 dismissal, the Korean War was MacArthur's war. Summarizing its first six months, Blair concluded that it had not been fought well, and that MacArthur was responsible for the main mistakes,
68a1 | grossly underestimating the professionalism of the KPA; the inhumane piecemeal commitment of the untrained Eighth Army; the shift of X Corps after Inchon from hot pursuit to a meaningless amphibious landing at Wonsan; scandalously underestimating CCF strength and intentions; the foolish "race" to the Yalu in both the Eighth Army and the X Corps sectors. As a result 60,000 American soldiers and Marines and probably five times that number of ROK soldiers were dead, wounded, or missing. - 220
