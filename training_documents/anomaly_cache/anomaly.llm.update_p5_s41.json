        "content": "o9sc | We discard the x and y coordinates due to the low informative content and use only the depth component z in centimeters. Missing depth values are repeatedly filled by using the average value of valid pixels from an eight-connected neighborhood for three iterations. We model the background as a twoD plane by interpolating the depth of the four corner pixels. A pixel is assumed as foreground if its depth is further than seven millimeters distant from the background plane. As an input to our models, we first resize the masks to one hundred ninety-two by one hundred ninety-two pixels via bilinear downsampling and then perform pixel-unshuffling with d equals eight as described in Section three to match the feature map resolution. In order to detect anomalies at the edge of the object and fill holes of missing values, the foreground mask is dilated using a square structural element of size eight. We subtract the mean foreground depth from each depth map and set its background pixels to zero. The binary foreground mask M with ones as foreground and zeros as background is downsampled to feature map resolution to mask the loss for student and teacher. This is done by a bilinear interpolation f1 followed by a binarization where all entries greater than zero are assumed as foreground to mask the loss at position (i, j):\n121u | Cmasked [Lij if fi(M)ij greater than zero equals ten else\nzh03 | Four point two point three Teacher\n1mvw | For the normalizing flow architecture of the teacher, we use four coupling blocks which are conditioned on a positional encoding with thirty-two channels. Each pair of internal subnetworks Si and ti is designed as one shallow convolutional network ri with one hidden layer whose output is split into the scale and shift components. Inside ri we use ReLU-Activations and a hidden channel size of one thousand twenty-four for MVTtwoD and sixty-four for MVTthreeD. We choose the alpha-clamping parameter o equals three for MVTtwoD and Q equals one point nine for MVTthreeD. The teacher networks are trained for two hundred forty epochs for MVTtwoD and seventy-two epochs for MVTthreeD, respectively, with the Adam optimizer, using author-given momentum parameters thirty-one equals zero point nine and thirty-two equals zero point nine nine nine, a learning rate of two times ten to the negative four and a weight decay of ten to the negative five.\n6d4s | Four point two point four Student\nmqah | For the student networks, we use nst_blocks equals four residual convolutional blocks as described in Section three point two. The Leaky-ReLU-activations use a slope of zero point two for negative values. We choose a hidden channel size of nhidden equals one thousand twenty-four for the residual block. Likewise, we take over the number of epochs and optimizer parameters from the teacher. The scores at feature map resolution are aggregated for evaluation at image level by the maximum distance if a foreground mask is available, and the average distance otherwise (RGB only).\nxxr8 | Four point three Evaluation Metrics\nrl4j | As common for anomaly detection, we evaluate the performance of our method on image-level by calculating the area under receiver operating characteristics. The ROC measures the true positive rate dependent on the false\nvz32 | positive rate for varying thresholds of the anomaly score. Thus, it is independent of the choice of a threshold and invariant to the class balance in the test set. For measuring the segmentation of anomalies at pixel-level, we compute the AUROC on pixel level given the ground truth masks in the datasets.\nncb0 | Four point four Results\n8mp0 | Four point four point one Detection\nxjyk | Table two shows the AUROC of our method and previous work for detecting anomalies on the fifteen classes of MVTtwoD as well as the averages for textures, objects and all classes. We set a new state-of-the-art performance on the mean detection AUROC over all classes, improving it slightly to ninety-nine point two percent. This is mainly due to the good performance on the more challenging objects, where we outperform previous work by a comparatively large margin of zero point nine percent, except for PatchCore. The detection of anomalies on textures, which CS-Flow has already almost solved with a mean AUROC of ninety-nine point eight percent, still works very reliably at ninety-nine point three percent. Especially compared to the two student-teacher approaches, a significant improvement of six percent and three point six percent respectively is achieved. Moreover, our student-teacher distances show to be a better indicator of anomalies compared to the likelihoods of current state-of-the-art density estimators which, like our teacher, are based on normalizing flows.\nmt0f | Even though MVTtwoD has established itself as a standard benchmark in the past, this dataset (especially the textures) is easily solvable for recent methods, and differences are mainly in the sub-percent range, which is only a minor difference in terms of the comparatively small size of the dataset. In the following, we focus on the newer, more challenging MVTthreeD dataset where the normal data shows\nawab | more variance and anomalies only partly occur in one of the two data modalities, RGB and threeD.",
