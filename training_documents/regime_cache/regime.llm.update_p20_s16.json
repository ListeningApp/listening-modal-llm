Extending the range of linear response with synthetic forcings. We discuss in this section the notion of synthetic forcings, and how they can be used to extend the regime of linear response. We start by describing the notion of synthetic forcings in Section three point one, and give examples in Section three point two for both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics. Then, we provide a methodology for choosing the magnitude of the forcings in Section three point three. Finally, we briefly discuss how to linearly combine multiple extra forcings in Section three point four.\nd7eu | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS\nxndr | Three point one. Notion of synthetic forcings. As discussed in Section two point one point one, a system with a nonequilibrium perturbation has a generator of the form\nm6hi | (Three point one) C sub n equals L sub zero plus n O,\nvpkf | where L is the generator of some perturbation to the reference dynamics with generator L sub zero. We considered in Section two only the case where L is Lphys - in other words, the perturbation corresponds to some physical perturbation on the system, which is the typical scenario in the context of statistical physics. We now consider, in addition to the physical perturbation, some possibly nonphysical extra perturbation, which we denote by Lextra, so that L in (three point one) is replaced by\n4d67 | L equals Lphys plus alpha Lextra,\ne7j2 | for alpha in real numbers. We call the resulting perturbation a synthetic forcing.\nlqzt | The key requirement of synthetic forcings is that the addition of the extra forcing should preserve the invariant measure of the reference dynamics, thus preserving the linear response. In other words, the dynamics with generator\n1ocm | L sub n comma alpha equals L sub zero plus n times Lphys plus alpha Lextra\n527v | has the same linear response as the dynamics associated with L sub n comma alpha equals L sub zero plus n Lphys when\nlrri | Lextra integrated over X equals zero.\n5cl9 | (Three point two)\nu7a3 | We denote by U sub n comma alpha the invariant measure for the dynamics associated with the generator L sub n comma alpha, i.e. the solution to the stationary Fokker-Planck equation\nw409 | (Three point three) L sub n comma alpha times U sub n comma alpha equals zero.\nm04y | When there is no indication of the value of alpha, e.g. U sub n, it means that alpha equals zero.\n23jk | From the definition (two point twenty-six) of the linear response O, it is indeed easy to see why the linear response is preserved with the addition of Lextra: the conjugate response S defined in (two point ten) is preserved, and so is f sub one in view of (two point twenty-four), which allows us to conclude by Lemma two point two. Let us emphasize that (three point two) is the key condition to be satisfied for extra forcings to be admissible. We provide various examples of admissible extra forcings in Section three point two. For technical reasons, the extra forcings we consider should satisfy the same conditions as Lphys in Assumption four.\noa63 | One practical interest is to optimize the extra perturbation in order to increase the regime of linear response. As made precise in Proposition two point four, the variance of the estimator (two point thirty-eight) is of order O of n to the negative two. A larger linear regime therefore means that larger values of n can be considered without introducing too much bias on p sub one. This leads in turn to a smaller statistical error, and hence shorter simulation times to reach the same accuracy. One idea in particular is to look for Lextra which minimizes O sub two, the leading order n squared of the nonlinear response, as a proxy for minimizing the absolute value of E sub n of R minus p sub one, i.e. the nonlinear portion of the response. This is discussed in detail in Section three point three. This also naturally suggests that one could further combine k forcings in order to cancel the first k plus one orders of the response, as discussed in Section three point four.\ne3lv | Another approach to optimizing the perturbation is to increase the range of n for which the nonlinear response is within some desired distance from the linear regime, in relative error, also discussed Section three point three.\nrqv6 | Three point two. Examples of synthetic forcings. To make synthetic forcings more concrete, we now go over some examples of extra forcings. We first outline in Section three point two point one the general classes of operators we consider. We then discuss more precisely examples for overdamped Langevin dynamics in Section three point two point two and for underdamped Langevin dynamics in Section three point two point three.\noa48 | Three point two point one. General classes of extra forcings. When considering possible extra forcings, we restrict ourselves to differential operators of at most second order in order to realize them in Monte Carlo simulations. We consider the following classes of differential operators:\n3fp1 | One. First-order differential operators Lextra equals G transpose V r, with G: X maps to R d such that the divergence of G psi equals zero. The latter condition ensures that (three point two) is satisfied since Lextra equals negative G transpose V R;\n557x | Two. Second-order differential operators of the form Lextra equals negative partial D divided by partial x sub i or more gen- erally negative partial D subscripts i j divided by partial x sub i for some nonnegative function D subscripts i j: X maps to R positive. In the case Lextra equals negative partial D divided by partial x, the operator is self-adjoint, i.e. Lextra equals L prime extra, so that (three point two) is easily seen to hold. For Lextra equals negative partial D subscripts i j divided by partial x sub i, it holds that Lextra equals negative partial D subscripts i j divided by partial x sub j, which also satisfies (three point two).",
