You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

5bq3 | 3.4.3. Insulin resistance has an impact on reward sensitivity
ezla | The effect of insulin on motivation and reward sensitivity goes beyond food intake. Insulin deficiency due to fasting increased reward sensitivity in an intracranial self-stimulation task. This effect was reversed by insulin (Carr et al., 2000) and leptin administration (Fulton et al., 2000). Equally, insulin deficiency due to STZ-application increased reward sensitivity, but only in the first (three) weeks (Carr et al., 2000). Afterward, this effect was abolished (Carr et al., 2000) or even turned to the opposite showing reduced reward sensitivity (Ho et al., 2012b). In this case, insulin application improved reward sensi- tivity. Equally HFD for 15-17 weeks reduced the attraction of male ro- dents to female urine, that is normally perceived as rewarding (Dutheil et al., 2016a) indicating that insulin resistance over a longer period of time leads to anhedonia - the loss of experiencing pleasure from usually rewarding activities.
rsbu | 3.4.4. Insulin resistance leads to a depressive, anxious phenotype
magd | Moreover, insulin resistance has been associated with behavioural despair (a core feature of depression) and anxious behaviour (Fig. 3). In life-threatening situations, insulin-resistant mice showed increased immobility in the tail-suspension test and the forced swim test and avoided exploratory behaviour in the open field task and during expo- sition to novel food stimuli indicating anxiety (Cai et al., 2018a; Gilak-Dalasm et al., 2021; Kleinridders et al., 2015).
tb74 | 3.4.5. Insulin resistance impairs preference formation
8l69 | There is accumulating evidence that insulin plays an important role in learning and preference formation. During flavour-nutrient condi- tioning, a previously neutral flavour is associated with a positive post- ingestive consequence (e.g., intragastric glucose infusions) to form a preference for the flavour. While insulin-sensitive rodents fed ad libitum or after food restriction are able to establish flavour preferences, this effect is abolished in insulin resistance following HFD. Particularly, after HFD, there was less IR activation in the NAc after intragastric glucose infusion (Woods et al., 2016). Similarly, flavour-nutrient conditioning was inhibited after deactivating insulin bilaterally in the NAc via local administration of insulin antibodies (Stouffer et al., 2015). To differ- entiate whether this observation was driven by a change in motivation or indeed by a change in the learned reward value, Carr et al. (2022b) analysed the microstructure of licking for glucose: Insulin antibodies did not affect the number of lick bursts emitted (a measure of motivation and/or satiety), but decreased the size of lick bursts (a measure of reward magnitude). This effect was shown to depend on previous flav- oured glucose consumption under insulin antibody treatment rather than on insulin antibody treatment per se, indicating that impaired in- sulin signalling in the NAc (shell) impairs learning by diminishing the estimated reward value rather than motivation per se (Carr and Weiner, 2022b).
1jyv | 3.4.6. The effect of insulin resistance on motor activity
olce | Several models using insulin resistance after HFD or IR knockout in DA neurons or astrocytes (GIRKO) did not show any changes in volun- tary motor activity (Evans et al., 2018; McNeilly et al., 2016). In STZ-diabetic mice, however, the results are very inconsistent, providing evidence for reduced, increased, and unaffected spontaneous locomotor behaviour (Ho et al., 2012b; Miyata et al., 2003), which might be related to the large variability in STZ-protocols in terms of timing, dosage and strains. These findings suggest that the shortage of insulin availability and the resistance of insulin receptors have differential effects on motor activity.
erx1 | Collectively, impaired insulin signalling increases food approach, attenuates value formation and preference learning and promotes anhedonia and anxious behaviour. However, it is important to consider,
b3bt | that many aspects of reward-seeking behaviour, that are distorted by impaired insulin signalling, cannot be solely attributed to DA signalling in the VTA or NAc but are also related to their interaction with further brain systems (Fordahl and Jones, 2017; Patel et al., 2019c; Stouffer et al., 2015).
0w8m | 3.5. Effect of insulin resistance on reward behaviour in humans
vcu3 | There is no direct measure of central insulin resistance in humans (see Appendix, Tables S8-S10). Using [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), Antony et al. (Anthony et al., 2006) discovered that glucose metabolism in regions subserving appe- tite and reward, including the mesostriatal system, is impaired in response to peripheral insulin administration in diabetes patients compared to healthy controls. This indicates that peripherally measured insulin resistance can be used as a surrogate for central insulin resis- tance. Since PET using radioactive ligands is limited in its accessibility, fMRI has emerged as a valuable tool for studying changes in brain sig- nalling associated with insulin resistance. In fact, using resting state fMRI data, we demonstrated that the modulation of midbrain (SN/VTA) connectivity by intranasal insulin is compromised in participants with decreased peripheral insulin sensitivity (Edwin Thanarajah et al., 2019).
hjzj | 3.5.1. Insulin resistance changes food preference
j79f | Tiedemann et al. (2017) showed that non-diabetic participants with incipient insulin resistance have a lower preference for food items than healthy controls along with diminished activation of the NAc. At the same time, others reported that food-specific responses within the basal ganglia including the NAc are significantly greater in participants with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes than in healthy controls (Chechlacz et al., 2009; Van Vugt et al., 2013). Stronger activation in the NAc was related to higher appetite ratings (Chechlacz et al., 2009). Besides the immediate response to food cues, the anticipatory response has also been shown to increase proportionally with BMI and insulin resistance (Simon et al., 2014). However, these studies have to be interpreted with care, because they included small sample sizes and differ in the fasting conditions and study populations (Alsaadi and Van Vugt, 2015; Chech- lacz et al., 2009; Van Vugt et al., 2013). Studies assessing the modulation of the brain response to food pictures by insulin have been more consistent: both intranasal insulin, as well as a glucose challenge (which causes elevated insulin secretion), fail to decrease the brain signal to food pictures in insulin-resistant participants indicating that the ability of insulin to curb food intake by reducing the salience of (highly palatable) food cues may be impaired (Alsaadi and Van Vugt, 2015; Belfort-DeAguiar et al., 2016; Tiedemann et al., 2017). In line, during fasted conditions, intranasal insulin failed to decrease wanting for food in insulin-resistant participants (Kullmann et al., 2015; Tiedemann et al., 2017). However, a recent study demonstrated that in post-prandial conditions, a high dose of (160 IU) intranasal insulin reduced snacking in overweight women with insulin resistance (Hallschmid et al., 2012b; Schneider et al., 2022) suggesting that suffi- ciently high doses of intranasal insulin may enhance satiety signalling and compensate for reduced central insulin sensitivity.
