        "content": "nh8n | Aggregation of the measures plays an important role here. The default behavior of Tableau Public is to aggregate measures (for example, by using sums or averages). This may be fine for most analyses, but you may want a clearer picture (or you may want to expose outliers) by looking at all the data points. You can override this aggregation behavior by disaggregating the data, which will display all the values in the data source for that measure. To do so, go to the Start button and select Analysis. Then, click on Aggregate Measures and deselect that menu command. Note that disaggregation may remove the information displayed from the tool tip when hovering over a data point. You can add the contextual values displayed in the tool tip by dragging dimensions and measures from the Data window to the Detail or Tooltip shelves in the Marks card.\nircn | If too many values are displayed, you can add the measures to the Filters shelf and set parameters in the filter dialog box to limit the number of data points (marks) that are being shown.\nnpsf | We created the scatter plot shown in the following screenshot, which shows the relationship of GDP and mobile phone users between two thousand and two thousand ten in Asia by country from the World Bank Indicators data, by performing the following steps:\ndynl | One. Drag Finance: GDP (current, USD) to the Columns shelf, which puts it on the x axis and makes it the independent variable.\nmsij | Two. Drag Business: Mobile Phone Subscribers from the Measures pane to the Columns shelf, which makes it the dependent variable.\n8n3m | Three. Drag Date from the Dimensions pane to the Color shelf.\nech9 | Four. Click on the context menu for the Color legend and assign the Cyclic color palette.\np94v | Five. Drag Region to the Filters shelf and select Asia.\ngf1i | Six. Drag Country to the Label shelf.\nrouh | Seven. Drag Population: Urban (count) to the Size shelf on the Marks card, which further encodes the default circles with the relative urban populations.\n080i | Visualization - Tips and Types\n4fln | From this, we learned that the relationship between the GDP and Mobile phone subscribers in China is linear and that in other countries such as Japan, it is relatively consistent. It is also not surprising that the urban population of China is the largest, since it has the largest population. In the next chapter, you will learn how to create calculated fields that show you the percentage of the total that is urban rather than just a discrete number.\ntmlf | Pie charts\noy09 | Pie charts allow you to show the composition of parts to a whole, like slices in a pie. Pie charts should be used sparingly because humans cannot interpret angles and area that well. Noted visualization experts, including Stephen Few and Edward Tufte, are generally against using pie charts, except in limited circumstances. It is often said for data, authors consider using a stacked bar chart instead.\nwvb1 | That being said, pie charts can sometimes be used effectively under certain circumstances. Limit the number of slices to five (at the most), and make sure that the slices are not too small and are visible. You can use pie charts effectively to give a general sense of how one dimension compares to another, but do not use it to report measures that are close in value. It is too difficult for people to interpret when the measures (the pie slices) are of similar sizes. Tableau Public, unlike other data visualization software packages, does not support three D pie charts and drill-downs into pie slices. This is a good thing because these characteristics lead to confusing and misleading pie charts.\nqi9a | Chapter Four\nr7ii | We made the pie chart shown in the following screenshot, which still uses the World Bank Indicators data to show the relative percentage of mobile phone users in the world by region:\nezxx | One. On a new worksheet, change the mark type to a pie on the Marks card.\nzzb7 | Two. Drag Region to the Color shelf.\nzts3 | Three. Click on the context menu on the Color shelf to change the color palette to Cyclic.\nq5zo | Four. Drag Business: Mobile Phone Subscribers to the Size shelf on the Marks card.\nz20w | Five. Click on the Color controller on the Marks card and add a black border.\nig3d | Six. Drag both Region and Business: Mobile Phone Subscribers to the Label shelf on the Marks card.\ndgts | Seven. Click on the context menu for Business: Mobile Phone Subscribers on the Label shelf of the Marks card, select Quick Table Calculation, and choose Percent of Total.\np1zf | Eight. Filter Date by setting it to two thousand ten.\nk0wj | Nine. Click on the Context menu on the Color legend, select Sort, and sort Regions in the descending order by Business: Mobile Phone Subscribers:\np83v | Visualization - Tips and Types\n5yts | This pie chart shows that half of the mobile phone users in the world are in Asia. The pie chart is easy to use, and it does not mislead users. It provides them with the context that they need to sort through the information points quickly.\nl1qt | Using groups and sets\n183q | It can be useful to group dimension members into groups to report on these groups, as compared to others. For example, in the Life Expectancy Map that we built earlier, it might be helpful to add Canada, USA, and Mexico into a group or set named North American Countries.\nvdw3 | A group is a simple set that is composed of the dimension members that you choose. In the following example, we set up the North American group by performing the following steps:\n8whh | One. Right-click on the Country field in the Dimensions pane.\niywu | Two. Select Create and then choose Group from the context menu.\nqn1v | Three. Give the group a name.\no9ng | Four. Manually select the three countries that we want to put into the group.\n6od4 | Five. Click on the Group button and then name the group.\njx1z | Six. Click on OK.\nhrlm | Note that the group field appears at the bottom of the Dimensions pane. It is considered to be metadata. It exists in the Tableau Public workbook, but it does not appear in your original data source.\nwfjt | Chapter Four\ng779 | In the following example, we added the group to the Color shelf on the Marks card of the map. Countries are colored by their membership in the group. Either they are in, or they are out, as shown in the following screenshot:\nby5l | Similarly, we can create a set that groups members of a dimension by their adherence to the criteria that you establish.\nwye3 | We can create a set that identifies the top twenty-five countries by life expectancy, which will be used again to modify the map, from the World Bank indicators data source by performing the following steps:\noc7w | One. Right-click on the Country field in the Dimensions pane.\nk5k4 | Two. Click on Create and then select Set.\nwngq | Three. Rename the Set to Country Set.\nudft | Four. Click on the Condition tab rather than manually selecting the members of the Set so that it will be updated if and when we get new data.\nfoay | Visualization - Tips and Types\n43mx | Five. Create a condition that includes the top twenty-five countries by Health: Life Expectancy at Birth (total years).\nld7j | Six. Click on OK, as shown in the following screenshot:\nmf5v | We dragged the set from the bottom of the Dimensions pane and dropped it on the top of the field on the Color shelf on the Marks card, thus replacing it. Countries that are in the top twenty-five countries filtered according to life expectancy are colored blue, and all the others are gray, as shown in the following screenshot:\nf31w | Chapter Four\nyofz | Summary",
