In earlier work, the Sleep Problems syndrome scale of the CBCL was not included in the analyses. Here, we applied LPA to define\nq1q2 | psychopathology subgroups at T One, T Two and T Three, using CBCL T-scores of all available syndrome scales as indicators, including Sleep Problems. Consistent with earlier work within Generation R, we used five criteria to determine the optimal number of profiles. The Bayesian Information Criterion and the bootstrapped likelihood ratio test were used to evaluate the fit of each model. The Bayesian Information Criterion is a measure of model fit considering the rule of parsimony, with a lower Bayesian Information Criterion indicating a better fit. The bootstrapped likelihood ratio test is a likelihood ratio for K classes versus K minus one classes, with a P-value greater than zero point zero five indicating that K minus one classes are sufficient. Entropy of the models was evaluated with values closer to one indicating better classification. Moreover, all profiles obtained should include a minimum of one percent of the participants. Lastly, all profiles were inspected visually to ensure each additional profile had a distinct severity or shape pattern.\ncb7r | Latent Transition Analysis\n68xu | We applied Latent Transition Analysis to calculate transition probabilities between psychopathology profiles over time. Due to the use of different CBCL versions, we were unable to test a model where we held the profiles equal across all ages. Therefore, the quantitative change in profile patterns was taken into account in interpreting the transition probabilities. In our primary model we allowed profiles to be estimated freely. Additionally, a partial invariant model was tested in which the profiles were held equal between T Two and T Three. Lastly, we tested a model in which demographic characteristics, biological sex, national origin and socioeconomic status based on maternal education and household income, were included as covariates. The number of profiles included in the Latent Transition Analysis at each age wave was based on the optimal number of profiles at each individual time point.\nhd35 | Both Latent Profile Analysis and Latent Transition Analysis were performed using Mplus version eight point six. Full information maximum likelihood was used in both the Latent Profile Analysis and the Latent Transition Analysis analyses to account for missing data, which can be used to account for data considered either missing at random or missing completely at random. No missing data was imputed. A detailed overview showing in how many data collection waves each individual participated, split by demographic variables, is provided in Supplementary Table one. Participants with a lower socioeconomic status and participants from non-western national origin were more likely to have fewer measurements available, pointing towards a pattern of missing at random.\n2zpk | Results\nepu7 | Latent Profile Analysis\n7od1 | The optimal model fit was determined, based on the bootstrapped likelihood ratio test, the Bayesian Information Criterion, the entropy and the inclusion of at least one percent of the\n0bqy | participants in the smallest profile obtained. When two or more models fitted the data equally well, optimal fit was based on visual inspection. We were unable to discriminate between models based on the bootstrapped likelihood ratio test, since the bootstrapped likelihood ratio test was less than zero point zero zero one across all waves and across all tested profiles, indicating that adding a profile would improve model fit, even when six profiles were fitted to the data. Likewise, the Bayesian Information Criterion decreased with an increasing number of profiles added to the model and could therefore not discriminate between the models at T One through T Three. At T One, a four-profile fit was determined the best fitting model, as the five-profile fit resulted in one profile with fewer than one percent of participants. At T Two, the entropy varied between the models, indicating that the model with four, five or six profiles at T Two fit the data equally well. Visual inspection of the four and five profile fit showed that the fifth profile did not differ largely in both shape and severity from profiles that were already identified in the four-profile fit. Therefore, a four-profile fit was determined optimal at T Two. At T Three, the optimal fit was based on the entropy, which was highest for the four-profile fit. Model fit indices are provided in Supplementary Table two.\nb780 | We describe these four profiles as: one. no problems, T One eighty-five point nine percent, T Two seventy-nine point zero percent, T Three seventy-eight point zero percent with low scores on all syndrome scales, two. internalizing, T One five point one percent, T Two nine point two percent, T Three nine point zero percent with particularly high scores on Anxious/Depressed,\nccmb | Withdrawn/Depressed and Thought Problems, three. externalizing, T One seven point three percent, T Two eight point three percent, T Three ten point two percent, consisting of children scoring high on Attention Problems, Rule-Breaking Behavior and Aggressive Behavior, and finally four. the DP, T One one point seven percent, T Two three point five percent, T Three two point eight percent, with elevated scores on all syndrome scales, see Table two and Fig. two. To remain consistent with our earlier work, we use the term DP with the understanding that the term is synonymous with the term 'comorbid group'.\nma93 | Latent Transition Analysis\nc6hh | Based on fit statistics, the freely estimated model and the partial invariant model fitted the data equally well, freely estimated: Bayesian Information Criterion equals six hundred sixty thousand six hundred forty-two point zero four, entropy equals zero point eight seven; partial invariant: Bayesian Information Criterion equals six hundred sixty thousand six hundred forty-one point three two, entropy equals zero point eight seven. Transition probabilities, based on the freely estimated model, between T One through T Three are shown in Tables three and four. Transition probabilities for the partial invariant model are presented in Supplementary Table three and four.\ny7ea | Homotypic continuity, indicating that children were classified in the same psychopathology subgroup at two consecutive time points, was eighty-four point five percent between T One and T Two for the no problems group and eighty-eight point one percent between T Two and T Three. As expected, homotypic continuity was lower for the\nnav4 | psychopathology subgroups than for the no problems group. Homotypic continuity between T One and T Two and between T Two and T Three for the internalizing group was thirty-eight point one percent and thirty-seven point six percent, for the externalizing subgroup was thirty-seven point three percent and forty-six point eight percent, and for the DP subgroup was forty-four point seven percent and thirty-three point six percent, respectively.",
