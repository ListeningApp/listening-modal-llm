You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0b39 | Plant materials and measurements
qecd | Plants of sunflower (Helianthus annuus, cv 'Sunspot') were grown in pots in a growth chamber (day : night temperature, 25 : 20℃; relative humidity, 70%; photon flux density, c. 500 umol <LATEX>m ^ { - 2 } s ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> at the soil level; photoperiod, 16 h, 06:00- 22:00 h) in Wageningen. Five seeds were sown and seedlings were thinned to one plant per 7 l pot. Initial amounts of soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were 0.62, 0.83, and 1.04 g per pot, respectively. Nutrient solution was added two or three times per week based on the expected plant growth. Seeds were sown weekly for 4 wk, creating four replications. Mea- surements were conducted on the <LATEX>1 1 ^ { \text { th } }</LATEX> or <LATEX>1 2 ^ { \text { th } }</LATEX> fully expanded leaf counting from the bottom, using one plant per replication.
1o7p | An open gas exchange system (Li-Cor 6800; Li-Cor Inc., Lin- coln, NE, USA) and an integrated fluorescence chamber head of <LATEX>6 c m ^ { 2 }</LATEX> were used for three sets of measurements, in which various <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> or <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> concentrations or various temperatures were used to create different amounts of photorespiration (Table 1). The first set used five <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> concentrations. Four cylinders containing differ- ent mixtures of <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>N _ { 2 }</LATEX> were used. Gas from the cylinder was supplied to the Li-Cor 6800 where CO2 was blended with <LATEX>O _ { 2 } .</LATEX> For the second set, five different ambient CO2 (Ca)
cp13 | concentrations in the leaf chamber were used (Table 1). For the third set, four leaf temperatures were used (Table 1). A flow rate of 200 umol s-1 was used, and leaf-to-air vapour pressure differ- ence was maintained within 0.8-1.6 kPa, for all measurements.
bgre | For a given <LATEX>O _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> or temperature, a photosynthetic response curve to incident irradiance <LATEX>\left( A - I _ { \mathrm { i n c } } \right)</LATEX> was measured. Leaves were first acclimated under 80 umol m 2 s-1 until A reached a steady state, which took c. 45 min. Measurements were then undertaken using a sequence of 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, and <LATEX>5 \text { \mumol } m ^ { - 2 } s ^ { - 1 } ,</LATEX> with 6 min for each step. For measurements in each of the first two sets, <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> or CO2 concentra- tions were chosen randomly. Measurements of the temperature set were conducted after the <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }</LATEX> sets to avoid possible after-effects of high temperature on leaves. For the same reason, the four temperatures were set up from low to high rather than randomly.
57lp | After the measurements for <LATEX>A - I _ { \mathrm { i n c } }</LATEX> curves, <LATEX>A - C _ { i }</LATEX> curves were determined to provide extra data to estimate <LATEX>g _ { m } .</LATEX> Leaves were adapted to an <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { i n c } }</LATEX> of <LATEX>1 0 0 \text { \mumol m } ^ { - 2 } s ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> at 25℃ and 21% <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> until <LATEX>A</LATEX> became stable, and curves were measured using a <LATEX>C _ { a }</LATEX> sequence of 400, 200, 100, 75, 50, 400, 400, 550, 800 and 1500 umol <LATEX>\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 } ,</LATEX> with 3 min per step. Apparent <LATEX>A - C _ { i }</LATEX> curves were also assessed with heat-killed leaves, which showed that <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> leakage was negligible during our measurement using the Li-Cor 6800.
ukth | For each step of either the <LATEX>A - I _ { i n c }</LATEX> or <LATEX>A - C ;</LATEX> curve, PSII photo- chemical operating efficiency <LATEX>\left( \Phi _ { 2 } \right)</LATEX> was determined by Chl fluo- rescence as <LATEX>\left( 1 - F _ { s } / F _ { m } { } ^ { \prime } \right) ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>F _ { s }</LATEX> is the steady-state fluorescence and <LATEX>F _ { \mathrm { m } } ^ { \prime }</LATEX> is the maximum fluorescence as revealed using the single flash of c. 8500 umol <LATEX>\mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } s ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> for a duration of 1.0 s. We did not use the multiphase method to determine <LATEX>F _ { \mathrm { m } } { } ^ { \prime }</LATEX> because all measure- ments were undertaken at low irradiances.
