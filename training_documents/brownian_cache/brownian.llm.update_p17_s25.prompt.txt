You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

w8ia | Having solved the appropriate flow equations to obtain the dynamical effective potentials we can now solve (108). Given the dynamical effective potential V it only takes a couple of seconds to obtain the full trajectory of x from some initial position Ci = Xi to the equilibrium position. For the polynomial potential we initialised the particle far away from the equilibrium position at x = 4. In Fig. 9 we show how the average position of the particle changes with time using direct simulation of the Langevin equation (4) over 50,000 runs, by numerically solving the
4vej | F-P equation (34) and as calculated by the evolution in the dynamical effective potentials V given using the LPA and WFR methods at Y = 10. All four trajectories agree to a very high precision.
8ut1 | In Fig. 10 we plot the evolution of x(t) for the unequal LJ potential where the particle begins in the smaller well at x = - 1.878 and moves towards its equilibrium posi- tion. We see as before that the WFR trajectory closely matches the simulated trajectory offering significant im- provement over the LPA computation. Note that for this system it was impossible to get convergent numerics for the evolution of the F-P equation (34) This ability of the fRG to capture the non-trivial evolution of average po- sition is also shown in Fig. 11 for the x2 potential plus 6 bumps/dips which is a much more complex potential landscape at three different temperatures. Here the LPA trajectory offers improvement over the x2 "prediction" by converging to the correct equilibrium position and includ- ing WFR more closely matches the true simulated tra- jectory. Lowering the temperature generically decreases the accuracy of the fRG results. It is noteworthy that the fRG is able to reasonably capture these difficult dy- namics well in systems where the F-P solution is difficult to obtain.
6o35 | It is important to note the time advantage offered by the fRG. Solving the fRG flow equations is comparable in computation time to direct simulation while solving the F-P equation (34) takes longer than both. However the latter two methods obtain solutions that are only valid for a single initial condition. A huge advantage of the fRG is that once the dynamical effective potential V is obtained it is trivial to solve the EEOM (108) in a couple of seconds for any initial position whereas for both direct numerical simulation of (4) and solving the F-P equation (34) one has to start again from scratch.
8r63 | C. Evolution of Var(x)
qze0 | For our accelerated trajectories we initialised the par- ticles at the exact same point every time. This means that at t = 0 the probability distribution of the particles had zero variance Var(x) = 0. Using this as our initial
o3m2 | condition we solved numerically the EEOM for the vari- ance (116) , derived in appendix B. In Fig. 12 we show how the variance evolves with time for the polynomial potential for Y = 10. We can see that the LPA closely matches the numerical and F-P evolution until t = 0.5 before departing slightly although it still tends towards the correct equilibrium distribution.
kro9 | In Fig. 13 we show how the variance evolves with time for an unequal LJ. As with the one-point function the F- P was unable to give sensible statistics however the LPA is able to very well match the early simulated trajectory even capturing the overshooting of the variance. The WFR on the other hand is better at capturing the late- time decay to equilibrium.
i438 | Finally in Fig. 14 we show how the variance evolves for the x2 plus 6 gaussian bumps/dips potential at three different temperatures. As before, lowering the temper- ature decreases accuracy. In Fig. 14 (c) the fRG once again clearly captures the overshooting which is a fea- ture of the gaussian bumps' existence; the bare x2 evolu- tion does not capture this behaviour and overall describes the evolution poorly, converging to the wrong equilibrium variance. Again as before the LPA much better describes the early evolution while WFR more accurately describes late time evolution.
yr7b | D. Comparison with the spectral expansion
60hk | The above results for the change in the relative perfor- mance of LPA + WFR as temperature is lowered can be interpreted by resorting to the spectral expansion. In section II B we recalled how all observables can be computed in a standard way from the Schrödinger-like, Fokker-Planck equation (34) using an expansion in eigen- functions and eigenenergies. It is straightforward to show
5djf | that - given our initial conditions considered above - the average position and the two-point function can be ex- pressed as:
hem5 | <LATEX>\langle x \left( t \right) \rangle = \chi _ { e q } + \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } \left[ e ^ { - E _ { n } t } e ^ { V \left( x _ { 0 } \right) / \Upsilon } p _ { n } \left( x _ { 0 } \right) \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. \times \int _ { - \infty } ^ { \infty } d x x e ^ { - V \left( x \right) / \Upsilon } p _ { n } \left( x \right) \right]</LATEX> (131)
