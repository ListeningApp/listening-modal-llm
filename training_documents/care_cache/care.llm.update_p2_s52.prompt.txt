You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

2zpk | However, as the story above illustrates, even concerted effort at the effectiveness end of the trial design spectrum is not enough to guar- antee routine usage of a clinical innovation. Moreover, education and monitoring are not sufficient to change provider behavior, as indicated
epu7 | by a meta-analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration which showed that audit and feedback only increased target provider behaviors by 4.3% (0.5-16%) (Ivers et al., 2012). Thus, simply using traditional clinical trials approaches and pushing them further into real-world conditions is not sufficient to guarantee public health impact. Factors contributing to the non-adoption of evidence-based clinical innovations must be ad- dressed directly through promising methods and strategies that can be subjected to rigorous investigation in the emerging field of im- plementation science.
7od1 | 3. What is implementation science?
0bqy | 3.1. Some history
b780 | While researchers, clinicians, and healthcare leaders have been at least partially and intermittently aware of the problem of non-adoption of evidence-based clinical innovations, the area began to coalesce as a sustained field of study with the publication of Everett Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations (1962). Drawing on examples from agriculture and in- dustry as well as health, Rogers conceptualized the spread, or diffusion, of innovations as a social process with multiple determinants well be- yond the evidence supporting the innovation itself. Concurrently, others also called attention to contextual aspects of innovation adoption or non-adoption, including the field of knowledge utilization, which addresses the tenuous link of evidence to policy decisions; and the field of technology transfer, which investigates reasons that knowledge and technology do not flow freely even within single organizations (Dearing et al., 2018). These areas of study, and others, have provided a collective foundation upon which the field of implementation science emerged.
ccmb | 3.2. Defining implementation science
ma93 | Implementation science has been defined in several ways that are consistent with the definition put forward in the inaugural issue of the journal, Implementation Science: " ... the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence- based practice into routine practice and, hence, to improve the quality and effectiveness of health services." (Eccles and Mittman, 2006). Hence the goal of implementation science is not to establish the health impact of a clinical innovation, but rather to identify the factors that affect its uptake into routine use (Fig. 1, lower panel).
c6hh | As outlined above, ample experience indicates that factors which affect the uptake of a clinical innovation differ from those factors that determine whether an innovation works. The crux of implementation science is thus two-fold (Fig. 2):
y7ea | . Identify uptake barriers and facilitators across multiple levels of context (individuals in treatment, providers, organization, and other stakeholder groups), and
nav4 | . Develop and apply implementation strategies that overcome these barriers and enhance the facilitators to increase the uptake of evi- dence-based clinical innovations.
gem8 | In its focus on changing individual and social unit behavior, im- plementation science is close kin to the wide spectrum of fields ranging, for example, from health behavior change (Prestwich et al., 2017) to organizational psychology (Spector, 2016).
e8nr | 4. How implementation science differs from clinical Research, quality Improvement, and dissemination
k78w | 4.1. Clinical research versus implementation research
g9du | Perhaps the major difference between clinical research and im- plementation research is that the latter actively engages with the con- text into which a clinical innovation is introduced, rather than con- trolling (efficacy studies) or simply tolerating (effectiveness studies) that context. Consider a hypothetical trial of intranasal ketamine for depression (Andrade, 2015) (see Table 1).
f682 | Implementation trial designs differ from efficacy and effectiveness clinical trials at a fundamental level, that of the hypothesis. While clinical trials focus on contrasting the health effects of an innovation with a comparison group, implementation trials focus on testing stra- tegies to increase uptake and sustainability of the innovation, in this example intranasal ketamine. Efficacy and effectiveness trials seek to evaluate a clinical innovation-i.e., a clinical treatment, test, organi- zation of care, or other initiative to be introduced into a healthcare venue. In contrast, implementation trials seek to evaluate a strategy for increasing uptake of the evidence-based innovation into routine prac- tice-typically an integrated set, bundle, or package of implementation innovations to enhance the usage of the clinical innovation. (Curran et al., 2012; and see Kirchner, this issue)
li1k | While the subject population and setting in an implementation trial may resemble those used in effectiveness trials, alternatively the unit of observation in implementation trials may also be providers or clinics or even entire organizations-depending on the focus of the im- plementation effort. Further, as the population becomes more hetero- geneous in moving from efficacy to effectiveness designs, outcome measures must become briefer and simpler in order to minimize re- spondent burden and retain protocol subjects who are less research- tolerant; this is true in implementation trials as well. As one moves from left to right in Table 1, intervention clinicians become progressively less highly specialized and skill development efforts more closely resemble training that would typically be feasible under general conditions; measurement of fidelity to the intervention varies similarly.
pbea | Consideration of the context for the research also differs sub- stantively across the efficacy-effectiveness-implementation spectrum. Efficacy trials value conducting a trial that is invariant from beginning to end. This entails sometimes extraordinary efforts at training clin- icians and tracking subjects, so that the research team's efforts amount at times to "crypto-case management" (i.e., aggressive subject engage- ment and follow-up outreach) to ensure close follow-up and minimal data loss-which is not a problem since the focus of the trial is solely on testing the intervention under optimal conditions. However, since ef- fectiveness studies are more concerned with performance of an effica- cious intervention in real-world settings, careful attention is paid to limiting the amount of research-funded effort that is incorporated into the protocol, often "firewalling" research effort with carefully and ex- plicitly defined parameters (Bauer et al., 2001). Further, for im- plementation trials, trying to optimize the natural context in which uptake is being measured is a threat to validity of the trial. Thus, re- searcher involvement at the sites is drastically circumscribed, with
ccpt | some implementation trials even limiting research support to training endogenous clinicians and utilizing remote, "light-touch" outcome as- sessments for patient and provider subjects (see also Smith, this issue).
