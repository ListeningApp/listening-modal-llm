Applying this expression to equation eight and using the orthogonality of Vt plus one, we obtain the reduced tridiagonal least-squares problem\n5djf | min\nhem5 | open fourteen close\nvfd9 | where thirty-one equals the norm of g.\njkgk | QR Factorisation. The next step in the MINRES procedure is to solve equation fourteen by computing the full QR factorisation QtTt equals Rt where Qt belongs to the real numbers raised to the power of t plus one by t plus one and Rt belongs to the real numbers raised to the power of t plus one by t. Because It is already close to being upper triangular, we form the QR factorisation using a series of Householder reflections to annihilate the sub-diagonal elements. Each Householder reflection affects only two rows of Tt. We can summarise the effect of two successive Householder reflections\n8nom | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimisation with Nonnegativity Constraints\nvsjd | for three less than i less than t quad minus quad one as\ntucm | open left parenthesis one, one, one, one right parenthesis open left parenthesis ci minus one, si minus one, zero, ci minus one, si minus one right parenthesis open left parenthesis gamma i minus two, delta i minus one, zero, zero right parenthesis open left parenthesis beta i minus one, alpha i minus one, beta i, zero, zero, beta i, alpha i, beta i plus one right parenthesis equals open left parenthesis one, zero, zero right parenthesis open left parenthesis ci minus one, si minus one, zero, si minus one, ci minus one right parenthesis open left parenthesis gamma i minus two to the power of two, delta i minus one to the power of two, epsilon i, zero, zero, gamma i minus one, delta i, zero, beta i, alpha i, beta i plus one right parenthesis equals open left parenthesis gamma i minus two to the power of two, delta i minus one to the power of two, epsilon i, zero, zero, gamma i minus one to the power of two, delta i to the power of two, epsilon i plus one, zero, zero, gamma i, delta i plus one right parenthesis comma\nprly | ci equals the fraction of gamma i over gamma i to the power of two comma si equals the fraction of beta i plus one over gamma i to the power of two comma gamma i to the power of two equals square root open left parenthesis gamma i close parenthesis to the power of two plus beta i plus one to the power of two equals ci gamma i plus si beta i plus one period We therefore form Q sub t as a product of the Householder reflection matrices\n2epy | Q sub t equals product from i equals one to t Q sub i, i plus one, Q sub i, i plus one, is similar to open left parenthesis I sub i minus one, si sub t, si sub t, si sub t, ci sub t, I sub t minus i right parenthesis period It is also clear that R sub t is given by",
