You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

lbed | So important is this lesson that it can be said to go before all others: in the sense that failure to know this can prevent you from learning more - and can leave you attached to the externals of hypocrites. This includes, of course, unconscious hypocrites.
2thk | If the Sufis are right in their claim that time affects behaviour, and that personal appearance should change (and even tempera- ment) then obviously all the people who cultivate a reverend appearance, and all those who acquire it, mistaking this for spirituality, are wrong.
ugry | It is this unspoken contradiction which makes it almost im- possible for people who want continuity and easily identifiable teaching figures, to accept the change in circumstances and atti- tudes which the Sufi Way demands.
vvh3 | These people, of course, will not have thought it out like this. All they know is that 'A holy man must seem holy to me'; or 'If he always behaves in the same manner, or always exhorts me to the same things, I believe that he may be right'.
j4h0 | The other problem is that the observer is confusing, as he is bound to confuse without having understood, continuity and con- sistency with reliability or truth. Because butter always tastes the same when it looks the same, he expects a similar 'reliability' in his spiritual teacher. He is, of course, self-deceived in this as- sumption.
i652 | The genesis of the attitude adopted by the people of externals is that their inward drive is for finding tidiness, order. This is not a spiritual activity, it is perhaps, rather, a therapeutic one. Order is essential for disordered people. Looking for it as a major factor in 'esoteric' directions is the mistake.
xzdl | In trying to make what - for them - is order out of what they imagine to be the disorder of Sufi tradition, they have to over- simplify. They ignore parts of the teaching and succeed only in creating an imitation of Sufism.
0svg | Because so many people desire order so strongly, you will find more imitations than reality. One cannot blame anyone for this. But pointing out facts can help.
b0va | WHAT A TEACHER SHOULD BE
esy3 | Ibn Arabi's dictum on this matter has not been bettered:
g96a | 'People think that a teacher should display miracles and mani- fest illumination. But the requirement in a teacher is that he should possess all that the disciple needs.'
o4b2 | BEYOND APPEARANCES
v35x | In order to possess what a disciple needs, the Teacher must be one who has gone beyond appearances and has realised his inner-
3vcs | most self, after transcending the barriers imposed by attach- ment to secondary factors. He really exists and is aware of this existence. As Ibn Arabi says: 'Absolute existence is the source of all existence'.
y4gx | Hallaj put it in this way, indicating the peculiarity of the realised individual:
b5ju | 'I am the Real, for I have not ceased to be real-through the Real.'
21e1 | Sufi teachers who have reached stages where strange things happen in their vicinity, generally called miracles and wonders, due to actions other than any attempt to impress, have to try to compensate for this. Otherwise people are attracted to them or to the Sufis in general because of a craving for wonders.
f7to | THE ONION SHOP
nkdf | One example of this is when the great woman Sufi Rabia had no vegetables in the house, and mentioned it. Suddenly a string of onions fell from the sky, it seemed, and people cried out that this was a proof of divine blessing.
3tsf | Conversions through miracles, Rabia realised, are only emo- tional happenings and have no essential spiritual reality. So she said, in a famous phrase:
57xh | 'A miracle, you say? What, does my Lord therefore keep an onion shop?'
x9wv | Books and Beyond Books
sm98 | Q: What is the compatibility, if any, of the Sufi book and the Sufi teaching beyond books?
aqhz | A: Many people say that they cannot learn from books.
etyv | INSTRUMENTAL FUNCTION
ksy2 | Of course they cannot: because they have first to learn that, correctly guided, they can learn from books, or from grass- hoppers, or from anything.
mund | A book, for the Sufis, is an instrument as much as it is some- thing to give information.
uhlr | Information and action are both necessary.
688j | The key is the teacher.
qdf9 | If he says: * Read this book' then you should read it.
rnv1 | If your answer is: 'I cannot learn from books', then you are in fact refusing his teaching.
70gp | If you refuse teaching, do not be surprised if you do not learn anything.
1cc3 | You may be one of those whose problem is that you do not want to learn, and your saying T want to learn' is a protection against ever learning: an incantation, in fact.
n5b7 | No real teacher will mistake a man or woman who merely says: 'I want to learn' for one who undoubtedly wants to learn.
vi9l | That is why so many people have to go through stages which will show them that their condition (while they claimed that they wanted to learn and could not find the materials) was an un- suitable basis for learning.
pny0 | REALITY AND POTENTIALITY
zlcb | Man has to come to understand how to see himself as he really is, so that he can achieve something in the area which he calls 'what he might be'.
5an2 | Again, it is the teacher who knows what is indicated: whether his student has to develop through linear or other modes. As Khaja Khan says, traditionally, direct teaching beyond books, the mystery of unification, was taught to the spiritual elite, while the linear Holy Law (the Islamic Shariyya) was given to the ordinary people. In this way the limited could rise via discipline, the Shariyya, and the elite were able to descend to the Law by means of the Truth of immediate perception.
ibib | According to the Sufis, there is only one Essence, Reality (Haqq = Truth). Derived from this is appearance, Form, referred to by Ibn al-Arabi, in his Fusus al-Hikam, and others, as Khalq, that which is created, secondary. To mistake the secondary for the primary is usual and humanity has to learn how to avoid this. But living in a secondary realm, 'the world', humanity must learn the value and limitations of the secondary, of phenomena. The limitations include the fact that such derivatives cannot help one beyond a certain stage with anything. The value is the occasions and circumstances in which such things can be of help, and the kind of use they can be.
kjrj | VALUE OF THE RELATIVE
i8xi | 'The Relative is the Channel to the Absolute' (Al-majazu qantarat al-Haqiqa) encapsulates this statement. The Sufi's experience in- forms him in relation to knowing how to deal with the secondary factors, and hence enables him to teach.
sx4a | The Sufi teaching through books, or through the use of scholas- tic methods applied to indicate their absurdity or limitations, was demonstrated one day by Shaqiq of Balkh when Haroun al- Rashid visited him seeking wisdom.
whiz | THE VALUE OF A KINGDOM
e7zk | The Caliph, in all his magnificence, was in need of a lesson in the relative nature of power and possessions. 'Ask a favour of me', be said.
hzuh | Shaqiq asked him whether he would give one-half of his realm
e3n2 | to someone who would give him a drink of water, if he were dying of thirst in a desert.
r7iy | Haroun said that he would.
sh7g | And, continued the Sufi, would he give the other half to some- one who enabled him to pass that water, if he had become unable to do so?
89b1 | Haroun said that he would.
th0v | Now Shaqiq asked the Caliph to reflect why he valued his kingdom so highly, when it was something which could be given away in return for a drink of water, which itself does not stay with one.
