You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

mror | Catalytic graphitization assisted synthesis of FezC/ Fe/graphitic carbon with advanced pseudocapacitance+
zlxc | We report an environmentally friendly strategy for the synthesis of FezC/Fe/graphitic carbon based on hydrothermal carbonization and graphitization of carbon spheres with potassium ferrate (K2FeO4) at 800 °C. The obtained sample consisting of Fe3C/Fe nanoparticles and graphitic carbon (FC-1-8) delivered an enhanced pseudocapacitance of 428.0 F g 1 at a current density of 1 A g 1. After removal of the FezC/Fe electroactive materials, the graphitic carbon (FC-1-8-HCI) possessed a large specific surface area (SSA) up to 2813.6 m2 g-1 with a capacity of 243.3 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, far outweighing the other amorphous carbon electrodes of FC-0-8 (carbon spheres annealed at 800 ℃ without the treatment of K2FeO4). The graphitic material with a porous structure could offer more electroactive sites and improved conductivity of the sample. This method provided guidelines for the synthesis of superior performance supercapacitors with synchronous graphitic carbon and electroactive species.
k0bw | 1. Introduction
aq5a | The ever-increasing demand for energy all over the world has promoted intensive research in the field of energy storage materials. Among various types of emerging power devices, supercapacitors (SCs) owing to their excellent output capability, quick charge-discharge rate and long cycle stability have attracted much attention of researchers.1,2
sc5y | Carbon-based materials, such as activated carbon and gra- phene, have been regarded as the most common electrode materials. The hydrothermal carbonization technique is a green and soft chemistry method to synthesize carbon-based mate- rials under mild temperature and self-generated pressure.3 The whole process involved a series of reactions, such as hydrolysis, dehydration, polymerization and aromatization, leading to the formation of brown hydrochar and soluble chemicals.4 Biomass-derived carbon materials are low-cost and have been reported as good candidates for carbon-based electrodes.5
0yab | The properties of specific surface area (SSA), porosity and conductivity of these materials have a big influence on their performance of electrochemistry.6-8 As we all know, the larger SSA value is favorable to obtaining electrode material with excellent performance. Till now, various strategies have been proposed to develop porous structure, including carbonization under KOH,9 ZnCl2 (ref. 10 and 11) and CO2.12 Despite the remarkable increase
w95z | in the SSA value and pore size after activation, most materials display unsatisfied specific capacitance because of the low conductivity. Creating graphitic carbon leading to lower internal resistance is a possible method to solve the problem. Generally, the conventional graphitization transformation requires rigorous conditions, like high temperature (>1000 ℃) or high vacuum degree, which do not only needs a huge energy input but also leads to a decreased porosity of the host.13,14 However, using transition metal (Fe, Co or Ni) functioned as a catalyst during the pyrolysis process could achieve graphitization transformation at low temperature.15-17 Metal organic frameworks (MOF), as a kind of porous coordination polymers, are promising materials in the field of supercapacitor and battery.18 Pang et al. studied a series of MOF composite as excellent electrochemical energy storage material, such as [Ni(thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate)(4,4'-bipyridine)] n MOF nanocrystals,19 Co3O4 nanocube@Co-MOF.20 In some cases, the derived species could serve as electroactive species as well and can be used to prepare SCs with high performance. For example, Li et al.21 fabricated carbon hybrids by g-C3N4 and iron oxalate as electrode, which delivered an enhanced pseudocapaci- tance. In this process, iron oxalate was further reduced to metallic Fe followed by carbide reaction. Fe-based nanomaterials, such as encapsulated FeP nanoparticles with graphene,22 nano Fe-C3 with in situ grown CNT on N doped hollow carbon cube,23 N-doped carbon nanotubes grafted onto MOF-derived carbon nano- materials (Fe-NCNT) were proved to display efficient electro- chemical performance. ß-FeOOH@carbon derived multi-shelled Fe2O3 microspheres by calcination in air could deliver a high capacity up to 630 F g 1 at 1 A g-1.24
0i1k | Herein, we achieved a safe and environmentally friendly transformation from amorphous carbon spheres to graphitic
dqlg | carbon layers with Fe3C/Fe nanoparticles (NPs) through K2FeO4 named as FC-1-8, which showed excellent pseudocapacitance as the electrode for SCs. K2FeO4, in this article, is not only used as the activating agent but also functioned as the precursor of catalyst (Fe) in the graphitic transformation process. The derived Fe3C/Fe NPs serve as electroactive species as well and compared with the other amorphous carbon electrodes of FC-0- 8 (carbon spheres annealed without the treatment of K2FeO4), the K2FeO4-derived Fe3C/Fe/graphitic carbon exhibited an outstanding pseudocapacitance of 428.0 F g 1 at 1 A g 1 working as an electrode material for SCs. After removal of the Fe3C/Fe electroactive materials, the graphitic carbon (FC-1-8- HCl) with a much high SSA up to 2813.6 m2 g 1 displayed a capacity of two times higher than that of the other type of amorphous carbon electrode, FC-0-8. Fe3C/Fe/graphitic carbon exhibited synchronous performance of graphitic carbon and electroactive species, which was inspirational and provided a novel route to design electrode material.

zse6 | 2.1 Materials
p2n3 | Glucose (C6H12O6, AR) was purchased from Aladdin Reagent Inc. Potassium ferrate (K2FeO4, >98%) was obtained from Bei- jing Innochem Chemical Co., Ltd. All the chemicals were used as received without further purification.
ohh7 | 2.2 Hydrothermal synthesis of carbon spheres
vbni | The carbon spheres were synthesized using glucose as a precursor through hydrothermal carbonization. In a typical procedure, a certain concentration of glucose was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (100 mL), followed by heating at 140-200 ℃ for 10 h before being naturally cooled to room temperature. The precipitates were isolated by centrifu- gation and rinsed sequentially with deionized water and ethanol, and dried in an oven at 60 ℃ overnight. Several kinds of parameters were investigated and the details were displayed in Table 1. The samples were named as Gx-T-t, where X is the concentration of glucose, T is the hydrothermal temperature, t is the reaction time. For example, G1-200-10 means 1 M glucose was hydrothermally treated at 200 ℃ for 10 h.
