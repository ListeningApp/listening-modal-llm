You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

epu7 | Resources. To complement the changes to the organizational structure, Zhang developed a new corporate culture to support the company's shift toward responsiveness and customer orientation. To encourage simultaneous internal cooperation and competition among the company units, Haier's corporate cul- ture emphasized internal reputation and performance. Backed up by appropri- ate performance management systems, the company emphasized that the more productive and customer-oriented employees are, the more decision-making autonomy and greater rewards they will receive. The new corporate culture was understandably more receptive to the radical changes in organizational practices in the mid-2000s.
7od1 | But beyond employing the organizational culture as a resource, the intro- duction of a new management system required resources such as consultancy fees, new IT systems, and staff training. More importantly, the performance out- comes of Rendanheyi were totally unknown, and unsuccessful implementation could become a major drain on the company's finances. However, Zhang sug- gested that Rendanheyi would proceed even if revenues and profits showed signs of weakening.
0bqy | Fortunately, Zhang did not have to worry about resources or the potential impact on investors when he introduced his new management system in 2005. Haier's revenues in the mid-2000s were soaring, having quadrupled from RMB27 billion in 1999 to RMB 103 billion in 2005. And the Haier Group was under partial public ownership, freeing the company from delivering consistent financial returns.
b780 | The freedom to allocate resources distinguished Haier from western competi- tors. Indeed, Zhang told us that he specifically discussed the idea of introducing
ccmb | Management Innovation Made in China: Haier's Rendanheyi
ma93 | 87
c6hh | Rendanheyi with senior management of a very large U.S. multinational firm, and he was reportedly told that "we cannot do it [introduce Rendanheyi] because we need to play by Wall Street rules." On another occasion, a group of visiting European managers from several well-known large enterprises accused Haier of fabricating a "trompe l'Å“il" with their ZZJYTs and communities of interest, sug- gesting that such radically innovative practices would be "impossible to imple- ment." A focus on quarterly results and steady revenues keeps American and European companies from even contemplating the sort of changes that Rendanheyi requires. In contrast, Haier's resources allowed Zhang to embark on a radical new management innovation, shifting the firm from a traditional manufacturer toward an agile online-platform-driven firm, without any guarantee that this turnaround would actually enhance organizational performance.
y7ea | Lessons for Management Innovators
nav4 | The Haier Rendanheyi case produces four key lessons for management innovation. First, it is clear that one good response to a high VUCA world is man- agement innovating, that is, the creation of innovative management systems. We showed how Rendanheyi constituted just such a response for the Haier Group. The Haier case is quite significant, since this is not a company from the buzz- ing IT sector in Silicon Valley or the innovative biotech sector in Britain's Silicon Fen. The white goods industry is traditionally a mature, slow-moving, and low- profit manufacturing sector. Yet, an environment with high VUCA is challeng- ing this sector, too, and the Haier example illustrates the necessity as well as the opportunity for established companies to invent novel management systems in response.
gem8 | The second lesson revolves around how Haier experimented with Rendanheyi. The case study demonstrates that experimentation is a sine qua non for success in a VUCA environment. In particular, the Haier case demonstrates that leadership may eventually be the single most important contextual factor for making management innovation work. Furthermore, the management innova- tion seemed to co-evolve with the ideas and experiences of Haier's CEO. This sug- gests that those leaders that can actually learn from experiments are best placed to make management innovation work.
e8nr | Third, we presented an extended process model of management innova- tion, which managers in both emerging and developed countries can apply. The four-stage process model, illustrated in Figure 1, describes each of the stages man- agers go through when undertaking management innovation, with the internal and external contexts influencing all four stages. Managers must carefully con- sider competitive, technological, and institutional constraints when engaging in a new management innovation, while the three organizational contextual factors of structure, leadership, and resources act as enablers or levers for management innovating. Clearly the relative importance of internal and external contexts var- ies from one episode to the next, as emphasized by Zhang:
k78w | CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW 61(!)
g9du | both matter . . . the first big transformation of Haier was based on external factors, as we knew that the market was going to become much more competitive, but the next transformation was based on a fear that we had, or would, become much too bureaucratic, and so we needed to combat the internal tendency.
f682 | Fourth, managers should align the nature of management innovations they create, and how these are created, to the six environmental categories in our model, in line with the Haier case but also following other successful man- agement innovators throughout history. Where leadership in an organization is strong and charismatic, a top-down creation process is more viable, which is how GM came up with the divisional M-form. With slack resources, organizations should attempt to undertake more management innovation, as GE has demon- strated throughout its history with stretch goals, Six Sigma, and the strategic business unit, to mention but a few. Organizations that want to be more effective management innovators have to build structures that allow for more experimen- tation, as Procter and Gamble did with Connect-and-Develop.32 Furthermore, managers must align their attempts at management innovating to what is possi- ble in their institutional environment, Toyota's lean manufacturing being a great example, as noted earlier. Finally, they should increase efforts at management innovation when technological change is frequent and when there is intense competitive pressure, which was part of the reasoning behind Samsung's co- opetition model.
li1k | Discussion and Conclusion
pbea | The main contributions of this article are demonstrating how the internal and external contexts mattered for the creation of Rendanheyi to allow Haier to deal with a high VUCA world, drawing lessons from Haier's experimentation process for other firms, and providing an improved explanation of how new management innovations are created.
ccpt | For the creation of Rendanheyi, leadership was the most important con- textual factor, and our model extends the literature on the role of leadership in management innovation33 by providing a detailed description of how strong lead- ership can drive the development and implementation of management innova- tion. Yet, we suggest that leadership would not have been enough to drive Rendanheyi through, if the other contextual factors were not aligned and pushed in the same direction. In general terms, strong leadership does not always have to be the most important factor for every single management innovation. For instance, the initial development of innovations such as the balanced scorecard at Analog Devices and scenario planning at Shell was neither initiated nor driven by top management.34
0fpw | The complexities and uncertainties of the VUCA world are driving firms such as Haier to create management innovations that are appropriate to the con- text in which they operate. This article shows specifically how rapid and timely
dqn8 | Management Innovation Made in China: Haier's Rendanheyi
cop0 | responses to deal with VUCA lead to context-dependent management innovations created by emerging market firms such as Haier. Rendanheyi allows Haier to both connect better to customers and create more internal cohesion, without sacrificing scale advantages, due to technology deployment. Our model suggests that manag- ers must carefully consider the specific context within which they operate before introducing a novel management innovation.
lhkq | Some questions on the future development of Rendanheyi are unresolved, as the transfer of Rendanheyi to Haier's foreign affiliates, other companies, and other national contexts will be challenging. The challenges Haier faces in the implementation of Rendanheyi are, to some extent, archetypical of breakthrough innovations. It is well documented that key stakeholders are often cautious and even unwilling to adopt or participate in breakthrough innovations for a myriad of reasons.35 More fundamentally, as we have seen, there are cultural and legal impediments that limit Rendanheyi's applicability in other institutional contexts. Rendanheyi may not work as well, or not at all, in other countries. In fact, the implementation of Rendanheyi has been very limited in Haier's foreign affiliates. Haier executives still hope to eventually transfer Rendanheyi to Haier's global affiliates, but the takeover of GE's white goods division may render this objective even more difficult.
82ju | Within those affiliates where Rendanheyi has been fully introduced, Haier also needs to consider some critical issues going forward, including how organization-wide process innovations can be implemented by semi-autono- mous xiaowei, given that user-facing xiaowei are obsessed with product innova- tions with relatively quick payoffs and are less concerned with the longer term collective interests of the Haier Group. As the Haier Group is progressively dilut- ing its ownership stakes in the xiaowei, Haier must also consider how successful xiaowei can be prevented from fully disengaging themselves from the Haier Group organization. One possible future for Haier would be to transform into a "flotilla" model away from the "ocean liner," as Zhang has already indicated that "we may be entering the era of losing control" in the quest to serve customers better.
y2qo | Future research will need to further investigate to what extent Rendanheyi and other context-specific management innovations from emerging countries are transferable across national borders and organizational boundaries. There is much evidence that the transfer of organizational innovations across institutional con- texts often fails. The failed or incomplete transfer of management innovations from Japan to the West and the mixed success of novel, hierarchy-free organiza- tional forms such as holacracy should serve as a warning to managers.36 As we have seen, China's institutional context is particularly conducive to Rendanheyi. There is no written manual for introducing Rendanheyi, and, in fact, the ambigu- ity and vagueness of the precise contents of Rendanheyi are typical of most Chinese management models, as Chinese organizations tend to develop broad and imprecise strategies that are short on details and vague on the specific steps to implement them.37 Furthermore, Rendanheyi took a long time to develop into

rhaz | what it is today, and compared with key historical management innovations, only the making of Toyota's lean production platform has taken as long.38 Haier's long experimentation with Rendanheyi may have been an important reason why the practice was successfully implemented within the company, since the practice was molded by the specific experiences of the company, and Haier employees gradu- ally got used to assuming greater management responsibilities. Therefore, the Rendanheyi case suggests that organizations must be cautious before cutting and pasting radically innovative processes and mechanisms to obtain the same goals. Nonetheless, some elements of Rendanheyi could well be emulated by companies around the world, and this case will surely inspire managers and academics work- ing with management innovation.

On one hand, this is chiefly due to the fluid and highly dynamic business environment that requires companies to favor broad strategies that provide them with a wide array of options and allow them to experiment and adapt. On the other hand, there are cultural (holistic view and dialectical thinking) and historical reasons that made Chinese organizations more reflexive in order to absorb unex- pected external changes and continuously morph to cope with heightened complexity and uncertainty in the business environment.
