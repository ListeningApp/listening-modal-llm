## Scope and Objectives

Basic differences between animals and plants


## one. Trophism

· Plants only one trophic level; animals up to five to seven or more levels (Predators of sixth degree)

. Algae - Copepod - Fish larvae (one) - Dragonfly larvae (two) - Tilapia (three) - Pied kingfisher (four)

· Grass - Locust - Preying mantis (one) - Lizard (two) - Cobra (three) - Mongoose (four) - Python (five) - Leopard (six)

· The relationship between competition and predation in community structuring is far more complex for animals as these can be both prey and predators at the same time (plants are normally only prey for herbivores and few are predatory - carnivorous plants e.g. Drosera spp.)


## two. Mobility

. Generally, all plants are immobile (except for a few algae) whereas all animals are mobile (except corals and barnacles)

· Field study of animals far more difficult due to seasonal movements, cryptic behaviour etc.

· Implications - challenges in assessing animal population dynamics (distribution, abundance, density and diversity)


## three. Ranges

· Animals have larger ranges than plants, especially for migratory animals

· Spatio-temporal (circadian/circannual) variation in animal ranges poses challenges for describing community structure and interspecific interactions


## four. Behaviour

· Animals generally have more complex and diversified behavioural patterns (intra-/ inter- specific interaction, predation, reproduction)


## five. Reproduction

· Plants are immobile and reproduction is by fertilization agent (animals, wind or water)

. Many plants depend on animals for their reproduction. E.g. pollinators of pollen and dispersers of seeds

· Mobile animals actively search for reproductive partners, engage in complex courtship behaviour (e.g. vocalization, body display, pheromone attraction, building of structures such as nesting sites, mating chambers) to initiate copulation

· Immobile animals (e.g. marine corals and barnacles) reproduces in a way similar to that of plants (more passive fertilization modes)


## six. Dispersion

· Plants depend on agents for dispersal whereas animals disperse by themselves by virtue of their mobility

· Good dispersers include flying organisms as well as aquatic organisms that can tolerate a broad temperature range, or highly prolific species with high population turnover


## Plant and Animal Interactions

· Plants depend on animals and vice versa

. Examples of animal dependencies on plants: Food (Herbivory), Building materials (Nests), Roosting and shelter (Protection)

· Examples of plant dependencies on animals: Pollination, Seed dispersal, Protection (Predators on Herbivores)


## Different aspects of Animal Ecology

· Evolutionary Ecology - Focus on how ecology and evolution are linked as inter-related processes. Ecology drives speciation/extinction which again affect community structure

· Behavioural Ecology - Focus on how ecology and behaviour is linked. Survival strategies such as Optimal Foraging and Reproductive strategies such as Semelparity/Iteroparity

. Population Ecology - Focus on how population grow, are regulated and interaction within and between different species (Competition, Predation, Mutualism, Parasitism)

· Community Ecology - Focus on how communities of animals are structured with groups made up of taxonomical and ecological guilds

· Macro-ecology: Focus on large scale (global) patterns of animal communities, spatio-temporal patterns of distribution, abundance an diversity on the Earth

ECOSYSTEM: Biotic and abiotic factors interacting in a specific area (Ghana's coastal woodland)


## Practical Implications

· Understanding the relationship amongst niches, species, community structure and functioning;

*Land and water - Species-area relationship, habitat heterogeneity, island biogeography models

Crop pests: Predator-prey relations, anti-predator strategies, invasive species ecology

Design of conservation regions - Species diversity concentrations, gradients, endemic centres

Vector control of tropical diseases - Trophic organisations and food webs, predation, competition

* World fish stock - Food webs, predator-prey relations, invasive alien species

## Lecture two - Experimental Methods in Animal Ecology

one. An introduction to the three major experimental methodologies in Animal Ecology:

Laboratory tests, Field Experiments, Natural Experiments two. An overview of how ecologists use different field approaches to show that Competitive Exclusion Principle (Gause's Law) is real three. A comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of experimental methodologies four. An account of important ecological concepts related to Gause's Law - Niche overlap and Niche shift


## Method

Laboratory Experiments

Field (Manipulation) Experiments


## Famous Examples

· Diamond's island ground doves and honey eaters


## Major Advantages

Relatively good controls


## Major Limitations

· Confounding factors can compromise validity of patterns


## Laboratory Experiments

Georgy Gause's Protozoa Cultures (Paramecium aurelia and P. caudatum)

. Glass tube experiments

. Grown separately (allopatric "A and B") or together (sympatric "C")

· Logistic population growth until carrying capacity (K) reached

· Carrying capacities (K) measured as volume density of each organism (population density)

K _ { \text { aurelia } \left( A \right) } = five hundred twenty Number per zero point five milliliter sample

· Similar decrease in

Sympatric Logistic Growth

K : P . aurelia = \left( five hundred twenty - three hundred \right) / five hundred twenty = forty-two point three P . datum = \left( three hundred sixty - two hundred \right) / three hundred sixty = forty-four point four percent


## Laboratory Experiment two

Thomas Park's Three Grain Beetle species: Tribolium confusum, T. castaneum, and Oryzaephilus surinamensis.

Variable - Climatic conditions, temperature/moisture, and food availability.

Monitoring of competitive outcome, highest fitness, among three grain beetles.

Moisture gradient: Dry - Moist.

Temperature gradient: Hot - Warm - Cold.

Demonstrations of Fundamental and Realized niches.

T. castaneum: hot-moist specialist.

T. confusum: cold-dry specialist.

Fundamental niches.

Hot-moist versus cold-dry specialists.

Both species of beetles exhibit identical climate niches in allopatry.

Climatic extremes represented in only one of the two species, with the other species occupying the middle range.

In sympatric medium, T. confusum always eliminates O. surinamensis because of its higher rate of reproduction and better predation ability.

An extra dimension, such as space in the form of glass tubes, allows co-existence of the two species.


## Oryzaephilus.

Interspecific Competition - Field Experiments.

Joseph H. Connell's Tidal Barnacles: Balanus balanoides and Chthamalus stellatus.

Adult Chthamalus usually occur above Balanus.

Chthamalus larvae do settle in Balanus Lower Tide Zone.

Adult Balanus never in high tide zones due to desiccation.

Methodology - Connell suspected that adult Balanus out competed adult Chthamalus. He kept removing Balanus adult in lower zones in experimental plots in one set as well as removing Chthamalus from upper zone in another.

Results.

One. Removing Balanus from lower zones caused Chthamalus to survive.

Two. Balanus never settled in upper zone even as Chthamalus was removed there.

Conclusion.

One. Adult barnacles compete over space in lower zones.

Two. Balanus is superior, crushing Chthamalus, leaving a small realized niche, upper zone, for Chthamalus.

Three. Fundamental niche of Chthamalus includes dry upper zones where Balanus cannot withstand desiccation.


## Interspecific competition - Field Experiment Two.

Brown and Davidson's Granivorous Desert Ants and Rodents in Arizona.

Ants and rodents were observed to overlap in seed utilization, and the question was then: Are they competing for a limited resource, seeds?

Experimental Design.

One. Ant-Removal Plots were sprayed with pesticides regularly.

Two. Rodent-Removal Plots were fenced and subjected to intensive trapping protocols.

Three. Both ants and rodents removed.

Four. Control Plots with both ants and rodents present.

Results.

One. Rodents removed - Ant colonies increase above control plots.

Two. Ants removed - Rodents densities increase above control plots.


## Conclusions.

One. As one competitor is removed the remaining increase. Density Compensation occurs - Release of extra resources that is no more utilized by the removed species.

Two. Ants and rodents have overlapping limited food resource niche, seeds, over which they compete.


## Interspecific Competition - Field Experiment Three.

Paine's starfish, Pisaster, in rocky intertidal zones of the United States: Predator-mediated Coexistence.

Pisaster, a keystone predator, predates differentially on the dominant competitors, bivalves, and acorn barnacles.

Removal of the predator showed that the more dominant competitors crowded out the inferior species, goose barnacles, limpets, and chitons.

This reduced the total number of coexisting species from fifteen to eight.

A classic example of Top-Down control of communities, trophic cascading effects, or predator-mediated coexistence at lower trophic levels.

Ecological Release, Habitat - Natural Experiments One.

Jared M. Diamond's Ground Doves on Papua New Guinea and associated islands: Chalcophaps indica, C. stephani, and Gallicolumba rufigula.

Mainland, New Guinea: All three Ground doves living sympatrically in distinct habitats, no overlap.

Large island, Bagabag: Only two species - In the absence of Gallicolumba rufigula, Chalcophaps stephani expands its niche to include inland rainforest.

Very small islands, New Britain, Tolokiwa, Karkar, Espiritu Santo: Only one species, Chalcophaps indica, present and it's able to occupy all three types.

Conclusion.

Fundamental niches of the three doves shown only when in allopatry.

When in sympatry, each species excludes the other two from its specialized habitat, contiguous allopatry.

There is competitive exclusion on New Guinea and competitive release elsewhere.


## Ecological Release, Habitat - Natural Experiments Two.

Jared M. Diamond's, nineteen seventy-five, Honeyeaters on three Papua New Guinea mountains.

Fundamental niche: similar - Phylidonyris guisel equals three hundred to three thousand five hundred meters; Phylidonyris peristriata equals two hundred to three thousand eight hundred fifty meters.

Fundamental niche: overlap.

Eighty-eight percent. Ranged reduced, allopatry to sympatry, from two hundred to three thousand seven hundred to three thousand to three thousand eight hundred fifty meters.

Twenty-five percent. Realized niche of inferior species, Phylidonyris peristriata, only twenty-five percent of the fundamental niche.

Another example of habitat related, altitudinal equals vertical spatial, ecological release.


## Contiguous Allopatry - Natural Experiment Three. H. C. Heller's chipmunks in Sierra Nevada mountains, California.

Ecological Release/Niche Shift - Natural Experiment Four


## ONils-Arvid Nilsson's Salmonids in Swedish Lakes (Asymmetric Niche Shift)

· Assessment of diets (six food types) of two Salmonids

· Great overlap in food utilization in allopatry

· Large crustaceans, insect larvae and terrestrial insects preferred by both species in allopatry

In sympatry;

Char specializes greatly (sixty percent) on small crustaceans, greatly reducing consumption of insect larvae and terrestrial insects

Trout largely remains a generalist in sympatry; large crustaceans/molluscs are shared in sympatry

Char's dietary composition greatly changed in sympatry; Trout's not


## Limiting Similarity - Character Displacement One

Tom Fenchel's Character Displacement in Marine Mud Snails, Denmark

· Measurement of lengths of two species of snails; Hydrobia ulvae and H. ventrosa

· Shell length correlated with food size

· Allopatry: Snail length almost identical, mode equals three millimeters

· Sympatry: Snail length distinctively smaller for H. ventrosa, mode approximately one point eight millimeters, but bigger for H. ulvae, mode approximately three point seven millimeters


## Tom Fenchel's Character Displacement in Marine Mud Snails, Denmark

· Food size of the two species in allopatry very similar

· Allopatry: Both species' mode equals approximately sixty micrometers in diameter

· Sympatry: H. ulvae approximately one hundred micrometers; H. ventrosa approximately sixty micrometers

· Conclusion: The snails compete for the same limiting food resource and H. ulvae diverge towards the larger-sized food hence reducing niche-overlap


## Limiting Similarity - Character Displacement Two

Community-wide Character Displacement & Hutchinson's Size Ratio Rule. Niche partitioning among fruit pigeons - four key niche dimensions: Fruit Size: Larger species feed mostly on larger fruits (large beaks can handle these)

Bird Size and Weight: Body size positively correlated to preferred fruit sizes eaten

Thickness of Branches: Body size positively correlated with branch thickness

Position on Branches: Small species foraging on outer branches and twigs due to lower weight.


## Summary - Animal Ecology Experimental Methods

One. Three Animal Ecology Experimental Methods

· Laboratory: small animals, simple principles, strong controls

· Field Experiments: small-medium sized, advanced set-up, limited control

· Natural Experiments: any size of animal, large sample size, poor controls


## Two. Seven Major Ways to demonstrate competitive interactions

· Competitive Exclusion: Yeast and grain beetle competition for space

· Niche shift: Dietary shift between two salmonids (allopatry-sympatry)

· Ecological release: Barnacle competition for space (Displacement)

## Four. The Explanatory Concept for competition: Fundamental versus Realised Niche

Lecture Three: The Basis of the Ecological Niche Concept


## One. Definitions of important terminologies in Ecological Niche Concept

· Trophic component: Elton

· Multi-dimensional: Hutchinson

· Abiotic-biotic multidimensional: Begon-Krebs-Ricklefs


## Two. Overview of perception of niche dimensionality

· Niche dimensions: Biotic and abiotic components interacting

· Graphical depiction: One-, two-, three-, multi-dimensional visualization

· Dimensional interaction: Dimensions can be unrelated or inter-dependent


## Lecture Three: The Basis of the Ecological Niche Concept

Three. Comparison of two niches types and the eco-potential of a species

· Eco-potential: Genotype determined/ limited maximum potential

· Fundamental: Optimum niche, phenotype limited by environmental factors

· Realised: Limited by biotic interactions: competition, predation, parasitism


## Four. Foraging Niche concept and fitness of animals

· Fitness: Population size, reproductive and survivorship rates

· Utilization and Response Curves: Bell-shaped, normal distribution, idealized

· Three Levels: Trophic (what-), Spatial (where-), Temporal (when) to eat

· According to Joseph Grinnel, an American ecologist, Ecological Niche is defined it as "The ultimate distributional unit of a species"

· Grinnel implied that niches do not overlap, but are disjunct. Species display their fundamental niches; hence there is no apparent competition among them.

· Charles S. Elton, a British ecologist, went further by using a more functional view concept, and defined Ecological niche as: "The trophic position of a species in the biotic environment".

· Elton viewed the niche as a simplistic subdivision within the traditional trophic grouping as herbivores, carnivores etc., i.e. the mere feeding habits or dietary trait of a species.

· George Evelyn Hutchinson, after thirty years, proposed the most comprehensive concept to date

"The n-dimensional hypervolume or hyperspace of a species"

· The Hutchinsonian concept implies the total range of environmental variables to which a species must be adapted, and under which a species population lives and reproduces indefinitely.

· The Hutchinsonian concept therefore involves both habitat and functional aspects

· The environmental variables include physical, chemical and biotic parameters

· These variables can be viewed as a gradient along which species utilize with different intensities, and each gradient is considered as an n-dimensional space. Adding up all these forms the niche hyperspace

· The niche can be viewed as an n-sided flexible ball that can take any form in an n-dimensional coordinate system and represents the responses of the species population to all environmental variables.

· In multidimensional geometry with n-number of axes, the niche of an organism is graphically depicted, when all relevant environmental variables are included and these are independent of each other

· Begon et al.: "The limits, for all important environmental features, within which all individuals of a species can survive, grow and reproduce"

· Krebs: "The role or profession of an organism in the environment; its activities and relationships in the community"

· A very broad definition comprising all biotic interactions (competition, mutualism etc)

· Ricklefs: Formal Definition - "The ranges of many conditions and resource qualities within which the organism or species persists" (i.e. perceived as the multi-dimensional space)

· Informal Definition - "The ecological role of a species in the community"

· Polechová & Storch: "Ecological niche indicates the position of a species within an ecosystem, describing both the range of conditions necessary for persistence of species, and its ecological role in the ecosystem.

· The diversity of definitions illustrates to what extent the niche is perceived as a species or community property: Is the niche created by the species itself, or by its surroundings?

· Or as a dynamic mutual interaction? Let us examine an example - The Beaver


## The Niche Concept - Dynamics

· The Beaver (Castor Canadensis, C. fiber) creates dams by felling trees across fast-flowing rivers, hence creating a new environment of stagnant water in which they build their nests.

· Hence beavers create their own habitat which is conducive both for itself and for many other organisms - i.e. beavers impact their habitat by virtue of a specialised niche of dam building.

We can generalise that:

Eco- or Biotic Potential: The full genetic potential of a species population in all ecological matters.

Fundamental Niche: Phenotype limited by environmental factors and physical constraints currently shaping the genotype; for example, the temperature or food type range of an organism.

Realized Niche: Phenotype limited by biotic interactions equals competition, predation, parasitism; for example, the population growth of an organism after predators have reduced it.


## The Niche Theory - Niche Dimensions & Fitness

(a) One Dimension:

Abiotic: Temperature


## The Niche Theory - Niche Dimensions & Fitness

Resource Utilisation Curve (Resource Gradient equals Seed size, Fruit ripeness, Tree height etc.)

Species Response Curve (Environmental Gradient equals Temperature, pH, Salinity etc.)

Note that only one dimension is shown on these ‘bell-shaped curves'.


## The Niche Theory - Niche Dimensions & Fitness

Graphical expressions of multidimensional niches can also incorporate fitness

Again with more than three niche dimensions this becomes increasingly problematic to show in graphic diagrams.

Examples are shown below: (a) Fitness highest at X equals five point five units;

Y equals three point zero (b) Fitness highest at

The Niche Theory - Niche Dimensions & Fitness


## Summarizing the Overall Levels of Ecological (Foraging) Niche Dimensions

Summary of Lecture Three - The Basis of the Ecological Niche Concept

One. Historically the Niche Concept was initiated and developed about one hundred years ago

Grinnel: Geographical-spatial distributional unit of a species

Elton: Trophic-foraging positioning of a species in the ecosystems

Hutchinson: The first comprehensive n-dimensional hyper volume

Begon-Krebs-Ricklefs: Further advancing of Hutchinson's Polechová and Storch: Duality - both position and role in ecosystems

Two. Species Niches are controlled by Dynamic Ecological Interactions:

Abiotic components: Climatic conditions, chemical-physical environment

Biotic components: Competitors, parasites, predators-prey, disease


## Summary of Lecture Three - The Basis of the Ecological Niche Concept

Three. Three types defined within the Theory of the ecological Niche Concept:

Eco or Biotic Potential: Absolute maximum potentiality - genotype determined

Fundamental: Actual uncontested, resource unlimited - phenotype determined

Realized: Actual in the presence of other biotic interactors - resource limited

Four. Three major Niche Dimensions: Trophic (food), Spatial (area), Temporal (time)


## Objectives of lecture Four - Theory and Concept of the Ecological Niche

One. An introduction to Niche Width - populations and individual morphs:

What is the effect of phenotypic traits on niche width and shape?


## Two. An Overview of interspecies niche relationship and positioning:

Included niches: Which are inferior and which are superior?

Abutting niches: How limited is competition such as in Contiguous Allopatry?

Overlapping niches: How much can niches overlap before exclusion results?


## Three. A Comparison of Niche Overlap and Competition:

Interspecific: The relationship between species density and niche width.


## Four. An Account of the rules for Niche Width, Overlap and Limiting Similarity:

Diffuse Competition: Additive competitors may drive exclusion from Niche.


## Niche Theory - Niche Width and Overlap (One)

Natural populations have variability in both resource use and diversity of morphs

(b) Between Phenotype Component: morphological diversity of a population.

Niche width (W) equals Within Phenotype Component plus Between Phenotype Component

If Within Phenotype Component is high then the population consists of mono or oligo-morph generalists (a)

If Between Phenotype Component is high then the population consists of poly-morph specialists (b)

(a) Intraspecific: Increased population density (Low to High) increases competition among individuals for limited resources (food and space), forcing individuals to search for and adapt to other opportunities equals increasing niche width.

(b) Interspecific: Increased competition between species force these to reduce niche overlap or segregate niches by virtue of specialisation equals decreasing niche width (narrow niches allow more dense packing of species in communities).


## Niche Theory - Niche Width and Overlap (Three)

Possible niche relationships of two species (Species One, Species Two and Species Three; one niche dimension):

(A) Included, (B) Overlapping, (C) Abutting, (D) Disjunct niches.


## Niche Theory - Niche Width and Overlap (Four)

Realized Niche (G) equals

G equals brackets (A plus B plus C plus D plus E plus F) divided by G close brackets

Diffuse competition of several species on a single species.

The fundamental niche of species G is greatly reduced by subtracting the overlapping fundamental niches of species A through F.

This illustrates how several species may squeeze out another species by this cumulative or diffuse competition.

No competition (disjunct): D divided by W greater than three, Invasion of adjacent species:


## Objectives - Differential Niche overlap and Complementarity

One. An Introduction to the concept of niche overlap and interspecific competition:

How does spatio-temporal variation on food availability affect trophic niche?

Which mechanisms separate species to limit similarity and segregate niches?


## Two. An Overview of various modes of differential niche overlap

How does various means of niche segregations operate?

What are the relationships among trophic and spatio-temporal niche division?


## Three. An Account of relationships between niche dimensionality and complementarity:

What is the effect of increasing niche dimensions and complementarity?

What are the basic rules for complementarity and niche dimensionality?

How does niche differentiation and complementarity increase coexistence?


## Four. A Comparison of ways in which niches are partitioned at the community level:

What are the basic rules (Hutchinson's) of community wide niche partitioning?


## Differential Niche Overlap and Complementarity (One)

Categories of species separation along complementary resource dimensions

One. Food type and habitat - species showing overlap in habitat eat different foods, or vice versa

Two. Food type and time - species use the same food at different times or different foods at the same time

Three. Habitat and time - species uses the same habitat at different times or different habitats at the same time

Four. Habitat and habitat - species overlapping in horizontal habitat often differ in vertical habitat or vice versa

Five. Food type and food type - species may eat similar-sized foods but different species or types, or vice versa


## Differential Niche Overlap and Complementarity (Two)

Seasonal (temporal) variation in habitat and dietary overlap among granivorous birds in an Arizonian grassland equals spatio-temporal dietary niche segregation:

Rainy Season (food plenty): Birds specialize on a seed type across overlapping habitat types

Dry Season (food scarce): Birds specialize on separate habitats foraging on many seed types


## Differential Niche Overlap and Complementarity (Three)

Differential Niche Overlap between Four hypothetical species (A, B, C, D)

Horizontal niche dimension considered alone: Species C is apparently in trouble facing diffuse competition from both B and D - coexistence doubtful.

Vertical niche dimension considered alone: Species C subject to heavy niche overlap with A, and moderate overlap from B - coexistence doubtful.

Both Niche dimensions considered simultaneously

Resulting Niche Space

A, B, C versus D disjunct

A versus B disjunct

A and C abutting

Only little overlap between species B and C


## Differential Niche Overlap and Complementarity (Four)

Foraging Techniques of Five sympatric Bird Species in Oak Forest

The time spent on three foraging tactics for each species monitored: One. Hovering, Two. Gleaning, Three. Hawking

All five species adopt all strategies, but to a variable degree.

Gleaners: Parus inornatus (tit), Vermivora celata (warbler).

Hover-Gleaners: Vireo gilvus, V. huttoni (shrike-warblers).

Glean-Hover-Hawker: Polioptila caerulea (gnatcatcher)

Differences in foraging techniques may reduce direct interference and also resource exploitation as each method is best designed for a particular prey type in a particular microhabitat

Hovering

Equilateral Triangle

Hawking


## Differential Niche Overlap and Complementarity five

Differential Niche Overlap and Complementarity six


## Spatial Foraging Niche Separation of two water boatmen bugs (Heteroptera)

Perch positions monitored quantitatively over time:

Species a prefers near bottom fifty-five percent, and least at water surface five percent

Species b prefers middle of water fifty-eight percent, and least at water surface seven percent

In this way they separate foraging depth and reduces competition


## Community Wide Niche Partitioning one

Nine squirrel species in African rainforest:

Three Habitat types:

Dense growth one species, Flooded forest one species

Mature and Disturbed Forest seven species

Trophic specialization one species

Bark scraping on tree trunks

Frugivores separate spatially six species :

Ground three species and Arboreal three species

In each of the two vertical guilds, the three species separate on fruit size and hardness both of which is related to jaw musculature which again is related to mere body size (Hutchinson's Body Size Ratio Rule)


## Community Wide Niche Partitioning two

Nineteen species of Coral Reef Fish at Great Barrier Reef, Australia:

Segregation into four main trophic levels in which size and body shape vary:

Generalists typical fish shape, vary in size following Hutchinson's Rule

Hard corals six Small typical shape and extra deep body, two large deep body

Soft and Hard corals four species three Large, one Small all typical shape

Other invertebrates three species Large typical shape and deep body


## Niche Overlap, Partitioning and Coexistence

Summarizing Flow Chart showing the various ways that ecologically similar species may segregate or differentiate the overlap of their foraging niches Birds


## Summary: Differential Niche Overlap and Complementarity

One. Differential Niche Overlap comprises three major dimensions:

Spatial: Horizontal (habitat types) and vertical (altitude, vegetation strata)

Temporal: Time of day and night, seasonal variation (dry and wet, summer and winter)

Trophic: Generalist or Specialist dietary trait, foraging techniques/ strategies

Two. Niche Differentiation, Complementarity and Coexistence often interrelated:

Niche dimensionality one to Niche differentiation one to Complementarity one

High niche differentiation predisposes Complementarity to Coexistence

High overlap in some niche dimensions tolerated by otherwise low overlaps


## Summary: Differential Niche Overlap and Complementarity

Three. Community wide niche partitioning limits similarity and increase coexistence:

High overlap in vertical and horizontal space leads to low trophic overlap

High dietary overlap leads to low, abutting, disjunct and spatial niches

High dietary and spatial overlap leads to low overlap in temporal niche

Four. Coexistence facilitated by limiting similarity and hence niche overlap:

Spatial separation: vertical-horizontal habitat ranges, territoriality

Resource partitioning: Diet and foraging techniques diverging

Morphological divergence: Body size, feeding apparatus (teeth, claws, beaks)


## ABCS three hundred forty-nine: Objectives of Lecture six - Niche Partitioning and Species Richness

One. An Introduction to modeling of species richness using niche partitioning:

What pertinent factors within the niche concept theory predicts diversity?

How are these factors interrelated and what are the dynamics among them?


## Two. An Overview of various models to explain species numbers in space and time:

Are they mathematical stochastic or deterministic models?

Graphically explained models to support the notational equations?

How does the models explain the links between niche dimensionality and how many species than can be 'packed' into a natural system or community?


## Three. A Comparison of various models to explain species numbers on islands:

The species-area models explained - islands and mainland islands

The island biogeography model: immigration, emigration, speciation, extinction


## Four. An Account of the theories behind speciation and extinction processes:

What drives speciation in relation to niche overlap and competition?

What drives extinction in relation to niche overlap and competition?

Ds equals P one plus Cã, where Du

Based on MacArthur's model, communities diversity is shaped in three potentially interacting ways:

One. Resource base: How big is N in the niche hypervolume. Areas with more available resource have larger Dr and C components (niche space) and can therefore contain more species.

Two. Niche width or degree of specialization of component species. Narrow niches can be packed tighter and thus contain more species.

Three. Niche overlap between species. Greater species overlap leads to greater diversity even if two communities are similar in both areas.

Four. Niche curve shape also counts, in thick-tailed (leptokurtic) curves more species can be packed on the same resource gradient than thin-tailed (platykurtic) curves seventy-three


## Niche Partitioning and Species Richness two

Forest Succession and Increased Bird Diversity (Species Richness):

As habitat heterogeneity increases and more bird species are added, these have to separate on an increasing number of niche dimensions, particularly:

Food type, Foraging techniques, Foraging height, Micro-habitat type


## Biogeography - The Species-Area Model (one)

When increasing the area from which one samples various species populations, the total species number increase in a positive way according to the following logarithmic deterministic model: S equals C times A to the power of Z. Areas equals Oceanic islands or Habitat islands on mainlands.

Factors that specifically contribute to the S-Area relationship are:

One. Large islands are also subject to larger sampling sizes of individuals from species populations thereby increasing the probability of encountering new species; hence a mere sampling phenomenon or artefact of more effective species sampling as N increases

Two. As the island size increases, the probability of encountering different habitat types also increases: High landscape heterogeneity: Lakes, mountains, valleys, swamps, oases etc., and such features contain more potential niches that can be filled by species

Biogeography - The Species-Area Model (two)

Three. Large islands inevitably also contain large populations, and large populations are less vulnerable to local extinction phenomena

Four. Large island populations also have higher speciation potentials due to higher population variability contained herein

Five. Large islands inevitably represent larger targets for colonizing species as the probability of encountering the area increases with size


## Biogeography - The Species-Area Model (three)

The normal range of Z is zero point two zero to zero point four zero for true oceanic islands and often around zero point two five.

Z is only zero point one to zero point two five for recently isolated habitat islands.

Z is greater than zero point two six for long-term isolated habitats on the mainland or very large islands such as Australia.

As habitat connectivity increases, the S-Area relationship is reduced —> Low z-value

Habitat connectivity is related to habitat diversity and as oceanic islands are more isolated than mainland habitat islands, they display stronger S-Area relationship


## Biogeography - The Species-Area Model (four)

Logging both sides of the S-Area power function:

log S equals log C plus z log A

C and Z are constants depending on both habitat type, animal community and is specific to variability in dispersability and mobility of the species herein.

In a x-y logarithmic plot, log C is the intercept on the y-axis, and z denotes the graph slope.

The z-value denotes how strong the S and A relationship is


## MacArthur-Wilson's Equilibrium Theory (one)

Modelling species number on true islands: S depends on two independent variables: One. Immigration rate. Two. Extinction rate.

S is determined when an equilibrium between I and E rates is obtained

As S increases, I rate is lowered as potential niche space is occupied

In contrast when S increases then E rate increases due to increased interspecific competition

Small islands have high E and low I rates: They are small targets and have small vulnerable populations; the opposite is the case for large islands; high I and low E


## Immigration rate

Distance to mainland also a factor for I rate: Distance islands have low I and close islands have higher I.

Thus, S is highest on large islands nearby mainland, and smallest on small islands far from the mainland


## MacArthur-Wilson's Equilibrium Theory (two)

Extinction Rate: Depends on One. Island Size, Two. Distance to mainland

Island Size: Large islands have larger populations, hence genetic population variability is high and populations therefore more resilient towards predators, diseases, and stochastic detrimental events.

Distance to mainland: If close to mainland, extinctions may be delayed by regular immigration, thus compensating for the species loss over time


## MacArthur-Wilson's Equilibrium Theory (three)

Immigration Rate: Depends on One. Island Size, Two. Distance to mainland.

Island Size: A large island represents a greater target for colonisers with higher probability of colonization.

Distance to mainland: If the distance is short, the likeliness of species colonizing from the mainland is higher than for more remote islands, to which many species may have difficulties in reaching successfully.

In effect species number is highest on large islands close to the mainland and smallest on small islands far away from the mainland


## Modelling Species Number on Habitat Islands

On habitat islands, species numbers depend on One. Speciation rate and Two. Extinction rate.

Immigration plays a minor role on the large scale and is replaced by speciation processes.

However, if habitat connectivity is high between islands, immigration from species rich areas is important in ecological time frame; speciation only evolutionary time frame


## Speciation Rate

Fewer empty niches reduce the chances of adaptive radiation by virtue of reducing character displacement processes


## Extinction Rate

As species saturation increases interspecific competition increases extinction rate through the competitive exclusion principle.


## Summary - Niche Partitioning & Species Richness (one)

One. Species richness and the niche concept are interrelated and determined by:

Niche dimensionality and differentiation: Related to habitat heterogeneity

Niche width and shape: Narrow and leptokurtic niches increase diversity

Niche overlap and competitive coefficient: Complementarity increase S


## Two. Species richness and niches also interrelated with the habitat.

Habitat complexity: Both vertical and horizontal heterogeneity increase S

Habitat area: Large and interconnected habitat areas increase richness


## Summary - Niche Partitioning & Species Richness

Three. The species-area model explains the number of species on islands

True islands: z-value higher than on mainland islands z equals zero point two zero to zero point four zero, z approximately zero point two five. Mainland islands: Lower than for true islands, z greater than zero point two six, Lakes: Similar to mainland islands but largely depends on connecting rivers.

Four. The theory of island biogeography and species richness depend on

Area size: Large size has larger populations and higher habitat heterogeneity

Distance to mainland: Nearness leads to higher colonization rate

S increases Habitat connectivity: Low connectivity means lower colonization rate

Speciation-extinction dynamics: Related to time and population size or area


## Lecture Seven - Foraging Theory

What is Optimal Foraging Theory, O P T?

It is a behavioral ecology model that helps predict how an animal behaves when searching for food

Aim of the Optimal Foraging Theory


## To predict the foraging strategy of a forager or predator to be expected under specified condition

Important terminologies

Ideal Free Distribution theory - theory which makes a case of uniform distribution of food for predators such that there is no need for foragers to switch foraging patches.

Functional response - deals with a predator's intake rate in response to variation in prey distribution and densities

· Aggregate response - explains how predators are distributed in response to prey availability

· Total response equals Functional response plus Aggregate response


## Assumptions inherent in Optimal Foraging Theory

One. The foraging behavior that is exhibited by present-day animals is the one that has been favored by natural selection in the past but almost enhances an animal's fitness at present

Two. High fitness is achieved by a high net rate of energy intake (gross energy intake minus the energetic costs of obtaining that energy)

Three. Experimental animals are observed in an environment to which their foraging behavior is suited


## Scenarios which unjustify the O.F.T.

One. Other aspects of the organism's behavior may influence fitness more than optimal foraging does. For example, premium on avoidance of predators coercing animals to forage at places and at times associated with lower predation risk, trading off efficiency in food gathering.

Two. Variation in the efficiencies of energy gathering process exploiting different dietary constituents (for example, nitrogen) by many consumers (herbivores and omnivores) creating the need for consumers to forage on a mixed and balanced diet.


## Theoreticians and Mathematicians

O. F. T. makes predictions about foraging behavior based on mathematical models


## Important Question

Is it necessary for a real forager to be equally omniscient and mathematical, if it is to adopt the appropriate, optimal strategy?

Theoreticians are omniscient mathematicians - the foragers need not be

The answer is NO, because

Theory says that if a forager that in some way manages to do the right thing in the right circumstances, then this forager

One. Will be favored by natural selection

Two. Possible inheritance of newly acquired abilities by future generations

Three. Abilities spread, in evolutionary time, throughout the population


## Parameterizing the O.F.T. One

Foraging entails predators expending time and energy in obtaining food

Intake rates of a predator is dependent on the searching (encounter rate) and handling (pursuing, subduing and consuming) times of prey

Generalists pursue (and may then subdue and consume) a large proportion of the prey types they encounter

Specialists continue searching except when they encounter prey of their specifically preferred type


## Parameterizing the O.F.T. Two

Specialists will only pursue profitable prey items, but may expend a great deal of time and energy searching for them

Generalists will spend relatively little time searching but they will pursue both more or less profitable types of prey

An optimal forager should therefore balance the pros and cons so as to maximize its overall rate of energy intake


## Parameterizing the O.F.T. Three

Given that a predator already includes a certain number of profitable items in its diet, should it expand its diet (and thereby decrease its search time) by including the next most profitable item as well?

The next most profitable prey item for an optimal forager

Ei hi

Profitability equals where Ei is the energy content of the next most profitable ith prey item and hi its handling time

In addition, E over h is the average profitability of the 'present' diet (one that includes all prey types that are more profitable than i, but does not include prey type i itself), and

S is the average search time for the present diet


## Parameterizing the O.F.T. Four

If a predator does pursue a prey item of type i, then its expected rate of energy intake is Ei over hi

If it ignores this prey item, whilst pursuing all those that are more profitable, then it can expect to search further. The total expected rate of energy intake

E (s plus h)

where E is the average energy content, s is the average search time and h is the average handling time for the present diet


## Parameterizing the O.F.T. Four

The most profitable, optimal strategy for a predator will be to pursue the ith item if, and only if

Ei over hi is greater than Ē over (s plus h)


## The optimal diet model leads to a number of predictions

One. Predators with shorter handling times than search times should be generalists, because the short times taken to handle prey items already found would allow them to commence searching for another prey.

Two. Predators with longer handling times than search times should be specialists because once a prey has been seen and began to be handled (include pursuit), the predator cannot go in for another food. Therefore, such predators should go in for the most profitable prey.


## Parameterizing the O.F.T. Five

Three. Predators should have broader diets in unproductive environments (where prey items are relatively rare and s is relatively large) than in a productive environment (where s is smaller)

Four. Predators should ignore insufficiently profitable food types irrespective of their abundance

Five. Provides a context for understanding the narrow specialization of predators that live in intimate association with their prey. Since their whole lifestyle and life cycle are finely tuned to those of their prey, handling time is low.

Two studies of optimal diet choice that show a clear but limited correspondence with the predictions of the optimal diet model. Diets are more specialized at high prey densities; but more low profitability items are included than predicted by the theory
