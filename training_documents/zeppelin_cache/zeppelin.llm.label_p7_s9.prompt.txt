You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

bf9k | What the cock rock indictment significantly overlooks is that many women were Zeppelin fans, found the male musicians attractive, and responded to the sexual overtones of the songs as much as any boy or man buying the records or attending the concerts. Though Led Zeppelin had never been a teenybopper act of winsome youngsters like their contempo- raries the Osmonds or the Bay City Rollers, teenyboppers had older sisters and in time grew up themselves, and chaste fantasies of doe-eyed Donny or Woody evolved into more explicit ones of sweaty Robert or mysterious

ibgs | Jimmy. Cock rock worked both ways: the performers expressed it (Mick Jagger rode an inflatable oversize phallus during the Rolling Stones' 1975 US tour), and both sexes in the audience encouraged it. Though there were probably many women put off by Led Zeppelin's overt machismo and crushing rhythms, preferring the sensitive tones of a James Taylor or a Van Morrison, or instead identifying with the lyrics of a Joni Mitchell or a Carole King, there were still plenty happy to find in Zeppelin a larger-than-life eroticism the musicians could not help but convey. For a term intended as a rebuke, Zeppelin's "cock rock" was sometimes exactly what listeners wanted to see and hear.
colo | Airwaves to Heaven: Led Zeppelin as AOR Band
d6r4 | The band was one, but not intentionally. The group's debut in 1968 was in part planned around the rise of "free-form" FM radio in North America, stations that broadcast music far removed from the sanctioned two-minute ditties of their AM rivals. In the 1960s the coolest FM outlets might play extended sides of jazzer Sun Ra, avant-gardist Captain Beefheart, or sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar; or choose from among the best new tracks by Iron Butterfly, the Band, or Jimi Hendrix; it was these stations that the young baby boomers turned to when seeking out the most progressive sounds. FM came through in stereo, as well, adding a new dimension to the already expanding home sound systems proliferating in the basements, dorm rooms, and campus pubs of the era. At the time of Led Zeppelin's appear- ance such stations were considered "underground," but into the next decade the format was popular enough to be reconfigured into "Album-Oriented Radio" or "Album-Oriented Rock." "FM radio was just beginning to have a huge influence," John Paul Jones acknowledged of Zeppelin's initial marketing mediums. "They weren't afraid to play longer tracks or even whole albums. We went around to a lot of radio stations to plug the record." Publicist Danny Goldberg added that "rock stations like WCBN in Boston, KMET in LA, and KSAN in San Francisco really made Zeppelin very big, very fast."
9mrz | AOR was both the expression and the basis of a music industry whose prime product had become the long-playing 33 -rpm record. Audiences were now affluent enough to afford the discs in large numbers, competing with (though not completely eliminating) the market for 45-rpm singles. Both rock artists and rock audiences came to revere the album format as a more personal or serious art, less constricted by the time and content regulations of AM, and the most important rock albums were compared
pk06 | Led Zeppelin FAQ
7wn9 | 340
wcd0 | to the most important novels, plays, or films of older generations. To Peter Grant and Led Zeppelin, AOR was the perfect complement to their strat- egy of album-only releases, where the quartet's AM-friendliest singles ("Communication Breakdown" or "Immigrant Song") were no more helpful to the bottom line than the longer album cuts featured on FM ("Dazed and Confused," "Stairway to Heaven," or "Kashmir").
caos | But from the middle of the 1970s onward, AOR became synonymous with a smug and cynical business culture that was a natural product of rock's billion-dollar revenues. Staple AOR acts such as Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles were derided as spoiled prima donnas disconnected from the day-to-day lives of their middle-class fans, and fresh AOR additions like Boston, Styx, Journey, Kansas, and Supertramp seemed to have been specifically crafted for the highbrow pretensions of listeners raised on Abbey Road, Dark Side of the Moon, or Tommy. Drug-based corruption was endemic between record labels and disc jockeys, with cocaine replacing payola as the standard currency of greased palms; AOR playlists shrank to almost exclusively white rosters, the occasional exception being a song from Jimi Hendrix or Stevie Wonder (some called it Apartheid-Oriented Radio). "Through AOR," noted 1995's Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, "FM radio became almost as, and some would argue substantially more, conservative than the AM radio of the Sixties to which FM had been an alternative. .. . AOR music, which is now termed 'classic rock,' is played all the time because it's popular; it remains popular because it's played all the time."
qrvy | As anyone who has listened to a local classic rock radio station for an hour or so will confirm, Led Zeppelin was an early pillar of AOR airplay and has been ever since. This was a good thing for the band while they were making records, but since their demise the prevalence of the fistful of Zeppelin cuts in heavy rotation on FM radio-"Whole Lotta Love," "Ramble On," "Black Dog," "Over the Hills and Far Away," and, notoriously, "Stairway to Heaven"-has misrepresented their overall canon and gotten them lumped them in with a range of other acts and tracks whose familiarity has muted their original appeal. Today the inescapable AOR classic "Stairway to Heaven" is reviled as much as it's revered, in company with the Who's "Won't Get Fooled Again," the Rolling Stones' "Jumpin' Jack Flash," AC/DC's "Back in Black," plus Boston, Styx, Kansas, Journey, Supertramp, Fleetwood Mac, and the Eagles. On their own, all of these are fine works and fine musicians whose continued fame is justified, but repeated ad infinitum on AOR they have suffered grievous overexposure. What began as a trade term subse- quently became a derogatory epithet, and Led Zeppelin and other artists have been tarred by association.

1pmc | A Minute Seems like a Lifetime: How "Classic Rock" Radio Represents Led Zeppelin
5z6q | Since the early 1980s Album-Oriented Radio has been transformed into classic rock, a programming format devoted to the rock music of roughly 1966 to 1980-AOR frozen in time. Just as it was in the 1970s, Led Zeppelin has been prominent on classic rock stations, and the broadcasters have played a large part in the band's continued popularity with generations too young to remember them from their heyday. Whereas many of Zeppelin's onetime peers on the charts and tour circuits have been relegated to the oldies, "soft favorites," or "where are they now" categories (say, Three Dog Night, Paul Simon, Stealers Wheel, or Van Morrison), Zeppelin are thriving on classic rock stations, where the children and perhaps even grandchildren of their original fans can still catch their hits at all hours of the day. Because of classic rock radio, Led Zeppelin's posthumous releases, such as the box sets of 1990 and 1993, the BBC Sessions of 1997, and the Mothership collection of 2007, have all found ready markets. By maintaining Zeppelin's favored status on its airwaves (and offering syndicated shows like Get the Led Out and other Zep-focused program blocks), classic rock has been the group's best marketing vehicle for some thirty years.
yeoh | Like the earlier AOR, however, classic rock broadcasting has tended to adhere to rigidly controlled selections of songs and an entrenched mythol- ogy that has had the unfortunate effect of making the music less and less interesting. Even Led Zeppelin's boosters admit that the band's place in the classic rock system has harmed the group as much as it has helped them: in his liner notes to the 1990 Zeppelin four-CD box set, critic Robert Palmer wrote, "The preponderance of 'Led Clones' on American FM radio, and continuing frequent airplay for the original recordings, have kept the band's legacy alive. They have also done our memories of the band a great disservice by carrying on as if 'Stairway to Heaven' and a few crunching, blues-based riff tunes .. . represented the entire scope of the Led Zeppelin heritage." As the years go on, defenders of Zeppelin have had to distinguish the true richness of classic rock, the genre, from its caricature in classic rock, the sales pitch.
b8hf | Ironically, the initial attraction of classic rock was that most of its tunes had rarely been heard on the conventional AM stations and might thus be thought of as heavier or cooler than the happy pop hits of the 1970s or 1980s. Likewise, the advent of music video in the 1980s came as a garish contrast to the substance of rock 'n' roll's greatest decades of creativity and artistic freedom, as noted by Brad Tolinski in Guitar World in 1993: "Thanks to constant exposure on MTV, today's pop heroes somehow seem smaller,
hntf | 1

y5r7 | more disposable than their predecessors. But pre-MTV bands like Queen, the original Kiss, and Led Zep have retained a powerful mystique. Unlike today's overexposed supergroups, those Classic bands were rarely captured on film, and when they were, they left distant, grainy images which have themselves taken on an almost mythic power." But by 2010 even the best- loved tracks by Queen, the original Kiss, and Led Zep had been almost exhausted by continuous airplay on classic rock radio, especially under an enforced regimen that has shrunk their catalogues (and those of other classic rock stalwarts like Pink Floyd, Lynryd Skynyrd, and Steve Miller) to but a fraction of their depth.
lrry | Disc jockey Jon Shap of WKOT in Illinois, a Zeppelin lover who asserts that "Led Zeppelin will always have a place on classic rock radio," nonethe- less harbors reservations over they way the band are covered on his own and other stations. "Without a doubt, 'Stairway' and 'Whole Lotta Love' are on their own overplay level. . . . Air Talent (DJs) really have no freedom [as to] what goes on the air. Everything is picked ahead of time by the program- ming department and then scheduled by a computer. Some programmers base their playlists on research done with target listeners, or test songs on how quickly listeners recognize them. Other programmers are told what to play by consultants, and check with their consultants for everything! It's nuts!" One on-air personality confesses anonymously that he breaks ranks by playing the Led Zeppelin drum solo "Moby Dick" every year on the anniversary of John Bonham's death. Many classic rock outlets now cater to a middle-aged male audience, with DJs telling dirty jokes and cueing up advertisements for power tools and military recruiters between spinning forty-year-old anthems of personal and social liberation. If you want to hear a Led Zeppelin song on the radio, tune to classic rock -- if you want to really hear Led Zeppelin, turn to your own collection.
hvhm | Takin' Home My Hard-Earned Pay: Led Zeppelin as Corporate Rock
863b | Like pornography, corporate rock is something hard to define-but you know it when you hear it. The phrase cropped up orally and in print around the time of the punk rebellion of 1976-79, although by the late '60s some acts, including Led Zeppelin, had their countercultural bona fides ques- tioned by the most politically vociferous segments of the youth movement. The disco craze of the late 1970s, driven by anonymous dancers, DJs, and club hits like Sister Sledge's "We Are Family" and the Commodores' "Brick House," likewise made four- or five-man collections of millionaire hippies look much less populist than they thought themselves to be.
fj24 | But in the Long Run
uz3c | Corporate rock refers to the music made by artists so commercial, so con- spicuously rich, or with such confident label promotion, that its spontaneity, humanity, and air of social menace have been all but suppressed. Some critics have written off nearly every pre-punk pop record of the decade as corporate rock, as the New York Times's Howard Hampton did in 2001:
d5bi | Something happened to rock music in the 1970s that it has never quite recovered from: the sound congealed into a dense, ponderous and soporific mass. . . . Where playfulness, humor, chaotic weirdness and wayward passion had reigned supreme, now even excess and outrage came to seem stage-managed by an invisible bureaucracy of FM station consultants, management firms, technocrat produc- ers, and record company apparatchiks. . .. FM rock's infamous disco-bashing campaign was an understandably panicked, phobic reaction, given how insular rock culture had become by that point.
ba4l | The first of corporate rock's prime suspects might include the flam- boyant Elton John, the gaudy Queen, the faceless Doobie Brothers, the imitative Blue Oyster Cult, or the arena demagogue Ted Nugent. Others might cite the proliferation of extravagant artist-owned record companies (the Beatles' Apple, the Rolling Stones' Rolling Stones, and Zeppelin's Swan Song) or the prominence of oversold live albums like Peter Frampton's Frampton Comes Alive, Kiss's Alive! and Cheap Trick's At Budokan as crucial indicators of corporate rock's arrival.
ffx8 | Along with their manager Peter Grant, the men of Led Zeppelin earned a lot of money for themselves (so much that they could only keep it by going into tax exile); they were treated like royalty by industry personnel; and their records and promo paraphernalia turned a neat profit for their financial backers, so by that definition the band was certainly corporate rock. Of course, no performers would ever identify themselves as such, and the term corporate rock is purely a derogatory one that can be thrown at anybody deemed too popular or successful for the thrower's liking. Such an epithet also disregards the very real struggle and hard work that a group like Led Zeppelin underwent before getting to their vast stadium shows and decadent private jets of later in their career. A more judicious application of the label would be to the ready-made superstars whose airplay and rev- enue piled up a little too fast and more easily than their music warranted: Toto, REO Speedwagon, Night Ranger, Foreigner, Meat Loaf. The whiff of corporate rock was also strong off of works heavily produced, cowritten, or otherwise doctored by employees or supervisors of the named artist: Bryan Adams, Bon Jovi, Carly Simon, latter-day Aerosmith, and the antiseptic Starship, whose '80s hit "We Built This City" must surely be liable in some
