We will discuss each of these features in detail and we propose a term for such species (neonative) below.\nk16v | Applying the above-mentioned criteria in practice will often be difficult because of a lack of data. Therefore, using expert knowledge and developing practical guidelines and thresholds will be essential for ensuring the usefulness and robustness of assessments of range-expanding taxa. We provide some recommendations on thresholds as a basis for future discussions to reach a widely accepted consensus.\nb2lm | We propose that the historic native reference range of a taxon should be the documented or likely historic range that the taxon has occupied or colonized by natural means before humans began playing a dominant role in landscape or climate modifications. This may include parts of the species' range that have been lost historically, which implies that recolonization into historically lost regions after the causes of decline have been eliminated disqualifies a species from being classified as range-expanding taxon responding to human-induced environmental change.\nti7f | There are arguments both in support of using a temporal threshold to delineate range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental change or against doing so. We believe that the definition of temporal thresholds warrants further discussion before a consensus on its usefulness can be reached. If a temporal threshold needs to be identified, then restricting the concept of range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental change to those that expanded their range since the onset of the Anthropocene, which was recently suggested to be the year one thousand nine hundred fifty CE, might be a pragmatic temporal reference point. The advantages of using the Anthropocene as a temporal reference are that, in earlier history, the role of human agency on range changes was considerably smaller in most cases, whereas the role of naturally occurring changes in the environment were most dominant, and data on range changes are scarce for many regions and taxonomic groups, which makes the reconstruction of historic range changes difficult or impossible in most cases. For those species and regions for which human-induced range expansion that occurred before one thousand nine hundred fifty CE are well documented, we propose that this reference date may be relaxed, but this should be made explicit. Nevertheless, there are also important arguments for not introducing a temporal threshold; these include that range expansion tracking human-induced environmental change already occurred millennia ago. For example, deforestation in the medieval period in Europe was a strong driver of transformation of the landscapes with vast implications for dispersal opportunities for many heliophilous species, and it is difficult to justify why some events with extreme impacts like this should be included within the concept, whereas others should not. Moreover, identifying the onset of range expansion is often difficult. From this perspective, the most objective approach would be to consider the beginning of Neolithic as a threshold, in the same way as it is applied to the definition of the beginning of biological invasions. We highlight these different perspectives as a topic that will require further discussion within the conservation community but note that in practice most land or marine managers and conservationists will be concerned with addressing contemporary rather than historical range expansion.\no22k | Natural range expansion may occur over vastly different distances and may be driven by different processes, ranging from small-scale fluctuations of metapopulations at range margins to natural long-distance dispersal events. In practice, to qualify a taxon as range expanding, we propose that range expansion should have happened over substantial distances beyond the historic native reference range. What constitutes a substantial distance in this context is difficult to define in absolute terms for a range of taxa and for different regional contexts, and the mobility of the focal species will play a significant role as well. We believe that agreeing on thresholds of the minimum distances a species has to cross to qualify as range expanding warrants further discussion. However, to initiate discussion, we propose that such minimum distances should exclude marginal range expansion, because, for short distances, it is often difficult to disentangle population fluctuations at the range limits from range expansion. For instance, we propose that for latitudinal range expansion (within the same elevational belt) minimum distances should typically be of the order of at least one hundred kilometers, so way beyond landscape-scale migrations and minor range adjustments. For altitudinal range expansion in mountainous regions, shorter distances of the order of a few hundred meters in elevation will be more appropriate.\nnwfz | To assess the population status of occurrences outside the historic native range requires the assessment of whether\nmror | populations are permanent or ephemeral. We propose that the same criteria as for successful naturalizations of alien species should be considered for identifying permanent populations outside the historic reference range-that is, they have to be self-sustaining, persistent, and able to reproduce. Temporary occurrences and casual observations beyond the historic reference range should only qualify as neonative when there is evidence that they lead to the establishment of founding populations at the range front of range-expanding species tracking anthropogenic environmental change. Consequently, in the absence of such evidence, short-lived populations at the limit of the suitable environmental space, isolated long-distance dispersing individuals and species that expand their range naturally do not qualify as fulfilling this criterion. We believe this is useful, because such ephemeral occurrences of individuals or small short-lived populations do not necessarily indicate range expansion. For example, there are frequent records of individuals of many mobile species such as birds and moths found as vagrants far away from their native range.\n```",
