One was his constant unrealistic optimism concerning the balance of forces prior to the breakout of war, and disregard of his Asian enemies. In nineteen thirty-nine, he doubted if \"an enemy could concentrate superior forces at any vital Philippine area\" and estimated that a Japanese blockade would be \"practically unfeasible without the tacit agreement of the other nations surrounding the Pacific.\" On the eve of the attack on Pearl Harbor, he was certain that war would not start before spring. When it started, he defined the Japanese blockade on the Philippines as a \"paper blockade.\" When the Korean War started, he was contemptuous of the fighting capabilities of the KPA, and despite their initial military achievements did not change his mind, believing that if he could put the First Cav Division into Korea, \"those fellows scuddle up to the Manchurian border so quick, you would see no more of them.\"\na5u1 | The same pattern, considered by Halberstam as his worst professional sin, dominated his strategic thinking in November nineteen fifty. Despite the reports by this stage that massive Chinese forces had deployed in Korea, and even though the CPVF soldiers proved their military effectiveness in the First Campaign, MacArthur avoided taking this factor into account when ordering the Eighth Army and the Tenth Corps to rush to the Yalu. When assessing the four options that were available to China, he ruled out the option of full intervention because of fundamental Chinese military weaknesses. Ridgway believed that \"with the\nry7u | prize within his grasp, holding tight to his conviction that Red China was a paper tiger, MacArthur had simply closed his ears to all counsel save his own.\"\n5mda | MacArthur's excessive optimism was influenced by prejudice, mirror imaging, and a belief in American air superiority as a panacea. As Halberstam emphasized, MacArthur was familiar with the traditional Chinese army of the pre-World War Two era but showed no interest in the new army that Mao had built over the intervening years. Since he was certain that he knew \"the mind of the Oriental,\" he refused to absorb that the PLA commanders and soldiers were very different from the ineffective militaries of the East that he had previously known. The PLA learned to meet its technological inferiority by primitive yet effective means, such as night movement by foot, emphasis on camouflage, and minimal use of wireless traffic. MacArthur knew nothing about it and, accordingly, he estimated that the Communist forces were \"grossly overrated.\"\ni4li | MacArthur's disregard of the Chinese enemy, and his inner circle's support for that attitude, explains his decision to advance northward despite the CPVF threat. But it does not suffice to explain the pressure he exerted on his subordinates, primarily Walker, to reach the Yalu as fast as possible. Here, MacArthur's record shows that exerting this kind of pressure was a pattern of his military leadership style. It was vividly seen in the Papuan Campaign, his first as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific area:\nr8sm | He sent order from his headquarters in Brisbane and later Port Moresby, to officers on the fighting front, often bypassing the chain of command. His dissatisfaction with the speed of the advance resulted in pressure on the Australian senior commanders, who on more than one occasion replaced lower ranked generals and brigadiers in order to satisfy the need for a quick success.\ncuin | American generals were also dismissed, and replaced by men who were more willing or able to achieve a quick finish to the fighting. MacArthur attempted to gain victory in Papua before his rivals, the Navy, could beat the Japanese in Guadalcanal in the Solomon Group.\nn1i7 | The fighting in Papua had created disproportionate losses in dead and injured and the reason lay in MacArthur private problems. He had suffered ignominy after his Philippines loss, had marred the proud legacy of his father, had abandoned his men, had enemies in the American government and armed forces, and needed to prove that he was still worthy of commanding an army.\n0r5m | During the Korean War, this pattern repeated itself twice. First, it manifested in MacArthur's urge to occupy Seoul by September twenty-five, precisely three months after the North Korean invasion had started. Practically, the pressure to meet this date was exerted by Almond, who like MacArthur in the Papuan campaign, intervened directly in the fighting, bypassing General Smith, the commander of the First Marines Division that was occupying the city. From Smith's perspective, \"Almond was risking his Marines unnecessarily for a couple of extra lines in the newspapers back home because that was what his commander wanted.\" Smith himself, Walker and the Joint Chiefs of Staff estimated that a wiser strategy was for the Tenth Corps to cut off Seoul and advance eastward to meet the Eighth Army, thus capturing the remains of the KPA.\nne2o | The second case of unnecessary pressure was prior to the \"home-by-Christmas offensive.\" Its main target was Walker. One of the clearest indications for the effect it had on him was his October twenty-six letter to MacArthur, which explained why, in light of the CPVF counterattack, he had to stop his advance to the Yalu. Knowing MacArthur's reputation for replacing officers whom he deemed insufficient achievers, the letter explained the halt in an apologetic tone and assured MacArthur that the attack would continue: \"There has never been and there is now no intention for this Army to take up or remain on a passive perimeter or any other type of defense. Every effort is being made to retain an adequate bridgehead to facilitate the resumption of the attack as soon as conditions permit.\"\nsqxn | By fall nineteen fifty, MacArthur reached a status that no one-not even the US president or the JCS-could oppose. Recall that MacArthur was only fired after the military defeat that had made him far weaker politically. Combined with his political ambition and his mistaken estimation of the magnitude of the Chinese threat, the combination of his character and status accounts for much of the explanation for the catastrophic outcome of the \"home by Christmas offensive.\"\n6pmo | Willoughby is the person most identified with the intelligence fiasco of November nineteen fifty and, as Haynes argued, \"The most important person to influence intelligence assessments\" in the FEC and in Washington. Indeed, no matter what MacArthur's role was, every war plan is based on intelligence, and the US war plan to reach the Yalu was no exception. In this case, the operational plan was completely faulty because it was based on a completely mistaken intelligence picture. Willoughby was the man who personally prepared and provided it, and it was mistaken not because of lack of relevant information. The opposite is true:\n195r | By the end of the first week of November nineteen fifty, the FEC G-Two had enough data to identify the Chinese order of battle in North Korea and should have been able to determine that the Chinese Communists had fully committed to entering the Korean War. Rhetoric from the communist leadership in Beijing mirrored the political indoctrination and guidance given to the lowest ranking Chinese soldiers captured by the United Nations forces. One common theme stands clear: the bulk of the Chinese Communist Army deployed in Manchuria since July, nineteen fifty, had entered Korea in order to defeat the Americans before they could reach the Manchurian border.\nkqmi | Despite his personal responsibility for one of the worst intelligence failures in American military history, Willoughby's personality and the role he played in facilitating the fiasco have not received the attention they deserved until recently. Even now, only sketchy details about him are available, and although they provide some insight into relevant key elements of his personality, they do not suffice to give us a full explanation.\n```",
