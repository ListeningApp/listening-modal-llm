You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

uz9y | "As we learned more, the meaning of the question continued to evolve. We asked our- selves, "How can we go out and plant this seed? How do we frame it as we bring other people into the conversation?" The question always worked in stimulating the dialogue. Sometimes as leaders it's important not to col- lectively work on what the answer is but to work on what the question is. That was a big insight for me as we did this work. The ques- tion never failed us."
8ov0 | Improving Questions at Pfizer. In another recent case, professionals at Pfizer, the world- renowned pharmaceutical firm, are experimenting with a systematic method of improving the quality of their questions. Through a custom-designed workshop, marketing and finance professionals in Pfizer's European business unit have been learning to articulate powerful questions. These executives have discovered that meetings have more energy and creative ideas flow more quickly when they place attention on for- mulating catalytic questions. With this discipline in place, new ideas are more easily finding their way into key products and services.
mj9m | From these examples, it's clear that improving the quality of the questions you ask and creating a frame- work of engagement that encourages their explo- ration can create business value. Because learning to engage thoughtful questions can lead to insight, inno- vation, and action, doing so will become an essential strategic capability for leaders of organizations who want to create sus- tainable results in the face of both short- and longer-term challenges and opportunities.
94h3 | Fostering Strategic Inquiry
9jx1 | Beyond building the capacity of individ- ual employees to ask powerful ques- tions, an organization can design processes that use such queries to enhance the emergence of knowledge creation and strategic thinking. As the chairman and CEO of a major multina- tional corporation says, "Discovering strategic questions is like panning for gold. You have to care about finding it, you have to be curious, and you have to create an anticipation of discovering gold, even though none of us may know ahead of time where we'll find it. You head toward the general territory where you think the gold may be located, with your best tools, your experience, and your instincts. And then you begin a disciplined search for the gold."We've partnered with this leader to create a set of tools for fostering strategic inquiry and working with powerful questions in the service of positive futures called the "Game Plan" process. The following steps may not apply to all situations and they may not always play out in the same sequence. However, the Game Plan sug- gests ways that organizations can create both formal and informal processes to support individuals as well as teams in discovering the "gold" for themselves.
c3lz | The Game Plan Process
8bwk | The steps in the Game Plan can be used both as a process discipline by individuals looking at a particular situation, as well as by functional and cross-functional groups and leadership teams charged with the responsibility for key decisions regarding future courses of action. The Game Plan can also involve diverse stakeholders to provide important perspec- tives both on the current situation and on possible future actions.
ez9s | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
mqot | Assess Your Current Situation. Get a feel for the larger context in which you are operating. Scan the internal and external business and organizational envi- ronments that may affect the future of the system or project you are working with. This situation analysis might include the assessment of critical results data, meetings with key stakeholders, and the mapping of your strengths, opportunities, and threats. It might also involve looking for "signals"-inter- nal and external events, develop- ments, and trends that can affect the future of your situation. Like trackers in the mountains, look for both obvi- ous and subtle indicators that point to storms as well as sunny skies. Allow your curiosity and imagination to take the lead as you begin to iden- tify the many questions that the broader landscape within which you're operating reveals.
oc99 | It will be challenging, but important, to frame your findings as questions rather than as problems or concerns-questions that end with a question mark, not with a period or an exclamation point. To help in designing these queries, ask yourself, "How does A affect C and what questions does that suggest? If X were at play here, what question would we be asking? What's the real question underneath all this data?"
gipz | Discover the "Big Questions." Once you think you've posed most of the relevant questions (and there may be many of them), look for patterns and themes. This is not a mechanical process, even though it should be disciplined and systematic. You are on a treasure hunt, seeking the core questions-usually three to five-that, if answered, would make the most difference to the future of the project or situation you are exploring. Cluster related questions, and consider
b4wj | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
5xlt | the relationships among them. Begin to clarify the "big questions" that the initial clusters reveal. Frame these as clear and concise queries, not as problems. Something fundamental changes when people begin to ask questions together-they go beyond the nor- mal stale debate about problems that passes for strat- egy in many organizations.
9bz4 | Create Images of Possibility. Ask yourself, "What would our situation look like or be like if the 'big questions' were answered?" Creating vivid images of possibility differs from pie-in-the-sky visioning, especially if people with a variety of perspectives have participated in the earlier stages of your analysis. This part of the conversation can also provide clues for refining or reframing your big questions as well as inventing creative strategies. Developing scenarios- stories of the future based on different ways your big questions might be answered-can also be useful. These often reveal new territory and opportunities for action that are grounded in real life.
yfv2 | Evolve Workable Strategies. Workable strategies begin to emerge in response to compelling questions and to the images of possibility that these questions evoke. In a sense, such strategies are the "big answers"-the key initiatives you invent to address your "big ques- tions." Once you clarify key initia- tives, you can formulate and imple- ment specific action plans.
pujl | Of course, the cycle is never complete. You need continuous "sensing" based on relevant business and organizational data, ongoing conversations with internal and external stakeholders, informal conversations among employees, and feedback from the organizational environment. This input enables you to continually reassess the landscape you're operating in-revealing new questions for exploration.
3rqe | The innovative leader with whom we developed the Game Plan process has shared this tool with the entire organization. People from throughout the com- pany have found that it provides a way to discover questions that matter to the future of individual units and to the firm as a whole. The company has also used the Game Plan as part of refining the corporation's
