In the decomposition, the second term depends entirely on the number of parameters N that defines the size of the functional approximation space. On the set of two-layer neural networks, it is expected to be proportional to negative one. Finally, given that it corresponds to early stopping in stochastic first-order methods, the third term should scale as the convergence rate of these methods, which is lower-bounded by I and may attain the bound. This convergence rate is expected to be dimension-free and depends only on the loss smoothness; hence we assume that the second term only depends on D in the equation. Empirically, we find after fitting the equation that\njrik | L of N and D equals E plus N raised to the power of zero point three four plus B D raised to the power of zero point two eight.\nxv78 | with E equals one point six nine, A equals four hundred six point four, B equals four hundred ten point seven. We note that the parameter and data coefficients are both lower than two; this is expected for the data-efficiency coefficient but far from the known lower-bound. Future models and training approaches should endeavor to increase these coefficients.\nsdks | Fitting the decomposition to data. We effectively minimize the following problem\ny8fb | a, b, e, min Run Hubers LSE of a minus a log N, b minus b log D, e minus log L, where LSE is the log-sum-exp operator. We then set A, B, E equals exponential of a, exponential of b, exponential of e.\n521q | We use the LBFGS algorithm to find local minima of the objective above, started on a grid of initialization given by: a in the set zero point zero, zero point five and so on to two point zero, in the set zero point zero, zero point five and so on to two point zero, e in the set negative one point zero, negative zero point five and so on to one point zero, a in the set zero, five, and so on to twenty-five, and b in the set zero, five, and so on to twenty-five. We find that the optimal initialization is not on the boundary of our initialization sweep.\nyogo | We use delta equals ten to the negative three for the Huber loss. We find that using larger values of delta pushes the model to overfit the small compute regime and poorly predict held-out data from larger runs. We find that using a delta smaller than ten to the negative three does not impact the resulting predictions.\n2285 | Predicted compute optimal frontier for all three methods.\nys0g | For Approaches two and three, we show the estimated model size and number of training tokens for a variety of compute budgets in Table A3. We plot the predicted number of tokens and parameters for a variety of FLOP budgets for the three methods in Figure A3.\n7zvp | Small-scale comparison to Kaplan et al.\n```",
