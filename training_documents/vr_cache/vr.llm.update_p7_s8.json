        "content": "v3r2 | feedback. One interesting phenomenon related to this that is often observed in VR is termed the \"uncanny valley\". This refers to the way in which humanoid characters in a virtual world can elicit a feeling of unease or revulsion if they look very human-like but are imperfect (e.g., their breathing movements are not realistic), reducing the overall realism of the environment. Interestingly, avatars with more cartoon-like features might overcome this problem as they are easily accepted and do not seem to elicit the same sense of unease as more real-like humanoids. Clearly, the design of reliable and immersive VR experiences is complex. This, combined with the computing power and hardware required to build and run VR experiences, is a challenge for those in the field.\nnv42 | Ethical issues\nxags | A number of reviews and commentaries have been written about the ethical landscape of digital mental health. Common themes across this literature include privacy, confidentiality, transparency, security, and ownership of data. These issues are also relevant to VR, especially when the application involves the collection of personal information and is accessed via the Internet. VR brings about more specific ethical challenges, however. More conceptually, the blurring of realities may have undue consequences on how we relate to and understand the world, perhaps especially so for conditions such as psychosis where reality distortion is already a challenge. As discussed previously, research has demonstrated that experiences in VR can have the same impact as if they occurred in the real world, necessitating considerable caution when conducting VR experiments designed to manipulate behavior. Some have commented on the dangers of enabling continual access to alternate realities, potentially perpetuating escape from the discomfort of the real world. The side effects of VR-namely, eye strain, cybersickness, and reality distortion-are also important considerations, and limited research exists on their long-term effects. In considering these factors, Madary and Metzinger, and Rizzo and Schulheis, provide recommendations for the ethical use of VR within research, drawing on general principles underpinning respect for rights and protection from harm.\njc47 | Conclusion\nko3c | Sufficient evidence has accumulated to support the benefits of VR for a variety of assessment purposes in mental health. VR elicits similar psychological and physiological reactions\nxek3 | Original article VR in mental health research and practice - Bell et al\nbbpr | to real-world environments, extending the reach of current assessments beyond the lab or clinic. Superior capabilities for experimental manipulation and controlled exposure could significantly advance the field of mental health by improving methodological rigor, as well as enabling more accurate and individualized assessment. Automatic data capture of behaviors and signals from VR experiences can reveal important insights that might improve our understanding of mental health conditions and inform more\n5zyf | tailored treatments. Advances in hardware, software, and research evidence has progressed in recent years; however, more studies are clearly needed to establish the reliability and validity of VR-based assessments, and issues with access to these resources and ethics require attention, thought, and research as the field develops.\n9own | Original article VR in mental health research and practice - Bell et al\nbqfb | Original article VR in mental health research and practice - Bell et al",
