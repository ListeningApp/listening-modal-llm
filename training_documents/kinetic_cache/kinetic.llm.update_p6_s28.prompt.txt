You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0x0s | This potential-dependent apparent <LATEX>p K _ { a }</LATEX> of the surface- attached species can also be viewed in terms of a potential- dependent work term due to bringing a proton to the interfacial region. A similar work term is necessary for the ET steps for the same physical reason and to ensure that the overall free energy of the PCET process is independent of path. Therefore, this work term was added to all of the ET and PT steps. Including these work terms for the diagonal steps does not alter the results because they effectively cancel. These work terms are effectively accounting for nonideal behavior at the interface.50,51 The impact of the potential dependence of
4exe | the apparent <LATEX>p K _ { c }</LATEX> values on the pH dependence of the apparent potential is negligible (Figure S9) and is not expected to be experimentally observable for this system.
0myz | Within the MG theory, the potential-dependent apparent rate constant can be expressed as
xh3i | <LATEX>k ^ { \mathrm { M G , R e d } } \left( E \right) = k _ { \max } \cdot \frac { 1 } { 2 } \left[ 1 - \mathrm { e r f } \left( \frac { F \left( E - E ^ { 0 } \right) + \lambda } { 2 \sqrt { \lambda R T } } \right) \right]</LATEX> (14)
syiw | where <LATEX>^</LATEX> is the reorganization energy. The apparent reorganization energy can be defined as the driving force corresponding to the potential at which this rate constant reaches half its maximum value (i.e., <LATEX>k ^ { \mathrm { M G } , \mathrm { R e d } } \left( E \right) / k _ { \max } = 1 / 2</LATEX> when <LATEX>F \left( E ^ { 0 } - E \right) = \lambda .</LATEX> Using the rate constant expression of the MG theory, Equation 9a becomes
kg3t | <LATEX>k _ { \mathrm { a p p } } ^ { \mathrm { M G } , \mathrm { R e d } } \left( E , \mathrm { p H } \right) = \sum _ { i } k _ { \max , i } \cdot</LATEX> <LATEX>\frac { 1 } { 2 } \left[ 1 - \mathrm { e r f } \left( \frac { F \left( E - E _ { i } ^ { 0 } \right) + \lambda _ { i } } { 2 \sqrt { A _ { i } R T } } \right) \right] .</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathcal{X} _ { \mathrm { O x } _ { i } } \left( \mathrm { p H } ; \mathrm { p K } _ { \mathrm { a } , \mathrm { O x } } \left( E \right) \right)</LATEX> (15)
lvae | We estimated the total reorganization energies for ET and EPT to be 0.37 <LATEX>a n d \quad 1 . 0 1</LATEX> eV, respectively, based on our previous calculations."" this previous work, the outer-sphere (solvent) reorganization energy was computed using a dielectric continuum model with a cylindrical cavity containing a point charge representing the molecular catalyst, as well as the bridge attaching it to the electrode surface (Figure S10). The resulting outer-sphere reorganization energy was computed to be 0.21 eV and was assumed to be the same for ET and EPT. In this previous work, the inner-sphere (solute) reorganization energies were computed using the four-

For ET, the axial ligand is <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O</LATEX> in the oxidized and reduced states, whereas for EPT, the axial ligand <LATEX>i s \quad O H \quad i n \quad t h e</LATEX> oxidized state and H2O in the reduced state. The inner-sphere reorganization energies were computed to be 0.16 and 0.54 eV for ET and EPT, respectively. The substantial difference arises from the larger change in the distance between Ru and the oxygen of the axial ligand for EPT than for ET (0.19 Å for EPT versus 0.06 Å for ET). The total reorganization energy, which is the sum of the inner- and outer-sphere components, computed for ET is in agreement with experimental measurements at low <LATEX>\mathrm { p H } ,</LATEX> where only the ET channel is accessible.19 The total reorganization energy for EPT is an effective value where the contributions of excited proton vibrational states are also included. A model using <LATEX>\lambda _ { \mathrm { E P T } }</LATEX> without considering the excited proton vibrational states is provided in the SI (Figure S7).
zh03 | Using the parameter values provided and explained in Table S2, we are able to model the pH and potential dependence of the apparent PCET rate constant, as shown in Figure 5. Figure Sa shows qualitatively reasonable agreement with the experimental data in this potential and pH range using eq 15. The weak <LATEX>p H</LATEX> dependence of <LATEX>k _ { \max , \mathrm { a p } }</LATEX> is correctly described, and the curves for <LATEX>p H = 3</LATEX> and 5 are shifted toward lower potentials compared to the curve for <LATEX>\mathrm { p H } = 1 ,</LATEX> indicating larger apparent reorganization energies for <LATEX>p H = 3</LATEX> and 5. Note that this apparent reorganization energy reflects the summation over channels in eq 15 and thus is not as easily interpreted as in eq 14, as discussed further below. One source of the quantitative deviations could be the use of the error function expression in eq 15. In this expression, we assume that the

The y-error bars represent one standard deviation from the average of three separate electrode measurements, while the x-error bars represent one standard deviation from the average pH recorded for the electrolyte solution both before and after the experiment for each of the three trials. The red curve was generated with the kinetic model using the parameters given in Table S3.
