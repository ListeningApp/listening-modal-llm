Connell's Tidal Barnacles: Balanus balanoides and Chthamalus stellatus.\nrcl1 | Adult Chthamalus usually occur above Balanus.\n9qpf | Chthamalus larvae do settle in Balanus Lower Tide Zone.\ny5cx | Adult Balanus never in high tide zones due to desiccation.\nhexk | Methodology - Connell suspected that adult Balanus out competed adult Chthamalus. He kept removing Balanus adult in lower zones in experimental plots in one set as well as removing Chthamalus from upper zone in another.\nc05v | Results.\n1ytq | One. Removing Balanus from lower zones caused Chthamalus to survive.\ntkax | Two. Balanus never settled in upper zone even as Chthamalus was removed there.\n6mpz | Conclusion.\nbi1x | One. Adult barnacles compete over space in lower zones.\nbnve | Two. Balanus is superior, crushing Chthamalus, leaving a small realized niche, upper zone, for Chthamalus.\n7gvc | Three. Fundamental niche of Chthamalus includes dry upper zones where Balanus cannot withstand desiccation.\njf19 | Interspecific competition - Field Experiment Two.\n6hx6 | Brown and Davidson's Granivorous Desert Ants and Rodents in Arizona.\nxcql | Ants and rodents were observed to overlap in seed utilization, and the question was then: Are they competing for a limited resource, seeds?\nxcxb | Experimental Design.\nci51 | One. Ant-Removal Plots were sprayed with pesticides regularly.\njaj7 | Two. Rodent-Removal Plots were fenced and subjected to intensive trapping protocols.\nuc0w | Three. Both ants and rodents removed.\n494y | Four. Control Plots with both ants and rodents present.\n5whs | Results.\nkigc | One. Rodents removed - Ant colonies increase above control plots.\nk5st | Two. Ants removed - Rodents densities increase above control plots.\nd8e8 | Conclusions.\ngb7b | One. As one competitor is removed the remaining increase. Density Compensation occurs - Release of extra resources that is no more utilized by the removed species.\njxu0 | Two. Ants and rodents have overlapping limited food resource niche, seeds, over which they compete.\nl1bb | Interspecific Competition - Field Experiment Three.\ni3e0 | Paine's starfish, Pisaster, in rocky intertidal zones of the United States: Predator-mediated Coexistence.\n78dj | Pisaster, a keystone predator, predates differentially on the dominant competitors, bivalves, and acorn barnacles.\nc1pj | Removal of the predator showed that the more dominant competitors crowded out the inferior species, goose barnacles, limpets, and chitons.\n6v9y | This reduced the total number of coexisting species from fifteen to eight.\ndeen | A classic example of Top-Down control of communities, trophic cascading effects, or predator-mediated coexistence at lower trophic levels.\n27bo | Ecological Release, Habitat - Natural Experiments One.\n72k6 | Jared M. Diamond's Ground Doves on Papua New Guinea and associated islands: Chalcophaps indica, C. stephani, and Gallicolumba rufigula.\nemhp | Mainland, New Guinea: All three Ground doves living sympatrically in distinct habitats, no overlap.\ntcgw | Large island, Bagabag: Only two species - In the absence of Gallicolumba rufigula, Chalcophaps stephani expands its niche to include inland rainforest.\n4d8s | Very small islands, New Britain, Tolokiwa, Karkar, Espiritu Santo: Only one species, Chalcophaps indica, present and it's able to occupy all three types.\n1cmq | Conclusion.\nu8s6 | Fundamental niches of the three doves shown only when in allopatry.\n86m5 | When in sympatry, each species excludes the other two from its specialized habitat, contiguous allopatry.\nlzzv | There is competitive exclusion on New Guinea and competitive release elsewhere.\n623p | Ecological Release, Habitat - Natural Experiments Two.\n50lp | Jared M. Diamond's, nineteen seventy-five, Honeyeaters on three Papua New Guinea mountains.\ni4nn | Fundamental niche: similar - Phylidonyris guisel equals three hundred to three thousand five hundred meters; Phylidonyris peristriata equals two hundred to three thousand eight hundred fifty meters.\nnuk3 | Fundamental niche: overlap.\ny2cn | Eighty-eight percent. Ranged reduced, allopatry to sympatry, from two hundred to three thousand seven hundred to three thousand to three thousand eight hundred fifty meters.\nhgm4 | Twenty-five percent. Realized niche of inferior species, Phylidonyris peristriata, only twenty-five percent of the fundamental niche.\nnc42 | Another example of habitat related, altitudinal equals vertical spatial, ecological release.\ntbfm | Contiguous Allopatry - Natural Experiment Three. H. C. Heller's chipmunks in Sierra Nevada mountains, California.\nok18 | Ecological Release/Niche Shift - Natural Experiment Four.\npgqe | Nils-Arvid Nilsson's Salmonids in Swedish Lakes, Asymmetric Niche Shift.\nqo9m | Assessment of diets, six food types, of two Salmonids.\ne7zz | Great overlap in food utilization in allopatry.\nlhzk | Large crustaceans, C, Insect larvae, D, and terrestrial insects, E, preferred by both species in allopatry.\nwdpw | In sympatry;\ntwiq | Char specializes greatly, sixty percent, on small crustaceans, B, greatly reducing consumption of insect larvae, D, and terrestrial insects, E.\ncchx | Trout largely remains a generalist in sympatry. One. Large crustaceans and molluscs are shared in sympatry.\n2vma | Char's dietary composition greatly changed in sympatry; Trout's not.\nz4aw | Limiting Similarity - Character Displacement One.\nmo0p | Tom Fenchel's Character Displacement in Marine Mud Snails, Denmark.\ntyxr | Measurement of lengths of two species of snails; Hydrobia ulvae and Hydrobia ventrosa.\ntxaa | Shell length correlated with food size.\nqz8s | Allopatry: Snail length almost identical, mode equals three point zero millimeters.\ny7de | Sympatry: Snail length distinctively smaller for Hydrobia ventrosa, mode approximately one point eight millimeters, but bigger for Hydrobia ulvae, mode approximately three point seven millimeters.\nrukn | Tom Fenchel's Character Displacement in Marine Mud Snails, Denmark.\n5tu7 | Food size of the two species in allopatry very similar.\nvqgg | Allopatry: Both species - mode equals approximately sixty micrometers in diameter.\n```",
