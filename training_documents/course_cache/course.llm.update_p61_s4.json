Differential Niche Overlap comprises three major dimensions:\nh8x1 | · Spatial: Horizontal (habitat types) and vertical (altitude, vegetation strata)\n6qtq | · Temporal: Time of day or night, seasonal variation (dry or wet, summer or winter)\nwm3n | · Trophic: Generalist or Specialist dietary trait, foraging techniques or strategies\n1anr | Two. Niche Differentiation, Complementarity and Coexistence often interrelated:\n600w | · Niche dimensionality leads to Niche differentiation leads to Complementarity\n60w7 | · High niche differentiation predisposes Complementarity leads to Coexistence\n1a5g | · High overlap in some niche dimensions tolerated by otherwise low overlaps\n0oof | Summary: Differential Niche Overlap and Complementarity\np930 | Three. Community wide niche partitioning limits similarity and increase coexistence:\nxhc7 | · High overlap in vertical and horizontal space leads to low trophic overlap\n6a60 | · High dietary overlap leads to low, abutting, disjunct and spatial niches\ndfgj | · High dietary and spatial overlap leads to low overlap in temporal niche\n6ptp | Four.

An Account of the theories behind speciation and extinction processes:\n7haq | · What drives speciation in relation to niche overlap and competition?\nubwu | · What drives extinction in relation to niche overlap and competition?\nucme | Ds equals p (one plus Cã), where Du\nqnl5 | · Based on MacArthur's model, communities diversity is shaped in three potentially interacting ways:\nwdx9 | One. Resource base: How big is n in the niche hypervolume. Areas with more available resource have larger Dr and C components (niche space) and can therefore contain more species.\nn1xr | Two. Niche width or degree of specialization of component species (Du) Narrow niches can be packed tighter and thus contain more species.\nohpj | Three. Niche overlap between species. Greater species overlap (smaller exclusive niches) leads to greater diversity even if two communities are similar in both areas.\nry5f | Four. Niche curve shape also counts, in thick-tailed (leptokurtic) curves more species can be packed on the same resource gradient than thin-tailed (platykurtic) curves\n31wg | Niche Partitioning and Species Richness two\ncelk | Forest Succession and Increased Bird Diversity (Species Richness):",
