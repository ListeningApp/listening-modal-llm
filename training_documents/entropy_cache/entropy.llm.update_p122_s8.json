But please be aware that my versions are idiosyncratic and will make some people raise their eyebrows. I'm afraid you'll have to go elsewhere, like Reif's book, to learn these laws in their traditional form!\nb264 | We've been maximizing entropy subject to a constraint on the expected value of one quantity. What if we do two or more? Everything works the same way, but the fundamental relation between temperature, energy and entropy, d(E) equals TDs, gets one extra term for each constraint. The resulting equation is a version of the 'First Law of Thermodynamics'.\njv66 | I'll explain the case with one extra constraint. Suppose we've got a measure space X whose points are states of some system. Choose two functions on it. They could be anything, but let's call them energy and volume and write them as E: X goes to R and V: X goes to R. These terms are favored because thermodynamics arose in part from the study of steam engines, where you've got a cylinder of steam with some energy and some volume. For any probability distribution p: X goes to zero comma zero, we can write down a formula for its Shannon entropy\n5507 | H equals negative the integral of p of x times the natural log of p of x dx\n74me | and also the expected values\nexc2 | (E) equals the integral of E of x dx, (V) equals the integral of V of x dx.\n8y62 | Let's not worry now about whether these integrals converge.\n4fig | Suppose we only know (E) and (V), and we are trying to choose the 'best' probability distribution p with these expected values. What should we do? Following the principle of maximum entropy, we seek the probability distribution p that maximizes H subject to our constraints on (E) and (V). If we do this, we are led to a Lagrange multipliers problem, much as in the simpler case of one constraint. But now we need two Lagrange multipliers: let's call them beta and gamma. We get this equation:\nsksb | dH equals beta d(E) plus gamma d(V).\nop72 | This is the First Law!\nim7i | But this isn't the way physicists usually write it. To get the First Law in its usual form, first let's switch to using Gibbs entropy S equals kH, and emphasize the role of energy by solving for d(E):\nrmuk | d(E) equals TdS minus Pd(V).\nkadj | Then, to simplify the look of this equation, let's introduce variables called temperature and pressure:\n5kvy | T equals k beta inverse, P equals beta.\n8wop | Now the First Law of Thermodynamics looks like this:\nvcpg | d(E) equals TdS minus Pd(V).\nij2y | It says that as we move around among probability distributions that maximize entropy subject to constraints on expected energy and volume, the change in expected energy is the sum of two terms:\nw7j4 | heat, meaning TdS\nq8xw | work, meaning minus Pd(V).\n1m55 | For example, if we have a cylinder of steam with pressure P and we increase its expected volume by a little bit deltaV, its expected energy goes down by about P deltaV: that's how we understand the minus sign. In this situation, the external world has done an amount of work minus P deltaV on the cylinder of steam, but most people say the cylinder of steam has done an amount of work P deltaV on the external world.\n2zaa | Here are a few puzzles if you want to dig deeper. In the first two, I ask you to generalize ideas from our earlier work on maximizing entropy subject to a single constraint.\n4iwf | (E) equals e, (V) equals v,\ngrmv | and also suppose p1 and so on up to pn greater than zero. Show that at p we have\nmrk0 | dH equals beta d(E) plus gamma d(V)\nbash | for some beta, gamma in R. (Hint: first do the case where not all the E_i are equal and not all the V_i are equal. This guarantees that d(E) and d(V) are nonzero. You can handle the other cases separately.)\nxseo | n exp minus beta E_i minus gamma V_i\n3oxf | P_i\ngvhw | sum exp minus beta E_i minus gamma V_i\n4ta1 | THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS\njokf | Suppose a system has some measure space X of states and at any time t there is a probability distribution p of t on X.\nx0bn | We say the second law of thermodynamics holds if t1 is less than or equal to t2 implies S of p of t1 is less than or equal to S of p of t2.\n049a | This seems to be widely true, yet the conditions under which it holds are subtle and much argued.\nebc8 | The Second Law of Thermodynamics, as commonly stated, says that the entropy of a closed system never decreases. This appears to be a profound fact about our universe. A huge challenge to physics is to understand where this law comes from. Can it be derived from some realistic assumptions? One problem is that the laws of classical mechanics are invariant under time-reversal. Thus, if we evolve probability distributions on some space of states according to these laws, for any probability distribution whose entropy is nondecreasing, there is a time-reversed one whose entropy is nonincreasing.\nidjw | This is called the problem of the arrow of time: briefly, why does the future look so different from the past? Quantum mechanics makes the problem subtler but does not provide an easy resolution. The solution may be that we happen to live in a universe a particular solution of the laws of physics where entropy was very low at the Big Bang, making it easy for entropy to increase after that. But if you get ten physicists in a room and ask them to explain the arrow of time, you are likely to hear ten different opinions. Thus, I will not attempt to resolve it here. For more on that, I recommend this book:\n6561 | Instead, let's see how the Second Law sheds light on the meaning of temperature. You'll notice that in our course I never talked about systems evolving in time, and I never talked about two systems interacting: always just a single system. Now let's imagine two systems, each in thermal equilibrium, but at possibly different temperatures. Say the first has entropy S1, expected energy (E1) and temperature T1. As usual, these are related by\n2hrf | dS1 equals d(E1) over T1.\nmpyx | Say the second system works similarly, with\nqlzy | dS2 equals d(E2) over T2.\nsa6v | We can define the total entropy of the two systems by\ngneb | S equals S1 plus S2.\n1oqy | and the total expected energy by\nopno | (E) equals (E1) plus (E2).\n0ahx | Suppose now that the two systems can exchange energy with each other, but in a slow and gentle way, so we can approximately treat each one as in thermal equilibrium at any moment. If no energy flows in or out of the combined system, the total expected energy is conserved, so d(E) over dt equals zero\nx5cc | and thus\nc7cg | d(E1) over dt\nfiyl | What does the Second Law give us in this situation? It implies\nyz7j | dS over dt greater than or equal to zero or\nwsee | S1 plus S2 greater than dS2 over dt\nilgr | over dt dS1\nhrx3 | It follows that\nna9n | one over T1 d(E1) over dt plus one over T2 d(E2) is greater than zero or\n8k3d | T1 over dt one over d(E1)\nagug | T2 over dt one over d(E1) is greater than or equal to zero.\nmkb4 | We can rewrite this as\n06qs | T1 inverse minus T2 inverse.\ncdth | Now suppose both T1 and T2 are positive. Then we get a remarkable consequence: as two systems exchange energy, with each staying in thermal equilibrium at every moment, expected energy can only flow from the system with higher temperature to the system with lower temperature!\ngen4 | THE THIRD LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS: REVISITED\n2wtm | If a system has countably many states, with just one of lowest energy, and thermal equilibrium is possible for this system for some temperature T greater than zero, then its entropy in thermal equilibrium approaches zero exponentially fast as a function of one over T as T approaches zero from above.\n```",
