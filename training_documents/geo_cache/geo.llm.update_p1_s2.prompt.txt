You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

vz32 | Linking geological and infrastructural requirements for large-scale underground hydrogen storage in Germany
ncb0 | Hydrogen storage might be key to the success of the hydrogen economy, and hence the energy transition in Germany. One option for cost-effective storage of large quantities of hydrogen is the geological subsurface. However, previous experience with underground hydrogen storage is restricted to salt caverns, which are limited in size and space. In contrast, pore storage facilities in aquifers -and/or depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs- could play a vital role in meeting base load needs due to their wide availability and large storage capacity, but experiences are limited to past operations with hydrogen-bearing town gas. To overcome this barrier, here we investigate hydrogen storage in porous storage systems in a two-step process: 1) First, we investigate positive and cautionary indicators for safe operations of hydrogen storage in pore storage systems. 2) Second, we estimate hydrogen storage capacities of pore storage systems in (current and decommissioned) underground natural gas storage systems and saline aquifers. Our systematic review highlights that optimal storage conditions in terms of energy content and hydrogen quality are found in sandstone reservoirs in absence of carbonate and iron bearing accessory minerals at a depth of approx. 1,100 m and a temperature of at least 40℃. Porosity and permeability of the reservoir formation should be at least 20% and 5 x 10-13 m2 (~500 mD), respectively. In addition, the pH of the brine should fall below 6 and the salinity should exceed 100 mg/L. Based on these estimates, the total hydrogen storage capacity in underground natural gas storages is estimated to be up to 8 billion cubic meters or (0.72 Mt at STP) corresponding to 29 TWh of energy equivalent of hydrogen. Saline aquifers may offer additional storage capacities of 81.6-691.8 Mt of hydrogen, which amounts to 3.2 to 27.3 PWh of energy equivalent of hydrogen, the majority of which is located in the North German basin. Pore storage systems could therefore become a crucial element of the future German hydrogen infrastructure, especially in regions with large industrial hydrogen (storage) demand and likely hydrogen imports via pipelines and ships.
8mp0 | 1 Introduction
xjyk | Global environmental changes and future energy needs are among the most fundamental challenges facing humanity in the near future. Green hydrogen produced by renewable energies has the capacity to overcome these obstacles by decarbonizing the industry, electricity generation, transport and heat. With its National Hydrogen Strategy (NWS), the German government has given a strong boost to the hydrogen economy in all sectors of the energy system (BMWi, 2020). But renewable energy sources needed for the production of green hydrogen are subjected to weather-related and seasonal fluctuations. Hence, measures are needed to stabilize and secure future energy supplies. Hydrogen storage could therefore be the decisive factor in the energy transition. Only then the divergent hydrogen demand and production will be balanced.
mt0f | In addition to the storage of hydrogen in tanks or pipes, the geological subsurface also offers possibilities for the long-term storage of hydrogen. The hydrocarbon industry has been using the underground for decades in Germany and around the world to store large quantities of natural gas in the pore space of rocks or in salt caverns (e.g., American Gas Association, 1997; Sedlacek, 1999a; Sedlacek, 2002; Evans and Chadwick, 2009). More than 23 billion cubic meters of natural gas are stored underground in Germany (EEK Redaktion, 2021). This gives Germany the fourth-largest storage capacity in the world after the United States, Russia and the Ukraine (EEK Redaktion, 2015). About 36% (~8.6 billion cubic meters) of the current technically usable working gas volume is stored in pore storage systems for seasonal base load coverage and 74% of the installed capacity are stored in salt caverns for peak load coverage with more efficient injection and withdrawal cycles (EEK Redaktion, 2021). Nevertheless, current research into underground hydrogen storage potential in Germany and Europe has mainly focused on salt caverns only (Iordache et al., 2014; Simón et al., 2015; Michalski et al., 2017; Tarkowski and Czapowski, 2018; Caglayan et al., 2020; Lankof, and Tarkowski, 2020; Williams et al., 2022). The total energy storage potential in salt caverns is estimated to be as high as 84.8 PWh in Europe and 35.7 PWh in Germany alone (Caglayan et al., 2020). It is therefore not surprising that first flagship projects for underground storage of hydrogen in salt caverns at the field scale have already been launched in Germany at the Bad Lauchstädt Energy Park (HYPOS), in Rüdersdorf (HyCavMobil) and in Epe (GetH2). However, suitable salt deposits are locally limited and only 9% of the total worldwide working gas capacity is attributed to salt caverns (Sedlacek, 1999b; Cedigaz, 2021). Pore storage facilities such as depleted gas fields and saline aquifers could therefore play an important role in the energy transition due to their wide spread and broad availability across Europe (e.g., Foh et al., 1979; Panfilov, 2016; Tarkowski, 2019; Heinemann et al., 2021a; Zivar et al., 2021; Hematpur et al., 2023).
awab | Here, we investigate safety requirements and storage potentials in the light of future hydrogen needs. The aim is to formulate recommendations for future underground hydrogen storage in porous media. Our study starts with an overview of the past, present, and future of underground hydrogen storage (UHS) in Germany, discussing the experience with UHS and the prospects for hydrogen network structures. It highlights the progress that has been made and the challenges that need to be overcome for widespread
ixcc | deployment. In particular, there are critical factors that need to be considered in the design and operation of UHS facilities to ensure their safe and efficient operation. These critical factors or indicators, such as biotic and abiotic reactions, sealing capacity, cap rock integrity, cushion gas requirements, etc., are discussed before estimates of UHS storage capacity in Germany are made. Our estimates are made with respect to the discussion of technical hydrogen storage capacity in former and current underground gas storage facilities and the theoretical hydrogen storage capacity in saline aquifers. This section provides a quantitative assessment of the potential of UHS to support the energy transition in Germany. The fifth and final section discusses storage capacity and demand in Europe and assesses the costs and purity requirements of UHS. It builds on the findings of the previous sections and highlights the economic and technical challenges associated with UHS and the potential role of UHS in supporting the development of a sustainable hydrogen economy in Europe.
