You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

li1k | CpGs linked to life span in various taxonomic orders and tissues
pbea | To pinpoint CpGs associated with <LATEX>\log</LATEX> mum life span independently of phylogenetic order or tissue type, we conducted a meta- analysis of EWAS findings from 25 distinct strata comprising phylogenetic order and tis- sue type. Using a nonparametric meta-analysis approach (rankPvalue), we assessed the EWAS of life span (meta.lifespan) in these strata to identify CpGs unconfounded by tissue type or phylogenetic order (table S24). Our meta.life- span results demonstrated significant overlap with the previously mentioned EWASs of life

By contrast, none of the meta.lifespan CpGs overlapped with EWASs of age, which further supports the idea that methylation of life span-related CpGs does not change with age in mammalian tissues. The top four CpGs from the meta.lifespan analysis are depicted in Fig. 6B, showing significant posi- tive correlations for CpGs near LOXL1 and ZSCAN29 (exons) and negative correlations for those near RAB29 (exon) and GATA3 (down- stream), with log maximum life span across various taxonomic orders and tissue types. Similar to our above-mentioned results, CpGs implicated by our meta.lifespan analysis (FDR < 0.05) overlap significantly <LATEX>\mathrm { \left( F D R \right. } < 0 . 0 \mathrm { I } \mathrm { \left. \right] }</LATEX> with genes involved in organ morphogenesis, RNA biosynthesis, increased rib number in mice, Wnt signaling (Fig. 6C), and genes altered by transient expression of pluripotency-inducing factors in mouse models (nominal Fisher's ex- act <LATEX>P < 1 0 ^ { - 5 }</LATEX> for skin and meta.lifespan; <LATEX>P < 1 0 ^ { - 1 1 }</LATEX> for kidney and meta.lifespan; Fig. 6D).

y2qo | A biclustering analysis between chromatin annotations and comethylation modules based on fold enrichments (Fig. 8 and tables S21 and S22) revealed that the 55 mammalian comet-
1piq | hylation modules fall into three large group- ings (referred to as meta-modules). The bar plot to the left of Fig. 8 shows different mean methylation levels of the CpGs underlying the three meta-modules: mean methylation = 0.23, 0.66, and 0.77 for meta-modules 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
7fqw | Meta-module 1 contains several chromatin states that are associated with Polycomb repres- sion, including strong polycomb-repressed state ReprPC1 and bivalent promoters (BivProm1-2). Further, meta-module 1 contains chromatin states related to TSSs (TSS1 and TSS2) and several flanking promoters (PromF2, PromF3, PromF4, and PromF5). TSS1, PromF4, and PromF5 (as- sociated with negatively life span-related CpGs) were previously associated among universal chromatin states with the strongest enrich- ments for CpG islands (71 to 101 fold) (41). The color band under Fig. 8 reveals that six mod- ules underlying meta-module 1 are sensitive to murine life span interventions. Meta-module 1 is enriched with CpGs that have low methyl- ation levels in long-lived species (overlap with EWASs of life span, tan and greenyellow mod-

Meta-module 2 also con- tains the module most related with life span (midnightblue) and the human mortality risk module (magenta). These two modules over- lap with the CpGs that are positively related to life span. Three out of four average weight- related modules are also located in meta- module 2.
wtfz | Discussion

This platform specifi- cally focuses on highly conserved regions of DNA, making it a valuable resource for studying methylation patterns across mammalian spe- <LATEX>\mathrm { c i e s } \left( 5 \right) ,</LATEX> successful construction of mam- malian phyloepigenetic trees suggests that the divergence of DNAm profiles is closely aligned with genetic changes throughout evolution. Sensitivity assessments reveal that the observed phyloepigenetic associations are not caused by technical issues associated with our measure- ment platform. Instead, the phyloepigenetic signal may stem from sources such as upstream regulators, transcription factors, or DNA se- quence variations in distant regions.
