However, none of the previous researches reviewed the empirical studies of the relationship between inequality and carbon dioxide emissions. The authors of the selected papers, published from two thousand one to two thousand nineteen, found a diverse impact of income inequality on carbon dioxide emissions. It could depend on different trajectories of Kuznets curves. Furthermore, the majority of authors have provided theoretical analysis (even including human behavior) of the influence of income inequality on carbon dioxide emissions, considering only territorial (or production-based) emissions. However, this paper recommends distinguishing between the production-based and consumption-based emissions and suggests revised approaches to the impact of income inequality on carbon dioxide emissions with regard to the production-based and consumption-based emissions. Regarding the production-based emissions, the following approaches are proposed: determination of environmental policies, which also could reveal and explain the leakage phenomenon, and the channels of Environmental Kuznets Curve, namely scale, composition, technical, and globalization effects. The influence of income inequality on consumption-based emissions can be explained by applying two approaches, namely inequality determined changes in working time (this approach is also related to the Veblen effect) and individual economic behaviors of households. Therefore, the present study provides a new insight into the subject of the relationship between income inequality and pollution related to climate change.\npbea | Introduction\nccpt | Climate change and economic inequality are faced as the biggest challenges in recent decades. The main consequences of climate change include polar ice shield melting, sea level rising, and more frequent extreme weather events such as heavy rains, heat waves, and droughts. Thus, the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions is crucial for mitigation of\n0fpw | climate change consequences. Unequal societies badly affect sustainability and well-being as well. The authors have identified that inequality influences health and social problems, impels poverty-driven migration, decreases economic growth due to changes in fiscal policies, and undermines human capital. Therefore, a large number of authors have investigated whether these two problems, i.e. inequality and pollution related to climate change, could be solved simultaneously.\ndqn8 | A discussion concerning the impact of income inequality on carbon dioxide emissions originated in the nineteen nineties. A majority of studies theoretically and empirically analyzed the relationship between inequality and environmental pollution. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them has reviewed the empirical studies of the relationship between inequality and carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, in this paper, by reviewing the selected papers published from two thousand one to two thousand nineteen, the impact of inequality on carbon dioxide emissions in developing and developed countries is presented.\nlhkq | Empirical studies on inequality and environmental impact offer diverse results. Grunewald et al. has stated that different links between inequality and environmental impact vary with the level of inequality. Chow and Li together with Ibrahim and Law have argued that the links between economic development and pollution are moderated by the income inequality level. Moreover, the change in the relationship between these variables is moderated by the level of economic development. Therefore, in this paper, referring to Kuznets curve theory, which was applied to both inequality and environmental impact, particular attention was paid to revealing three possible alternatives: the countries trace the same Kuznets curve trajectory; the turn points are different, and in the case of inequality reduction, the environmental pollution increases (or vice versa); and Kuznets trajectories are different; for income inequality, a U-shape is observed, although for environmental impact, it has an inverted U-shape (or vice versa). To my best knowledge, this aspect has still not been considered in scientific literature. Furthermore, this article presents the differences between the impact channels through which economic development affects inequality and carbon dioxide emissions.\n82ju | Theoretical links of the relationship between environmental degradation (as air pollution level) and the inequality level are still required for a complete understanding of the reasons. Authors analyzing the inequality impact on carbon dioxide emissions mostly used three approaches: political economy explanation, marginal propensity to emit carbon dioxide, and individual economic behavior. However, these approaches are not suitable to explore the inequality impact on national carbon dioxide emissions, which is production-based. The argument that different consumer behavior (particularly consumption level) influences national emissions (which are production-based) might be a misconception considering that the major share of goods which people consume is imported or exported and thus related to the environmental impact in foreign countries. Therefore, analyzing approaches to the relationship between inequality and pollution, the type of emissions (consumption or production-based) should be considered. Therefore, in this paper, the revised approaches to the impact of income inequ-\ny2qo | ality on production-based and consumption-based carbon dioxide emissions were suggested. These aspects, presumably, have not been analyzed yet, and the present paper provides new insights into the subject.\n1piq | The impact of income inequality on carbon dioxide emissions with regard to economic development level\n7fqw | In order to thoroughly explore the influence of inequality on carbon dioxide emissions at different economic development levels, the databases ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Web of Science were exploited by applying a query \"inequality and greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide)\". All papers published from two thousand one to two thousand nineteen were selected where authors empirically evaluated the links between inequality and carbon dioxide emissions. In the presentation of the results, countries were classified as low-, middle-, and high-income countries, and a wide range of developed and developing countries. The relationship be- tween income inequality and carbon dioxide emissions was also distinguished as positive, negative, and neutral (or insignificant). Results in Table one revealed diverse results regarding the level of economic development. The impact of inequality on carbon emissions was different in developing and developed countries. These different results highlight the versatile role of inequality in carbon dioxide emissions.",
