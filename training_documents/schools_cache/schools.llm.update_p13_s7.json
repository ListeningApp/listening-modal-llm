Some will be shared with other members and some will differ from them significantly. School practice cannot be fully understood without including the habitus of the members.\nq1q2 | In our view, a leader's mediation between the school and the community must focus on pedagogical practices. We are not the first to argue for bridging marginalized students' cultural capital or funds of knowledge with the academic knowledge reflective of the common state and national culture. Referring to teachers,\ncb7r | highlighted how collaborations between the schools and the community can promote learning for students from minority communities. Similarly, also in reference to teachers, argues that teachers need to think about the teacher-student relationship in terms of culture, curriculum, and teaching. Here teachers need to have consciousness of their own culture in relation to students' cultures and bring that consciousness into their pedagogical practices.\n68xu | In our Bourdieusian approach to leadership, we argue that school leaders also have the responsibility to recognize, understand and integrate the cultural funds of knowledge of the community they serve into their school practices. Such recognition begins with consciousness and reflexivity as well as an awareness of the inequalities and differing logics of practice in schools. For Bourdieu it is the interaction of the thinking tools, habitus, capital and field, that enables us understand the logic of practice. Specifically, we see the role of today's school leader as a mediator between the fields of school and community, using Bourdieusian thinking tools to influence change in schools and communities. Drawing on Bourdieu, leaders engage diverse cultures in ways that connect schools and communities, supporting students toward autonomy, freedom and equality toward the democratic prospect. We are currently working as a research team to apply the Bourdieusian theories and thinking tools to empirical case studies in ISLDN.\n```",
