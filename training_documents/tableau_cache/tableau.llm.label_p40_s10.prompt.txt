You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

cuin | Visual cues
n1i7 | Within the Data pane, each field name is displayed, but there is also a visual cue that tells you what type of field it is. Field types determine the function and capability of joining data sources. In addition to showing the field type, Tableau Public allows you to change a field's type by right-clicking on it and selecting the Change Data Type option. The following list shows the fields and their descriptions:
0r5m | . The Abc field: This indicates that the field is a string field, which means that the contents of the field may include letters, special characters, or numbers
ne2o | · The calendar icon: This indicates a date, datetime, or time field
sqxn | . The # sign: This indicates a numeric field that can have any type of native numeric format, from bigint to decimal
6pmo | · The globe icon: This icon indicates that the field has geographic attributes
195r | . The paper clip icon: This indicates that the field is a group that you have created in Tableau Public
kqmi | · The Venn diagram icon: This indicates a set
g8rd | ]
nns9 | The parameters have their own data types, which can be established when you create them.
9uwy | The Analytics pane
srly | The Analytics pane is next to the Data pane. You can access it by clicking on its header. It provides you with the ability to add summaries, average lines, constant lines, distribution bands, medians, boxplots, forecasts, and other visual analytics to your visualization. You can then customize and edit them by using the reference line and formatting user interfaces.
dl6i | The Analytics that you can add are dependent on the data elements in your visualization, which include the following:
89ub | Summarized Analytics: This includes the following elements:
dhle | ° A constant line: This is an integer on an axis that you can input
2nib | ° An average line: This displays the mean of the measure that you have selected either across the table, pane, or cell
naev | ° Median line with 25% and 75% quartiles: This creates a median reference line and a quartile distribution band that you can edit
7h0h | [ 22 ]
a64c | www.it-ebooks.info
gi7n | Chapter 2
3pn1 | · Modeling: This includes the following elements:
wjuz | ° Average (or mean) with confidence intervals
3yxv | ° Trend lines with the most commonly used models (such as linear, exponential, and so on)
d8zj | . Custom: With the help of this element, you can add custom reference lines and distribution bands as well as box plots, which can also be used by right-clicking on an axis
ywxn | In the following screenshot, we added the average delay in minutes per day to the graph as a reference line by performing the following operations:
uxhs | 1. Click on Analytics to see the Analytics pane.
ed6e | 2. Drag Average Line to the y axis, which is the vertical axis.
6qqm | 3. Select Table as the scope, as shown in the following screenshot:
onum | Menus and toolbars
3iir | The menus in Tableau Public are arranged and named in a way that is similar to those in other modern applications. Their primary uses are shown in the following screenshot:

xv78 | Let's look at each of them in the following list:
sdks | . File: You can open and save your work to Tableau Public via this menu. Remember that Tableau Public does not auto-save.
y8fb | . Data: From here, you can add new data sources and modify the existing ones.
521q | . Worksheet: From here, you can create new worksheets, copy the visualization or data on your worksheet, and modify the title, caption, tooltip, and other features.
yogo | . Dashboard: This is used to create and format dashboards as well as to add actions.
2285 | . Story: This is used to add Story Points, which enhance the narrative capabilities of a data visualization. Story Points refers to a specific function in Tableau Public, and it's beyond the scope of this book.
ys0g | · Analysis: This can be used to aggregate and disaggregate measures, create forecasts, totals, and trend lines, and create and edit calculated fields.
7zvp | . Map: By changing the Map options, you can modify background maps and images, and add custom geocoding and WMS.
ww6u | . Format: This is used to modify the appearance of visualizations.
hpi6 | . Window: This can be used to switch between the presentation and development mode as well as other views in the workbook
4uhb | . Help: You can use this to get help and manage performance.
epyi | The buttons on the toolbar are graphically descriptive of their function. When you roll over each with your mouse, the instructions for use pop up as well.
y51p | The buttons of the toolbar include the following:
x95m | . The Start button: This takes you back to the Start screen
yfum | . The Undo button: This reverses the previous action that you took and can go as far as back to the state of the workbook when you opened it
ppx4 | . The Redo button: This repeats actions that you have reversed
qf11 | . The Save button: This is critical, as Tableau Public does not auto-save
8oqt | . Add New Data Source: This adds a new data source
6zah | . Add New Worksheet: This adds a new worksheet

g3tm | Canvas and Column/Row shelves
tfra | Tableau Software has a user interface that is very different from that of the older reporting or data analysis tools that you may have used at work or in school. It uses a methodology of dragging and dropping objects for most of the functions that you need to perform to build a visualization. The areas of the workspace where you place objects are called Shelves and Cards. Many of the tasks in this book instruct you to drag a field to the Columns or Rows shelf.
5lm9 | The far right side of the screen is called the canvas area. It is where sheet objects, such as a chart, are built. The chart area itself starts out blank, and you must drag the fields that you want to analyze to an axis, header, or the Columns or Rows shelf, which also determines on which axis or header the field appears.

rs2m | Tableau Public Interface Features
uz9y | In the following screenshot, we have highlighted the Columns and Rows shelves, the canvas, the Marks card, the Filters shelf, and the Pages shelf. This screenshot shows how the workspace looks before we add fields to it, and the description is as follows:
8ov0 | . The Columns Shelf (1) is where you put fields that you want on the horizontal header or the x axis, that is, the axis that goes from left to right. The Rows shelf is where you put fields that you want on the y axis.
mj9m | . The Canvas (2) has three places where you can drop fields, namely the x axis/header, the y axis/header, and the visualization space itself.
94h3 | · The Marks card (3) includes the controllers that are used to mark color, size, text label, and shape. In addition to this, the level of the Detail and Tooltip controllers allows you to control the appearance of the visualization. You can change the mark type for each individual axis as well as control the size, color, label, and shape. (Since the Marks card is critical to the function of the visualization, we will describe it in depth in the next section).
9jx1 | . The Filters shelf (4) is where you put fields that you want to use to limit the values included in your visualization. After dragging a field onto the Filters shelf, you can select values in the dialog box of that data element's Filters shelf.
c3lz | [26 ]

ez9s | Chapter 2
mqot | . The Pages shelf (5) allows users to progress through your visualization based on the fields that you put on it. For instance, you can use a date field on the Pages shelf, and your users can click on changes over time without having to manually select the subsequent values.
oc99 | Using the Columns and Rows shelves
gipz | As discussed earlier, the fields that you place on the Columns and Rows shelves will appear either on the x and y axis, or the row or column headers of the visualization respectively. The following are a few new concepts related to the uses of these shelves:
b4wj | . Once a field is on the shelf, it is referred to as a pill, or an active field
5xlt | · A pill on a shelf has a context menu
9bz4 | 7
yfv2 | The context menu can be opened by clicking on the small arrow that point downwards.
pujl | · Instances of fields that are discrete will appear in blue, and continuous fields will appear in green. The following is a description of both these fields:
3rqe | ° Discrete fields have specific values, and the range of values is finite
nsi3 | ° Continuous fields, on the other hand, have an infinite range of values with infinite possibilities
nil3 | . The Information Lab blog does a great job explaining the differences in Tableau Public; you can have a look at the explanation by visiting http: / / www.theinformationlab.co.uk/2011/09/23/blue-things-and-green- things/
68a1 | . In case you have multiple pills on a shelf, the discrete pills appear first because they are used to group fields, and the continuous pills appear second because they are used to measure fields

hkft | The following screenshot shows an example of a basic graph that we created:
jai3 | In order to create the graph shown in the preceding screenshot, we will perform the following steps:
p57i | 1. Drag Flight Date to the Columns shelf from the Dimensions pane.
u5ug | 2. Choose WEEKDAY as the part of the data that we want to show.
i9k5 | 3. Add a set that we created that groups airlines by the criteria that we established.

htre | Chapter 2
da3c | 4. When we drag the Flight Date field and the set to the Columns shelf, they both appear in the column headers. Drag the Delay minutes from the Measures pane to the Rows shelf.
890q | 5. When you do this, it defaults to aggregating as a SUM. Click on the Context menu of the pill and change the aggregation to Average.
jomo | Next, we will discuss how to use the Marks card to add color and labels.
06fi | Using the Marks card
hb4s | Another Tableau invention is the use of cards. Cards are containers for various controllers: which are dialogs in the Tableau workspace that allow various data elements and components to be configured. The most important card is the Marks card, which is in the most current version of Tableau Public. It has combined various controllers into one.
cqq2 | The Marks card is a compact yet highly functional area of the worksheet view that contains different controllers for data element chart properties (these data points on a chart are called marks). To use the Marks card, drag and drop data elements onto a corresponding shelf (such as Colors, Label, and Size). This will change the chart visualization by changing the chart mark properties.
1ews | The different controllers on the Marks card, which are commonly referred to as shelves, include the following:
afyn | . Colors: This changes the colors of marks in the chart (such as bar or line colors). In our example, the Set that shows whether an airline is in the top five worst airlines according to their average delay time is on the Color shelf.
8sye | · Size: This configures the sizes of data points or elements in charts.
r04h | · Label/Text: This adds a label to the chart for data points, bars, groupings, or lines. In our example, the percentage difference in average delay time between the top five worst airlines and all the others is on the Label shelf.

sy14 | . Details: This adds details to the chart or data points, allowing you to keep the main structure of the chart. However, it further categorizes it in detail and with more granularity. For example, if we add Unique Carrier to the Detail shelf, our visualization will aggregate the average departure time by day for each Unique carrier, which means that there is now a bar segment for each carrier, and the story that our graph tells will change dramatically, as shown in the following screenshot:
ghss | . Tool Tip: This allows you to add context and calls to action, which are critical for telling stories because they instruct users how to progress to the next step and they better illustrate how a data point relates to a user's interests.
3s61 | · Shape: This sets the data point shape in the chart visualization.
s3rm | . Path: This is typically used for routes on a map. This controller allows a path to be sequentially built and placed on a map visualization. This is commonly seen in tornado and hurricane tracking maps visualizations.

a57g | Once a field is on a shelf on the Marks card, it shows up under the shelves with a small icon for the shelf type followed by the field name, as shown in the following screenshot:
g8m3 | You can change the shelf on which a field is placed by clicking on the small icon and then selecting the shelf to which you'd like to move the field, as shown in the previous screenshot.
a9av | The Filters and Pages shelves
73l3 | The Filters shelf is where you drag fields to limit the data points that your users see in your visualization. When you drag it to the Filters shelf, Tableau Public will prompt you to filter a field according to its type.
ornm | You can also filter a visualization based on the inclusion in a Data set. If you want to show the filters to users, you can right-click on the fields in the data window to Show Quick Filters as well. We will describe filtering in depth in future chapters.
u2z1 | In the following screenshot, we have added WEEK(Flight Date) to the Pages shelf. The controller appears here. We can set the speed at which the visualization changes. In the Tableau Public desktop client, the visualization will progress sequentially once you click on the Play button. However, online, it will not progress automatically. Your user will need to click on the Play button to proceed.

756b | Since the functionality is limited online and that is where your users will interact with your work, we will condense the discussion of the Page shelf:
6bx7 | The workspace control tabs of Tableau Public
spl6 | The tabs at the bottom of the Tableau Public screen are either sheet or dashboard tabs. The tabs with a series of rows and a column on them are sheet tabs, where you can design objects that fit on one sheet. The tabs with a rectangle divided into four quadrants are dashboard tabs, where you can add one or more sheets in order to form a unified dashboard. When you click on one of the new (blank) worksheet or dashboard tabs, that tab opens and names the sheet or dashboard the next sequential name, such as Sheet 3 or Dashboard 2. The sheet or dashboard is blank when you first open a new tab.

c2fd | A dashboard is really just a group of worksheets on the same page. You can assemble a dashboard after creating the various component worksheets that it will contain. Dashboards are assembled and configured by using the Dashboard tabs in Tableau Public, which are available in the lower row of the tabs in the Tableau Public interface.
