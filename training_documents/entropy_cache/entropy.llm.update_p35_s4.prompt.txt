You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

lev6 | In summary, we've seen that if there exists a probability distribution <LATEX>p</LATEX> that max- imizes the Shannon entropy among probability distributions with <LATEX>\langle A \rangle = c ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>i f</LATEX> all the <LATEX>p _ { i }</LATEX> are positive, then <LATEX>p</LATEX> must be a Boltzmann distribution. But this raises other questions. When does such a probability distribution exist? If it exists, is it unique? And what if not all the <LATEX>p _ { i }</LATEX> are positive?
cnqv | In what follows we'll dive down this rabbit hole and get to the bottom of it. I'll just state some facts-you may enjoy trying to see if you can prove them. First, there exists a probability distribution <LATEX>p _ { 1 } , \ldots , p _ { n }</LATEX> with <LATEX>\langle A \rangle = c</LATEX> if and only if
848r | <LATEX>A _ { \min } \leq c \leq A _ { \max }</LATEX> where <LATEX>A _ { \min }</LATEX> is the minimum value and <LATEX>A _ { \max }</LATEX> is the maximum value of the numbers <LATEX>A _ { 1 } , \ldots , A _ { n } .</LATEX> Second, whenever
o1ho | <LATEX>A _ { m i n } < c < A _ { \max } ,</LATEX> there exists a unique probability distribution <LATEX>p _ { 1 } , \ldots , p _ { n }</LATEX> maximizing Shannon entropy subject to the constraint <LATEX>\langle A \rangle = c .</LATEX> Third, this unique maximizer <LATEX>p</LATEX> has <LATEX>p _ { i } > 0</LATEX> for <LATEX>\mathrm { a l l } i</LATEX> i, and is thus a Boltzmann distribution, whenever
gd2a | <LATEX>A _ { \min } < c < A _ { \max } .</LATEX> When <LATEX>c = A _ { \min } ,</LATEX> the unique maximizer assigns the same probability <LATEX>p _ { i }</LATEX> to each outcome <LATEX>i</LATEX> with <LATEX>A _ { i } = A _ { \min } ,</LATEX> while <LATEX>p _ { i } = 0</LATEX> for all other outcomes. Similarly, when <LATEX>c = A _ { \max } ,</LATEX> the unique maximizer assigns the same probability <LATEX>p _ { i }</LATEX> to each outcome <LATEX>i</LATEX> with <LATEX>A _ { i } = A _ { \max } ,</LATEX> while <LATEX>p _ { i } = 0</LATEX> for all other outcomes.
z373 | It's good to look at an example:
38ni | Puzzle 24. Suppose there are only two outcomes, with <LATEX>A _ { 1 } = - 1</LATEX> and <LATEX>A _ { 2 } = 1 .</LATEX> Work out the Boltzmann distribution <LATEX>p</LATEX> maximizing Shannon entropy subject to the constraint <LATEX>\langle A \rangle = c</LATEX> for <LATEX>- 1 < < <</LATEX> 1. Show that as <LATEX>\lambda \rightarrow + \infty</LATEX> this Boltzmann distribution has
effn | <LATEX>p _ { 1 } \rightarrow 1 , p _ { 2 } \rightarrow 0</LATEX> while as <LATEX>\lambda \rightarrow - \infty</LATEX> it has
ud13 | <LATEX>p _ { 1 } \rightarrow 0 , p _ { 2 } \rightarrow 1 .</LATEX> Show the probability distribution <LATEX>p _ { 1 } = 1 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>p _ { 2 } = 0</LATEX> maximizes Shannon entropy subject to the constraint <LATEX>\langle A \rangle = - 1 ,</LATEX> while <LATEX>p _ { 1 } = 0 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>p _ { 2 } = 1</LATEX> maximizes it subject to the constraint <LATEX>\langle A \rangle = 1 .</LATEX> Show these two probability distributions are not Boltzmann distributions.
aoj8 | THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM
1std | Suppose a system has finitely many states i = 1, . .. , n with energies Ej. If the probability p; that it's in the ith state maximizes entropy subject to a constraint on its expected energy:
m2cm | (E) = p; E; i=1 n
2syo | we say it is in thermal equilibrium. In this case pi is given by a Boltzmann distribution
dxsw | pi =
ba75 | >
sod4 | exp(-E;)
2x2r | at least if all the probabilities p; are positive.
4gct | Don't worry: the substance of what I'm saying here is almost the same as in the last box. I'm merely attaching new words to the concepts, to make them sound more like physics:
uuio | · Before I said we had a set of n 'outcomes' numbered 1, 2, ... , n. Now I'm talking about 'states'. If we have a system with n states, it means there are n outcomes when we do a measurement to completely determine which state it's in. A 'state' is some way for a physical system to be that's vague but it's all we can say until we consider some specific kind of system. In classical physics the states form a set, usually infinite but sometimes finite.
e34x | · Before I said we had a 'quantity' A that depends on the outcome, taking the value Ai in the ith outcome. Now I'm calling this quantity the 'energy' E. Energy is a particularly interesting quantity in physics, so we'll focus on that, without demanding that you know anything about it: for our present purposes, we can take any quantity and dub it 'energy'.
8w73 | · Before I called the Lagrange multiplier . Now I'm calling it ß, because that's what physicists do in this particular context.
6ndf | When a system maximizes entropy subject to a constraint on the expected value of its energy, and perhaps also some other quantities, we say the system is in thermal equilibrium. This is meant to suggest that an object just sitting there, not heating up or cooling down, is often best modeled this way.
x2p2 | You may have noticed the annoying clause "at least if all the probabilities pi are positive". I only said that because I cannot tell a lie. In Puzzle 24 we saw that as 3 -> too, the Boltzmann distribution can converge to a non-Boltzmann probability distribution where some of the probabilities pi vanish. This still counts as thermal equilibrium, because it's still maximizing entropy subject to a constraint on expected energy. We'll learn more about this when we study the concept of 'absolute zero'.
yhgh | COOLNESS
jjti | If a probability distribution p; maximizes entropy sub- ject to a constraint on the expected value of the energy Ej, then
uw2x | Pi xe BEi
1rbl | where ß is the coolness, inversely proportional to tem- perature. So:
wr7g | The cooler a system is, the less likely it is to be in a high-energy state!
