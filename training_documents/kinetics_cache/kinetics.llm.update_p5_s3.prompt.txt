You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

43ia | Identification of promoter motif and TSS distribution. The recognition and coordinates of the promoter motifs (TATA box, Initiator, CCAAT box, GC box) are downloaded from 'the Select/Download Tool' of the EPD New database (54). In order to determine the TSS distribution of mouse embry- onic fibroblasts, MEFs FANTOM5 Cap Analysis of gene expression data is retrieved through the CAGEr R package (55). After normalization and TSS clustering, TSS distribu- tion is defined as 'sharp' if the promoter width is less than 15bp (this length is taken as the median of all genes), and as 'broad' otherwise.
3g2y | Identification of enhancer-promoter intensity. The data about the interaction between enhancer and promoter is downloaded from (16). The dataset is used to compare the correlation between burst kinetics and enhancer activity of fibroblasts and mESCs. Enhancer activity is calculated ac- cording to the intensity of the H3K27ac peak measured in the defined EPUs region (which is considered that enhancer and promoter interactions occur more possibly) via ChIP- seq in a previous study (56). In our study, we only utilize the collated data that includes the peak of H3K27ac in EPUs of MEFs.
gc7v | Statistical analysis
wqfv | Gene expression variability. Gene expression variability is usually quantified by the square of the coefficient of varia- tion (CV2), which is defined as the ratio of the variance over the square of the mean. According to this definition, we cal- culate gene-expression variability in a given set of observed data Y for gene g. Similarly, we use the inferred eest to calcu- late the theoretical CV2 of our hierarchical model for gene g, that is,
j30a | CV2 E[Y; Oest]2 Var [ Y; oest]
7bdk | (18)
fim0 | When fitting CV2 with a cubic spline, we find that there is a strong correlation between the mean expression level and
ojro | CV2 (Supplementary Figure S9a). Many studies have dis- cussed the relationship between gene-expression variabil- ity and mean (57,58). Note that in the classical telegraph model, the total mRNA variability can be decomposed into two parts: the mRNA internal variability generated from transcription and the promoter variability due to the switch- ing between active and inactive states. Inspired by (15), we adjust the variability by subtracting the inverse of the loga- rithmic mean (logarithm base 2), thus obtaining the resid- ual squared coefficient of variation (rCV2). For example, for gene g, we have
l6t9 | rCV? = CV? log2 (Mg)' 1 −
1ujy | (19)
qzor | where µg = E[ Y; oest]. As a result, the influence of the mean expression level on the expression variability is basically eliminated after performing a linear regression on rCV2 (Supplementary Figure S9b).
a0by | Linear regression model in promoter motif analysis. After having obtained the promoter motifs of each gene from the EPD database and its burst kinetics (rCV2, burst fre- quency, burst size) by inference, we conduct multivariate linear regression with interaction terms to find the corre- lations between quantities of interest in cases of positive, negative, and non-feedbacks. Specifically, we perform mul- tivariate linear regression according to
u1ky | rCV2~(TAT A * Inr + CCAAT * GC) x feedback,
htm9 | log10 (bf) ~(TATA* Inr +CCAAT *GC) × feedback, (20) log10 (bs) ~(TATA* Inr +CCAAT * GC) × feedback.
8hul | In Figure 4B-D and Supplementary Figure S10c-e, we show the t-value in the regression results. The absolute of t- value is larger in the test of the linear regression coefficient, indicating that the resulting correlations are significant.

ym66 | An integrated statistical framework for learning promoter- dependent yet feedback-constrained transcriptional burst ki- netics on a genome-wide scale
l0a3 | Cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression is primarily at- tributed to transcriptional bursting (12,59,60), which is rep- resented by a vector y of components including burst fre- quency, burst size, expression variability, etc. (Figure 1C). Transcriptional bursts result from complex molecular pro- cesses on multilayered sources (1), which are represented by a vector x of components including static DNA se- quences, epigenetic modifications (61), transcription, trans- lation, dynamic network regulations, etc. (2). Then, the question of how these molecular processes coordinate tran- scriptional busting can be mathematically described as y = f(x), where f is a vector function describing the correlation of x to y.
u8nw | Static promoter architecture is an essential DNA se- quence for binding transcription factors during mRNA synthesis. Specifically, promoter motifs (such as initiator, TATA-box, CCAAT-box, GC-box), broad and sharp TSS
l2v9 | distributions, and enhancer-promoter interactions are es- sential features of eukaryotic promoter architecture (Fig- ure 1A, left). Meanwhile, variability in gene expression can propagate from mRNA to protein and further to target genes, possibly through a dynamic and complex gene reg- ulatory network. A common form of dynamic regulation is auto-regulation which directly or indirectly regulates the corresponding target gene itself through a feedback loop, resulting in a repressing or activating expression (Figure 1A, right). For clarity, we let vectors x1 and x2 represent static promoter architecture and dynamic feedback regu- lation, respectively (Figure 1A). The information on pro- moter architecture (x1) can be recovered from public bioin- formatics databases such as the EPD database (54), Biocon- ductor (62), and UCSC Genome Browser (63). In general, the mechanisms of dynamic regulation (x2) and burst kinet- ics (y) are not directly measurable but hidden in data sets. Unlike some imaging-based technologies such as MS2 sys- tem (64) that were limited to a few genes and could not be extended to the whole genome, single-cell sequencing technologies made it possible to recover the information on dynamic regulations (x2) and burst kinetics (y) from static snapshots (Figure 1E). Figure 1B-E summarizes the
afbe | genome-wide inference procedure proposed here. This pro- cedure used a statistical framework of the model-driven (Figure 1B) and data-driven (Figure 1E) combination to in- fer dynamic feedback regulations and transcriptional burst kinetics from static scRNA-seq data (Figure 1C, D) under the assumption that the abundances of mRNA and protein were highly dependent (65).
78r8 | Specifically, our statistical inference framework used a mechanistic model of gene expression (Figure 1B), which simultaneously considered transcriptional burst kinetics (y) and feedback regulations (x2), to obtain 'true' gene expression distributions (Figure 1D, left). On the other hand, the known scRNA-seq data gave 'observed' gene expression distributions, implying possible errors in the sequencing technologies (66,67). A hierarchical statistical model (see 'Materials and Methods') was proposed to link 'true' gene-expression levels (Figure 1D, left) and 'ob- served' mRNA counts (Figure 1D, right), thus determin- ing key kinetic parameters (expression variability, burst size, burst frequency, and dynamic regulation) (Figure 1C). We emphasized that the proposed framework was a scal- able genome-wide inference, which was particularly use- ful in revealing how both static promoter architecture and
