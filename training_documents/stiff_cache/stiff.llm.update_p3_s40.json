For example, Iwasaki and Tatsuoka indicated that the shear modulus of clean sands obtained from resonant column and cyclic torsional tests can be expressed by\np2n3 | G sub c q equals K left parenthesis gamma right parenthesis F left parenthesis e right parenthesis p raised to the power n left parenthesis gamma right parenthesis (one)\nohh7 | where G sub e q equals equivalent shear modulus; K left parenthesis gamma right parenthesis equals material constant that depends on shear strain level; F left parenthesis e right parenthesis equals void ratio function; p prime equals mean effective stress; and n left parenthesis gamma right parenthesis equals empirical exponent that depends on shear strain level.\nvbni | According to Hardin and Blandford, it is also possible to express the dependence of the small strain shear modulus G sub zero on the current state of a soil by means of the following relationship:\ndgcw | G sub zero equals S sub i j F left parenthesis e right parenthesis left parenthesis O C R right parenthesis raised to the power k p sub a raised to the power left parenthesis one minus n sub i minus n sub j right parenthesis sigma sub i raised to the power n sub i sigma sub i raised to the power n sub j (two)\ngvwz | where Sij equals nondimensional material constant of given soil that also reflects its fabric; k equals empirical exponent that depends on plasticity index of soil; sigma sub i and sigma sub j prime equals effective principal stresses acting on plane in which G sub zero is measured; n; and n sub i equals empirical exponents; and p sub a equals stress.\nsk5m | Moreover, Hardin and Blandford suggested that the Young's modulus for elastic compressive strain increments in a certain direction is a unique function of the normal stress in that direction. Lo Presti et al. and Hoque and Tatsuoka reported similar results for triaxial tests performed on clay and sand.\nqws8 | As mentioned before, it was indicated that the secant Young's modulus depends on the stress ratio and the stress history under consolidation. Moreover its effects were different from sand to sand. Thus, to clarify the effects of the confining pressure, the stress ratio at consolidation (i.e., isotropic and K sub zero consolidation) and the overconsolidation history on the secant Young's modulus E sub sec under wide strain levels (zero point zero zero one to one percent), an empirical study was performed on triaxial compression test results using the following equations:\n877u | E sub s c c left parenthesis I C right parenthesis equals S sub r F left parenthesis e right parenthesis sigma sub r e prime raised to the power n p sub a raised to the power left parenthesis one minus n right parenthesis (isotropic normally consolidated sand)\nrzhj | (three) E sub sec left parenthesis K sub zero right parenthesis equals a S sub v F left parenthesis e right parenthesis sigma sub w double prime p sub a raised to the power left parenthesis one minus n right parenthesis left parenthesis K sub zero normally consolidated sand right parenthesis (four) where Sy equals nondimensional material constant that depends on\nbfax | axial strain level of isotropic normally consolidated sands; F left parenthesis e right parenthesis equals void ratio function left parenthesis dot F left parenthesis e right parenthesis equals left parenthesis two point one seven minus e right parenthesis squared divided by left parenthesis one plus e right parenthesis right parenthesis (Toyoura and Ticino sands) and F left parenthesis e right parenthesis equals left parenthesis three point eight two minus e right parenthesis squared divided by left parenthesis one plus e right parenthesis (Quiou sand); sigma sub w prime equals effective axial stress at end of consolidation; n equals empirical exponent that depends on axial stress and axial strain level of isotropic normally consolidated sands; p sub a equals reference stress (ninety-eight kiloPascal); and a equals empirical constant that\nf2y8 | ampersand a equals one point zero depends on axial strain level of K sub zero normally consolidated sands.\no7qm | Figures three to five show the comparison of the secant modulus obtained from the test data and the empirical fitting equation for normally consolidated isotropic consolidated and K sub zero consolidated Toyoura, Quiou, and Ticino sands for three kinds of strain levels, respectively. Although a certain scatter is recognized, it can be seen that the empirical fitting equation that uses three and four above agrees well with the test data at small and intermediate strain levels and stress ratios for normally consolidated sands. Table three lists the parameter values of the empirical fitting equation for the three sands.\n```",
