        "content": "68xu | Considering the advantages in evaluating patients with hypertensive heart disease, cardiac magnetic resonance, aside from being the gold standard for ventricular function and mass assessment, did not find its place in everyday practice, mostly due to the limited capability of a large number of hospitals to perform it on an everyday basis. Different non-invasive diagnostic modalities have been developed and improved with great correlation to cardiac magnetic resonance in evaluating patients with hypertensive heart disease. In\nhd35 | patients with myocardial hypertrophy, ECG showed low sensitivity and specificity, while echocardiography overestimated or underestimated certain clinical forms due to high inter-observer variability. It is shown that echocardiography overdiagnosed LVH in fifteen percent of patients and missed LVH in fourteen percent. However, with the latest echocardiographic techniques, this imaging modality can provide a much wider spectrum of important information. Three-D echocardiography showed excellent results in different clinical trials in obtaining measurements of left ventricle size and function in correlation with cardiac magnetic resonance. Speckle-tracking echocardiography can detect subclinical systolic dysfunction and reduced longitudinal strain in patients with hypertensive heart disease. Regarding the differences between various imaging tools in evaluating patients with hypertensive heart disease, cardiac magnetic resonance can offer high reproducibility of measurements, easier and faster evaluation of treatment, intramyocardial function and diastolic dysfunction, fibrosis, and ischemia assessment. Ischemia assessment is an important aspect, as cardiac magnetic resonance can provide a highly sensitive non-invasive estimation of ischemia through an adenosine stress-perfusion test. All these parameters give a comprehensive overview of the patient's clinical condition in one single examination, shortening the time required to make a diagnosis while simultaneously facilitating healthcare expenses.\n2zpk | Five. Ventricular Volumes and Left Ventricle Geometry Measured by Cardiac Magnetic Disease in Patients with HHD\nepu7 | Pathophysiological mechanisms of hypertensive heart disease involve myocardium remodeling, muscle fibrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and hypertrophy of intra-myocardial coronary vasculature. The evolution of the disease is affected by the duration and severity of hypertension, hereditary predisposition, and the effects of cytokines and neurohormonal factors which subsequently lead to systolic and diastolic dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, or ischemia. Cardiac magnetic resonance is currently the gold standard in estimating right and left ventricular volumes, myocardial mass, non-invasive hemodynamic indexes, as well as accessing the left ventricle geometry. CMR-measured LV mass and cardiac geometry are independently associated with biomarkers of myocardial stretch and injury, including NT-proBNP and hs-Troponin T.\n7od1 | Optimal evaluation of hypertrophy patterns, especially between hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypertensive heart disease, is of great importance considering an increased cardiovascular risk in patients with advanced left ventricle hypertrophy. Additionally, it is important to underline that left ventricle asymmetry and left ventricle end-diastolic wall thickness are poor discriminators between hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypertensive heart disease. A novel imaging technique named myocardial feature tracking is a method similar to speckle-tracking echocardiography which can differentiate between hypertensive heart disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by accessing global longitudinal strain. Although the differences between left ventricle ejection fraction and left ventricle volumes\n0bqy | were insignificant in these patients, as presented by Neisius et al., left ventricle mass index, maximum left ventricle wall thickness, late gadolinium enhancement volume, and global native T one measured by cardiac magnetic resonance were important parameters of hypertensive heart disease to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy distinction.\nb780 | Six. Left Ventricle Function Accessed by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance\nccmb | Global systolic function in the early stages of hypertension is usually preserved. Measuring the intramyocardial strain by cardiac magnetic resonance in these patients is important as this parameter is usually depressed, especially in the septum. Myocardial tissue tagging is a modality that can access longitudinal and circumferential shortening, determine pathophysiological changes, and follow-up left ventricle wall motion changes in patients with hypertensive heart disease. It is shown that in patients with hypertensive heart disease, global circumferential, longitudinal, and radial strain rates were associated with the mean arterial pressure, left ventricular mass index, and age, which is important in preventing the possible consequential decrease in global ejection fraction. Global longitudinal strain is decreased in patients with hypertensive heart disease, regardless of the presence of late gadolinium enhancement phenomenon, and is associated with left ventricular end-diastolic volume, LV ejection fraction, and LV mass index. Certain biomarkers of myocardial\nma93 | fibrosis can be significant in the early stages of hypertensive heart disease before global systolic dysfunction occurs, as they have a good correlation with myocardial strain rates. In patients with decreased longitudinal strain, increased values of serum TIMP-one level have been detected. This tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase has been marked as a potential indicator of myocardial fibrosis, not only in hypertensive patients with decreased regional systolic function but also in patients with diastolic dysfunction. Molecular biomarkers of collagen synthesis (PICP and PIIINP) and collagen degradation (CITP and MMP-one) are potential biomarkers of myocardial fibrosis and have significant correlation with left atrial diameter, LV mass, LV posterior wall thickness, LV end-diastolic volume, and longitudinal strain, as important parameters in patients with progressed hypertensive heart disease. Cardiac magnetic resonance derived mitral annular plane systolic excursion can also be a significant prognostic marker in patients with hypertension. A study by Romano et al. demonstrated that lateral mitral annular plane systolic excursion was independently associated with mortality across all the subgroups of patients with preserved ejection fraction, even in those without history of previous myocardial infarction.\nc6hh | Diastolic dysfunction often develops as a consequence of long-standing hypertension, while atrial dilatation correlates with the severity of hypertension and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Quantification of ventricular volume change over time using retrospective gating is an important modality that can estimate atrial filling ratios, peak diastolic filling rate, and time to peak filling. Although it is not used routinely in estimating diastolic dysfunction in patients with hypertensive heart disease, cardiac magnetic resonance could be an important part of stratifying patients with an increased risk to develop a more severe form of the disease.",
