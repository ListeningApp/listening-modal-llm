You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

f2y8 | Surprisingly, dipyrone at both doses inhibited COX-1 and COX- 2 for 24 hours and 0.5 hour, respectively, in cats. However, no

d52l | <LATEX>\left( p < 0 . 0 5 \right) .</LATEX> significant adverse effects and alterations in laboratory tests were observed throughout the study. In addition, dipyrone was as effective as meloxicam for postoperative analgesia.
qlbb | During the literature search, no previous papers evaluating the effect of dipyrone on COX activity in cats were found. This study was based on the one performed by Duz et al. (2015), which described this technique in horses.
nhsg | The administration of the drugs led to an inhibition of COX-1 activity, as observed by the plasma <LATEX>\mathrm { T X B } _ { 2 }</LATEX> concen- tration decrease. These results corroborate previous studies
hy0l | <LATEX>\left( p < 0 . 0 5 \right) .</LATEX> on the use of dipyrone (Hinz et al. 2007; Pierre et al. 2007) in other species and meloxicam in other species (Engelhardt et al. 1996a, b; Brideau et al. 2001) and in cats (Giraudel et al. 2005).
4jmz | The COX-1 activity inhibition was greater at both dipyrone doses than meloxicam from 4 hours on. Even though this in- hibition is similar to that caused by nonselective NSAIDs, dipyrone was not associated with any adverse effects commonly observed with NSAIDs. A multicentric study of humans reported higher gastrointestinal safety with dipyrone than classical NSAIDs (Laporte et al. 1991) and its low acidity may be responsible for the favorable gastrointestinal tolerance (Hinz et al. 2007).
b7cq | Despite the significant COX-1 inhibition seen in this study, no postoperative bleeding was observed in any cat. In a similar study in dogs, a single dose of dipyrone (25 mg <LATEX>\left. \mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { I V } \right)</LATEX> alone or in combination with meloxicam <LATEX>\left( 0 . 2 \mathrm { m g } \mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { I V } \right)</LATEX> inhibited platelet aggregation for 3 and 5 hours, respectively, with no alterations in thromboelastometry and buccal mucosal bleeding time (Zanuzzo et al. 2015b).
0b39 | The ex vivo evaluation of COX-2 activity inhibition showed that it occurred in all groups, similar to results from studies in other species (Engelhardt et al. 1996a, b; Brideau et al. 2001; Giraudel et al. 2005; Hinz et al. 2007; Pierre et al. 2007). At 0.5 hour, PGE2 concentrations had decreased significantly in all groups, lasting longer (4 hours) in group M.
qecd | In the present study, both dipyrone doses strongly inhibited both COX isoforms in a nonselective way; COX-1 inhibition was greater and longer lasting than that of COX-2. The COX
1o7p | selectivity ratio was not calculated because ex vivo assays cannot be used for these estimates (Duz et al. 2015). Hinz et al. (2007) observed that 4-methylamino antipyrine, an active metabolite of dipyrone, led to a substantial COX inhibition of both isoforms equally.
cp13 | Meloxicam also inhibited both COX isoenzymes, however inhibition of COX-1 by meloxicam was less intense than from dipyrone, whereas COX-2 inhibition was longer lasting. Pre- vious studies, including assays of canine and feline whole blood after administration of meloxicam, identified only a slight COX-2 selectivity (COX-1:COX-2 ratio of 10 and 3.5, respectively) (Brideau et al. 2001; Giraudel et al. 2005). Blood collected from 10 cats revealed that meloxicam inhibited COX-1 by at least 20% at minimal plasma concen- trations and exceeded 40% at therapeutic plasma concen- trations (Giraudel et al. 2005). These results are similar to those in the present study.
bgre | Despite the nonselective COX-2 inhibition, the drugs and dosages administered in the present study resulted in no adverse effects or alterations in laboratory tests (CBC and serum chemistry) throughout the evaluation period. In group M, serum SDMA concentrations decreased at 24 hours compared with 7 days before and 7 days after anesthesia. In group D25, they were significantly lower at 24 hours compared with 7 days postoperatively. However, the changes showed a similar pattern in all groups, and the values did not exceed the feline normal reference interval (0-14 µg dL-1). These results suggest that glomerular filtration rate increased after the surgical procedure, probably influenced by intra- operative fluid therapy. There were no differences among

ukth | groups in concentrations of SDMA, however, one cat in M presented a high value (15 µg dL-1) at 7 days postoperatively.
kpvt | Pain is a vital sign that has a complex pathophysiology. Sensitization of nociceptors or hyperalgesia is a common finding in inflammatory pain and is a consequence of the ac- tion of inflammatory mediators such as PGE2. These mediators lower the threshold of excitability of receptors, facilitating the activity of notoriously painful substances, such as histamine and bradykinin (Zhang et al. 1997). NSAIDs, such as melox- icam, have a proven analgesic potential related to COX inhi- bition, decreasing the production of PGE2 in cats (Giraudel et al. 2005).
jie2 | Although dipyrone is not a new drug, the mechanism of action is complex and not yet completely understood. Based on studies in other species, it was hypothesized that effects of dipyrone depend at least partially on COX inhibition and consequently on the reduction in PGE2 synthesis peripherally (Abbate et al. 1990; Hinz et al. 2007). Our findings corrob- orate these data; however, it is likely that dipyrone also pro- duces analgesia through other mechanisms in cats. Chandrasekharan et al. (2002) reported the existence of a splicing variant of COX-1, referred to as COX-3, and suggested that dipyrone selectively inhibits this enzyme. However, that in vitro study used constructs of canine COX-3 and murine COX-1 and -2 with disparate activity levels, leading to un- certainties and controversies (Hinz et al. 2007). In addition, there is no evidence regarding the presence, physiological role and dipyrone selectivity for COX-3 in the feline species.
