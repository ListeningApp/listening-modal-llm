You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

87cq | Annual Review of Virology Crowning Touches in Positive-Strand RNA Virus Genome Replication Complex Structure and Function
0qs3 | Abstract
z8f7 | Positive-strand RNA viruses, the largest genetic class of eukaryotic viruses, include coronaviruses and many other established and emerging pathogens. A major target for understanding and controlling these viruses is their genome replication, which occurs in virus-induced membrane vesicles that organize replication steps and protect double-stranded RNA intermediates from innate immune recognition. The structure of these complexes has been greatly illuminated by recent cryo-electron microscope tomography studies with several viruses. One key finding in diverse systems is the organization of crucial viral RNA replication factors in multimeric rings or crowns that among other functions serve as exit channels gating release of progeny genomes to the cytosol for translation and encapsidation. Emerging results suggest that these crowns serve additional important purposes in replication complex assembly, function, and interaction with downstream processes such as encapsidation. The findings provide insights into viral function and evolution and new bases for understanding, controlling, and engineering positive-strand RNA viruses.
7w7j | 1. INTRODUCTION
51vd | Positive-strand RNA viruses [(+)RNA viruses] are one of the most numerous and devastating viral classes. Their members include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the tumor-inducing hep- atitis C virus (HCV), paralytic poliovirus, lethal encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever viruses, and many other human, animal, and plant pathogens (1, 2). In parallel, these viruses have demon- strated considerable potential for beneficial uses in medicine, biotechnology, and nanotechnology through their abilities to deliver, dramatically amplify, express, and evolve selected genes and RNA elements (e.g., 3). The practical potential of such RNA pathways has become even more apparent with the recent successes of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines (4) and increasingly numerous and powerful RNA-based tools for gene editing and regulation (5-7).
baj1 | Better understanding of replication and pathogenesis is crucial to (+)RNA virus control, to predicting the emergence of future dangerous viral species and variants, and to improving engi- neered uses of viral derivatives and pathways. One essential target for understanding, controlling, and employing (+)RNA viruses is their genome replication. Such RNA replication invariably uses most of the viral genome coding capacity-e.g., greater than 70% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome-and thus is arguably the main job of the virus. This (+)RNA virus genome replication proceeds solely through RNA intermediates, without any natural DNA forms (Figure 1a). In eukaryotes, these processes occur in virus-induced, membrane-bounded mini-organelles that organize RNA replication steps and protect double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) replication interme- diates from innate immune recognition. Two classes of such RNA replication complexes (RCs) are known. The first, designated spherules, are ~50- to 150-nm invaginations of an intracellular membrane, whose interior remains connected to the cytosol by a necked channel (Figure 1b). The second class consists of ~200- to 300-nm double-membrane vesicles or DMVs, which lack any membranous opening to the cytosol (Figure 1c).
n1wo | Prior ultrastructural knowledge of (+)RNA virus RCs had been limited to their membrane architecture. Recent application of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and complementary approaches to a few pioneer systems has greatly advanced understanding of these complexes and their functions by revealing the location, organization, and interactions of viral RNA templates, RNA replication proteins, and other relevant viral and cellular factors. In this review we sum- marize these and other recent breakthroughs in (+)RNA virus genome replication and their implications for viral function and control. Major findings include that, in addition to enzymatic roles in viral RNA synthesis, (+)RNA virus replication proteins have key structural roles in RCs. For both spherule and DMV RCs, these viral proteins form ringed complexes or crowns that among other functions serve as cytosolic exit channels for progeny (+)RNA products. As outlined below, such crowns appear to represent a crucial nexus for many infection steps, from initial recruitment of RNA replication factors and templates through successive RNA replication func- tions, post-translational maturation steps, encapsidation, and host innate immune interactions. Ongoing analysis of these crowns promises to provide further valuable insights regarding RC structure, operation, assembly, and evolution.
5bq3 | 2. SPHERULE RNA REPLICATION COMPLEXES
ezla | Below we introduce some general RC principles and emerging specifics of RCs employ- ing spherule invaginations as RNA replication compartments (Figure 1b), using several of the best-characterized examples among the many (+)RNA viruses that employ this style of RC.
rsbu | 2.1. Nodaviruses
magd | Nodaviridae infect vertebrates or invertebrates including insects and nematodes. Their genomes and spherule RCs bear similarities to the plant-infecting Tombusviridae (8, 9). The associated nodavirus-tombusvirus clade was recently substantially expanded by viruses discovered through large-scale sequencing (1, 10). Nodaviruses encode a single, highly multifunctional RNA repli- cation factor, protein A (~1,000 aa), that contains RNA methyltransferase (M'Tase)/capping, membrane association, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and multiple self-interaction domains (Figure 2). Advanced sequence comparisons show that protein A embodies three of the four domains conserved across the RNA replication proteins of the large alphavirus superfamily (11) (Figure 2). In keeping with such expanding parallels, findings on nodavirus RNA replication and RCs often have provided precedents relevant to many (+)RNA viruses.
tb74 | Flock house virus (FHV) is a particularly well-studied nodavirus and an increasingly advanced model for (+)RNA virus genome replication and other processes (12, 13). While FHV virions are
8l69 | only infectious to insect cells, FHV RNA replication, transcription, and virion assembly have been reproduced in all eukaryotic cells tested to date, including mammalian, plant, fungal, and nematode cells (14, 15). FHV thus provides a simple, well-characterized system for RNA-dependent RNA amplification in diverse cells, which as noted above could have many practical applications.
1jyv | 2.1.1. Ultrastructure of nodavirus spherule RNA replication complexes. Nodavirus RNA replication occurs in spherular membrane invaginations on host mitochondria (16-20) (Figure 3a). Protein A is targeted to the outer mitochondrial membrane by an N-proximal
olce | 196
erx1 | mitochondrial transmembrane domain (19) and further interacts with that membrane through se- quences in its Iceberg region (11, 21, 22) (Figure 2). This nodavirus Iceberg region has parallels to alphavirus RNA replication proteins in predicted structure and in primary sequence position relative to flanking protein domains (Figure 2), and is defined as a relatively large conserved struc- tural extension to the capping enzyme core, reminiscent of the submerged part of an iceberg (11). Protein A also recruits FHV genomic RNA templates to the outer mitochondrial membrane by interaction of its RdRp domain with cis signals that in FHV genomic RNA1 reside in nucleotides 68-205 (22, 23). In a process closely linked to RNA synthesis from such templates, protein A then induces invagination of the characteristic ~60- to 70-nm spherule vesicles of its RCs (24).
