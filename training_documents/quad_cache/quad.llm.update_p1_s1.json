        "content": "byu8 | Quadratic Voting How Mechanism Design Can Radicalize Democracy\n76b0 | Vickrey launched mechanism design as a project to implement Lerner's \"socialist\" dreams of welfare optimality absent a benevolent and omniscient planner. When Vickrey became a Nobel Laureate, he announced that he planned to bring this vision to the broader public using the \"bully pulpit\" the prize afforded him, but he sadly died days later. Furthermore, while Vickrey's ambitions gained some early adherents, experience and Vickrey's own warnings suggested his exact scheme was usually impractical.\nzxz6 | Thus, while mechanism design transformed economic theory, the novel mechanisms it suggests have largely been treated as a series of insightful theoretical curiosities of little practical relevance or applied in quite narrow settings, for example to spectrum and internet advertising auctions. In a book that will come out as this article does, one of us aims to revive the more radical ambitions of mechanism design and suggest they may offer a solution to the economic, political and social crisis of our times.\nxnth | Perhaps the most glaring element of that crisis has been the struggles of democracies to resolve majority-minority conflicts and the resulting ascendancy of \"populist\" tyrannies of the majority or plurality. This oldest and most persistent problem of democracy seems particularly to lend itself to Vickrey's approach both because of its sweeping scope and because the basic problem seems to be precisely the lack of markets.\nvafm | One-person-one-vote rations a single unit of influence on any collective deci-\n2zmw | sion to each voter, preventing potential Pareto-improving trade. When we complain about the failure of standard democracy to account for intensity of preference or knowledge, we mean that it blocks trades where some citizens would be willing to give up their influence on some issues to gain more influence on others. Furthermore, given that the standard market system of exchange may be derived as a limit of Vickrey's procedure in a large society, it seems natural that applying a similar logic to public goods could yield a solution.\nbf9k | Yet, to our knowledge, prior to our work on the subject no simple and flexible pricing system for collective decisions that could apply to common settings such as binary decisions had been proposed. Groves and Ledyard and Hylland and Zeckhauser proposed closely related market systems for choosing continuous public goods, but groups of voters rarely directly choose continuous public goods. Here we propose a simple version of Hylland and Zeckhauser's scheme for the common setting of communities making repeated binary collective decisions. As with the market system for private goods, it is the large population limit of Vickrey's scheme and we will show that it is the unique way to price votes that achieves optimality in a \"price-taking\" model analogous to the conditions under which markets achieve optimality.\notkr | One. Price-Theoretic Model\nibgs | Consider a society of N voters i equals one through N where many binary collective decisions arise. To create the opportunity for market trade, each voter is endowed with a large stock of \"voice credits\" that they may spend influencing the outcome of\ncolo | these decisions. As is common in the analysis of markets for private goods, we assume there are enough issues and that each is sufficiently inconsequential that every voter has a quasi-linear \"continuation value\" for retaining voice credits for future votes. As in the theory of fair resource allocation, we assume that voice credits have been distributed in a manner considered fair by the relevant society in the sense that maximizing total equivalent continuation value in units of voice credits defines social optimality.\nd6r4 | Consider some particular decision. Call the value that voters would receive, in units of voice credits, for seeing alternative A prevail over alternative B u, with negative values indicating a preference for B over A. The community votes to determine which alternative is implemented, with each voter choosing a continuous number of votes v either positive or negative depending on which alternative she favors. A is implemented just when the sum of votes is greater than or equal to zero. Each voter pays a cost c of v voice credits for her votes where c is differentiable, convex, even and strictly increasing in the absolute value of v to a central clearing house. We describe c as a vote pricing rule.\n9mrz | A game-theoretic analysis would specify beliefs of each voter about the distribution of values and derive an equilibrium strategy. We conduct such an analysis, which involves narrow assumptions about beliefs and behavior and statistical subtleties, elsewhere. We focus here instead on a price-taking approximation that appears to be valid more broadly and shows simply the core logic.\npk06 | We thus assume that each voter, in deciding how many votes to purchase, weighs the marginal cost of an additional vote against the perceived chance the vote will be pivotal in swinging the election. The price-taking assumption we adopt, originally proposed by Mueller and Laine, is that all voters agree on this marginal pivotality of votes p. Under this assumption, a rational voter will choose v to maximize two p v u minus c of v. By our assumption that vote credits are distributed fairly, society wishes to implement A exactly when the sum of u is greater than zero. We say a vote pricing rule is robustly optimal if, for every p greater than zero, N and vector u, each price-taking voter i chooses votes v so that it has the same sign as the sum of u.\n7wn9 | Two. Uniqueness\nwcd0 | Our main result is that the set of robustly optimal vote pricing rules are precisely the set of quadratic rules.\ncaos | THEOREM ONE: A vote pricing rule is robustly optimal if and only if it is quadratic.\nqrvy | PROOF:\npn9j | See our online Appendix.\n1pmc | two p u equals a of V a one equals\n5z6q | one equals sign parentheses four parentheses two a minus one U i a minus one one\nyeoh | If a equals two this leads to v proportional to u; and thus robust optimality. For any other a, v is not proportional to u and thus the costly voting rule will be suboptimal for some arrangements of values and p.\nb8hf | In contrast, consider the extremes of a approaches one (as voting cost approaches linear) and a approaches infinity (as voting cost becomes very convex). In the former case, the power on u determining v becomes infinite and thus voters with only slightly greater values will vote infinitely more. Linear voting thus leads to dictatorship of the most intense voter, as in Casella et al. This reflects the common intuition against vote trading: allowing it will lead to capture by the most intense special interests.",
