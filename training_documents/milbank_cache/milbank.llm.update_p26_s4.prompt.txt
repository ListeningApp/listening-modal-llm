You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

7w7j | The question of sustainability does arise, however. A longer-term and more broad-based commitment by research sponsors is needed to support the field's continued flourishing. This is most likely to occur if public health law researchers spend time educating sponsors and policymakers as to the significance of the problems that the field addresses as well as researchers' ability to provide useful, credible answers. Empirical research examining how research influences policy has emphasized the importance of the relationships between researchers and their audiences (Lavis, Moynihan, et al. 2008). We hope that over time, law and policy studies will become seen as a core component of all public health research solicitations, in the way that ethics is increasingly viewed in the context of genomic, cancer, and other population health research.
51vd | Identifying Data Sources
baj1 | Although a wide array of data sets on health risk exposures, health behaviors, and health outcomes are available, data on health laws are much harder to find (Hadfield 2006; Heise 1999; Mello and Zeiler 2008). Unlike many other areas of public health research, research on public health law and policy has developed few surveillance systems (Brownson et al. 2006; McGowan et al. 2003). Gathering information
n1wo | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health
5bq3 | about the patterns of public health law adoption and implementation across states and local governments over time generally is done de novo in each research project.
ezla | Maintaining and updating databases of laws would dramatically im- prove researchers' ability to conduct rigorous policymaking, mapping, intervention, implementation, and mechanism studies at low cost. High standards of transparency concerning the data-collection and coding pro- tocols for such databases would allow subsequent researchers to update publicly available data sets at reasonable marginal cost. In the few in- stances in which such databases have been made available-for example, Ronen Avraham's contribution of a database of state tort reforms, funded by the National Science Foundation (Avraham 2006)-researchers have quickly made them the gold standard source of data in that area of research.
rsbu | Such examples point to three steps that would help bridge the data gap in PHLR. First, research sponsors need to provide funding to com- pile databases. Second, database architects need to develop and share systematic protocols for finding and classifying relevant laws and reg- ulations. These protocols are best developed in consultation with other researchers in the field so that definitions and typologies are widely recognized as appropriate and suitable for use in other studies. Third, databases need to be made publicly available and easy to locate online.
magd | A final step that would contribute to the available data resources for PHLR is better linkages between researchers and public and private holders of relevant data. Hospitals and clinics, public health agencies, insurance companies, and product manufacturers are just some of the en- tities that hold a treasure trove of data relevant to PHLR. Building trust with these data holders, so that they feel confident that the informa- tion they share will be appropriately safeguarded and research findings responsibly reported, takes time and care but is well worth the effort. The widespread adoption of standard protocols for using, protecting, and reporting proprietary data could help establish trust, but much will remain dependent on carefully cultivated personal relationships.
tb74 | Promoting Policymakers' Use of PHLR Findings
8l69 | The greatest challenge confronting PHLR is an all-too-common one in research: rigorous research may be relevant to policy in theory but
1jyv | too often is neither salient nor useful to policymakers and advocates in practice. The elements of the problem are well documented. Researchers are often isolated from the policy process and disconnected from poli- cymakers and public health practitioners, making it difficult for them to identify salient topics for study and to produce knowledge that can both respond to policymakers' concerns and drive policy agendas to- ward evidence-based innovation (Brownson, Chriqui, and Stamatakis 2009). Academics tend to follow their own interests and, in policymak- ers' eyes, often do not successfully anticipate where policy agendas will be in the short and medium terms (Jewell and Bero 2008). Rigorous research-not to mention peer review and publication-takes time, but policy actors need information when they need it. Even when results are available, a lack of understanding of policymakers' perspectives, time constraints, and level of scientific literacy hampers researchers' ability to craft research reports that are likely to be read and understood by the policy and practice communities (Jewell and Bero 2008). For their part, policymakers report being overwhelmed by the volume of information presented to them, particularly the quantity of dense, detailed mate- rial (Sorian and Baugh 2002). State legislators face particular challenges owing to their lack of research training, the breadth of issues about which they must become knowledgeable, the short timelines involved, the high turnover of legislators and legislative staff, and the leanness of legislators' staff and resources (Jewell and Bero 2008).
olce | Solutions, like the problems, are not unique to PHLR (Greenhalgh et al. 2004; Mitton et al. 2007). Transferring knowledge from research to policy generally requires careful attention to a set of key questions: What is the precise information to be transmitted? Who exactly are the targets? Who are the best messengers? What media can most effectively be used to transfer the knowledge? For what purposes, exactly, is the information likely to be used (Lavis et al. 2003)?
erx1 | Commentators emphasize the importance of ongoing contact between research producers and research consumers (Innvaer et al. 2002; Lavis, Moynihan, et al. 2008). Systematic reviews are repeatedly identified as an effective strategy for distilling a large amount of evidence into a us- able form (Community Guide 2009; Fielding and Briss 2006; Jewell and Bero 2008; Lavis et al. 2003; Moulton et al. 2009; RWJF 2009; Sweet and Moynihan 2007). Policy briefs and other translational materials should be geared to the recipient and should "concretize impact"-that is, delineate specific benefits, harms, and costs, including the specific
b3bt | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health
0w8m | populations affected, and how particular policy strategies can alter them (Jewell and Bero 2008; Sorian and Baugh 2002). Nor does the entire responsibility lie with researchers. Effective practices have also been iden- tified for organizations engaged in knowledge transfer (Lavis, Oxman, et al. 2008).
vcu3 | Training and mentorship within the field can move PHLR toward these practices, as can hands-on experience when researchers spend time working in policy settings. But there are no panaceas here. Even when research findings are effectively communicated to policymakers, a variety of forces can get in the way of policymakers' ability and willingness to translate evidence into policy proposals. Among these are the influence of interest groups, the power of anecdotes that contradict research findings, force of habit, cultural norms and values, and political compromises and expediency (Brownson, Chriqui, and Stamatakis 2009; Brownson et al. 2006; Jewell and Bero 2008).
