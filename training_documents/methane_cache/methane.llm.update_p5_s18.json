        "content": "d52l | Cavities two and three are linked, but are only connected with cavity one, which is next to the diiron active site, when MMOB is bound to MMOH. A number of crystal structures with bound xenon, halogenated alkanes, and product alcohols have been obtained. The substrate analogues dibromomethane, iodoethane, and xenon bind in cavities two and three. Along with methanol and ethanol, the product analogues two-bromoethanol, three-chloropropanol, and three-bromobutenol bind in cavities one through three and can bridge the diiron center, replacing a bound water molecule. These structures are consistent with optical, resonance Raman, magnetic circular dichroism, electron nuclear double resonance, and EPR spectroscopic data showing that substrates and products can affect the diiron site. However, recent time-resolved resonance Raman data indicate that the product alcohol does not bind directly to the diiron center. Access to the active site cavity from cavities two and three is mediated by conformational changes in two residues, Leu one hundred ten and Phe one hundred eighty-eight, which form a gate. The functional relevance of this chain of cavities to the catalytic cycle remains controversial, however. Finally, an approximately ten angstrom long hydrophilic pathway called the pore region is present and may\nqlbb | Biochemistry\nnhsg | function in alcohol and water release as well as play a role in proton transfer.\nhy0l | Particulate MMO. Because of difficulties isolating stable and active purified samples of pMMO, the enzyme kinetics have not been investigated thoroughly. Assays are further complicated by the use of different reductants, including NADH and duroquinol for isolated membranes, duroquinol for purified pMMO, and formate for whole cells. For isolated M. capsulatus Bath membranes, of which pMMO is the main component (such preparations are referred to as membrane-bound pMMO and can sometimes be crystallized upon solubilization without further purification), methane oxidation activities are in the range of twenty-five to one hundred thirty nanomoles per minute per milligram, depending on the preparation and reductant. Assuming that these samples are eighty percent pMMO, a turnover number in the range of three to sixteen per minute can be estimated. For propylene, membrane-bound pMMO activities are sixteen to one hundred twenty-three nanomoles per minute per milligram, giving an estimated turnover number of two to fifteen per minute. For purified M. capsulatus Bath pMMO, specific activities of seventeen to one hundred sixty nanomoles per minute per milligram for propylene have been reported, corresponding to turnover numbers of zero point one seven to sixteen per minute. Lower activities of two to twenty-three nanomoles per minute per milligram have been obtained for membrane-bound pMMO samples from M. trichosporium OB3b, Methylocystis sp. strain M, and Methylocystis sp. strain Rockwell, with very little activity after solubilization and purification. The whole cell M. trichosporium OB3b pMMO Vmax is eighty-two to three hundred nanomoles per minute per milligram total protein (measured by methane consumption), which corresponds to a turnover number of thirty to one hundred fifty per minute, assuming twenty percent of the total protein is pMMO. Similar Vmax values were measured by propylene epoxidation for whole cells of M. capsulatus Bath pMMO. Thus, preserving pMMO activity upon removal from the membranes remains an important issue. Apparent pMMO Km values for methane have been reported in the range of one to sixty-two micromolar. Notably, some methanotrophs, including Methylocystis sp. strain SC two, can produce a high affinity pMMO with a much lower apparent Km for methane. The molecular basis for this enhanced methane affinity is not known.\n4jmz | pMMO has a much narrower substrate range than sMMO and can oxidize only C one to C five n-alkanes and terminal alkenes to two-alcohols and one, two-epoxides. Analysis of the pMMO structures reveals a cavity at the proposed dicopper active site as well as a second cavity extending to the zinc binding site. However, the functional relevance of these cavities remains unclear due to the moderate resolution of the pMMO structures and the lack of structures in the presence of substrates and products or analogues thereof. A hydrophobic pocket the size of pentane in the pmoA subunit has also been identified computationally but is not near any of crystallographically observed metal binding sites. The narrow substrate specificity of pMMO and its ability to selectively orient substrates to produce R-alcohols suggests that a fairly restricted cavity must be present at the active site. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of the Mycobacterium NBB four HMO suggest that residue Ala one hundred fifty-one, which is equivalent to pmoC Asp one hundred sixty-six in M. capsulatus Bath pMMO, is important for determining substrate specificity. This residue lies at the interface of pmoB and pmoC, about eight angstroms from the dicopper center, and could modulate the sizes of the aforementioned cavities. Notably, AMO has a much broader substrate specificity, but there are no crystal structures of AMO, and the molecular basis for this difference remains unclear.\nb7cq | Current Topic\n0b39 | Protein-protein interactions",
