You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

dfzb | I have black eyes and hair. As you can tell from my last name you should know that I am Chinese. ... I was born in Taiwan and moved to Costa Rica when I was in grade two. Later when I was in grade four I moved to Canada. (Sarah Huang)
u6ty | . You probably wouldn't know that [I] am Chinese. I have one of the strangest names in the world, but at least if someone asked, "Where's Sterling?" nobody would say, "Sterling who?" (Sterling Tan)
awvu | What lessons should the school be teaching, I wondered, about the his- torical depth and intricacy of the great divide that these students continue to live out? How might it help them understand the histories carried in these innocent acts of self-identification? It was not that the question of identity
on9b | was missing from the school curriculum. Students have long had lessons on who is and who is not a member of this imagined community known as Canada.4 These lessons do their share to make each student, in effect, "a pr√©- cis of all the past," as Antonio Gramsci framed it: "For each individual is the synthesis not only of existing relations, but the history of these relations" (1971, P. 353). A strong source of light that the schools can throw on "the his- tory of these relations," I argue, is found in reviewing imperialism's educa- tional project.
a8ge | One student in Kathy's class framed her identity in terms of ethnicity- "My ethnic background is Chinese but I was born in Vancouver and have lived here all my life" (Karen Yu)-yet there is still the strength of the con- trast, established by her use of "but," of her Chinese background and her life in Vancouver.5 The Kiplingesque division between East and West remains firmly a part of this city's vision of itself as the gateway to the Asian Pacific, a city in which half of the students speak English as their second language. Al- though the city is often given to celebrating its multiculturalism, the news- paper boxes a few blocks from Kathy Chin's school are occasionally defaced with "Chinks go home," and stickers placed on telephone poles in a local sub- urb at one point read, "Save a Young Mind, Stop Multiculturalism." The city's leading newspaper has run headlines on the order of "Immigrants Form Pool for Disease, Doctors Say" and "Cost of Providing ESL [English as a Sec- ond Language] Classes Is Eating Up the Education Dollar." Clearly, the graf- fiti would be a lot easier to deal with-as messages of misguided hate and ig- norance-if they did not appear to be underwritten at times by the city's newspapers and doctors.6
h27a | Of course, there were also students in Kathy's class who did not appear to have to face such issues:
pdjh | I am 15 (turning 16 on April 7) with blonde hair and blue eyes. I'm pretty short. I was captain of the cheerleading squad for a football team. (Susan Harris)
xmgs | Hello, my name is James Statley. I live in Vancouver, British Columbia. I like sports a lot. I hate school. (Jim Statley)
bd9h | My name is Robert Campbell, and I am a Libra. (Robert Campbell)
m047 | It would seem that the play of race and ethnicity in identity is not necessar- ily everyone's affair, and this, too, signifies a gap in the students' education. All students need to understand the historical legacy of these self-identifica- tions. They need to see how it is that white is a color that need not name it- self. No one makes this more apparent than the antiracist educator Peggy MacIntosh when she speaks of the "invisible weightless knapsack" of white privilege, out of which she pulls some twenty-six instances, including, "I can be sure that my children will be given curricular materials that testify to the existence of their race," and, "I am never asked to speak for all the people of my racial group" (1990, p. 35). MacIntosh's last point strikes home all the more as this speaking-for-my-race is what I've done on behalf of Kathy Chin and her classmates, just as they have used this racial/ethnic identification out of a sense of history for which I am holding education accountable in this book.
gy8c | The real issue is obviously not how Kathy and her classmates chose to identify themselves. My concern is with whether the schools can do more to help the young understand the educational formation of worldly divisions that carry with them a profound sense of who belongs where. The postimpe- rial migration of people around the world today poses profound challenges to what we once knew and assumed of the world. Just as the changes involve Kathy Chin, I would argue, so also they include, and must become a part of the education of, her classmate Robert Campbell. He also needs to under- stand how the community he lives in is changing as part of a history that has long involved the sort of dislocations that first brought the Scots to Canada even as they displaced the people who had lived here for thousands of years before that. Imperialism does not tell the whole of students' stories, but it does figure in what they will learn of the world.
y4mj | The Canadian literary critic Northrop Frye, whose work I focus on in chapter 9, wisely commented that that great identity question "Where is
vpgq | here?" was less perplexing than "Who am I?" (1971a, p. 220). The geoidentity question "Where is here?"-which in Matthew Arnold's "Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse" takes the form "And what am I, that I am here?" (1895, I. 66)-does have a way of linking our various histories as indigenes, colonials, immigrants, expatriates, tourists, citizens, refugees, and displaced persons. It is easy to see that many of the disputes that threaten the future of Canada, as well as those that concern broader questions of national identity, are about the nature of "here."
ousl | What Imperialism?
m4ju | The Columbus quincentenary, celebrated a few year ago, was staged as a great marketing opportunity for blockbuster art shows and epic movies, yet for many the event amounted to what performance artist Guillermo G√≥mez- Pe√±a called "a dance on the wound of history."7 It was also a grim reminder of how students in the West have long been asked to honor the inflicting of that wound. We might take the familiar classroom mnemonic "In fourteen hundred and ninety-two / Columbus sailed the ocean blue" as proof of how Columbus has long been at the heart of what it means to be schooled. A new account, if not a new rhyme, of imperialism's misadventures, which has been long overdue in the schools, has begun to be written for the classroom, as I will point out presently. What also needs to be reviewed is imperialism's record of learned achievements, which was to shape our modern sensibility.
a0mb | Such accounts need to begin with the often-taught pursuits of the Por- tuguese along the coast of Africa, Columbus in the Caribbean, the Spanish in America, Cabot and Raleigh across the Atlantic and their countrymen in India, the Dutch in Southeast Asia, and later the Germans in Africa and the Americans in the Pacific. They need to include imperialism's influence through Europe's age of exploration and the Renaissance, the founding of colonies and the Enlightenment, the opening of the Pacific and the rise of Romanticism, the Victorian age and the scramble for Africa. They need to confront a trade in human beings that forced 12 million people from sub- Saharan Africa on a deadly journey into slavery in the Western Hemisphere. They need to address the devastation of indigenous populations through mil- itary campaigns, economic exploitation, and the spread of epidemics. They also need to consider the encyclopedic project of mapping and naming all
ki8m | that the world contained, bringing it within a single system of thought. They need to realize the spread of education from the missionary schools of the New World to the universities of Japan.
km8w | Of course, the label "European imperialism" does not in any sense rep- resent a systematic movement, a sustained campaign, or a coherent body of thought. Nowhere is this more clear than with the British Empire. Although by the turn of this century the empire encompassed more than one-quarter of the world's people, the British liked to think that it had been acquired over a five-century period in a "fit of absence of mind," as the British historian John Seeley put it in the last century (1884, p. 10). The empire was made up of a makeshift assortment of Crown colonies, white dominions, mandates, naval bases, trading ports, and the unique Indian raj. To name what was common to all of these arrangements is difficult, and so the term imperialism will have to operate as a loosely conceived historical phenomenon that covers a myriad of ventures directed at extending the dominion of Europe around the globe.8
wzno | At the risk, then, of lending too much coherence to the forces of Euro- pean imperialism and of seeming to belittle the violence and injustice that ac- companied the exploits of these "gentlemanly capitalists," as they have been characterized, this book focuses on the activities that were conducted in the name of imperialism's intellectual interests, which I take to be its educational project.9 Beginning in earnest during the eighteenth century, the research and development arm of imperialism was gradually staffed by increasingly pro- fessional cadres of geologists, naturalists, astronomers, ethnographers, phi- losophers, historians, geographers, painters, and poets (many of them holding day jobs as sailors, soldiers, missionaries, and bureaucrats). The whole thing resulted in a Victorian "obsession with gathering and ordering information," as Thomas Richards describes it, that was closely connected to the "adminis- trative core" of the British Empire through such educational institutions as the British Museum, the Royal Society, the Royal Geographic Society, the Royal Botanical Gardens, and the India Survey, as well as the universities (1993, p. 9). It produced an imaginary "imperial archive," in Richards's
xagm | terms, which amounted to "a fantasy of knowledge collected in the service of state and empire" that was thought capable of turning the world into a com- prehensive order (p. 6). It was the duty and pleasure of these learned men and women, as this book will detail, to make the whole of the world coherent for the West by bringing all we knew of it within the imperial order of things. So it was that this order dictated all that future generations were going to learn of the world.
iwn5 | Today, that order may seem to be a thing of the past. The great colonial empires collapsed after the Second World War, undone by the politics of self- determination, the cold war, and transnational capitalism. A hundred nations were born, legalized segregation was declared unconstitutional in America, apartheid was finally ended in South Africa, and the Soviet Union was broken up. Transnational capital remains a global force, an imperialism of a differ- ent order, that extends beyond the scope of this book, which is taken up with the particular manifestations of the colonial legacy.10 Yet the West is still deal- ing directly with the colonial legacy on a number of fronts. Consider Aus- tralia, where Aborigines' land claims met with considerable resistance until, only recently, the courts corrected one of colonialism's great myths by con- ceding that the British had not found a terra nullius, that is, an unoccupied land, when they first arrived (Milliken, 1993). In Canada, the Quebecois and First Nations peoples are each still working on forming postcolonial associa- tions within or apart from the dominion (and are often at odds with each other in this struggle). The First Nations peoples in Canada do not hesitate to speak of a "colonialism on trial" in addressing unsettled land claims now be- fore the courts (Monet and Skanu'U, 1992).
uooz | In America, the legacy persists in a deepening of the "color line," with increasing segregation in schools and discrimination in health care ("Race," 1993; "Segregation's Threat," 1993). Bob Herbert (1995) writes in the New York Times of "a besieged black population" facing restricted voting rights, dimin-
pxbq | WHERE IS HERE?
jfsr | ished affirmative action, education, and job training opportunities, and cur- tailed support for the poor (largely the black poor) in housing, health, and food. For Herbert, the "increasingly harrowing times" that face the African American people bear "the foul legacy of 200 years of slavery and nearly a century and half of violent and grotesque racism." Meanwhile, a rising na- tivism uses the specter of an "immigration crisis" to advocate restrictive leg- islation for newcomers and a pitting of one minority group against another (Rayner, 1996; F. R. Lee, 1993). "The Asian invasion" (and its variations) whether in the New Yorker or in Sports Illustrated, is just one of the racial clich√©s that have returned to prominence (W. Wong, 1994). Immigration also preoccupies Europe, with its internal colonization of guest workers facing a rising xenophobia that sustains, for example, the demand for blood citizen- ship in Germany and talk of a fortress Europe, which, having made so much of the world, now closes its door to it.11
u15r | Beyond the economic and political legacy of the colonial era, the West has also been busy producing a colonial nostalgic that speaks to the lost style and seeming grace of those heady days. The African Queen, A Passage to India, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Indochine are but a few films serving up a fascina- tion with the exotic, with Walt Disney making it a speciality. Disney's Aladdin perpetuates the charmingly despotic Eastern other in a cartoonish oriental- ism, and The Jungle Book and Pocahontas extend the characterizations of this colorful period (Karim, 1993). Red Rose tea announces that its company's agents "comb the backwaters of Ceylon (sic), India, and Africa in search of the most treasured tea leaves" for "tea that means the world to you." Colo- nial imagery wafts through the perfume ads for Ralph Lauren's "Safari," and the New York Times spread on "Indo-Chic," with fashions by Chanel and Ar- mani, was shot in Vietnam, one "of the rare places where one can still expe- rience true glamour. . . . There's something otherworldly about the place" (O'Neill, 1993). For the home, colonial nostal-chic can be had from Domain Home Fashions: "No one went farther to make themselves comfortable than the British," its ad explains. "From the West Indies to East India, their tradi- tional furnishings were enriched by the tropical cultures of the colonies, and now you can reclaim this adventurous and romantic era for yourself. . . . After all, it's your empire."
lq35 | But if our empire has left us with the rewards of (former) membership, it has also left us with liabilities of an educational nature. Imperialism afforded lessons in how to divide the world. It taught people to read the exotic, prim- itive, and timeless identity of the other, whether in skin color, hair texture, or the inflections of taste and tongue. Its themes of conquering, civilizing, converting, collecting, and classifying inspired educational metaphors equally concerned with taking possession of the world-metaphors that we now have to give an account of, beginning with our own education.
