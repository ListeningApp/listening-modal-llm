You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

jc47 | Flowers are also sometimes visited just as a conve- nient habitat, often simply because they offer an equa- ble sheltered microclimate for a small animal to rest in, a place that is somewhat protected against bad weather, predators, or parasitoids. Or flowers may of- fer a reliable meeting site for mates or hosts or prey, or for females an oviposition site providing shelter for eggs and larvae. More rarely they are used as a warm- ing-up site by insects in cold climates, usually because the flowers trap some incoming solar radiation, which enhances their own ovule development, but occasion- ally because a few flowers can achieve some metabolic thermogenesis that warms their own tissues (chapter 9 will provide more details on this topic).
ko3c | 3. How Do Flowers Encourage Animal Visitors?
xek3 | Many plant attributes contribute to attraction of visi- tors: J. Thomson (1983) usefully groups these as plant presentation. Some of these attributes are readily ap- parent to visitors, and these may be features of indi- vidual flowers (e.g., color, shape, scent, reward avail- ability, or time of flowering) or features of whole plants or groups of plants (e.g., flower density, flower num- ber, flower height, or spatial pattern). The more readily apparent plant presentation traits can be divided into attractants (advertising signals), dealt with mainly in chapters 5 and 6, which discuss visual and olfactory signals, and rewards (usually foodstuffs), dealt with in chapters 7-9. Aspects of the timing and spacing of flowers, and how these might be affected by competi- tion between different flowering plants, are given more in-depth treatments in chapters 21 and 22.
bbpr | Other floral attributes are more cryptic to the visitor and may only determine the reproductive success of the plant in the longer term; these might include pollen amounts, ovule numbers, the genetic structure of the plant population, the presence and type of incompat- ibility system, etc.
5zyf | It is generally in the plant's interest to support and even improve its visitors' efficiency, encouraging them to go to more flowers of the same species (so ensuring that only conspecific pollen is taken and received) and to go to flowers with fresh pollen available and/or with receptive stigmas for pollen to be deposited upon. Many flowers therefore add signals of status to their repertoire, via color change, odor change, or even shape change. Visitors are thereby directed away from flowers that are too young or too old or already polli- nated. Instead they will tend to concentrate their ef- forts on those (fewer) flowers per plant that are most in need of visitation, thus also being encouraged to move around between separate plants more often and to en- sure outcrossing rather than selfing. Reasons for fa- voring breeding by outcrossing (i.e., with other plants) are covered more fully in chapter 3.
9own | 4. What Makes a Visitor into a Good Pollinator?
bqfb | In many ways this is the crucial theme running through this book. It relates to what is probably the major
wwdt | current debate in pollination ecology, that is, to what extent pollination it is a generalist process and to what extent it is a specialist one. Pollination has in the past nearly always been categorized in terms of syndromes, with particular groups of flowers recognized as hav- ing particular sets of characteristics (of color and scent, shape, timing, reward, etc.) that suit them to be visited by particular kinds of animals; and it is im- plicit in this approach that these suites have often been arrived at and selected for by convergent evolution in plant families that are unrelated. Thus most authors have used terms such as ornithophily to describe the bird pollination syndrome, or psychophily for the butterfly pollination syndrome. Flower characteristics would be listed that fit each syndrome, and an unfa- miliar flower's probable pollinators could therefore be predicted. Flowers in each category were seen as hav- ing a degree of specialization that suited them to their particular visitors, with some syndromes being more specialized than others. Nearly all earlier works on pollination were organized around this theme of syn- dromes, and it served as a useful structure for under- standing animal-flower interactions for nearly two centuries. Without knowing this background it would be nearly impossible to follow the current debates that are a major focus for pollination ecologists, and it would also be very difficult to structure the informa- tion on flower attractants and flower rewards in chap- ters 5-9. This book thus retains a syndrome-based ap- proach throughout its early chapters and explicitly considers the evidence in support of a syndrome ap- proach in chapter 11; then it unashamedly covers each of the syndromes in turn in chapters 12-19, providing all the core materials on which later criticisms might be based.
mn1r | The criticisms and debates focus around the reality of syndromes and how far they have been overplayed in the previous literature, perhaps blinkering or bias- ing our perceptions. Many authors now regard flower pollination as a much more generalized phenomenon, where most flowers get many different kinds of visi- tors and have not been and are not being heavily se- lected to specialize for the needs of one particular "best" visitor. This approach is specifically addressed in chapter 20. It will be a major argument there that the issue has been clouded by an as yet insufficient dis- tinction between flower visitors and pollinators. So what does make a visitor into a good pollinator?
5vqw | Physical Factors
meyw | Any animal that is to be an effective pollinator must have the ability to passively pick up pollen as its body moves past the anthers of a flower that it visits and carry that pollen to another flower. Normally this will be aided by the animal being a good physical fit in terms of size and shape, so that in alighting on the flower surface, or when inserting its tongue or beak of appropriate length, some specific part of its body touches the anther. Additionally pollen pickup and car- riage will be aided if the animal has appropriate sur- face structures; pollen adheres well to feathers, fur, and hairy or scaly surfaces in insects but does not get transported well on shiny or waxy surfaces (and may even be damaged by certain surface secretions). Hence a small shiny beetle taking some nectar by crawling into the lower surface of a large tubular corolla where the anthers are in the corolla roof may well be a regu- lar visitor to that flower but is unlikely to be an effec- tive mover of its pollen; in effect, it is acting as a "cheat" as far as the flower is concerned and may be termed an illegitimate visitor.
2e62 | Behavioral Factors
75y3 | Different animals land on and forage at flowers in very different fashions. There are many aspects of behavior that will affect whether a given animal is going to be a good pollinator. Pollinators will seldom have a com- plete perception of all the aspects of plant presentation mentioned above, but they will respond to at least some of them in ways that are useful to the plant:
