In one classic eighteen eighty-two example, Louis Pasteur designated half of a group of fifty sheep as controls and vaccinated the other half. All animals then received a lethal dose of anthrax. Two days after inoculation, every one of the twenty-five control sheep were dead whereas the twenty-five vaccinated sheep were alive and well!\ne8nr | However, many economists have long been pessimistic that an experimental approach could offer such vivid illustrations of cause and effect in their field. For example, Samuelson and Nordhaus wrote in their introductory economics textbook a quarter-century ago:\nk78w | The economic world is extremely complicated. There are millions of people and firms, thousands of prices and industries. One possible way of figuring out economic laws in such a setting is by controlled experiments. A controlled experiment takes place when everything else but the item under investigation is held constant. Thus a scientist trying to determine whether saccharine causes cancer in rats will hold \"other things equal\" and only vary the amount of saccharine. Same air, same light, same type of rat.\ng9du | Economists have no such luxury when testing economic laws. They cannot perform the controlled experiments of chemists or biologists because they cannot easily control other important factors. Like astronomers or meteorologists, they generally must be content largely to observe.\nf682 | In my own travels, I have often found similar skepticism. However, such skepticism has become more muted in recent decades as experimental methods have found a foothold in economics. In fact, complications that are difficult to understand or control represent a key reason to conduct a field experiment rather than a reason for skepticism. This is because field experiments use randomization as an instrumental variable, balancing the unobserved variables across the treated and control states.\nli1k | In this introduction to the symposium, I first offer an overview of the spectrum of experimental methods in economics, from laboratory experiments to the field experiments that are the subject of this symposium. I then offer some thoughts about the potential gains from doing economic research using field experiments and my own mental checklist of fourteen steps to improve the chances of carrying out an economics field experiment successfully.\npbea | The Spectrum of Experimentation in Economics\nccpt | Within economics, much experimental research has taken the form of laboratory experiments in which student volunteers gather in a research lab to make decisions. This work draws on the legacy of Vernon Smith, who shared the two thousand two Nobel Prize in economics for, in the words of the Nobel committee, \"having established laboratory experiments as a tool in empirical economic analysis, especially in the study of alternative market mechanisms.\" Work using laboratory experiments has offered a variety of insights. For example, Smith's research illustrated the robustness of market mechanisms in reaching an equilibrium price, showed the effect of institutions on allocations, and explored the formation and dissolution of asset bubbles in markets, among other lessons.\n0fpw | However, results in laboratory economics are inevitably subject to questions over the extent to which they generalize to non-laboratory settings. One concern is that such experiments are often done with college students as subjects. During my time in two thousand two to two thousand three at the Council of Economic Advisers, as I was urging my colleagues to take account of certain laboratory experimental results in our revisions of the Federal Benefit/Cost Guidelines, an official from the White House responded with some phrases that have been etched in my mind ever since: \"even though these results appear prevalent, they are suspiciously drawn . . . by methods similar to scientific numerology . . . because of students . . . who are not real people.\"\ndqn8 | A natural response to this concern is the \"artefactual field experiment,\" which mimics a lab experiment except that it uses \"nonstandard\" subjects, in the sense that the subjects are not students, but participants drawn from the market of interest.\ncop0 | Drawing from the Oxford English Dictionary, Glenn Harrison and I adopted the term \"artefactual\" to denote such studies—meaning that they are an empirical approach created by the experimenter that is artificial or synthetic in certain dimensions. In the past decade, artefactual field experiments have been fruitfully used in financial applications, public economics, environmental economics, and industrial organization, and to test predictions of game theory. In my own work, I have invited participants as varied as chief executive officers, farmers, traders from the Chicago Board of Trade and other trading outfits, as well as politicians into the laboratory for experiments. Similar work has been done more recently within development economics, where scholars have taken the laboratory tools to the field and examined behavior in a controlled setting. For instance, Henrich looked at ultimatum games and dictator games in fifteen different countries; Cardenas used a game that involved paying for common goods in dozens of rural communities in Colombia; and Carpenter, Daniere, and Takahashi generated data from a game that involves making contributions to a public good in Vietnam and Thailand.\nlhkq | Of course, a plausible concern about laboratory experiments in economics, whether the participants are students or others, is the extent to which the results are influenced by the laboratory setting. A \"framed field experiment\" resolves such issues by conducting a structured experiment in the natural environment of the subject rather than in the laboratory. Glenn Harrison and I denoted it \"framed\" because the research experiment is framed in the field context of the commodity, task, stakes, or information set of the subjects. Social experiments are a type of framed field experiment in that subjects are aware that they are taking part in an experiment and in many cases understand that their experience is for research purposes. In Europe, early social experiments included electricity pricing schemes in Great Britain in the late nineteen sixties.\n82ju | The first wave of social experiments in the United States began in earnest in the late nineteen sixties and included government agencies' attempts to evaluate programs by deliberate variations in policies. Other prominent social experiments include the negative income tax experiments done in four main groups across the United States in the nineteen seventies, which looked at how labor supply responded to a gradual phase-out of welfare benefits; the RAND health insurance experiments in the nineteen seventies, which examined how households responded to different levels of copayments and deductibles in their health insurance; the experiments with work requirements for welfare recipients in the nineteen eighties and early nineteen nineties; and the Moving to Opportunity experiment in the nineteen nineties and two thousands, in which some welfare recipients were given the option of moving to non-poverty neighborhoods. These\ny2qo | experiments have had an important influence on policy and have generated much academic debate.\n1piq | Framed field experiments have also been used in smaller-scale settings. Peter Bohm was an early experimenter to depart from traditional laboratory economics methods with an experiment on the willingness to pay for a public good—in this case, a highly anticipated new television show that was being broadcast on Sweden's one television station in nineteen sixty-nine. While Bohm's work touched off an interesting stream of research within environmental and resource economics, for reasons I cannot guess, the broader economics literature did not quickly follow Bohm's lead to pursue research outside of the typical lab experiment.\n7fqw | Of course, a plausible concern is that when subjects know they are participating in an experiment, whether as part of an experimental group or as part of a control group, they may react to that knowledge in a way that leads to bias in the results. A \"natural field experiment\" occurs in the environment where the subjects are naturally undertaking certain tasks, and where the subjects do not know that they are participants in an experiment. Such an experiment combines the most attractive elements of the experimental method and naturally occurring data: randomization and realism.\n```",
