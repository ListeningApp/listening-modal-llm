You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

fim0 | 3 Indicators for safe operations of hydrogen in pore storage systems
ojro | There are recommendations and evaluation schemes for the geotechnical and energetic use of the subsurface on a German and European level based on the operation of hydrocarbon reservoirs, underground storage facilities for both natural gas and CO2, the search for radioactive repositories and the utilization of geothermal resources (e.g., Sedlacek, 1999a; Sedlacek, 1999b; Chadwick et al., 2008; Reinhold et al., 2011; Alfarra et al., 2020; Stober and Bucher, 2021). Here we report positive and cautionary indicators for safe operations with hydrogen in underground pore storage systems based on a literature survey. The results are summarized in Table 1.
l6t9 | 3.1 Biotic and abiotic reactions
1ujy | Depleted fields and aquifers are composed of either sandstones or limestones. Sandstones, consist primarily of stable, non-reactive silicate minerals, namely, quartz and feldspar that will not react with hydrogen at reservoir conditions (Flesch, et al., 2018; Yekta et al., 2018). Major components in limestone reservoirs and mineral accessories in sandstones or in the caprock, however, may form reactions with hydrogen forming toxic gases such as hydrogen sulphide. Possible reactants include carbonate [CaCO3, MgCO3,
qzor | (Ca, Mg) CO3], sulfate (CuSO4, CuSO4H2O), sulphide (S, FeS, FeS2, PbS, HgS, ZnS, Cu2S, CuFeS2, CS2), and oxide (Fe2O3, Fe3O4, FeO, MgO) minerals and reservoir gases such as CO, CO2, and hydrocarbons (Foh et al., 1979). However most of these reactions are insignificant at reservoir conditions, because hydrogen redox reactivity is kinetically limited due to its high bonding energy and thus most of the possible redox reactions remain insignificant at low temperature (Truche et al., 2013; Panfilov, 2016). However, experimental data by Truche et al. (2013) demonstrates that hydrogen induced reduction of pyrite into pyrrhotite is likely to produce sulphide at reservoir conditions and that the pH of the media is a critical parameter controlling the extent of the reaction at low temperature. This is consistent with field observations in the town gas storage field in Beynes, France, where pyrite reduction is believed to be responsible for the observed rise in hydrogen sulphide within the reservoir (Bourgeois et al., 1979). Although this represents a potential risk to underground hydrogen storage, the study by Truche et al. (2013) also shows that pyrite reduction could be prevented at acidic reservoir conditions.
a0by | In contrast to abiotic reactions, the extent and impact of which is discussed in the literature (e.g., Foh et al., 1979; Truche et al., 2010; 2013; Yekta et al., 2018), it is widely agreed that biotic processes may endanger hydrogen quality and/or lead to hydrogen consumption (Šmigáň, et al., 1990; Buzek, et al., 1994; Reitenbach et al., 1995; Panfilov, 2016; Heinemann et al., 2021c; Zivar et al., 2021). Several classes of microorganisms present at reservoir conditions are known for consuming hydrogen, which are methanogens, hydrogenotrophic sulfate reducers, homoacetogens and hydrogenotrophic iron (III)- reducing bacteria (Reitenbach et al., 1995; Panfilov, 2016; Heinemann et al., 2021c). Possible implications might include the production of methane (CH4), acetic acid (CH3COOH), and hydrogen sulphide (H2S) in addition to hydrogen loss (Reitenbach et al., 1995; Panfilov, 2016; Heinemann et al., 2021c). A well-known example for such biotic hydrogen loss is the Czech underground storage facility Lobodice in which methanogens were shown to transform hydrogen and carbon dioxide to methane, resulting in significant hydrogen reduction from 54 vol% (input) to 37 vol% (output) over a time period of 7 months (Šmigáň et al., 1990). Optimum conditions
u1ky | where growth peaks and critical conditions beyond which no growth is possible were summarized for several classes of microorganisms by Heinemann et al. (2021c) showing that most bacteria favour moderate temperatures (20-40℃), salinity (<100 g/L) and pH (6-7.5) [Heinemann et al. (2021c) and references therein].
htm9 | 3.2 Petrophysical properties of prospective pore storage systems
8hul | The petrophysical properties of prospective pore storage systems are important factors to consider when selecting a site for underground gas storage (e.g., Hematpur et al., 2023). It is noteworthy that the optimal porosity and intrinsic permeability values for rock formations utilized in gas storage may vary depending on the specific storage application and the type of gas being stored. For instance, high-pressure storage applications may necessitate higher permeability than low-pressure storage. Other factors such as effective stress state, temperature, and deformation state must also be considered when evaluating the suitability of a rock formation for underground storage.
87vz | Technically in UHS operations, a rock with high porosity and permeability is more desirable for hydrogen storage because it allows for higher storage volumes as well as higher injection and withdrawal rates representing the unloading and loading cycles, respectively. Higher energy efficiencies tend to be expected for high intrinsic permeability rock types when hydrogen is injected into them (Pan et al., 2021a). Furthermore, the hydraulic properties of the reservoir rock are a key factor influencing the interaction between fluid pressure and mechanical properties of the reservoir, known as hydro-mechanical coupling (e.g., Rutqvist and Stephansson, 2003; Bai and Tahmasebi, 2002). The permeability controls the fluid flow and thus the temporal and spatial distribution of fluid pressure, which in turn affects the effective stress state of the reservoir and its mechanical properties. This interaction must be considered and studied in the design and operation of UHS systems, as it can change the security and efficiency of the storage process to a significant degree. Zones of high permeability can reduce the risk of high fluid-pressure transients in the reservoir and around the wells, and thus the risk of inelastic rock deformation. Local high-pressure zones can form within low-permeability rocks, leading to aftershocks and induced seismicity in worst-case scenarios (e.g., Pawar et al., 2015; White and Foxall, 2016). In addition, low-pressure zones in the reservoir and around the wells can lead to a decrease in the production rate.
