You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

pn9j | Just for fun, try placing these words in a pyramid of lower to higher power. Don't think too much; use your intuition.
1pmc | When asked, most people rank these words from more powerful to less powerful as follows:
5z6q | By using the words toward the top of the pyra- mid, we can make many of our questions more robust. For example, consider the following sequence:
yeoh | · Are you satisfied with our working relationship?
b8hf | · When have you been most satisfied with our working relationship?
hntf | . What is it about our working relationship that you find most satisfying?
99fo | . Why might it be that that our working relationship has had its ups and downs?
y5r7 | As you move from the simple "yes/no" question at the beginning toward the "why" question at the end, you'll notice that the queries tend to stimulate more reflective thinking and a deeper level of conversation.
lrry | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
hvhm | That's what we mean by a powerful question-one that provokes thoughtful exploration and evokes cre- ative thinking.
863b | However, a note of caution: Unless a "why" ques- tion is carefully crafted, it can easily evoke a defensive response, as people try to justify their answer rather than proceed in a spirit of inquiry. For instance, the questions, "Why can't you ever tell me exactly what you are thinking?" or "Why did you do it that way?" can cause someone to defend a given position or rationalize some past decision, rather than open new possibilities. In contrast, when a "why" question stems from genuine curiosity, such as "I wonder why that happened?" then the inquiry has the potential to cre- ate useful insights.
fj24 | Just because a question is situated near the top of the pyramid does not necessarily mean that it is more important or more relevant than its counterparts at the bottom. Depending on your goals, a "yes/no" question can be extremely important (particularly if you are clos- ing a large sale!). Likewise, a question that gets at the facts of who, when, and where can often be crucial, such as in a legal case. However, when you want to open the space for creativity and break- through thinking, questions construct- ed around the words at the top of the pyramid will have more strategic lever- age than those that use the words at the bottom.

d5bi | VERNA ALLEE, THE KNOWLEDGE EVOLUTION
ba4l | THE SECOND DIMENSION: The Scope of a Question
ffx8 | It's important not only to be aware of how the words we choose influence the effectiveness of our query, but also to match the scope of a question to our needs. Take a look at the following three questions:
s6su | · How can we best manage our work group?
y219 | · How can we best manage our company?
06ht | · How can we best manage our supply chain?
v3r2 | In this example, the questions progressively broaden the domain of inquiry as they consider larg- er and larger aspects of the system; that is, they
nv42 | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
xags | expand in scope.As you work to make your questions powerful, tailor and clarify the scope as precisely as possible to keep them within the realistic boundaries and needs of the situation you are working with.Avoid stretching the scope of your question too far. For example, compare the following question to the ones above:
jc47 | • How can we best manage the economy?
ko3c | While extremely interesting, this query is clearly outside the scope of most people's capacity to take effective action, at least in the short term. In many sit- uations, this would be a less strategic question than one for which those involved had the capacity to make a more immediate difference.
xek3 | THE THIRD DIMENSION: The Assumptions Within Questions
bbpr | Because of the nature of language, almost all of the questions we pose have assumptions built into them, either explicit or implicit. These assumptions may or may not be shared by the group involved in the exploration; for instance the question, "How should we create a bilin- gual educational system in California?" assumes that those involved in the exploration have agreed that being bilingual is an important capacity for the state's students. However, some powerful ques- tions challenge everyone's existing assumptions. For example, ask yourself what assumptions the following question might challenge: "How might we eliminate the border between the U.S. and Mexico?"
5zyf | To formulate powerful questions, it's important to become aware of assumptions and use them appro- priately. So, contrast the question, "What did we do wrong and who is responsible?" with "What can we learn from what's happened and what possibilities do we now see?" The first question assumes error and blame; it is a safe bet that whoever is responding will feel defensive.The second question encourages reflec- tion and is much more likely than the first query to stimulate learning and collaboration among those involved.
9own | It's often helpful to examine a question for any unconscious beliefs it may introduce to the situation. You can do so by simply asking your team, "What assumptions or beliefs are we holding that are key to the conversation we are having here?" and "How would we come at this if we held an entirely different belief system than the one we have?" Each of these questions invites an exploration into both conscious and unconscious assumptions and opens up the space for new possibilities to reveal themselves.
bqfb | By surfacing or altering assumptions, we can shift the context of a strategic inquiry and create new opportunities for innovation. Compare the following two questions:
wwdt | • How can we compete with the Chinese?
mn1r | · How can we collaborate with the Chinese?
5vqw | The second question changes the context by challenging our traditional busi- ness paradigm and the assumptions that underlie it. As a result, it opens up a new line of exploration and set of subsequent questions. The art of reframing questions in this way has important implications for not only shifting our assumptions, but also creating new possibilities for constructive action.
meyw | By understanding and consciously considering the three dimensions of powerful questions, we can increase the power of the questions we ask and, as a result, increase our ability to generate insights that help shape the future.As with any new skill, the best teacher is experience, and the best coach is a thoughtful listener. We encourage you to experiment with increasing the power of your questions and see what impact you have.
2e62 | For example, in advance of an important meeting or conversation, spend a few minutes with a col- league and write down several questions that are rel- evant to the topic. Rate them in terms of their power. Referring to the three dimensions outlined above, see if you can spot why certain questions are more com- pelling than others. Experiment with changing the construction and scope, to get a feel for how doing so changes the direction of the inquiry. Be sure to exam- ine the assumptions that are embedded in your ques- tions and check to see if they will help or hinder your
75y3 | 6
s2g2 | exploration. Just a few practice sessions will greatly enhance your ability to engage in productive conver- sations stimulated by dynamic questions.
q1q2 | Using Powerful Questions in Organizations
cb7r | There are more and more examples of how the disci- plined use of compelling questions is making a differ- ence in organizational life. These changes often hap- pen in surprising ways, opening new avenues that people never considered before.
68xu | HP "for the World." Sometimes something as simple as changing a preposition in a sentence can have a dramatic impact on how an organiza- tion conceives of its mission and role. Consider how a small shift in the con- struction of a question led to major changes in the scope and context of strategic inquiry at Hewlett- Packard, resulting in effective innovation and targeted action. The director of HP Labs wondered why the organization was not con- sidered the best industrial research laboratory in the world. As he thought about it, he realized that he did not know what that designation really meant. He charged Barbara Waugh, a key staff member, with coor- dinating the effort to respond to the question, "What does being the best industrial research lab in the world mean?" Instead of looking for answers outside the company, Barbara encouraged the director to share his core question with all HP Lab employees around the world.
hd35 | To that end, Waugh initiated a global network of conversations around that question, using the company's technology infrastructure along with face- to-face gatherings to support the dialogues. Just by exploring the practical implications of the question in a disciplined way, the Lab began to see productivity gains. But one day, an HP Lab engineer came into Barbara's office and said, "That question is okay, but what would really energize me and get me up in the morning would be asking, 'How can we be the best industrial research lab for the world?'"
2zpk | That one small shift changed the entire game by scaling up the meaning of and shifting the assump- tions embedded in the original question. It profound-
epu7 | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
7od1 | ly altered the context of the inquiry-to become the best for the world as the larger context for becoming the best in the world. This question obviously "traveled well"-it was no longer just the Lab's question, but something that many others at HP began to ask themselves as well. Employees at HP Labs and through- out the whole company responded to this new focus with a tremendous surge of collective energy.
0bqy | "THE QUESTION NEVER FAILED US."
b780 | MIKE PFEIL, CORPORATE EXECUTIVE
ccmb | Once they reworded the original question, Barbara and her colleagues could change the scope of related questions depending on the situa- tion. For example, shifting the scope downward meant focusing on "What does HP for the World mean for me? What does it mean in my life, in my own work?" HP employees could also scale up the scope by asking, "What does HP for the World mean for my work group? For my department? For HP as a company? And what might it mean for the world itself?"
ma93 | HP's E-Inclusion effort, a major project to enable the world's poor to enter the new economy while providing critical medical and other information to communities in the third world, stemmed in large measure from the HP for the World exploration. The question has now traveled far beyond the company: "What does it mean for us to be 'for the world'?" was a key question explored at a State of the World Forum with a group of more than 1,000 global leaders from every continent.
c6hh | Creating a Sales "Community." Another case in which a catalytic question empowered leaders in new ways occurred in the sales organization of a major U.S. corporation. Mike Pfeil, the area director of sales, wondered how a community, rather than a tra- ditional company, might deal with the challenges it confronted. As a learning experiment, he began to host conversations with employees from all levels in his organization to explore the meaning of communi- ty at work and how they might apply community principles to enhance performance.
y7ea | To depart from the group's traditional focus on problems, the sales director framed questions that shifted the context within which workers normally look at their organization. He asked people to examine their best experiences of community and to reflect on

gem8 | times they had participated in a community experi- ence that really worked, using queries such as, "What allowed that positive experience to hap- pen? What kinds of activities were tak- ing place? How did you fit into that?" As members shared what they knew from their own best community experiences, they began to see the analogies to busi- ness life. They posed follow-up ques- tions, such as, "How does a community deal with adversity and adapting to change? What happens with members who don't uphold the community's standards?"
e8nr | As the conversations evolved, important values that people really
k78w | HOW CAN I FRAME BETTER QUESTIONS?
g9du | Here are some questions you might ask yourself as you begin to explore the art and architecture of powerful questions. They are based on pioneering work with questions being done by the Public Conversations Project, a group that helps create constructive dialogue on divisive public issues.
f682 | Is this question relevant to the real life and real work of the people who will be exploring it?
li1k | . Is this a genuine question-a question to which I/we really don't know the answer?
pbea | What "work" do I want this question to do? That is, what kind of conversation, meanings, and feel- ings do I imagine this question will evoke in those who will be exploring it?
ccpt | Is this question likely to invite fresh thinking/ feeling? Is it familiar enough to be recognizable and relevant-and different enough to call for- ward a new response?
0fpw | What assumptions or beliefs are embedded in the way this question is constructed?
dqn8 | Is this question likely to generate hope, imagination, engagement, creative action, and new possibilities or is it likely to increase a focus on past problems and obstacles?
cop0 | Does this question leave room for new and different questions to be raised as the initial question is explored?
lhkq | Adapted from Sally Ann Roth Public Conversations Project c. 1998
82ju | cared about started to come forward-values like learning, mutual respect, contribution, and sharing with others. Another simple but powerful question emerged from those early dialogues:"How can we cre- ate a community at work that enables each person to contribute our best, inspires us to keep learning, and produces valued results?"This simple shift of lens led other leaders in the company to look how it functioned within the larger communities in which it operates. The learnings from this project informed subsequent work in the area of corporate respon- sibility and in the creation of mission goals that include the perspectives of both internal and external stake- holders in creating the company's future.
y2qo | "QUESTIONING BREAKS OPEN THE STAGNANT, HARDENED SHELLS OF THE PRESENT, OPENING UP OPTIONS TO BE EXPLORED." FRAN PEAVEY
1piq | The local leader who launched this effort is now a corporate vice president. In looking back on his expe- rience with engaging powerful questions to shift the context for exploring business realities, he shared the following:
7fqw | "As we learned more, the meaning of the question continued to evolve. We asked our- selves, "How can we go out and plant this seed? How do we frame it as we bring other people into the conversation?" The question always worked in stimulating the dialogue. Sometimes as leaders it's important not to col- lectively work on what the answer is but to work on what the question is. That was a big insight for me as we did this work. The ques- tion never failed us."
rhaz | Improving Questions at Pfizer. In another recent case, professionals at Pfizer, the world- renowned pharmaceutical firm, are experimenting with a systematic method of improving the quality of their questions. Through a custom-designed workshop, marketing and finance professionals in Pfizer's European business unit have been learning to articulate powerful questions. These executives have discovered that meetings have more energy and creative ideas flow more quickly when they place attention on for- mulating catalytic questions. With this discipline in place, new ideas are more easily finding their way into key products and services.

wtfz | From these examples, it's clear that improving the quality of the questions you ask and creating a frame- work of engagement that encourages their explo- ration can create business value. Because learning to engage thoughtful questions can lead to insight, inno- vation, and action, doing so will become an essential strategic capability for leaders of organizations who want to create sus- tainable results in the face of both short- and longer-term challenges and opportunities.
