You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

7ml0 | The problem with this table is that the years, which actually are qualitative descriptions of when each population measurement was made, are used as separate columns even though the year is a dimension and should run down the page. (Dates are dimensions too and not facts, because they describe something qualitative). If we loaded this table in Tableau Public, we would see a separate measure field for each year because Tableau Public recognizes each column as a distinct field. (In one of the following examples, we will use Tableau Public's new data interpreter to structure the data source properly).
r2i6 | The correct structure for this table will have three columns, namely [Country], [Year], and [Population], with a separate row for each combination of country and year.
sgha | Connecting to the data in Tableau Public
y3c5 | Tableau Public has a graphical user interface (GUI) that was designed to enable users to load data sources without having to write code. Since the only place to save Tableau Public documents is in Tableau's Cloud, data sources are automatically extracted and packaged with the workbook. (The ability to save extracts as separate documents or open extracts and share them with different users is a feature of Tableau Desktop Professional).
10g0 | Chapter 3
nl64 | Connecting to data from a local file, that is, an access, excel, or text file saved on your computer, takes several steps that have little variability by data source, which will be illustrated as follows with detailed screenshots:
a6si | 1. Click on the Connect to Data Link option from the Data menu.
o25a | 2. Select the data source type.
u5gt | 3. Select the file or website to which you want to connect.
f50c | 4. For a Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, or a text file, determine whether the connection is to one table or multiple tables or it requires a custom SQL connection:
8x23 | ° If the connection is to one table, select the table.
nf5i | ° If the connection is to multiple tables, select the option for the connection to multiple tables and identify the join conditions. We will discuss this in detail in the next section.
6f7n | ° Alternatively, you can type or paste a custom SQL.
r0bb | 5. When all the selections have been made, click on Ok.
ucxa | Now that you have learned what data sources look like and how they are structured, we will give you a couple of examples of data connections.
dpzv | In the first exercise, we will connect to the World Bank's environment indicators. You can download this data, which is formatted either for Microsoft Excel or as a text file, at www.worldbank.org.
p3zg | This data source is not formatted properly, which is shown in the following screenshot. It has a spacer row between the top of the worksheet and the headers' rows, and the years in which the measurements were taken were distributed as columns rather than individual dimensional values in a row.
dcq6 | Once we connect to the file, we will use Tableau Public's new data interpreter to clean up and pivot the rows:
4onb | Connecting to Data
j6i2 | The data source user interface
su8b | Before loading data, it's important to know what the different parts of the data connection user interface are. The Tableau Public 9.x user interface that is used for the connection to data is shown in the following screenshot. Don't forget that the Start button remains in the upper-left corner of the UI. You can click on it from either the data source window or a worksheet to get back to the Start menu:
ap79 | The parts of the user interface and their descriptions are as follows. The parts have been given in alphabetical references:
o2lj | Chapter 3
9ksk | To load this file into Tableau Public, we will start with a new Tableau Public workbook. You can download the Tableau Public workbook that we used for this chapter by visiting https: //public.tableau.com/profile/tableau.data. stories#! /. The following steps will guide you through how to connect a file to Tableau Public:
3rje | 1. Open a new instance of Tableau Public.
1ib3 | 2. From the Connect pane, click on the data file type to which you'd like to connect. In this case, we are using an excel file.
lokq | 3. Browse to the file to which you would like to connect.
i9g3 | 4. Drag a table from the list of tables, which is a list of different worksheets in this case, along with the workbook onto the workspace.
aprs | 5. Note that the values in the data source are now populating the space below the workspace, but at least with this data set, there is no complete set of field headers. We will edit the data source by using the data interpreter in the next exercise.
nna4 | The name of the data source is showing a concatenation of the name of the workbook and the table name. Click on it (in the previous screenshot, it's A) to give the data source a good name. Remember that anything that you publish on Tableau Public is available for other people to download, and since they aren't able to see the actual origin of your data source, it's a good idea to give it an explicit name so that there are no errors of attribution.

ph9z | Using the data interpreter
muji | Tableau Public 9.x has a new feature that is designed to reduce the amount of transformation that you need to do to your data sources. The data interpreter automatically detects where the first row of headers or data is in a Microsoft Excel data file, and if there are empty or semi-structured rows before the data, it can remove them. (The data interpreter does not work with text files.)
glmb | The following data source has the following major errors in it:
saqe | . There are two rows of mostly blank, non-data values before the first row of the valid data; we will use the data interpreter to fix this
e6o9 | · The years in which the measurements were taken should be going down a column rather than across the columns; we will pivot the data in the next exercise to fix this
wgep | We will use the data interpreter to fix the first problem. In the following screenshot, you will see that Tableau Public has suggested that we use the data interpreter. The steps are as follows:
71hf | 1. Under the workspace, note that Tableau Public has recognized that the data might not be formatted properly and has suggested using the data interpreter. Click on the button that says Turn on:
efpl | Chapter 3
01ri | 2. Now that the data interpreter is on, you can review the results in the following screenshot and see how the data was transformed:
1lfn | The two rows of garbage are now gone, and the field headers are populating properly. We still need to resolve the issue of the date dimension going across the columns rather than down a column. We can resolve this by pivoting the data.
3lvh | Pivoting data
6ub3 | Pivoting data is a capability designed to help you resolve issues within data sources, like in the previous example, where the date dimension is not formatted properly.
n712 | By highlighting the headers, you can pivot them from columns into rows by performing the following steps:
lxns | 1. Highlight the field headers that you need to pivot. In this case, we click on 1960 and scroll all the way to the right, holding down the Shift key as we select columns.
4afc | 2. Right-click on a selected header and choose Pivot.
px1t | 3. The pivoted fields now have transformed into two new columns -the headers that you selected appear as values in a new column called pivot field names, and the measures now appear in a field called pivot field values.
ehz9 | 4. Right-click on the headers for each of these fields and rename them. We renamed Pivot field names to Year and Pivot field values to Measure.
qrj5 | Connecting to Data
mwd5 | 5. Check out the following modified data source. It is now formatted properly, but there is one issue - the numerous rows with null values. We will edit those in the next exercise:
gng6 | Filtering data sources
fjnz | It's reasonable to expect that you won't need to load all the data in the data source. It is important to load only what you need because the more the data in the data source, the slower it will be. In the current example that we are using, there are many rows with null values. The reason that they have null values is that for the selected measure, no measurement was taken for certain time periods.
15hc | The null values are different from measurements of zero. Values of zero mean that a measurement was taken and the value was zero. Null means that no measurement was taken.
