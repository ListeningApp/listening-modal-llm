You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

yogo | 1. Introduction
2285 | Digital information is growing rapidly, in terms of five V's (volume, velocity, veracity, variety and value), and hence this is hailed as the big data era (BCS, 2014; Bellazzi, 2014; Lee and Yoon, 2017). Health-based big data including linked information for patients, such as their clinical data (for example gender, age, pathological and physiological history) and omics data (such as genetics, proteomics and metabolomics) has now become more widely available (Canuel et al., 2015; Singhal et al., 2016). Recently, such data has been used for precision (also called personalised or stratified) medicine to provide customised healthcare, i.
ys0g | ABSTRACT
7zvp | With the development of modern high-throughput omic measurement platforms, it has become essential for biomedical studies to undertake an integrative (combined) approach to fully utilise these data to gain insights into biological systems. Data from various omics sources such as genetics, proteomics, and metabolomics can be integrated to unravel the intricate working of systems biology using machine learning-based predictive algo- rithms. Machine learning methods offer novel techniques to integrate and analyse the various omics data enabling the discovery of new biomarkers. These biomarkers have the potential to help in accurate disease prediction, patient stratification and delivery of precision medicine. This review paper explores different inte- grative machine learning methods which have been used to provide an in-depth understanding of biological systems during normal physiological functioning and in the presence of a disease. It provides insight and rec- ommendations for interdisciplinary professionals who envisage employing machine learning skills in multi-omics studies.
ww6u | e. providing a bespoke treatment for individuals (Gibson et al., 2015; Kalaitzopoulos, 2016; Malod-Dognin et al., 2017). There has been un- precedented growth in the development of precision medicine sup- ported by ML (machine learning) approaches (Delavan et al., 2017; Peterson et al., 2013; Zou et al., 2017) and data mining tools (Chawla and Davis, 2013; Cheng et al., 2015; Margolies et al., 2016). These techniques have also helped to discover novel omics biological markers which can identify the molecular cause of a disease.
hpi6 | A biomarker is a substance, structure, or process that can be measured in the human body or its products and can provide surrogate information about the presence of a disease/condition (Strimbu and
4uhb | Tavel, 2010). Molecular biomarkers are discovered by analysing the cascade of information provided by different omics (Debnath et al., 2010). For example, the high-sensitivity C-Reactive protein test provides an accurate and quantitative risk assessment for cardiovascular disease (Pfützner and Forst, 2006; Shrivastava et al., 2015). Biomarkers play a significant role in planning preventive measures and decisions for pa- tients (Nielsen, 2017) and can be classified as either diagnostic, prognostic or predictive (Le et al., 2016; Shaw et al., 2015). Diagnostic biomarkers are used for determining the presence of disease in a patient, while prog- nostic biomarkers provide information on the overall outcome with or without the standard treatment (Carlomagno et al., 2017). Predictive biomarkers are used to identify who is at risk of an outcome (Nalejska et al., 2014). All of these biomarkers can also be used to identify which treatment will be most suitable for a given patient. For example, the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) study used a combination of neuroimaging, biochemical and genetic biomarkers to discriminate early Alzheimer's patients from healthy volunteers with an accuracy of 98% (Gupta et al., 2019). Similarly, different forms of Par- kinson's syndromes have been investigated by developing an automated tool that fuses multi-site diffusion-weighted MRI imaging biomarkers and disease rating score (MDS-UPDRS III) (Archer et al., 2019). Bio- markers can help identify high-risk individuals before their physiolog- ical symptoms are evident. Moreover, they also help in measuring disease progression (Mandel et al., 2010).
epyi | In the context of precision medicine, ML has been used to develop diagnostic, prognostic and predictive tools from single omics data (Dias- Audibert et al., 2020; Mamoshina et al., 2018; Sonsare and Gunavathi, 2019). However, ML may have deteriorated performance for certain single omics such as gene data due to inherent characteristics (Kim et al., 2020). ML methods are now also being applied to multi-omics data (Bersanelli et al., 2016), to investigate and interpret the relationships
y51p | between data and phenotypes (Kim and Tagkopoulos, 2018). Although ML analysis of multi-omics is still in its embryonic stage, it has already been explored for a wide range of applications, as reported in recent reviews on brain diseases (Garali et al., 2018; Young et al., 2013), dia- betes (Kavakiotis et al., 2017), cancers (Borad and LoRusso, 2017; Chaudhary et al., 2017; Wong et al., 2016) cardiovascular disease (Weng et al., 2017), medical imaging (Erickson et al., 2017), single-cell analysis in humans (Cao et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020a) and plant science studies (Acharjee et al., 2011). Currently, many of the multi-omic reviews are focused on individual sub-topics. For example, designing studies (Haas et al., 2017; Hasin et al., 2017), setting up workflows (Kohl et al., 2014), choosing software tools (Misra et al., 2019) and evaluating overfitted performance (McCabe et al., 2020).
x95m | In contrast, this review aims at a broader focus, presenting an interdisciplinary perspective to new readers in this domain by providing a background on multi-omics and ML. It takes forward the integration terminologies introduced by Ritchie (Ritchie et al., 2015) and summa- rises the recent integrative state-of-the-art approaches. We aim to cover various integration methods concisely and include a recommendation flowchart enabling interdisciplinary scientists to have a quick head start in this domain (Bersanelli et al., 2016; Nguyen and Wang, 2020).
yfum | Scope of this review: This review investigates the two primary learning strategies in ML, i.e. supervised and unsupervised, which are commonly used within the context of multi-omics integration. This re- view considers multi-omics integration as a process of combining different single omics. Although various ML specialisations such as reinforcement (Coronato et al., 2020), hybrid (Zhou et al., 2019), multi-view (Zhao et al., 2017) and self-supervised learning (Chen et al., 2019) are now emerging in generic healthcare applications, they have not yet gained enough momentum in multi-omics analysis, hence they remain beyond the scope of this review.
