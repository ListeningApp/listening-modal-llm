        "content": "mlcd | As with any other mode, the cautions associated with the advocating mode manifest when the mode is overused or misapplied. The strong ideological orientation that often characterizes a therapist in the advocating mode may lead some therapists to overestimate a client's desire; ability; socioeconomic, political, or cultural context; as well as resources for pursuing autonomy and independence. Because clients differ in their experience of disability, they respond differently to advocacy efforts that involve consciousness-raising. For some clients, it may be premature to raise their awareness about injustices that they would rather deny or discover in their own time.\n2qe7 | Collaborating Mode\nlpzf | The growing emphasis on client-centered practice in occupational therapy underscores the importance of the collaborating mode. Therapists functioning in the collaborating mode expect their clients to drive the therapeutic reasoning that underlies the session, to choose their own activities, and to set their own goals for therapy, even if the therapist disagrees with some or all of the client's goals or agenda. Therapists functioning in the collaborating mode also solicit ongoing feedback from their clients about their own performance as therapists and about the therapy process.\n24rz | Therapists in the collaborating mode believe that clients are more likely to achieve positive outcomes if they take ownership of the therapy process. They tend to view clients as capable of determining what they need from therapy and selecting occupational therapy goals and tasks that address those needs. In this way, they work to promote\n091m | Copyright twenty twenty. F. A. Davis Company. All rights reserved.\nsot6 | CASE EXAMPLE four point two The Advocating Mode\nd6sf | Virgil is a man in his late twenties with cerebral palsy and moderate learning disabilities who has lived in an institution for most of his life. The managers of his care team at the institution had built a plan that he would move into independent living within the community with staff support to accommodate him. Before I was referred to work with Virgil, his care team from the institution had already located, set up, and obtained funding for his new housing situation. I was referred to provide Virgil with a bath board to facilitate his bathing in the terraced house that was to become his home.\n7haq | Virgil had been schooled in the notion that his home was suitable to his needs, and he was thrilled about the possibility of moving into a new home. When I met with him within this new environment, it was immediately evident to me that the housing arrangement was not acceptable. Fundamentally, the way the house was set up did not facilitate Virgil's independence, maximize his dignity, or provide a safe environment for staff to support him.\nubwu | client empowerment, autonomy, independence, and personal choice. When disagreements or other interpersonal difficulties with clients occur, therapists who utilize the collaborating mode encourage clients to use their own judgment. In practice, this mode can be difficult to enact in its purest sense. A therapist must possess the confidence and capacity not only to receive criticism from his or her clients but also to let go of all control and professional authority regarding what is taking place during therapy, if even for a brief period of time. Although most clients for whom this mode is most appropriate make positive decisions on their own behalf, any therapist that has witnessed a client act against his or her own best interest knows how challenging it can be to step aside and watch this occur.\nucme | Instead of providing the bath board, I felt it was my duty to inform the managers of Virgil's care team and the organization that was to fund his new housing that I had found the proposed accommodations unacceptable. I provided a report that outlined the safety risks that would have been associated with providing a bath board. The report emphasized other shortfalls in the environmental design of the house and outlined the oversights in the overall care plan for Virgil.\nqnl5 | The managers took offense at my report and attempted to remove me from the situation. They insisted that Virgil was no longer in need of occupational therapy services. However, I pursued my agenda and held meetings with the funding organization and the managers to explain the rationale behind my position. Therefore, the funding organization conducted an independent review and later decided to offer Virgil an alternative accommodation. The housing that Virgil was eventually provided enabled him to move freely about the entire home and gain access to the bath, toilet, and other areas in a much safer and more dignified manner.\nwdx9 | understands that, even though the client made a poor decision in one instance, the confidence that the therapist had in the client to allow that decision to happen may have influenced that client to trust the therapist's judgment and recommendations in the future. Moreover, as explained earlier, the collaborating mode is most appropriate for clients who are educated, informed, and proactive about their care. It is the correct match for a client with a high need to control and drive the goals and outcomes of therapy.\nn1xr | Strengths of the Collaborating Mode\nohpj | The collaborating mode reflects many of the core values of occupational therapy. Specifically, the field places a strong emphasis on promoting client choice, freedom, and autonomy. Therapists who utilize the collaborating mode demonstrate these values by enabling clients to\nry5f | CASE EXAMPLE four point three The Collaborating Mode\n31wg | I met Edward, a seventeen-year-old boy, when he was admitted to the adolescent psychiatric unit for aggression toward staff and peers at his residential placement. At this time his primary diagnoses were conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Treatment was initiated with administration of the Adolescent Occupational Self-Assessment, an interview developed for this setting based on the Model of Human Occupation.\ncelk | During his initial interview, Edward was cooperative but made no eye contact and gave vague answers to the questions asked about his daily routine. He lacked insight into his aggressive behaviors and took no personal responsibility for his actions. He perceived himself as being alone in the world and was anxious to move to independent living where he could come and go as he pleased. Edward had low self-esteem and a poorly defined sense of self. He was motivated to be successful in the role of worker, friend, boyfriend, family member, and student yet consistently experienced failure in all these roles. Edward also reported on the initial assessment interview that he was having some difficulty managing his affect and regulating his feelings.",
