You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

k78w | where we have reinstated the dimensionful variables. We therefore recover the "on mass-shell" path integral (30) obtained earlier. Note the importance of including the determinant (19) in order to obtain the <LATEX>\partial _ { x x } ^ { 2 } V</LATEX> term in the Schr√∂dinger potential
g9du | <LATEX>\bar { U } .</LATEX> Before proceeding to the next sections we should add a comment regarding the above path integrals. Beyond being expressions that allow formal manipulations, they can also be understood as limits of large multi-variate integrals arising from the discretization of time evolu- tion into small discrete time intervals. In general, this
f682 | discretization results into apparent ambiguities [25]1. In our case this can also be linked to the discretization of the Langevin equation (8) (the index i refers to the <LATEX>i ^ { \mathrm { t h } }</LATEX> time interval)
li1k | <LATEX>x _ { i } = x _ { i - 1 } + V ^ { \prime } \left( x _ { i } ^ { \star } \right) \Delta t + \int _ { t _ { i - 1 } } ^ { t _ { i } } d s \xi \left( s \right)</LATEX> (49)
pbea | where <LATEX>x _ { i } ^ { \star } = \alpha x _ { i } + \left( 1 - \alpha \right) x _ { i - 1 } .</LATEX> In the above discus- sions and manipulations we have tacitly assumed <LATEX>\alpha = 1 / 2</LATEX> (Stratonovich) which, in the continuous limit is equiva- lent to setting <LATEX>\Theta \left( 0 \right) = 1 / 2</LATEX> [22]. It is well known however that, as long as the noise amplitude does not depend on <LATEX>x</LATEX> (known as additive noise), the solution to the Langevin equation is unique, as is the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. Our path integrals respect this and all results derived from them are independent of the choice of <LATEX>\alpha .</LATEX> Calculations with the discrete version, show that contri- butions from terms involving <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> cancel. For example, one can start from the discretized path integral with an ar- bitrary choice of <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> and obtain a unique Fokker-Planck equation - see e.g. [22]. In the continuum formulation, the supersymmetry discussed in subsection IID below imposes the cancellation of terms where the ambiguous quantity <LATEX>\Theta \left( t = 0 \right)</LATEX> appears. This is also reflected in the path integral (48) through the special form of the poten- tial <LATEX>U \left( x \right)</LATEX> in terms of the "superpotential" <LATEX>V \left( x \right) .</LATEX> Overall, this non-dependence on <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> ultimately stems from the in- clusion of the determinant detM in (13). These consid- erations support the view that the formal path integrals considered here are well defined and free from any ambi- guity.
ccpt | C. Correlation functions from the generating functional
0fpw | One way to compute correlation functions is through the use of objects called generating functionals. In this subsection we will outline how these generating function- als yield correlators in practice. We will then outline in section III how the fRG can be used to compute these generating functionals in the first place and therefore how to obtain correlation functions in section
dqn8 | <LATEX>I V .</LATEX> The first generating functional we examine is the parti- tion functional <LATEX>\mathcal{Z} \left( \mathrm { J } \right)</LATEX> which depends on source terms <LATEX>\mathrm { J } \left( t \right)</LATEX> (in analogy with a magnetic field source term <LATEX>M \left( x \right)</LATEX> in spin systems)
cop0 | <LATEX>\mathcal{Z} \left( \mathrm { J } \right) = \int \mathcal{D} \Phi \exp \left[ - \mathcal{S} _ { B M } \left[ \Phi \right] + \int d t \mathrm { J } \Phi \right] ,</LATEX> (50)
lhkq | which, under variation w.r.t. J will give any required correlator. In the above functional integral, <LATEX>\Phi</LATEX> stands
82ju | collectively for <LATEX>\left( \varphi \left( t \right) , \widetilde { F } \left( t \right) , \rho \left( t \right) , \bar { \rho } \left( t \right) \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>\mathrm { J } \left( t \right)</LATEX> for all the corresponding currents
y2qo | <LATEX>\int d t \mathrm { J } \Phi \equiv \int d t \left( J _ { \varphi } \varphi + J _ { \widetilde { F } } \widetilde { F } + \bar { \rho } \zeta + \bar { \zeta } \rho \right)</LATEX> (51)
1piq | The only constraint we will require of the currents is that they satisfy <LATEX>\mathrm { J } \left( t _ { \mathrm { i n } } \right) = \mathrm { J } \left( t _ { \mathrm { f } } \right) = 0</LATEX> at the initial and final times <LATEX>t _ { \mathrm { i n } }</LATEX> and
7fqw | <LATEX>t _ { \mathrm { f } } .</LATEX> The averages of the fields are defined by
rhaz | <LATEX>\langle \Phi \left( t \right) \rangle \equiv \int \mathcal{D} \Phi \Phi \left( t \right) \exp \left[ - \mathcal{S} _ { B M } \left[ \Phi \right] \right]</LATEX> (52)
wak1 | <LATEX>= \frac { \delta \mathcal{Z} \left[ \mathrm { J } \right] } { \delta \mathrm { J } \left( t \right) } | _ { \mathrm { J } = 0 } ,</LATEX> (53)
wtfz | the two point correlation function is:
qy1i | <LATEX>\langle \Phi \left( t _ { 1 } \right) \Phi \left( t _ { 2 } \right) \rangle \equiv \frac { \int \mathcal{D} \Phi \Phi \left( t _ { 1 } \right) \Phi \left( t _ { 2 } \right) \exp \left[ - \mathcal{S} \left[ \Phi \right] \right] } { \int \mathcal{D} \Phi \exp \left[ - \mathcal{S} \left[ \Phi \right] \right] }</LATEX> (54)
1k9e | <LATEX>= \frac { \delta ^ { 2 } \mathcal{Z} \left( J \right) } { \delta J \left( t _ { 2 } \right) \delta J \left( t _ { 1 } \right) } | _ { J = 0 } ,</LATEX> (55)
5bjs | and similarly for higher correlation functions. Note that the usual normalization by a factor <LATEX>\mathcal{Z} \left( 0 \right) ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> that is in- cluded in general, is omitted here since for this theory <LATEX>\mathcal{Z} \left( 0 \right) = 1</LATEX> by construction.
uodj | Defining
k16v | <LATEX>\mathcal{W} \left[ \mathrm { J } \right] \equiv \ln \left( \mathcal{Z} \left( \mathrm { J } \right) \right)</LATEX> (56)
b2lm | allows us to compute connected correlation functions (or Ursell functions) as:
ti7f | <LATEX>\langle \Phi \left( t _ { 1 } \right) \ldots \Phi \left( t _ { n } \right) \rangle _ { C } = \frac { \delta ^ { n } \mathcal{W} \left[ \mathrm { J } \right] } { \delta \mathrm { J } \left( t _ { 1 } \right) \ldots \delta \mathrm { J } \left( t _ { n } \right) } | _ { \mathrm { J } = 0 }</LATEX> (57)
oksu | For instance the connected 2-point function (more com- monly known as covariance) <LATEX>G \left( t _ { 1 } , t _ { 2 } \right)</LATEX> is:
wtow | <LATEX>G \left( t _ { 1 } , t _ { 2 } \right) \equiv \langle \Phi \left( t _ { 1 } \right) \Phi \left( t _ { 2 } \right) \rangle _ { C } = \langle \Phi \left( t _ { 1 } \right) \Phi \left( t _ { 2 } \right) \rangle - \langle \Phi \left( t _ { 1 } \right) \rangle \langle \Phi \left( t _ { 2 } \right) \rangle</LATEX> <LATEX>= \frac { \delta ^ { 2 } \mathcal{W} \left[ \mathrm { J } \right] } { \delta \mathrm { J } \left( t _ { 1 } \right) \delta \mathrm { J } \left( t _ { 2 } \right) } | _ { \mathrm { J } = 0 }</LATEX> (58)
o22k | D. Symmetry transformations for <LATEX>\mathcal{S} _ { B M }</LATEX> and Ward-Takahashi identities
nwfz | In this subsection we recall the transformations that leave the action <LATEX>\mathcal{S} _ { B M }</LATEX> invariant, up to boundary terms. We comment on the implications of such symmetries, also paying attention to the boundary terms that are usually dropped under the assumption of equilibrium, or, equiv- alently, a corresponding infinite amount of elapsed time between initial and final states [26]. For us to later use SUSY fRG flow equations in section III it is crucial to ver- ify the presence of this symmetry in an out-of-equilibrium context.

mror | In general, invariances of the action imply relations be- tween various correlation functions in field theory, gener- ally known as Ward-Takahashi (W-T) identities. Their derivation can be summarized as follows: A general in- finitesimal transformation of the fields <LATEX>\Phi \rightarrow \Phi ^ { \prime } = \Phi + \Delta \Phi</LATEX> will generically change the action <LATEX>S \rightarrow \mathcal{S} ^ { \prime } = \mathcal{S} + \Delta \mathcal{S} .</LATEX> Also shifting <LATEX>\mathrm { J } \rightarrow \mathrm { J } + \Delta \mathrm { J }</LATEX> leads to
zlxc | <LATEX>\Delta \mathcal{Z} = \int d t \frac { \delta \mathcal{Z} } { \delta \mathrm { J } \left( t \right) } \Delta J \left( t \right) = \int \mathcal{D} \Phi e ^ { - \mathcal{S} \left[ \Phi \right] + \int d t J \Phi }</LATEX> <LATEX>\times \left( - \Delta S + \mathrm { J } \Delta \Phi + \Delta \mathrm { J } \Phi \right) \left( 5 \right.</LATEX> where we used that a) <LATEX>\Phi</LATEX> is simply an integration variable in (50) and <LATEX>\mathcal{Z}</LATEX> is not altered by a change in <LATEX>\Phi</LATEX> but only <LATEX>D = D ^ { \prime } .</LATEX> the transformation involves no non-trivial Jacobian determinant. Symmetries of the dynamical system comprise of transformations for which <LATEX>\Delta S</LATEX> is, at most, a total derivative (or a total divergence for higher dimensions): <LATEX>\Delta \mathcal{S} = \int d t \frac { d } { d t } \mathcal{A} = \mathcal{A} \left( t _ { f } \right) - \mathcal{A} \left( t _ { i } \right) =</LATEX> <LATEX>\left[ \mathcal{A} \right] _ { t _ { j } } ^ { t _ { f } } \cdot \text { Further choosing } \Delta \text { J such tha } ,</LATEX> for a given
k0bw | <LATEX>\Delta \Phi ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { J } \Delta \Phi + \Delta \mathrm { J } \Phi = 0 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\int d t \frac { \delta \mathcal{Z} } { \delta \mathrm { J } \left( t \right) } \Delta \mathrm { J } \left( t \right) = \int \mathcal{D} \Phi \left[ \mathcal{A} \right] _ { t _ { i } } ^ { t _ { f } } e ^ { - \mathcal{S} \left[ \Phi \right] + \int d t J \Phi }</LATEX> (60)
aq5a | Differentiating this master equation w.r.t. J and setting <LATEX>\mathrm { J } = 0 ,</LATEX> gives relations between correlations functions that are necessitated by the symmetry under
sc5y | <LATEX>\Phi \rightarrow \Phi + \Delta \Phi .</LATEX> For our case, given two independent, infinitesimal Grassmann variables <LATEX>\epsilon</LATEX> and ‚Ç¨, the following transforma- tions of the fields [16]
