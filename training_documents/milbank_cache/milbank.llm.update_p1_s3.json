Public health law research, however, has received less attention.\nap5o | Methods: Expert commentary.\n7zvf | Findings: This article explores public health law research, defined as the scientific study of the relation of law and legal practices to population health. The article offers a logic model of public health law research and a typology of approaches to studying the effects of law on public health. Research on the content and prevalence of public health laws, processes of adopting and implementing laws, and the extent to which and mechanisms through which law affects health outcomes can use methods drawn from epidemiology, economics, sociology, and other disciplines. The maturation of public health law research as a field depends on methodological rigor, adequate research funding, access to appropriate data sources, and policymakers' use of research findings.\nmov9 | Conclusions: Public health law research is a young field but holds great promise for supporting evidence-based policymaking that will improve population health.\nks7m | Law is an important discipline within public health. Legal \"powers, duties and restraints\" structure the mission of public health agencies and shape how it is carried out. Law is a prominent intervention tool to achieve particular public health goals. Laws and their implementation also have important unintended effects, both positive and negative, on population health. Although public health law has a long history in the United States, it was one of the fields of public health that fell into neglect when public health was thought to have conquered infectious disease. Over the past two decades, though, the reemergence of infectious disease as a major public health concern and a growing awareness of the complexity of health regulation at the local, national, and global levels have restored law to importance in public health and academic law. No longer confined to end-of-the-day conference panels on \"legal and ethical issues,\" public health law now has its own office at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, academic centers, journals, national and international professional societies, and a shelf of important treatises.\nw1w1 | Notwithstanding all the writing and commentary on public health law, there has been little discussion of public health law research and its place in the fields of law and public health. The evidence produced by empirical research is important to both public health law practice and scholarship. It constitutes the \"facts\" justifying regulatory action and supporting normative arguments about what policies are most desirable, effective, or consistent with human rights or other legal standards. To be sure, law legitimately serves as a site for the articulation and clash of values, and lawmaking often necessitates decisions that cannot await full information. Furthermore, not all law is or can be \"evidence based,\" even in public health. At the same time, empirical research is not just an ammunition dump for adversarial legal battle. The responsible use of law as a tool for improving public health requires a commitment to the pursuit and consideration of scientific evidence when possible. In public health, just as in health care, evidence should inform the investment in and implementation of policy, and a consciousness of data and the scientific method can improve the decisions of policymakers and practitioners even in the absence of data. This is the promise of public health law research. At a time when empirical health law has emerged from a general flowering of empirical legal research as a distinct scholarly field, scientific research is a\nh8gv | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health\nkwkp | tie that can now bind law to public health. In this article, we describe and chart a future for public health law research. Our discussion was occasioned by the launch of a major initiative by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to sponsor public health law research and expand the field. It thus is an opportune time to reflect on the field: its definition and boundaries, the types of research that a robust field of public health law research should include, and the challenges to be faced in growing and strengthening the field. This article concerns the field of public health law research generally, not the specific priorities or funding areas of the Public Health Law Research program.\nyj0m | Defining Public Health Law Research\newfp | We define public health law research as \"the scientific study of the relation of law and legal practices to population health.\" This includes both direct relationships between law and health, and relationships mediated through the effects of law on health behaviors and other processes and structures that affect population health. In this section, we elaborate on this definition in order to distinguish public health law research from other fields and forms of public health law knowledge.\noczy | Distinguishing Public Health Law Research from Public Health Law\n2ttg | Lawrence Gostin's widely cited definition of public health law is\nhis3 | the study of the legal powers and duties of the state to ensure the conditions for people to be healthy, and the limitations on the power of the state to constrain the autonomy, privacy, liberty, proprietary, or other legally protected interests of individuals for protection or promotion of community health.\nm50z | Using this power, duty, restraint formula, Gostin succeeds in focusing the field on the state's role in managing collective action to protect the population's health while still encompassing a diverse range of cooperating\nme84 | actors and related functions, including private actors and the health care system. His claims for public health law are broad enough to earn libertarian criticism: scholars have argued from diverse standpoints that Gostin and his colleagues in public health are expanding the jurisdiction of public health beyond its legitimate mission and into a realm of wrongful and counterproductive meddling in the autonomy of citizens. Yet for others, Gostin's definition may be too narrow. Regulatory researchers, for example, question the importance of distinguishing between public and private actors in health governance. Other commentators insist that public health law must include the role of law as a determinant and mechanism for the health effects of social and physical environments.\no56m | Debate over the boundaries of public health law plays out differently in the realm of public health law research. In defining public health law research, we are concerned not with what is right, proper, or legitimate to include within the jurisdiction of public health law but with whether law can be empirically shown to have an impact on the health of the population. Commentators might disagree on whether equality, for example, ought to be considered a public health issue, but that question is different from whether it is possible to empirically identify the ways in which law affects health inequalities. Empirical data can be highly salient to disputes about normative concepts and positions but cannot themselves resolve disputes about the legitimate scope of public health or public health law or the extent to which health promotion should be traded off against other social goods, such as civil liberties. Public health law research, then, is distinguished from public health law by its focus on description, explanation, and prediction-that is, its focus on empirical investigation.\nslz6 | Research versus Scholarship",
