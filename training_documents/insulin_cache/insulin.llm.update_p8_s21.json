        "content": "his3 | In the ventral striatum, impaired insulin signalling reduces DA release in response to stimuli (food, electrical or insulin); this effect is evident in neuron-specific IR knock-out mice and HFD-induced insulin resistance. However, it is important to note, that Fordahl et al. could not detect any change in evoked DA release in insulin-resistant rodents.\nm50z | Three point three point two. Insulin dysregulation impacts baseline DA levels\nme84 | Equally to evoked DA release, reports about baseline DA concentrations in the NAc are heterogeneous: While Kleinridders et al. could not detect any differences in DA content (but only in DA release) between rodents with low insulin levels (prolonged fasting) and insulin resistance (HFD) compared to normal insulin sensitivity, Chen et al. observed lower baseline DA levels in insulin resistance. As Oginsky et al. pointed out, a considerable source of heterogeneity in rodent studies might be caused by the various rodent strains and their susceptibility to weight gain, because intrinsic excitability of NAc core neurons differs between obesity-susceptible and -resistant rats. It is generally assumed that reduced excitatory synaptic transmission on MSNs is a key mechanism by which insulin resistance abolishes the capability of insulin to increase DA release in the\no56m | ventral striatum. In line, the modulation of MSN activity was attenuated in NIRKO mice and DA release in the NAc is equally decreased if insulin signalling in NAc astrocytes is disrupted leading to reduced ATP exocytosis and purinergic signalling cascades in DA neurons.\nslz6 | Three point three point three. Insulin resistance reduces DA turnover\n90k5 | Insulin resistance reduces DAT expression, and DA reuptake via attenuated AKT signalling. Moreover, selective inhibition of the insulin receptor has been shown to attenuate DA reuptake. The observation that both lack of insulin due to prolonged starvation and prolonged hyperinsulinemia reduces dopamine reuptake indicates that hyperinsulinemia leads to a desensitization of the IR and impacts downstream signalling pathways, that control DAT expression. This effect is time-dependent. While two weeks of HFD did not have an effect, six weeks of HFD reduced DAT levels in the synaptosomal membrane-associated fractions. Notably, the effects of insulin resistance are reversible. Eight weeks of aerobic exercise restored insulin AKT/GSK3-beta signalling, baseline DA levels, and DA release after food intake.\n9m8s | Taken together, reduced insulin signalling or insulin resistance in the NAc reduces DA release and DA reuptake in DA axon terminals.\n893y | Three point four. Effect of insulin resistance on reward behaviour and food intake in rodents\nfavz | To date, only a few studies have examined how compromised insulin signalling in the mesolimbic pathways affects reward behaviour and food intake.\n7szx | Three point four point one. Insulin resistance modulated food intake behavior\nhx9e | Selective inactivation of IR in VTA or SN DA neurons increases food intake, resulting in higher fat mass and body weight. In line, insulin depletion in STZ-treated mice and insulin resistance after HFD resulted in increased food approach behaviour. In fact, increased calorie intake after HFD was associated with impaired AKT signalling and reduced striatal DAT expression indicating an IR-dependent mechanism. In line with this, viral rescue of AKT signalling and striatal DA expression decreased calorie intake. However, there are also opposing findings. In congenital IR knockouts in DA neurons, there was no difference in daily calorie intake, body weight or energy metabolism, suggesting that the alterations in food intake and body weight by IR signalling are not solely attributable to the DA system.\nywn2 | Three point four point two. Insulin resistance impacts the motivation to work for food\na63r | In line with increased food intake, the motivation to work for food increases with insulin resistance. Rats fed a high-fat diet for five weeks exhibited more lever presses in a progressive ratio task using sucrose reward, and ICV insulin was unable to suppress this effect. Furthermore, obese insulin-resistant OLETF rats exhibited increased operant performance for sucrose reward. This is in contradiction, however, with evidence for reduced sucrose preference in insulin resistance. Moreover, McNeilly et al. demonstrated that three to four weeks of HFD, sufficient to induce insulin resistance, diminished the motivation to respond for sucrose pallets in Wistar rats. This deficit was ameliorated, but not totally reversed, by a dietary intervention (chow diet) that restored insulin sensitivity. However, it is significant to note that McNeilly et al. did not carry out a conventional progressive ratio task. They performed a delayed matching to place and a delay-non-matching to place operant task, that require cognitive flexibility and working memory, both of which are known to be impaired in\ndqvj | obesity and insulin resistance without being related explicitly to DA-signalling.\nr17u | Three point four point three. Insulin resistance has an impact on reward sensitivity\n3c47 | The effect of insulin on motivation and reward sensitivity goes beyond food intake. Insulin deficiency due to fasting increased reward sensitivity in an intracranial self-stimulation task. This effect was reversed by insulin and leptin administration. Equally, insulin deficiency due to STZ-application increased reward sensitivity, but only in the first three weeks. Afterward, this effect was abolished or even turned to the opposite showing reduced reward sensitivity. In this case, insulin application improved reward sensitivity. Equally HFD for fifteen to seventeen weeks reduced the attraction of male rodents to female urine, that is normally perceived as rewarding indicating that insulin resistance over a longer period of time leads to anhedonia - the loss of experiencing pleasure from usually rewarding activities.\ng345 | Three point four point four.
