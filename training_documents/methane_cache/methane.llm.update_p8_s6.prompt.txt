You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

1mvw | Particulate MMO. Mechanistic studies of pMMO are far behind those of sMMO, due to ongoing difficulties isolating highly active purified enzyme and uncertainty as to the atomic details of the active site (vide supra).9 Density functional theory (DFT) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/ MM) studies suggest that a monocopper Cu"-oxo species or a di (p-oxo)Cu"Cu" species could oxidize methane and that formation of the dicopper species is more favorable.126 Calculations using a dicopper active site model suggest that either a u-n1 :n2-peroxo Cu'Cu" or u-n2:n2-peroxo Cu"Cu" species is formed first and then is transformed into the more reactive di(u-oxo)Cu"Cu" species after O-O bond cleav- age.12
6d4s | 126,127 In later studies, a (-oxo) (u-hydroxo)Cu"Cu1II center was proposed to be the active species and was calculated to be more reactive toward methane than a di (u-oxo) Cu"CuIII species. Formation of this (u-oxo) (u-hydroxo)Cu"Cu" species is proposed to be facilitated by proton transfer involving residues Tyr374 and Glu35 (M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering, Tyr374 is not structurally conserved in other pMMOs) in the second coordination sphere of the dicopper center.12 It is important to note that these intermediates have been calculated based on the moderate resolution crystal structures of pMMO and have not been detected experimentally. Related to these ideas are recent studies of the zeolite Cu-ZSM-5, which can oxidize methane to methanol. Spectroscopic studies and DFT calculations show that the zeolite active species is a mono(u- oxo ) Cu"Cu" core formed from a u-n2:n2-peroxoCu"Cu" intermediate. 129,130 Although pMMO and the zeolite are fundamentally different, this work does suggest that it may be feasible to oxidize methane in an enzyme with a dicopper site.
mqah | One putative oxygen intermediate has been detected experimentally for pMMO. When reduced pMMO is reacted with H2O2 or reduced spmoB is reacted with O2 or H2O2, a new species with an absorbance feature at 345 nm is formed.131 The energy and intensity of this feature are consistent with a u- n2:n2-peroxo Cu"Cu" species like those formed in oxy-

Importantly, this intermediate does not form in variants of spmoB in which the ligands to the dicopper center have been mutated, consistent with O2 binding at the proposed active site. In addition, this species disappears in the presence of methane,11 and some methanol product is detected, indicating that it may be a relevant intermediate during methane oxidation. The identity of the actual species that reacts with methane, the pMMO equivalent to Q, remains unclear. Several studies using chiral alkanes suggest that C-H bond activation by this unknown species proceeds via a concerted, nonradical mechanism.136
vz32 | CONCLUSIONS
ncb0 | The two methane-oxidizing enzymes in nature, sMMO and pMMO, are completely different. The sMMO hydroxylase component, MMOH, is a soluble a28212 dimer, whereas pMMO is an a38373 trimer with both membrane-bound and periplasmic regions. The active site of sMMO is a well- characterized diiron center, but the atomic structure of the pMMO copper active site remains unclear. Similarly, the structural basis for substrate and product access to the sMMO active site has been partially elucidated but is not well-defined for pMMO. Both MMOs oxidize a range of hydrocarbon substrates, but pMMO has a narrower substrate specificity. sMMO exhibits higher turnover numbers than pMMO both in cells and in isolated enzyme preparations, but neither enzyme achieves levels desirable for biological gas-to-liquid conversion processes. The delivery of electrons to the sMMO active site in MMOH and the roles of MMOB and MMOR are reasonably well understood on the molecular level, although some aspects remain controversial. By contrast, the source of electrons for pMMO is still under debate, and possible protein interaction partners such as MDH require further investigation. The catalytic cycle of sMMO has been mapped out, and the intermediate that breaks the methane C-H bond, Q, has been characterized. Although mechanistic possibilities for pMMO have been considered, its mechanism cannot be further elucidated until lingering questions about the active site are resolved. Despite all these differences, the two systems share the unique ability to oxidize methane, and it is remarkable that nature has evolved two distinct large enzyme complexes for oxidation of a small gaseous substrate. Further study of how each MMO orchestrates the delivery of methane, oxygen, protons, and electrons to the active site, and how the O-O and C-H bonds are broken is essential to understanding these enzymes, their roles in the environment, and their potential biotechnological applications.
