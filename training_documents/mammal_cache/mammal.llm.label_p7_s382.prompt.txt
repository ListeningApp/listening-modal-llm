You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

y5r7 | The multivariate model analysis included sex, tissue type, and relative age as covariates to reveal additional modules that relate to life span in different tissues. The regression analysis found two modules with opposing correlations with maximum life span: the green module (life span <LATEX>r = 0 . 4 2 ,</LATEX> average weight <LATEX>r = 0 . 3 8 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P <</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. 1 0 ^ { - 3 0 0 } \right)</LATEX> and the greenyellow module (life span <LATEX>r = - \quad 0 . 4 4 ,</LATEX> average weight <LATEX>r = - \quad 0 . 3 5 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P < 1 0 ^ { - 3 0 0 }</LATEX> fig. S13J). The CpGs of the Lifespan Weight Rodentia (greenyellow) are located near genes that play a role in development <LATEX>\left( P = 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 3 } \right.</LATEX> table S4) and in RNA metabolism
lrry | <LATEX>\left( P = 6 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 2 } \right.</LATEX> Age-related consensus module in mammals
hvhm | The purple module (denoted subsequently as RelativeAge+ module) exhibited the strongest positive correlation with relative age (relative age <LATEX>r = 0 . 3 5 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P < 1 0 ^ { - 3 0 0 }</LATEX> Fig. 3E and fig. S13).
863b | To remove the confounding effects of spe- cies and/or tissue type, we also constructed seven consensus networks (denoted cNet3, ... , cNet9; for a description, see the supplemen- tary materials). The RelativeAge+ module was preserved in three different consensus networks (cNet3, cNet4, and cNet6; Fig. 2A), suggesting conservation in different species and tissues (scatter plot in fig. S11H). The purple Relative- Age+ module is positively enriched for CpGs in regulatory regions (e.g., promoters and 5' un- translated regions) and depleted in intron re- gions (fig. S15). Functional enrichment of this module highlighted embryonic stem cell reg- ulation, axonal fasciculation, angiogenesis, and diabetes-related pathways (table S3). The CpGs in this module are adjacent to Polycomb re- pressor complex 2 (PRC2, EED) targets, which are marked by H3K27me3 (table S3).
fj24 | Ingenuity pathway analysis implicated POU5F1 (alias OCT4), SHH, ASCL1, SOX2, and NEUROG2 proteins as putative upstream regulators of the RelativeAge+ module. We used Genotype- Tissue Expression project (GTEx) data to deter- mine whether the mRNA levels of any of these upstream regulators are altered with age in sev- eral human tissues. <LATEX>O C T 4</LATEX> [repeated-measures correlation <LATEX>\left( r m C o r r \right) = 0 . 0 7 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 } ,</LATEX> which is among the four known Yamanaka factors for cellular dedifferentiation, showed a positive increase with age in several, but not all, human tissues (fig. S11F). Nine other genes (e.g., HOXD10, <LATEX>r m C o r r = 0 . 1 6 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 4 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 0 }</LATEX> SRXN1, rmCorr = - 0.14, <LATEX>P = 4 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 2 }</LATEX> from the RelativeAge+ module also had a nominally sig- nificant rmCorr <LATEX>\left( P < 0 . 0 0 5 \right)</LATEX> in GTEx data (Fig. 3F and fig. S11G), although opposite aging pat- terns could be found in select tissues. These observations highlight the relevance of genes in the RelativeAge+ module to stem cell bio- logy and aging in human tissues.

ffx8 | life span of mice (Fig. 4, A to C). This in- cluded growth hormone receptor knockout (i.e., dwarf mice) (37) and caloric restriction (38), which extended life, and a high-fat diet, which elicited the opposite effect <LATEX>\left( 1 2 \right) . S i x \quad m o d -</LATEX> ules, including the purple module (RelativeAge+) showed a significant decrease <LATEX>\left( P < 0 . 0 5 \right)</LATEX> of the module eigengene in dwarf mice and after caloric restriction and, conversely, a modest increase after a high-fat diet. Although the magenta, black, midnightblue, tan, and green- yellow modules have connections to the max- imum life span in mammals, they did not present a clear relationship with interven- tions that modify murine life span (growth hormone receptor knockout, caloric restric- tion, and high-fat diet). This suggests a mu- tual exclusivity between the modules related to the maximum mammalian life span and those affected by interventions modulating the murine life span.
s6su | Transient expression of Yamanaka factors
y219 | We investigated whether a transient expres- sion of the Yamanaka factors in the 4-factor (4F) mouse affects the module eigengenes. The experimental design is shown in Fig. 4D, with additional details reported in the original article (39). Four of six of the above-mentioned murine intervention modules showed a nom- inally significant dose-dependent rejuvenation in murine skin <LATEX>\left( P < 0 . 0 6 \right) ,</LATEX> and two modules showed the same in kidney (dose refers to the duration of 4F treatment: 0, 1, 7, and 10 months of intermittent expression of 4F factors) (Fig. 4E). The purple, ivory, and lavenderblush3 modules were particularly sensitive to the <LATEX>4 F</LATEX> treatment (Pearson's <LATEX>r - 0 . 6 4</LATEX> in skin). In addition, the purple RelativeAge+ module's re- sponse to the 4F treatment is consistent with bioinformatic findings that OCT4 is an upstream regulator of this module. Among the life span modules, only the black module de- monstrates an increase <LATEX>\left( P = 0 . 0 0 7 \right)</LATEX> in skin of 4F treated mice, but this was not observed in the kidney.
06ht | Epigenome-wide association analysis of maximum life span
v3r2 | We performed epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) to identify individual CpGs with methylation levels that correlate with maximum life span. To reduce bias resulting from different levels of sequence conservation, our EWASs of maximum life span focused on 333 eutherian species, excluding marsupial and monotreme species. We restricted the analysis to 28,318 high-quality probes that are con- served between humans and mice.
nv42 | When relating individual CpGs to log- transformed maximum life span, we used several modeling approaches (for details, see the supplementary text). Briefly, our first approach, generic modeling, applied regres-
xags | sion analysis ignoring tissue type and age. In our second approach, we repeated the regres- sion analysis after focusing on a given tissue type. Third, we focused on specific nonover- lapping age groups: young animals (defined as age <1.5 times the age at sexual maturi- ty), middle-aged, and old (defined as age >3.5 times the age at sexual maturity; fig S19). Some of these regression models were further adjusted for average species weight (denoted LifespanAdjWeight).
jc47 | For brevity, we will focus on linear regres- sion models because phylogenetic regression models led to qualitatively similar conclusions (tables S13 and S14). The most significant life span-related CpGs are located in the distal in- neighboring TLE4 (Pearson's <LATEX>r =</LATEX> <LATEX>0 . 6 8 , P = 5 . 8 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 6 } ; \text { Fig. } 5 A \text { and table Sill and }</LATEX> HOXA4 <LATEX>\left( r = 0 . 6 6 , P = 7 . 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 5 } ; \text { Fig. } 5 A , \right.</LATEX> module) and are negatively correlated with a intron of GATA3 <LATEX>\left( r = - \quad 0 . 6 5 , \right.</LATEX> P = 8.8 x <LATEX>1 0 ^ { - 4 2 } ;</LATEX> remained so after phylogenetic as the CpGs neighboring TLE4 and HOXA4 (P = <LATEX>4 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>P = 4 . 8 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } ,</LATEX> respectively; fig. S17 and tables S11 and S12). The top 1000 life span- related CpGs (comprising 500 positively and 500 negatively life span-related CpGs) significantly overlapped (Fisher's exact <LATEX>P = 5 . 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 3 4 }</LATEX> with those found in our weight-adjusted analysis (LifespanAdjWeight).

xek3 | In general, methylation of life span-related CpGs does not change with age in mammalian tissues (Fig. 5B and fig. S20). The same can be seen from EWASs of life span restricted to ani- mals of a given age group (e.g., only very young animals; fig. S20D). The EWASs of life span in all animals (irrespective of age) is highly corre- lated <LATEX>\left( r > 0 . 7 \right) ,</LATEX> with the analogous EWASs re- stricted to animals that are young, middle-aged, or old.
bbpr | EWASs of life span showed good consis- tency with the eigengene-based analysis in the mammalian comethylation network. As expected, the following previously discussed life span- related modules were enriched with CpGs im- plicated by our EWAS of life span: midnightblue (hypergeometric test <LATEX>P = 2 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 7 }</LATEX> 67/249 overlapped CpGs), greenyellow (hypergeometric

The gene expression levels of 16 of these genes exhibited a highly significant repeated-measures correlation with chronological age (rmCorr <LATEX>P</LATEX> value <LATEX>< 1 0 ^ { - 5 0 }</LATEX> in different human tissues (Fig. 5C).
