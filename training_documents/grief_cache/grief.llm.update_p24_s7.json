It can be one of the most confusing feelings for the survivor and as such is at the root of many problems in the grieving process. A woman whose husband died of cancer said to me, \"How can I be angry? He didn't want to die.\" The truth is that she was angry at him for dying and leaving her. If the anger is not adequately acknowledged, it can lead to complicated mourning.\n40ry | This anger comes from two sources: from a sense of frustration that there was nothing one could do to prevent the death, and from a kind of regressive experience that occurs after the loss of someone close. You may have had this type of regressive experience when you were a very young child on a shopping trip with your mother. You were in a department store and suddenly you looked up to find that she had disappeared. You\nd1j2 | One Attachment, Loss, and the Experience of Grief\nwstc | felt panic and anxiety until your mother returned, whereupon, rather than express a loving reaction, you hauled off and hit her. This behavior, which Bowlby sees as part of our genetic heritage, symbolizes the message \"Don't leave me again!\"\nba1e | In the loss of any important person there is a tendency to regress, to feel helpless, to feel unable to exist without the person, and then to experience the anger that goes along with these feelings of anxiety. The anger that the bereaved person experiences needs to be identified and appropriately targeted toward the deceased in order to make a healthy adaptation.\nen95 | One of the riskiest maladaptations of anger is the posture of turning the anger inward against the self. In a severe case of retroflected anger, the person may be down on him or herself and could develop severe depression or suicidal behavior. A more psychodynamic interpretation of this retroflected anger response was given by Melanie Klein, who suggests that the triumph over the dead causes the bereaved person to turn his or her anger against him or herself or direct it outward toward others nearby.\nl3do | Blame\nu9bo | Anger is often handled in other less effective ways, one of which is displacement, or directing it toward some other person and often blaming him or her for the death. The line of reasoning is that if someone can be blamed, then that person is responsible and, hence, the loss could have been prevented. People may blame the physician, the funeral director, family members, an insensitive friend, and frequently God. \"I feel cheated but am confused not knowing who cheated me. God showed me something so precious and takes it away. Is this fair?\" queried one widow.\n7avo | Field and Bonanno observed two types of blame in their research. One involved blaming the deceased, the second blaming themselves. Those who blamed the deceased experienced more anger and other symptoms in the early months after the death and had fewer continuing bonds. Those who blamed themselves experienced more grief symptoms of all kinds and had difficulty accepting the reality of the loss. They tended to keep the deceased's possessions and to hold onto guilt that kept them connected to the deceased, rather than holding onto memories as a way of continuing attachments.\nuzo6 | Guilt and Self-Reproach\n89b4 | Self-blame, shame, and guilt are common experiences of the bereaved and can affect grief outcomes. Guilt and\n5f7e | Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy\nh83u | self-reproach-over not being kind enough, over not taking the person to the hospital sooner, and the like-are frequently seen in survivors. Usually the guilt is manifested over something that happened or something that was neglected around the time of the death, something that may have prevented the loss. Most often the guilt is irrational and mitigates through reality testing. There is, of course, the possibility of real guilt, where the person has indeed done something to cause the death. In these cases, interventions other than reality testing would be called for.\nkjoa | Anxiety\nwb1c | Anxiety in the survivor can range from a light sense of insecurity to a strong panic attack, and the more intense and persistent the anxiety, the more it suggests an abnormal grief reaction. Anxiety comes primarily from two sources. The first source is attachment-related anxiety. This is the fear the survivor will not be able to take care of him or herself and frequently comment \"I won't be able to survive without him or her\". Second, anxiety relates to a heightened sense of personal death awareness-the awareness of one's own mortality increased by the death of a loved one. Carried to extremes, this anxiety can develop into a full-blown phobia. The well-known author C. S. Lewis knew this anxiety and said after losing his wife: \"No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear. I am not afraid, but the sensation is like being afraid. The same fluttering in the stomach, the same restlessness, the yawning. I keep on swallowing.\"\nak13 | Loneliness\ns7el | Loneliness is a feeling frequently expressed by survivors, particularly those who have lost a spouse and who were used to a close day-to-day relationship. Even though very lonely, many widows will not go out because they feel safer in their homes. \"I feel so all alone now,\" said one widow who had been married for fifty-two years. \"It's been like the world has ended,\" she told me ten months after her husband's death. W. Stroebe, Stroebe, Abakoumkin, and Schut distinguish between emotional loneliness and social loneliness. Social support can help with social loneliness but does not militate against emotional loneliness due to a broken attachment. The latter can only be remedied by the integration of another attachment. Sometimes the need to be touched is a correlate of loneliness. This is especially true in cases of conjugal bereavement and often among the elderly.\n0lfu | One Attachment, Loss, and the Experience of Grief\ncnjl | Fatigue\nrtdl | Lindemann's patients reported fatigue, and we see this frequently in survivors. It may sometimes be experienced as apathy or listlessness. This high level of fatigue can be both surprising and distressing to the person who is usually very active. \"I can't get out of bed in the morning,\" said one widow. \"I am neglecting the house because I am tired all the time.\" Fatigue is usually self-limiting. If not, it may be a clinical sign of depression.\nnorp | Helplessness\nchx3 | One factor that makes the event of death so stressful is the sense of helplessness it can engender. This close correlate of anxiety is frequently present in the early stage of a loss. Widows in particular often feel extremely helpless. A young widow left with a seven-week-old child said, \"My family came and lived with me for the first five months. I was afraid I would freak out and not be able to care for my child.\" Helplessness is associated with Locus of Control. Those with more external locus of control feel at the mercy of circumstances and less able to exert a sense of control and self-efficacy.\nsfcf | Shock",
