Their familiarity with the animal may provide valuable insights. It is the caregiver who has had the best opportunity to have made key observations regarding a concern or illness, i.e., the \"chief concern.\" Sometimes the individual who has brought the pet to the facility is not able to convey the necessary information because of language, handicap, or another issue. This will direct you to attempt identification of the next most knowledgeable source of information. Always verify the patient's signalment as an easy means of beginning a conversation while avoiding misplaced diagnostic and therapeutic pursuits. There are many examples of diagnoses being made after a mistake in the record is identified. It is \"best not to assume anything.\"\nepu7 | Two. Diet and appetite. Animals with normal appetites are rarely critically ill. Changes in appetite, up or down, are easily and often observed. This reality is the reason that appetite is frequently a cause for concern and may be one of the first observed signs of illness. It may be important to know how much of an increase or decrease in appetite has taken place and over what period of time. Has the change progressively worsened or has it reached some plateau? Changes in appetite often parallel duration of illness. Dietary information is especially important in patients who are cachectic, obese, or who have chronic digestive system complaints. When possible, determine\n7od1 | Box One dash two\n0bqy | Essentials for the Complete History\nb780 | Signalment (age, breed, sex)\nccmb | Geographic origin and places visited\nma93 | Prior ownership and location (adopted from pound, found as stray, quality of previous care)\nc6hh | Current environment (indoor or outdoor pet; rural or urban environment; exposure to other animals and potential sources of intoxication)\ny7ea | Diet (raw meat, milk products, fish, commercially prepared, disease-specific or organ-specific diet, ingestion of wild animals) Prior medical problems (describe illness, medications used, and outcome)\nnav4 | Vaccination and parasite prevention status (history of prior worm infections; prior worming treatments)\ngem8 | Current or \"chief\" concern or \"complaint\"\ne8nr | Last known period of normalcy Disease onset-acute or gradual Progression and duration Intervening signs\nk78w | Previous treatments for the current illness and the animal's response\ng9du | Present status (weight loss or weight gain, attitude, activity level, appetite status, urination and defecation characteristics, amounts of water intake)\nf682 | the current diet, duration of providing that food, and all other sources of oral intake. It may be critically important to know if a diet is homemade or a commercially available food. Supplements and \"chew toys\" may be important.\nli1k | Three. Drinking, urination, and defecation patterns. These are three daily activities typically observed by owners. As such, they are common areas of concern and frequently represent an \"owner chief complaint.\" Even if an owner's chief concern appears unrelated to water intake, urine output, stool quality, or defecation frequency, having an understanding of the current status of these physical traits will be of general value and may help explain a primary concern. Answers to questions about these matters may provide the clinician with insight regarding the caregiver's observational skills.\npbea | As examples, polydipsia can be associated with numerous syndromes while adipsia will sometimes be a reason for an animal becoming severely hypernatremic. Polyuria can accompany the same syndromes associated with polydipsia while stranguria and dysuria will usually be associated with lower urinary outflow concerns. Stool quality and frequency of production could provide important information about the pancreas and intestines. High volume, greasy stools in a polyphagic pet who has experienced weight loss or difficulty gaining weight are typical of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Frequent watery stools are associated with small bowel dysfunction. Colonic disease is often characterized by a pet with stable body weight but who has straining (tenesmus), frequency, and the stool may be small in volume while containing blood and/or mucus.\nccpt | Four. Geographic history. Knowing the geographic background can provide important information because certain diseases are endemic to specific geographic areas. Clinical diagnosis can escape the clinician who fails to understand the importance of where the pet has traveled or lived.\n0fpw | Five. Describe home environment. Knowing the conditions of the animal's home is essential. A dog or cat that is allowed to be unattended outdoors might be subjected to various forms of trauma or be exposed to one of several of nature's maladies such as venomous snake encounters, toxic plant ingestion, etc. Behavioral problems can sometimes be traced to changes in the home environment. The addition or loss of a person or another animal from the home may be significant. Remember that pets may be exposed to or consume medications prescribed for people in the home.\ndqn8 | Six. The chronology of the sequence of events. Knowing when the animal was last normal and then being able to trace subsequent events in chronological order may help in understanding a concern. In some cases, this may help categorize the disorder as being either acute (occurring over the past hours or days) or chronic (occurring over a period of two weeks or more). The duration of subacute illnesses lies somewhere in-between.\ncop0 | Seven. The initial abnormal signs and their progression. This information provides the opportunity for the clinician to perceive not only how the illness began, but it furthers the understanding of the disorder by providing important information for how the illness progressed and its effects on the animal. As mentioned, it may allow the clinician to actually get a \"feel\" for the disease. This can be illustrated in a dog that is examined for initially vomiting a clear watery fluid. If the vomitus then progressed to being bile-colored and if the patient then begins to produce profuse watery brown diarrhea with or without hematochezia, it may be interpreted as gastritis that has progressed to involve the proximal and distal small intestine. The presence of bile provides evidence that the pylorus is probably patent.\nlhkq | Eight. Changes in body weight. Acute disease rarely causes significant weight loss. When weight loss is present in the acute setting, it is usually reflected in dehydration caused by water loss through vomiting and/or diarrhea. Polyuria, if present, will cause dehydration to develop quickly if the animal is not drinking. It is possible for an animal to lose as much as twelve percent of its body weight via water lost through vomiting and diarrhea while retaining muscle mass.\n82ju | The chronically ill pet may be brought to the veterinary facility with a \"chief concern\" of weight gain or weight loss. The hydrated pet with weight loss will have often lost both fat and muscle mass. These more chronic concerns have usually developed over a period of at least one to two weeks. Changes in body weight should trigger a number of questions directed at determining duration, changes in environment, diet, appetite, presence of intestinal signs, travel history, water intake and urine output, etc.\ny2qo | Nine. Vaccinations and medications. The owner of every pet should be asked about current, recent and previous medications given. Knowing what vaccinations have been given, when, and where may become valuable. Responses by the pet, positive or negative, to any medications should be noted. This information is not only important to help diagnose the disease, but might also help with its subsequent treatment management. A young dog may have been successfully treated at another hospital with glucocorticoids and parenteral fluids. Later, the dog relapses with the same symptoms after the effects of the treatment dissipated. This treatment history would be classic for adrenocortical insufficiency.\n```",
