You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ud3i | Above, I proceeded to compute Za directly by doing the Gaussian integral over momenta and integrating each position over the box. Here's a slightly different way. Because
8qfv | exp(-(E) =exp(-ßE1) ... exp(-BEN),
iers | the partition function Za is a product of integrals which are all equal:
z6h3 | BJR3 e-Bp·p/2m d3pd3q h3 .
qe1n | Za =
uaiu | 94
besh | The integral in the parentheses is the partition function of an single particle in a box. We have already seen that this equals
z6fn | JB JR3 e - Bp.p/2m ď3pd3q _V h3
c7zf | A3
iwkf | where A is the thermal wavelength. Thus we have
4jzo | Za =
i5zo | We can also do this calculation with a lot less work using Puzzle 36. This implies that when we build a new system from N identical noninteracting copies of some old system, the partition function of the new system is the Nth power of the partition function of the old system. What I just did is show this in a special case.

3h4l | GAS OF DISTINGUISHABLE PARTICLES: ENTROPY
my5y | In thermal equilibrium, an ideal gas of N distinguishable classical particles of mass m in a 3-dimensional box of volume V has expected energy
k3e7 | (Ed) = kNT 3
zuhq | and free energy
pt13 | A3N VN
rw3z | Fa = - kT In
voc3 | where A = h/V2TmkT is the thermal wavelength. Its entropy Sa is ((Ea) - Fa)/T, so
huha | Sa = kN In N (InN +3)
otjb | We use the subscript d for a gas of N distinguishable particles. Since the energy is a quadratic function of 3N variables, the equipartition theorem says the expected energy is (Ed) = kNT.
1rbe | The free energy F is minus Boltzmann's constant times the logarithm of the partition function, which we just computed:
z978 | Fa = - kln Za =- kln
qxdv | Thus the entropy of the gas is
06co | Sa = (Ea) - Fa T V( 3 +2). h =
jei2 | A = V2TmkT 3 2Tm h2 + 2 )
tti3 | If we expand this out using
r4pa | we get the formula I promised earlier:
ivgr | Sa = kN (InV +InkT +]]n
vobc | The only advantage of this messier formula is that it separates out the temperature dependence and the volume dependence.
3rdh | 96
lbvs | THE GIBBS "PARADOX"
2rt2 | For the ideal gas of N distinguishable classical particles in a box of volume V, the entropy
3ld6 | Sa = kN In V + InkT + In 3
1ac5 | 2 3 2Tm + 3 h2 2
oau9 | more than doubles if we double both N and V while keeping everything else the same. This confused people for a while, so it's called the 'Gibbs paradox'.
9i0g | Start with a box B containing an ideal gas of distinguishable classical particles. Then double the volume of the box to get a new box B', and double the number of particles in the box too, while keeping the temperature and everything else the same.
3w3y | We might expect the entropy to double. After all, we could take the doubled box and slip a thin wall down the middle to get two identical copies of the original box. So the entropy should be twice as big now. Right?
3ejg | Apparently not! Instead of just doubling the kN ln V term in the original entropy, we are replacing it with 2kN ln(2V ), which is more than twice as big. The reason is that in the doubled box B' each individual particle has twice as much room to roam than if you put a wall down the middle. Thus, it takes more information to say where all the particles are.
ehdq | While there's no real paradox here, people found this result deeply counterintuitive, so they called it the 'Gibbs paradox'. And in fact they had a good reason for being suspicious of this result. It would be correct if gas molecules were distinguishable. But in fact molecules of the same kind are not distinguishable they don't have little labels on them that let you recognize which is which. And if we take this fact into account, our formula for the entropy changes. Let's see how!

ba46 | GAS OF INDISTINGUISHABLE PARTICLES: PARTITION FUNCTION
bjmu | The partition function of an ideal gas of N indistinguishable classical particles of mass m in a 3d box B of volume V is
w8jo | Zi(8) = Za(B) N!
n4g6 | β 3N/2 = 1 VN N! h3N
xrzh | Thus
b5m5 | Zi(3) = N! A3N 1 VN
wu5k | where A = h(8/2Tm)1/2 is the thermal wavelength.
n462 | The partition function Zi for a gas of N indistinguishable particles is 1/N! times that for a gas of distinguishable particles. Why? We got Za by integrating exp(-ßE) over the space of ordered N-tuples of position-momentum pairs. The energy E here does not change if we permute our N-tuple, so we can also think of it as a function of unordered N-tuples. Then we get Z; by integrating exp(-BE) over the space of such unordered tuples. Notice that there are N! ordered N-tuples for each unordered N-tuple, except for N-tuple with repeated entries, which form a set of measure zero and thus contribute nothing to the integral. Thus, we should not be surprised that
7tg4 | Zi(B) = Za(B) N! .
5kya | But we've seen
7muy | Za(B)= A3N VN
3zl7 | where A is the thermal wavelength, so
i0sj | Zi(8) = N! A3N . 1 VN
slsh | Making this sketchy argument precise requires more notation. I think carefully doing the case N = 2 is the best way for you to see what's going on.

4nlx | GAS OF INDISTINGUISHABLE PARTICLES: ENTROPY
o3xz | In thermal equilibrium, an ideal gas of <LATEX>N</LATEX> indistinguishable classical particles of mass <LATEX>m</LATEX> in a 3-dimensional box of volume <LATEX>V</LATEX> has expected energy
84mq | <LATEX>\langle E _ { i } \rangle = \frac { 3 } { 2 } k N T</LATEX> and free energy
56tt | <LATEX>F _ { i } = - k T \ln \left( \frac { 1 } { N ! } \frac { V ^ { N } } { \Lambda ^ { 3 N } } \right)</LATEX> where <LATEX>\Lambda = h / \sqrt { 2 \pi m k T }</LATEX> is the thermal wavelength.
chel | Its entropy <LATEX>S _ { i }</LATEX> is <LATEX>\left( \langle E _ { i } \rangle - F _ { i } \right) / T ,</LATEX> so
asam | <LATEX>S _ { i } = k N \left( \ln \frac { V } { \Lambda ^ { 3 } } + \frac { 3 } { 2 } \right) - k \ln N !</LATEX> We use the subscript <LATEX>i</LATEX> for a gas of <LATEX>N</LATEX> distinguishable particles. Since the energy is a quadratic function of the <LATEX>3 N</LATEX> momentum variables, the equipartition theorem says the expected energy of this gas is
dixj | <LATEX>\langle E _ { i } \rangle = \frac { 3 } { 2 } k N T .</LATEX> The free energy <LATEX>F</LATEX> is minus Boltzmann's constant times the logarithm of the partition function, which we just computed:
a3t5 | <LATEX>F _ { i } = - k \ln Z _ { i } = - k \ln \left( \frac { 1 } { N ! } \frac { V ^ { N } } { \Lambda ^ { 3 N } } \right) .</LATEX> Thus the entropy of the gas is
jlbs | <LATEX>S _ { i } = \frac { \langle E _ { i } \rangle - F _ { i } } { T } = k N \left( \ln \frac { V } { \Lambda ^ { 3 } } + \frac { 3 } { 2 } \right) - k \ln N !</LATEX> In short, it is <LATEX>k \ln N</LATEX> less than for the gas of distinguishable particles. This makes beautiful intuitive sense: there are <LATEX>N !</LATEX> permutations of the particles that we no longer care about in the indistinguishable case.

y7r5 | STIRLING'S FORMULA
nhpx | Stirling's formula says
2yc2 | <LATEX>\sim \sqrt { 2 \pi N } \left( \frac { N } { e } \right) ^ { N }</LATEX> e N N
eehg | N!
ght4 | and it gives In <LATEX>N ! \approx \left( \ln N - 1 \right) N + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \ln 2 \pi N</LATEX> where the error goes to zero as
sx29 | <LATEX>N \rightarrow + \infty .</LATEX> Now we need a bit of math: Stirling's formula for the factorial function. In one form this says
j7hg | <LATEX>\lim _ { N \rightarrow + \infty } \frac { \sqrt { 2 \pi N } \left( \frac { N } { e } \right) ^ { N } } { N ! } = 1 .</LATEX> We abbreviate this fact, that the ratio of two quantities approaches 1 as <LATEX>N \rightarrow + \infty ,</LATEX> by saying <LATEX>N !</LATEX> is asymptotic to <LATEX>\sqrt { 2 \pi N } \left( \frac { N } { e } \right) ^ { N }</LATEX> . We also write
2c66 | <LATEX>N ! \sim \sqrt { 2 \pi N } \left( \frac { N } { e } \right) ^ { N } .</LATEX> where the <LATEX>\mathrm { s y m b o l } \sim \mathrm { m e a n s }</LATEX> 'asymptotic to'.
zzrc | If we take the logarithm of both sides we get
m1vl | <LATEX>\ln N ! \approx \left( \ln N - 1 \right) N + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \ln 2 \pi N .</LATEX> The symbol ~ has a vaguer meaning: 'approximately equal to'. But it turns out that in this instance the approximation is extremely good: the difference between the left and right sides goes to zero as <LATEX>N \rightarrow + \infty .</LATEX> In fact we will content ourselves with a cruder approximation:
ghtz | <LATEX>\ln N ! \approx \left( \ln N - 1 \right) N</LATEX> because in the entropy entropy of an ideal gas <LATEX>N</LATEX> is typically huge, so the term we have discarded here is dwarfed by the others.
72zw | Puzzle 47. Suppose <LATEX>N</LATEX> is Avogadro's number, close to the number of atoms in 4 grams of helium:
9v2o | <LATEX>N \approx 6 \cdot 1 0 ^ { 2 3 } .</LATEX> What is the ratio of <LATEX>\frac { 1 } { 2 } \ln 2 \pi N</LATEX> to
fn2s | <LATEX>N ?</LATEX> While deriving Stirling's formula is fascinating and not at all trivial, doing so would take us rather far afield. So I will resist, and refer you instead to this:

4r9c | THE SACKUR-TETRODE EQUATION
xbmu | In thermal equilibrium, an ideal gas of <LATEX>N</LATEX> indistinguishable classical particles in a 3-dimensional box of volume <LATEX>V</LATEX> has entropy
rp75 | <LATEX>S _ { i } = k N \left( \ln \frac { V } { \Lambda ^ { 3 } } + \frac { 3 } { 2 } \right) - k \ln N !</LATEX> where <LATEX>\Lambda = h / \sqrt { 2 \pi m k T }</LATEX> is the thermal wavelength.
62hx | Using Stirling's formula
n5mv | <LATEX>\ln N ! \approx \left( \ln N - 1 \right) N</LATEX> we get the Sackur-Tetrode equation:
3lem | <LATEX>S _ { i } \approx k N \left( \ln \frac { V } { N \Lambda ^ { 3 } } + \frac { 5 } { 2 } \right)</LATEX> Taking our formula
jm94 | <LATEX>S _ { i } = k N \left( \ln \frac { V } { \Lambda ^ { 3 } } + \frac { 3 } { 2 } \right) - k \ln N !</LATEX> and using a simple version of Stirling's formula, <LATEX>\ln N ! \sim \left( \ln N - 1 \right) N ,</LATEX> we get the famous Sackur-Tetrode equation:
v4s7 | <LATEX>S _ { i } \sim k N \left( \ln \frac { V } { \Lambda ^ { 3 } } + \frac { 3 } { 2 } \right) - k \left( \ln N - 1 \right) N</LATEX> <LATEX>\sim k N \left( \ln \frac { V } { N \Lambda ^ { 3 } } + \frac { 5 } { 2 } \right) .</LATEX> Note that with this formula, if we multiply both <LATEX>V</LATEX> and <LATEX>N</LATEX> by the same constant, the entropy also gets multiplied by that constant. In this situation we say the entropy is 'extensive'.
j6ud | For a better approximation, we can use
rlh2 | <LATEX>\ln N ! \approx \left( \ln N - 1 \right) N + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \ln 2 \pi N</LATEX> where the error goes to zero as <LATEX>N \rightarrow \infty .</LATEX> This gives a correction to the Sackur-Tetrode equation:
gwtt | <LATEX>S _ { i } \approx k N \left( \ln \frac { V } { N \Lambda ^ { 3 } } + \frac { 5 } { 2 } \right) - \frac { 1 } { 2 } \ln 2 \pi N .</LATEX> Here if we multiply both <LATEX>V</LATEX> and <LATEX>N</LATEX> by a constant c, we don't just multiply the entropy by c: we also have to subtract <LATEX>\frac { 1 } { 2 } \ln 2 \pi c .</LATEX> So the entropy is not quite extensive but this effect is tiny when you've got a mole of gas.
