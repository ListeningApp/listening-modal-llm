You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

d0ik | 2021). While pure quartz remained always strongly water-wet (brine contact angles <50°) for all conditions tested, aged quartz samples were weakly water-wet (brine contact angles 50-70°) for most scenarios examined (Iglauer et al., 2021). Al-Yaseri et al. (2021) and Al-Yaseri et al. (2022) reported contact angles for the clay brine and shale brine system based on empirical correlations as a function of pressure and temperature. All clays showed water wetting (0 < 40°) under all experimental conditions and were shown to be conducive to capillary and/or residual trapping of the gas (Al- Yaseri and Jha, 2021). The shale's H2 sealing capacity was shown to decrease with increasing depth and TOC values, but remained at strongly water-wet conditions with contact angles of not more than 17° at highest pressure and TOC (Al-Yaseri et al., 2022). The above measured and estimated data show that rocks are highly water-wet (contact angle < 50) in the presence of H2 at most storage conditions. However, based on the hydrogen wetting behavior of aged quartz and aged mica, Iglauer (2022) and Ali et al. (2022) demonstrated that 0 may increase to 90° or more at greater depth (3,700 m for quartz; Iglauer et al., 2021), which sets a limit to hydrogen storage capacity below which hydrogen will percolate trough the cap rock. In practice however, limitations on the depth are questions of economics and depths greater than 1,200 m are uncommon in underground gas storage facilities (Foh et al., 1979; Sedlacek, 1999b). The optimum storage depth for hydrogen can be computed based on the sealing capacity of the cap rock and the density of hydrogen gas that was estimated to be at 1,100 m depth assuming average geothermal and hydrostatic gradients (Iglauer, 2022). In line with CO2 storage, a minimum depth of 800 m is recommended in order to avoid spoiling potable water resources (Sedlacek, 1999b; Chadwick et al., 2008).
0x0s | 3.4 Cushion gas requirements
4exe | The capacity of any gas reservoir consists of two components: cushion gas (also known as base gas), which is used to maintain the minimum reservoir pressure and hence desired production levels, and working gas, which refers to the portion of gas that can be withdrawn and used during a storage cycle. In underground gas storage the composition of the working and cushion gas is generally the same. The total amount of cushion gas required depends mainly on the type of storage, with pore storages requiring higher cushion gas shares than salt caverns. However, no general recommendations can be made because the proportion of cushion gas in pore storage facilities depends on many reservoir parameters, such as storage volume, permeability and porosity, reservoir geometry, depth and the resulting pressure and temperature conditions. It also depends on technical configurations, such as well distributions, shut-in periods between injection and production, and the respective injection and production rates. In Germany, for example, the cushion gas share in natural gas pore storage facilities active and inactive ranges from 21 to 93% (Table 2).
0myz | Unfortunately, there are no direct experiences with pure hydrogen in pore storages we can draw on, but numerical reservoir simulations demonstrate that aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon fields can be operated with reasonable hydrogen recovery rates of 78-93% (Pfeiffer and Bauer, 2015; Feldmann et al., 2016; Sáinz-García et al., 2017; Heinemann et al., 2021b; Kanaani et al., 2022). Simulations of saline aquifers show that the injected cushion gas can efficiently displace
xh3i | formation water from injection and production wells, creating the conditions for subsequent hydrogen injection and withdrawal with significant improvements in UHS performance (Sáinz-García et al., 2017; Heinemann et al., 2021b; Kanaani et al., 2022). This also results in a lower demand for cushion gas in deeper structures and reservoirs with higher permeabilities (Heinemann et al., 2021b). Since hydrogen in particular involves considerable upfront costs, alternative cushion gas compositions such as nitrogen, CO2 or natural gas have been discussed in the literature to cut costs and/or CO2 emissions (Foh et al., 1979; Pfeiffer and Bauer, 2015; Feldmann, et al., 2016; Kanaani et al., 2022; Rhouma et al., 2022). Hence, the possibility of mixing with an inert cushion gas that is present in the reservoir must be considered (Foh et al., 1979). Gas mixing depends on viscosity and density contrasts (see Figures 1, 2), and is governed by diffusion and dispersion (Tek, 1989; Feldmann et al., 2016). A process that is particularly important to consider when converting depleted hydrocarbon fields with high gas saturation and low reservoir pressures (Feldmann et al., 2016). However numerical simulations of depleted gas reservoirs indicate that undesired physical phenomena such as viscous fingering caused by mobility and density contrasts are of minor importance in gas saturated reservoirs (Feldmann et al., 2016). Numerical simulations in saline reservoirs with hydrogen and nitrogen as working and cushion gas, respectively, demonstrate likewise the overall feasibility, but stress the importance of optimized injections schemes as the volume-weighted average hydrogen fraction of the produced gas increased from 52% during the first cycle to 85% in the fourth cycle (Pfeiffer and Bauer, 2015). In a most recent study of aquifer storage and withdrawal capacity, Kanaani et al. (2022) demonstrated likewise the operational feasibility and indicated that methane outperforms CO2 and nitrogen in terms of hydrogen recovery. The general feasibility has also been demonstrated in converted town gas storages across Europe (Foh et al., 1979; Foh, 1991). At Beynes, for example, natural gas was being injected on one side of the reservoir from 1972 while town gas had been withdrawn from the other side of the reservoir, replacing all of the working and 40% of the cushion gas with natural gas (Foh et al., 1979; Foh, 1991). Despite the fact that 60% of town gas resided in the reservoir, only minimal mixing of gases occurred during conversion, and less than 1% of the withdrawn gas consisted of the original town gas after conversion was completed in 1973 (Foh, 1991). It follows that detailed reservoir models are required to draw accurate conclusions about the demand and cushion gas requirements for any pore storage system, despite its general feasibility.
syiw | 3.5 Hydrogen solubility and losses
kg3t | The solubility of hydrogen in brine water depends on a number of factors, including temperature, pressure, and salinity, but it is generally lower compared to other gases such as CO2 or CH4 (e.g., Zivar et al., 2021). Hence, less loss due to dissolution is expected compared to other gases. Experimental and modelled data suggest that hydrogen solubility increases with increasing pressure, but decreases with increasing salinity resulting in less than 0.001 of mole fraction of hydrogen at storage conditions (Wiebe and Gaddy, 1934; Li et al., 2018; Chabab et al., 2020). This is important, because dissolved hydrogen may diffuse and leak out of the reservoir resulting in hydrogen loss. The rate of diffusion will likewise depend on a number of factors, including the temperature and pressure. Diffusion rates of hydrogen in brine water can be estimated
