Sarkosyl-\n1kke | soluble (Soluble) and sarkosyl-insoluble (Insoluble) fractions were immunoblotted using\nzp0n | following antibodies: R two two nine five for total Tau, GAPDH, and fluorescent Streptavidin (Biotin). iBEp\nf9ca | plus CHX indicated in blue for emphasis relative to iBEp alone (red). Data (right) are mean plus minus SEM normalized to respective DMSO controls.

Four-to-five month old hTau knock-in mice were stereotactically injected with iBEp in the left\n85ak | hippocampus and iBEp plus CHX were co-injected (blue) contralaterally. Hippocampi were\ngk8u | subjected to sarkosyl fractionation seventy-two hours post injection. The sarkosyl-soluble (Soluble) and\ndyg8 | sarkosyl-insoluble (Insoluble) fractions were immunoblotted using indicated antibodies and\nqoea | fluorescent streptavidin (Biotin). Quantification of soluble and insoluble Tau intensities\ned2n | normalized to soluble GAPDH.

Four times, twenty times and sixty times representative images are shown. Quantification of pTau signal\n7ojm | intensity was normalized to NeuN intensity.

Scale\nd5cm | (F) Immunohistochemical analysis of hTau knock-in mice stereotactically injected (schematic) with iBEp (red) and iBEp plus CHX (blue) contralaterally N equals six, three males, three females. Mice were collected seventy-two hours post injection and sections and stained with Thioflavin-S and antibodies against NeuN.\ncojo |\nlsvc | Thioflavin S-labeled beta-sheet protein structure is stained in magenta, NeuN is stained in blue.\nlfgp | Data are quantification of number of flame-like Thioflavin-S positive inclusions. Counting and analysis was blinded to experimental condition. p is less than point zero zero one by one-way ANOVA. Scale equals one hundred micrometers (right).\ny6yk | (H) Neuroproteasome inhibition induces accumulation of newly synthesized Tau. Primary fourteen DIV fourteen hippocampal neurons treated with DMSO or iBEp (red) were puromycylated for ten minutes. Tau-PLA-Puro labeling (pink) denotes newly synthesized Tau puncta, total Map2\ny6yk | positive dendrites (green), DAPI (blue). Higher magnification super-resolution image to bottom right. Quantification of Tau-PLA-Puro signal intensity was normalized to DMSO. p is less than point zero zero zero one by Paired T-test. Scale\n477w | treatment. This normalizes for the increase in puncta observed with iBEp treatment, allowing for\nu0zj | a fair comparison in size. p is less than point zero zero one by Paired T-test/size bin.\n```",
