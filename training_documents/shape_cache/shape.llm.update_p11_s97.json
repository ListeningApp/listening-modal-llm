The t-test achieved Power one minus beta error probability equals one point zero, Effect size D Z equals one point zero, satisfying our statistical power requirements. The mean increase in waist location height was one point two two centimeters, with a ninety-five percent confidence interval ranging from one point six seven to one point two seven centimeters. The eta-squared statistic (zero point five six) indicates a large effect size. Our results show that seventy-one point nine percent of participants had a higher waist\nhtm9 | height location when measured within the FFIT's S O B plus six point three five centimeters region. The large number of participants with their smallest waist existing above SizeUK's S O B plus four point zero centimeters region illustrates the need to consider measurement placement and its impact on shape definitions.\n8hul | We, therefore, accept Hypothesis three.\n87vz | Shoulder measurement's influence\nym66 | Investigating hypothesis four, we added shoulder measurements to a Multinomial Logistic Regression model\nl0a3 | alpha equals zero point zero five containing only the intercept. Adding shoulder measurements significantly improved the fit between model and data: x squared eighteen, N equals one thousand six hundred seventy nine equals three hundred twenty-two point three eight six, Nagelkerke R squared equals zero point one eight, P is less than zero point zero one. Shoulder-to-Shoulder measurements - Horizontal and Calliper - made significant contributions to the model, as Table four shows. Shoulder girth (full) did not, however, significantly contribute to the model. We confirmed Horizontal and Calliper shoulder measurements' Goodness of Fit through Hosmer-Lemeshow tests for each pair of groups, with both tests reporting\nu8nw | P is greater than zero point zero five. Considering parameter estimates, the Horizontal and Calliper shoulder measurements' predictor has six parameters: one for each of the FFIT body shape classifications, excluding the hourglass shape that acted as the reference group. To interpret the differences between predictors, Table five shows the parameter estimate and lists each shoulder measurement, standardized to: M equals zero, S D equals one.\nl2v9 | Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal) is the most powerful predictor for body shape classification compared to the hourglass shape. Bottom Hourglass prediction is, however, the exception.\nafbe | To improve the model's predictive power, we culled Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Calliper) from the model because of its insignificant association with the FFIT Body Shape Classification. The resulting model was statistically significant x squared sixteen, N equals one thousand six hundred seventy nine equals two hundred seventy-seven point two six five, Nagelkerke R squared equals zero point one six, P is less than zero point zero one, correctly classifying thirty-seven point two percent of all participants FFIT Body Shape. Despite the significant result, the model cannot correctly predict: Inverted Triangle, Triangle, Top Hourglass, or Spoon shapes, as Table six shows. Hourglass was the only shape with a high level of predictive capability: correctly identified in sixty-three point two percent of\n78r8 | cases. Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal) may, therefore, be a further factor in defining body shape. Systems like FFIT could include this measurement.\n320g | We, therefore, reject hypothesis four.\ntp8g | A one-way between-groups analysis of variance explored the FFIT body shape's association with shoulder-to-shoulder (horizontal) measurements. There was a statistically significant difference at the P is less than zero point zero five level for shoulder measurements for the FFIT's seven body shapes; F six, eighty-eight point eight seven equals forty-one point six five eight, P is less than zero point zero one. The R squared was zero point one six, indicating a large effect size. The ANOVA test achieved one minus beta error probability equals one point zero, Effect size F equals zero point four one, satisfying our statistical power requirements.
