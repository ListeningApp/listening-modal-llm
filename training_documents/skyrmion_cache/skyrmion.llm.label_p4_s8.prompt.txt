You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

5esx | For HS states, we find the largest concurrences up to <LATEX>C _ { \mathrm { H S } } =</LATEX> 0.16. Therefore, we use <LATEX>C _ { \mathrm { H S } }</LATEX> as a measure of reference to quantify the entanglement of the remaining ordered states. For the <LATEX>F P</LATEX> states (large magnetic field), we find almost vanishing entanglement in the bulk, indicating that the bulk spins are separable. Small nonzero values of <LATEX>C \approx 0 . 3 5 C _ { \mathrm { H S } }</LATEX> occur at the boundary due to the finite system size and strong DMI. Fi- nally, for the quantum SK states (intermediate magnetic field), we find that the spins inside the skyrmion quasiparticle are only weakly entangled, but we find concurrences <LATEX>C \approx 0 . 8 C _ { \mathrm { H S } }</LATEX> at the outer rim spins of the skyrmion, signaling significant en- tanglement of the quantum skyrmion with the field-polarized environment. Interestingly, both the helical state and quantum skyrmion show long-range concurrences between distant spin pairs beyond next-to-nearest neighbors.

pk06 | <LATEX>q _ { z } = 0 .</LATEX> In Fig. 7 we display <LATEX>d \sigma / d \Omega</LATEX> for the helical, skyrmion, and field-polarized states (see Fig. 6 for all components <LATEX>\mathcal{S} _ { \alpha \beta }</LATEX> of the structure factor). The geometry and local polarization of those states is displayed in Figs. 2(d)-2(f). Generally speaking, long-range magnetic ordering is signaled by the presence of Bragg peaks in <LATEX>d \sigma / d \Omega</LATEX> at momentum transfers <LATEX>q</LATEX> correspond- ing to the wave vectors of the ordering. We expect additional diffuse magnetic scattering components in <LATEX>d \sigma / d \Omega</LATEX> rooted in spatial variations of the spin orientation.
7wn9 | As expected, the cross section of the FP state in Fig. 7(c) is isotropic and exhibits a single broad peak centered at <LATEX>q = 0</LATEX> mainly caused by the component <LATEX>\mathcal{S} _ { z z }</LATEX> parallel to the external field. The contributions in <LATEX>\mathcal{S} _ { \alpha \beta }</LATEX> (& <LATEX>\in \left\{ x , y \right\} ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. \beta \in \left\{ x , y , z \right\} \right)</LATEX> are attributed to finite-size effects, caused by a helical winding of <LATEX>\langle S _ { r } \rangle</LATEX> near the boundaries due to the strong DMI interaction (see Fig. 2). The azimuthal average of the cross section in Fig. 7(c), defined as <LATEX>\left( 2 \pi \right) ^ { - 1 } \int _ { 0 } ^ { 2 \pi } d \varphi \left( d \sigma / d \Omega \right)</LATEX> can be well described by the form factor of a uniformly polarized thin circular disk with a radius <LATEX>R</LATEX> corresponding to the cluster ra- dius, i.e., <LATEX>d \sigma / d \Omega \left( q \right) \propto \left[ 2 J _ { 1 } \left( q R \right) / \left( q R \right) \right] ^ { 2 } ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>J _ { 1 } \left( z \right)</LATEX> the first-order Bessel function. To highlight this play the first two minima of <LATEX>\left[ J _ { 1 } \left( q R \right) / \left( q R \right) \right] ^ { 2 }</LATEX> (for <LATEX>\left. R = 4 a \right)</LATEX> by dotted white lines in Fig. 7(c) and find a very good agreement to the numerical data of the discrete system. The HS state in Fig. 7(a) is characterized by a superposition of spin spirals with wave vectors <LATEX>q \neq 0 ,</LATEX> resulting in six pronounced Bragg peaks <LATEX>\mathrm { i n } \mathcal{S} _ { z z } \left( q \right) .</LATEX> We observe in the SK phase a superposition of the two extreme limits: In particular, we find a Bragg peak at <LATEX>q = 0 ,</LATEX> together with an off-diagonal Bragg "ring" caused by the radial polarization winding of the skyrmion [see Fig. 7(b)]. The radius of the skyrmion can be as <LATEX>r _ { 0 } = q _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } \approx 3 a</LATEX> with <LATEX>q _ { 0 } \approx 1 / \left( 3 a \right)</LATEX> the momentum <LATEX>q \neq 0</LATEX> ring, consistent with the estimate given in Fig. 3. Hence, the predicted quantum skyrmion profile yields a distinct signature in the measurable neutron scattering cross section and allows a determination of its size. We want to stress that a classical spin

caos | profile compatible to the (normalized) quantum mechanical expectation values can lead to a cross section in qualitative agreement with the ones reported here. However, quantitative deviations are expected because, for classical systems, the spin-spin correlation functions factorize since the zero tem- perature configuration is nondegenerate for B = 0. Therefore, a direct measurement of the connected spin-spin correlation function (a,rÔß,r) - («,r) {ỡß,r) will differentiate classical from quantum skyrmion states at zero temperature. Classi- cal and quantum states also differ locally in the spin norm, which is not necessarily conserved in general | (Sr) | ≤ 1/2. We find that the domain wall spin norm at the outer rim of the skyrmion (where the concurrence is large) is about 4% lower compared to the field-polarized environment.
qrvy | VI. QUANTUM SKYRMION LATTICE PHASE
pn9j | After having discussed the properties of individual quan- tum skyrmions in the preceding paragraphs, we now turn to the phase diagram of the system. Our numerical technique makes it possible to reach system sizes much larger than that of individual skyrmions, which in principle allows us to extrapolate toward a phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit. While the HS and the FP phase remain unchanged when increasing the system size, at intermediate magnetic fields, the ground state for large lattices features a regular lattice of quantum skyrmions (SKX). Similarly to their classical analogs, the individual skyrmions form a dense packing, and for larger system sizes, we thus find quantum skyrmion chains and lattices, for which we plot examples in Fig. 8.

yeoh | We elucidate the appearance and robustness of quantum skyrmion lattices as a function of the external magnetic field, the strength of DMI, and perturbations of the form Eq. (2) due to uniaxial anisotropy. For this calculation, we have concen- trated on a triangular lattice with disk boundary conditions of diameter L = 9 sites, for which we obtain a single centered skyrmion for B = J = - 0.5D in the unperturbed case K = 0 [see Fig. 2(e)]. We relax the fine-tuned parameter lines of Fig. 2 by variations of B, J, and consider nonzero uniaxial anisotropies for J < 0 by varying K.
b8hf | Based on our simulations, we predict the existence of at least three distinct quantum phases of our model: (i) a region hosting HS states for weak field amplitudes, (ii) a valley for field strengths of the order of B ~ - 0.5D, which features a lattice formed by quantum skyrmions of radius r ~ 3a (SKX3a), and (iii) an FP phase where spins align parallel to the external field.
