        "content": "sl16 | Our first three lemmas, Lemmas C point one to C point three, will demonstrate that Type I steps produce sufficient decrease in the function value. The analysis of Type I steps builds off of Xie and Wright twenty twenty-three which demonstrated that projected gradient can achieve good progress, in terms of guaranteed decrease, when the active termination conditions seven a and seven b are unsatisfied. However, unlike Xie and Wright twenty twenty-three, which only uses a first-order step, we also incorporate second-order update in the form of Newton-MR step in the inactive set of indices.\nlrz1 | As shown in Lemma C point one, combining the steps in this manner suggests that the lower bound on the step size may depend inversely on the length of the Newton-MR step. This, in turn, could lead to small step sizes if the Newton-MR step is large. We deal with this issue by splitting our analysis into two cases. The first case, Lemma C point two, deals with large gradients on the inactive set where we expect good progress due to the corresponding large Newton-MR step on the inactive set. By contrast, the second case, Lemma C point three, deals with small gradients on the inactive set where we can expect to see small inactive set steps and therefore lower bounded step sizes. In this way, we trade off the convergence due to the inactive and active sets to always ensure sufficient decrease at the required rate.\nku5c | Recall that Assumption three point one implies that, for any y, x in the set of real numbers four, we have\n3z35 | f of y is less than or equal to f of x plus the inner product of the gradient of f of x and y minus x plus plus nine times the norm of x minus y squared.\n0xdu | Twenty-nine\nbpdv | We now give the proof of Lemmas C point one to C point three.\nb0xd | Lemma C point one, Type I Step: Step-size Lower Bound. Assume that f satisfies Assumptions three point one and three point seven. Suppose a Type I step is taken at iteration k of Algorithm two. If I of Xk and the expected value of k is not empty, then the largest step size which satisfies the line search criteria eleven, expected value of k, satisfies the following lower bound\ne106 | The expected value of k is greater than or equal to the minimum negative bracket, two times one minus p, Lg, the minimum of one, zero,\nmh8r | Thirty\nud3i | However, if I of Xk and zero k is empty, then\n8qfv | The expected value of k is two times one minus p, Lg\niers | Thirty-one\nz6h3 | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimisation with Nonnegativity Constraints\nqe1n | Proof. If the mathematical set I of x subscript k and the expected value of k is not empty, suppose\nuaiu | alpha is less than or equal to the fraction of the expected value of k over the norm of p subscript k to the set I, which is less than or equal to the fraction of the expected value of k over the infinity norm of p subscript k to the set I, so that for each i in the set I of x subscript k and the expected value of k, we have the projection of x subscript k to i plus alpha p subscript k to i equals x subscript k to i plus alpha p subscript k to i. The Lipschitz gradient upper bound twenty-nine yields\nbesh | f of x subscript k of alpha is less than or equal to f of x subscript k plus the inner product of g subscript k and P of x subscript k plus alpha p subscript k minus x subscript k plus the fraction of L subscript g over two times the norm of P of x subscript k plus alpha p subscript k minus x subscript k squared equals f of x subscript k plus the inner product of g subscript k to the set A, P of x subscript k to the set A minus alpha g subscript k to the set A minus x subscript k to the set A plus alpha the inner product of g subscript k to the set I and p subscript k to the set I plus the fraction of L subscript g alpha squared over two times the norm of p subscript k to the set I squared. It is clear from this bound that the line search will terminate for any alpha such that",
