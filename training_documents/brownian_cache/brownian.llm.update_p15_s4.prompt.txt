You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ak21 | As mentioned above and recalled in Appendix <LATEX>\mathrm { A } ,</LATEX> the LPA flow equation (88) exactly corresponds to the effec- tive potential of the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution
i7n1 | <LATEX>P \left( x \right) = N \exp \left( - \frac { 2 V \left( x \right) } { \Upsilon } \right)</LATEX> (126)
m9yn | We have verified that both the equilibrium position, given by the minimum of the effective potential,
cg8u | <LATEX>\partial _ { \chi } V _ { k = 0 } \left( \chi _ { e q } \right) = 0</LATEX> (127)
2hsv | and the equilibrium variance, defined from the effective potential's curvature through
7s7l | <LATEX>\mathrm { V a r } _ { e q } \left( x \right) = \frac { \Upsilon } { 2 V _ { , \chi \chi } | }</LATEX> (128)
uwdf | are reproduced to sub-percent accuracy, indicating the accuracy of the numerical solution to the LPA flow equa- tion, at least around the minimum of the effective poten- tial.
jjgp | In addition to the static variance at equilibrium, the curvature of the effective potential around the minimum also determines the time dependence of correlations in equilibrium, quantified by the time dependent covariance or connected 2-point function
df4g | <LATEX>\mathrm { C o v } _ { e q } \left( x \left( t _ { 1 } \right) x \left( t _ { 2 } \right) \right) = \frac { \Upsilon } { 2 V _ { , \mathrm { v } \chi } | } e ^ { - \lambda | t _ { 1 } - t _ { 2 } | } .</LATEX> (129)
qc2j | Here, <LATEX>\lambda</LATEX> corresponds to <LATEX>V _ { , \chi \chi } |</LATEX> within the <LATEX>\mathrm { I } \mathrm { P A }</LATEX> but the solution to the WFR flow equation (96) for <LATEX>\zeta _ { , \chi }</LATEX> also con- tributes, providing a correction to <LATEX>\lambda</LATEX> according to (119).
x3oh | In Table. I we collect the values of <LATEX>\lambda</LATEX> obtained using the fRG under LPA & WFR for different <LATEX>\Upsilon</LATEX> values, and compare this directly to high accuracy numerical simu- lations of the Langevin equation (4). We can clearly see from Table. I that the LPA can have good agreement with the simulation value for simple potentials at high temperature but can deviate drastically as temperature is lowered. Inclusion of the WFR factor <LATEX>\zeta _ { x }</LATEX> reduces the deviation error from the value obtained in the simula- tions substantially to <LATEX>\sim 1</LATEX> for the simplest cases and order of magnitude agreement for the most complicated, low temperature systems.
fqvx | The decay of the equilibrium covariance is shown in Figs. 6 & 7 for the polynomial and <LATEX>x ^ { 2 }</LATEX> plus 6 bumps/dips We can see - for the polynomial <LATEX>\begin{array}{} \text { potentials respectively. } \\ \text { potential } - \text { in Fig. } 6 \text { \left(a\right) } \end{array} ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\Upsilon = 1 0 ,</LATEX> that the LPA and WFR are both in good agreement with simulations and in Fig. 6 (b), <LATEX>\Upsilon = 1</LATEX> 1, that the WFR offers better agreement than the LPA. In Fig. 7 (a) we can see that for <LATEX>\Upsilon = 3</LATEX> the WFR prediction closely matches the simulations offering signif- icant improvement over the LPA which closely matches the bare <LATEX>x ^ { 2 }</LATEX> potential. This indicates that even for highly non-trivial systems - where the computation of eigenval- ues for these potentials is a non-trivial exercise - that
viae | the simulated decay is vastly different from the bare x2 potential - see Table. I and compare to the x2 prediction for \/2 which is 1 - the fRG can appropriately capture these effects.
p8u9 | It is also worth pointing out that the simulated decay rate does not follow a pure exponential at all times in all cases. This can be best seen in the top plot of Fig. 6 (b) where the decay is initially close to the LPA, then the WFR decay before moving towards the eigen decay rate at late times. This sort of behaviour has been identified
49ky | in similar systems in the early universe [46] where it was noticed that the smallest non-zero eigenvalue's spectral coefficient was sufficiently small that higher order eigen- values would dominate the decay at earlier times. As LPA matches the decay rate predicted by the Boltzmann distribution and WFR is closer to the decay predicted by E1. We discuss this further below.
p5wo | VII. RELAXATION TOWARDS EQUILIBRIUM
74rp | In order to solve the equations of motion for the one point function x(t) and two point function G(t,t') we must first solve the PDEs for the LPA & WFR to obtain the dynamical effective potential V and the function U. We will use the solutions obtained in Section V in order to compute these parameters and then solve the appropriate Effective Equation of Motion (EEOM).
oolg | A. The dynamical effective potentials
3ewf | In section IV we introduced the notion of the dynam- ical effective potential V given by equation (109) which together with (108) describes the evolution of the aver- age position, x. As the fRG guarantees that the fully effective potential V will be convex this implies that the dynamical effective potential V will also be either fully or extremely close to fully convex for LPA and WFR respectively thus greatly simplifying dynamical calcula- tions. In the previous section we emphasised how the fRG LPA effective potential gives us the Boltzmann equi- librium quantities such as equilibrium position and vari-
5iea | ance. What we would like to emphasise now however is that away from the minimum of the effective poten- tial the fRG gives us information that the near equilib- rium Boltzmann assumption does not. To be concrete, an approximate Gaussian Boltzmann distribution would assume that the potential is of the form:
62l5 | VBoltz(x)= 4 . Vareq Υ (x - Xeq)2 (130)
shub | where Xeq and Vareg are the equilibrium position and variance respectively. We show in Fig. 8 how this approx- imation can break down dramatically as one moves away from the equilibrium position suggesting that the fRG captures the far away from equilibrium dynamics well. In principle one could attempt to include higher order cumulants of the Boltzmann distribution such as skew- ness and kurtosis into an approximate effective poten- tial, however the relationship between these cumulants and higher derivatives of the effective potential is non- trivial and cumbersome to include. In any case it is not expected including these corrections would lead to signif- icant improvement away from equilibrium.
