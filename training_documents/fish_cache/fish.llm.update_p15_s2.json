        "content": "3g2y | Biology, fisheries, assessment and management of Pacific hake\ngc7v | the mid-1980s, led to Pacific hake being declared overfished below twenty-five percent of average unfished spawning biomass in the United States in two thousand and two. The strong nineteen ninety-nine year class was subsequently observed in the acoustic survey and fisheries, and a new assessment and abundance estimate led to the stock being declared rebuilt in two thousand and four.\nwqfv | The allocation issue was resolved with the development and eventual implementation of the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada on Pacific Hake/Whiting, the Treaty, which was signed in November two thousand three. The Treaty specifies a process for developing annual stock assessments and total allowable catch including a default harvest rate of F forty percent and fixed allocations of seventy-three point eight-eight percent and twenty-six point one-two percent for the United States and Canada, respectively. The Hake Treaty established a Joint Management Commission, JMC, that decides the annual TAC. JMC decisions are guided by the terms of the Treaty and the JMC's three advisory bodies consisting of the Joint Technical Committee, JTC, the Scientific Review Group, SRG, and an Advisory Panel. The JTC conducts the annual stock assessment and develops potential yield amounts for JMC consideration. The SRG assures the technical integrity of the stock assessment and the assessment's potential yield estimates. The Advisory Panel is composed of hake industry participants from the United States and Canada, who provide their perspectives about the fishery.\nj30a | Management of the coastal Pacific hake fishery is shared among the JMC, who recommends the annual TAC, the U.S. NMFS NOAA Fisheries and the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans, DFO, which are responsible for domestic management of their countries fisheries. In the United States, NOAA Fisheries receive advice from the Pacific Fishery Management Council, PFMC, which recommends specific management and enforcement measures. Canada gives priority to domestic fisheries in allocating yield between domestic and joint venture fisheries.\n7bdk | An Individual Vessel Quota system was implemented for the British Columbia trawl fleet in nineteen ninety-seven, with allocation based on a combination of vessel size and landings history. Although vessels may deliver joint venture hake quota to domestic shoreside processors, they are not permitted to deliver domestic allocation to joint venture/processor operations at sea. There is no direct allocation of quota to individual shoreside processors. IVQ holders declare the proportion of their hake quota that will be landed in the domestic market, and shoreside processors must secure catch from vessel license holders.\nfim0 | In the United States, yield is allocated among coastal tribes and the three domestic sectors. Washington coastal tribes have a treaty right to request amounts of fish to conduct fisheries within their respective usual and accustomed fishing areas. The Makah tribe has been full participants in the hake fishery since nineteen ninety-six. Beginning in two thousand nine, the Quileute tribe has been requested and allocated an amount but has yet to harvest any hake. The Quinault tribe has also expressed interest in the hake fishery.\nojro | A formal allocation structure for the U.S. non-tribal fishery sectors was developed by the PFMC and implemented by NOAA Fisheries in nineteen ninety-seven. Each year, the non-tribal allocation is divided among the shore-based trawl sector, forty-two percent, the mothership sector, twenty-four percent, and the catcher-processor sector, thirty-four percent. This action stabilised the fishery and resolved a highly contentious allocation battle and alleviated the race to fish. The allocation provides each group with a relative amount of stability in business planning by reducing the excessive competitive pressures associated with an open-access, derby style fishery: it slowed the pace of the fishery and opened opportunities for the fishery to act more rationally, improve product quality and expand product forms.\nl6t9 | Shortly after the nineteen ninety-seven allocation agreement, the companies licensed to operate in the at-sea catcher-processor sector of the U.S. Pacific hake fishery formed the Pacific Whiting Conservation Cooperative, PWCC, to promote rational harvest, optimal utilisation and minimal waste in the fishery. The PWCC fishing cooperative ended the race-for-fish in the catcher-processor sector fourteen years before the comprehensive rationalisation of the U.S. Pacific hake fishery. Their efforts resulted in decreased bycatch and waste, improved product quality and reduced fishing effort. The PWCC also sponsors scientific research, including stock assessment-related projects and bycatch avoidance programs. The cooperative model developed by the PWCC was later adopted in other fisheries, such as the walleye pollock fishery off Alaska.\n1ujy | Management of the U.S. fishery transitioned in two thousand eleven to a fully rationalised fishery, with an individual quota share program for the shoreside fishery and formal cooperatives for the mothership sector in addition to those for the catcher-processor sector. Bycatch of other groundfish species is strictly managed under the quota share system in the shoreside hake fishery, while sector-specific overfished rockfish species catch limits are used to ensure their minimal bycatch in the mothership and catcher-processor fisheries. Endangered Species Act listed salmonid impacts are managed under the aegis of a NOAA Fisheries Biological Opinion, for which specific measures include closed areas, seasonal fishery structure and overall limits on Chinook salmon bycatch.\nqzor | Mid-water trawl nets are required in the U.S. hake fishery. These are four-seam nets designed to catch schooling fish such as walleye pollock and Pacific hake, whose schools tend to behave in unison. Bycatch of non-hake species in the Pacific hake fishery is generally quite low, as Pacific hake tend to aggregate in large acoustically recognisable schools in the pelagic zone and mid-water trawl gear is fished off the bottom minimising interactions with non-hake species. Nonetheless, bycatch of limiting rockfish species has occasionally been an issue. The U.S. non-tribal hake fishery sectors are held to hard bycatch limits that, if exceeded, can result in closure of non-tribal fisheries, to limit impacts on certain depleted rockfish species. Prior to two thousand nine, the rockfish bycatch limits were not sector specific; that is, high bycatch in one sector could close the fishery for all the non-tribal sectors. In both two thousand seven and two thousand eight, there were mid-season closures due to bycatch of limiting species, but the\na0by | Biology, fisheries, assessment and management of Pacific hake\nu1ky | fishery was reopened later in the year once bycatch quota was reallocated from other fisheries. Despite these closures, about ninety percent of the U.S. hake TAC was achieved in both those years, similar to other recent years without closures. The bycatch limits were applied at the specific sector level beginning in two thousand nine, minimising the potential for one sector to affect the other sectors. Under the trawl rationalisation program, bycatch in the shoreside hake fishery is now managed using a quota share system.\nhtm9 | The three U.S. non-tribal sectors track tow-by-tow catch and bycatch amounts using real-time catch information collected by fishery observers. When the rare high bycatch tow occurs, that information is shared with the rest of the fleet so that other vessels can avoid fishing in the area of high bycatch. The U.S. hake industry also works in partnership with NOAA Fisheries in testing newly developed bycatch reduction devices specifically designed for the hake fishery. Lomeli and Wakefield two thousand twelve tested two open escape window BRD designs, with the goal of providing a tool to reduce the bycatch of Chinook salmon and rockfish in the hake fishery. The most successful design reduced bycatch by about eighty percent for Chinook salmon and twenty percent for widow rockfish.",
