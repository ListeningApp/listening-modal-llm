Both component level and system level responses for such braced frames are treated and discussed. For the component level response, a thorough review of the investigations on links, which are the primary sources of energy dissipation in eccentrically braced frames, has been presented. The results of experimental and numerical studies on strength, rotation capacity, and overstrength of links are discussed. Furthermore, studies on the effects of axial force, the presence of a concrete slab, the loading history, compactness, link detailing, and the lateral bracing on link behavior are summarized. Relevant available research on link-to-column connections is revisited. Different approaches for the numerical modeling of links are also given. For the system level response, characteristics of eccentrically braced frame systems are discussed in light of the capacity design approach. Findings of numerical studies on the seismic performance of eccentrically braced frames are discussed to provide insight into suitable response factors utilized in the design of these systems. Additionally, special topics and emerging applications of eccentrically braced frames, such as replaceable links, are provided. The impact of research findings on the design of eccentrically braced frame systems is demonstrated considering the American Institute of Steel Construction Seismic Provisions for Structural Steel Buildings. Finally, future research needs for improvement of eccentrically braced frame design and application are identified and presented.\nxrnt | One. Introduction\nc8ra | The main idea in the design of an eccentrically braced frame is to integrate the advantages of both moment resisting frame and concentrically braced frame lateral load resisting\np1l0 | systems into a single structural system. The eccentrically braced frame system originated from Japan in nineteen seventies with the aim of achieving a structure with high elastic stiffness as well as high energy dissipation during severe earthquakes.\n1i8b | There are several configurations for an eccentrically braced frame system, some of which are depicted in Figure one along with their expected plastic mechanisms. Larger architectural openings can be used with eccentrically braced frame systems when compared to concentrically braced frames. The short segment of the frame generally designated by the length \"e\" is called the link. In eccentrically braced frame systems, yielding is concentrated only at link segments and all other members of the frame are proportioned to remain essentially elastic. Therefore, during severe earthquakes, links can be considered as structural fuses which will dissipate the seismic input energy through stable and controlled plastic deformations.\n5sfj | A comprehensive review is provided in this paper on the behavior and design of eccentrically braced frames. The review includes research conducted on links, as they comprise the most critical elements of an eccentrically braced frame. In addition, the research on eccentrically braced frame system response is elaborated. Areas of future research needs are also identified. The comparison of design provisions as presented in various design specifications is out of the scope of this work; however, the American Institute of Steel Construction Seismic Provisions for Structural Steel Buildings are mentioned to illustrate relationships between research findings and design rules.\nvk4h | Two. Characteristics of Links\nnsm3 | Two point one. Yield Behavior, Shear Capacity and Overstrength\njdfw | The length of a link segment \"e\" is one of the key parameters that controls the stiffness, strength, ductility, and behavior of an eccentrically braced frame system. The link length ratio, rho equals e divided by the plastic moment divided by the plastic shear capacities of the link, provides a convenient measure for the yield behavior. The free-body diagram of an isolated link is shown in Figure two. Based on equilibrium, considering equal end moments at the ultimate state, no moment-shear interaction, and an elastic perfectly plastic material, the theoretical dividing link length ratio between shear dominated and flexure dominated behavior is the theoretical rho equals two point zero. In short (or shear) links, shear yielding of the web is found\nuc9r | to be predominant (Figure three a). On the other hand, in long (or moment) links, flexural yielding controls the link behavior (Figure three c). An intermediate link, however, would experience a combination of both shear and flexural yielding (Figure three b).\nl0ap | There are substantial differences between the behavior of short and long links. Although longer links provide more architectural freedom for openings, early experimental studies by Roeder and Popov and Hjelmstad and Popov showed that the performance of short links is considerably better than that of long links under severe cyclic loadings in terms of strength and ductility. Over the years Popov and his colleagues suggested different practical limiting lengths for shear dominated behavior, finally arriving at the limit of rho less than one point six, which is still in use in many design specifications including American Institute of Steel Construction three forty-one dash ten.\nx815 | The first comprehensive study on the behavior of intermediate and long links rho greater than one point six was conducted by Engelhardt and Popov in nineteen eighty-nine. A total of fourteen tests were conducted on twelve two-third scale subassemblage specimens with rho ranging from one point four five to four point two five. Based on the experimental results it was concluded that a gradual transition from the shear-dominant behavior to the flexure-dominant behavior occurs as rho is increased from one point six up to three. Despite this, in most of the previous and current specifications, links with length ratios of one point six less than rho less than two point six are classified as intermediate links while links with rho greater than two point six are generally referred to as long links. It is important to note that the presence of high axial force in a link may change this categorization, as discussed in Section two point three. Engelhardt and Popov also reported that moment-shear interaction has a notable effect on the behavior of intermediate links, while short and long links are generally unaffected.\nepbj | Terms such as very short and very long links are also used in the literature. Although there are no explicit definitions, links with rho greater than three to three point five are sometimes referred to as very long links while links with rho less than one as very short links. In twenty twelve, finite element analyses conducted by Daneshmand and Hashemi demonstrated that the behavior of very long links can differ notably from that of long links in terms of failure mode and ductility, and thus, dividing the long link range in design codes into two or more sub-regions was suggested. Furthermore, recent studies have proved that there are also other remarkable differences between the characteristics of very short links and short links, which will be discussed later.\nnmn2 | The nominal shear capacity (Vn) of a link can be defined as follows:\ng3tm | V sub n equals minimum of V sub p, two M sub p divided by e\ntfra | One",
