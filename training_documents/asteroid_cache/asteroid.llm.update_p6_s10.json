        "content": "f682 | to the four thousand five hundred fifty-four million years ago crustal metamorphism similar to the case of the Agoult apatite (discussed in the following subsection), or independent impact reheating similar to the previous NWA six thousand five hundred ninety-four apatite (Pb-Pb age of four thousand five hundred twenty-three plus or minus two million years ago). Conversely, the four thousand one hundred fifty million years ago merrillite accompanied by tridymite may represent the timing of an intense impact reheating event. The U-Pb systems in the Juvinas pyroxene and plagioclase were also severely disturbed. Their two thousand seven Pb-two thousand six Pb mineral isochron age was reported at four thousand three hundred twenty point nine plus or minus one point seven million years ago, which may be the result of an incomplete U-Pb reset at a later reheating event (i.e., the four thousand one hundred fifty million years ago event). The K-Ar system was further disturbed (the forty Ar-thirty-nine Ar age around approximately four thousand one hundred to four thousand million years ago), implying a weaker event. To summarize, Juvinas likely suffered severe impacts at four thousand three hundred twenty to four thousand one hundred fifty million years ago and weaker reheating at approximately four thousand million years ago. The metamorphic history of Juvinas can be explained as follows: (i) original crystallization at four thousand five hundred sixty-three million years ago, (ii) thermal crustal metamorphism and formation of secondary zircons at approximately four thousand five hundred fifty million years ago, (iii) closure/reset of the apatite U-Pb system at approximately four thousand five hundred twenty million years ago through slow cooling or reheating, (iv) a later reset of the U-Pb system in merrillite at approximately four thousand one hundred fifty million years ago through impact reheating, and (v) a final disturbance of the K-Ar system at approximately four thousand million years ago possibly due to a weaker impact.\nli1k | The U-Pb systems in the Camel Donga apatite are severely disturbed. Even though the mean model two zero seven p b star divided by two zero six p b star age was determined to be four thousand four hundred ninety-one point four plus or minus thirteen point five million years ago, the youngest outlier recorded an age of four thousand three hundred seventy-two plus or minus twenty-six million years ago (Fig. four). No apparent correlation was observed between the two zero seven p b star divided by two zero six p b star ages and the textural properties of the individual apatite grains (Figs. two and S two). The mean age of approximately four thousand four hundred ninety million years ago is approximately thirty million years younger than the two zero seven p b star divided by two zero six p b star age of the Agoult apatite (four thousand five hundred twenty-five million years ago; Fig. four). This time log of approximately thirty M between Camel Donga and Agoult is similar to the U-Pb systems in their zircons (Table one: Camel Donga, four thousand five hundred thirty-one plus or minus ten million years ago; Agoult, four thousand four hundred fifty-four point five plus or minus two point zero million years ago; Iizuka and oxides (Camel Donga, five point forty-three plus or minus zero point forty-two million years ago; Agoult, four thousand five hundred thirty-two point thirty-nine plus or minus zero point eighty-seven million years ago). The four thousand four hundred ninety million year ago apatite is consistent with a previous interpretation that Camel Donga resided in a distinct region on the parent body and underwent the thermal metamorphism at crust approximately twenty million years later than the other eucrites (Iizuka et al., two thousand nineteen). In addition, the presence of young apatite at four thousand three hundred seventy-two plus or minus twenty-six million years ago indicates that there was a distinct reheating event at approximately four thousand three hundred seventy million years ago, which caused an incomplete disturbance of the U-Pb system. Conversely, the forty Ar-thirty-nine Ar age in the Camel Donga plagioclase was completely reset at three thousand seven hundred forty-nine plus or minus twenty-five million years ago because of an independent impact (Iizuka et al., two thousand nineteen). This last event at approximately three thousand seven hundred fifty Na caused diffusion and brecciation of the host rock, even though reheating temperature was not high enough to reset the U-Pb system in the apatite. To summarize, the metamorphic history of Camel Donga can be described as follows: (i) initial crystallization at four thousand five hundred sixty-four million years ago (Hublet et al., two thousand seventeen), (ii) high-temperature thermal metamorphism in the crust at four thousand five hundred thirty million years ago, (iii) subsequent slow cooling until four thousand four hundred ninety million years ago, (iv) an additional impact causing an incomplete disturbance of the apatite U-Pb system at four thousand three hundred seventy million years ago, and (v) final impact brecciation at three thousand seven hundred fifty million years ago, where only the K-Ar system was\npbea | The mean two thousand seven p b star divided by two thousand six p b age of the Stannern phosphates also recorded young metamorphism at four thousand one hundred forty-three point zero plus or minus twelve point five million years ago (Fig. four), suggesting that they experienced severe impact reheating at this time. In contrast to Juvinas, both the apatite and merrillite in Stannern yielded identical ages. This may be because the host rock of Stannern was reheated more homogeneously to the U-Pb reset temperature. According to geochemical studies of the trace incompatible element trends, the geological backgrounds of Stannern and Juvinas should be different, which means that they resided at different locations on Vesta. Their identical reheating ages of approximately four thousand one hundred fifty million years ago indicate that there were two (or more) impact events on Vesta during this period, where the re",
