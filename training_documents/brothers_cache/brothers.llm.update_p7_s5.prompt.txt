You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0i1k | As the conflict escalated the international community scrambled to negotiate the conflict. It soon became clear, however, that both Ethiopia and Eritrea knew this con- flict would be settled on the battlefield, and not around the negotiation table. Ethiopian counter-offensives, first to retake Badme in March 1999, and later in May 2000 on the Tsorona, Zalambessa and Assab fronts, led to devastating losses. The entrenched Eritrean positions were attacked head on by waves of Ethiopian foot sol- diers. Tens of thousands of young men perished on the plains of Badme and hillsides of Tsorona. When the Ethiopian military command leadership later assessed the ter- rible details and losses on the Tsorona front, they reportedly all broke down crying.22
dqlg | During the spring offensive of 2000, Ethiopia managed finally to break through the Eritrean defence lines on the Western and Central front lines. The Eritrean gov- ernment ordered a strategic retreat. At the same time they communicated accept- ance of a negotiated settlement and cease fire agreement.23 Although parts of the Ethiopian military and political leadership wanted to continue the offensive towards Asmara, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi ordered a halt in military opera- tions and indicated a willingness to negotiate. Total Ethiopian losses amounted to close to 100,000 killed and 200,000 wounded, while Eritrea officially lost 19,000. My personal communications with former high ranking members of the Eritrean armed forces indicates that the number might be twice as high.24
p6pq | The Algiers peace agreement
zse6 | A Comprehensive Peace Agreement (called the Algiers Agreement) negotiated by the United Nations and African Union was signed in Algiers in December 2000, which should have paved the way for border demarcation and normalisation of bilateral affairs.25 At that time the peace agreement was hailed as a success and the international community expressed great optimism for a speedy normalisation of relations between the two warring countries. Soon thereafter, however, the peace process stalled as the parties apparently never truly committed themselves politic- ally to implementing fully the subsequent decisions reached in the internationally driven border arbitration process.
p2n3 | The most important aspect of the peace agreement was handled by the Eritrean-Ethiopian Boundary Commission (EEBC; the Commission), which, on 13 April 2002, made public its ruling on the delimitation of the border. At first, both countries issued statements proclaiming to be the 'winner' in the ruling. When it became clear that Eritrea had gained the contested village of Badme and the district of Irob in Tigray, however, Ethiopia protested the ruling. Badme village in itself is just a small cluster of houses without any significant strategic or economic value. However, as this was the site of the outbreak of hostilities and both parties had sac- rificed tens of thousands of troops in order to defend and reconquer the village, Badme had - and still has - a huge symbolic significance for both Eritrea and Ethiopia. The Irob, a small minority group defining themselves as Ethiopians, was granted to Eritrea.
ohh7 | Consequently, the Ethiopian government initially refused to implement the EEBC's border ruling in Badme and Irob, but welcomed the demarcation along the rest of the borderline.26 Since then, both parties have repeatedly accused each other of violating the principles of the peace agreement. The Ethiopian government argued for a more 'flexible' solution to the demarcation on the ground, to avoid for instance local communities being divided by the new border. This request was for- mally rejected by the Commission, which referred to the fact that the Algiers Agreement did not have any appeals procedure. While the Ethiopian House of Representatives voted on 25 November 2004 to accept in principle the EEBC's deci- sion (through its five-point peace plan), Eritrea rejected any talks prior to Ethiopian withdrawals from occupied territories. Subsequently, in a letter to the United Nations Secretary General of 8 June 2007, Ethiopia 'accepts the delimitation deci- sion without precondition'; but the frozen political situation between the two coun- tries stalled any initiative for follow-up on the matter.
vbni | Shifting identities during the period of estrangement: 2000-2018
dgcw | The devastating 1998-2000 war and the subsequent 'no war, no peace' stalemate which entailed a sustained militarisation of the border on both sides, kept the bor- derlands populations physically apart for twenty years. At no other time during a history which stretches back over 2,000 years has the Tigrinya-speaking highland population of Tigray and Eritrea been separate for such a long period. War and long-time physical and social separation will eventually lead to a reconfiguration of identities that used to be aligned and considered as affiliated groups. Research con- ducted in a border village on the Ethiopian side some years after the border closure notes that the younger generations have a very different conceptualisation of, and identity towards, their brethren on the Eritrean side, from their parents' gener- ation.27 The physical separation has naturally made an imprint on their under- standing of the 'other' on the other side of the trenches. What used to be conceptualised in terms of 'kinfolk', are now increasingly considered as 'aliens' by the youth.28 Will this shift in conceptualising identity, however, be a permanent fea- ture among the borderlands population?
gvwz | Due to the long separation and feeling of betrayal on both sides, many Eritreans and Ethiopians were hesitant about the possibilities of future reconciliation between the two peoples. Lacking any representative study, my impression is that more Eritreans than Ethiopians initially questioned the possibility for broad-based reconciliation between the two peoples. This may be due to a number of reasons. For one, the continued Ethiopian occupation of territories granted by the EEBC to Eritrea sustains the image of Ethiopia as a threat to Eritrean sovereignty. The domestic context in Eritrea has also contributed to and sustained the image of Ethiopia as an enemy: ie social and political isolation since 2000; sustained war mobilisation; and the lack of access to information and narratives other than that produced by the ruling People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ).29 This has been countered to some extent: as Eritrean internal grievances increased due to the regime's repressive nature, more and more Eritreans were saying in private conversations that 'we - the Tigrinya-speakers - are all one and only separated by political leaders'.3º
sk5m | Ethiopians have, on the other hand, 'moved on' quickly after the war. They demo- bilised their war army, the additional forces called up for the duration, and repriori- tised their resources to development projects. The restoration and reparation directive enacted in Ethiopia in 2009, which provides for restoration of property
qws8 | rights and compensation for Eritreans expelled during the war, has also shown an official capacity to reconcile and abolish the 'formal enemy image' produced during the war.31 In addition, as Ethiopia's challenging domestic political developments are the Ethiopian people's main concerns, accordingly, the enmity against Eritreans har- boured during the war has long since subsided and been forgotten.
877u | The fortified and closed Eritrea-Ethiopia border only had a sustained direct impact on livelihoods in the borderlands and political development in the northern border region of Tigray. This is also the region with the deepest political legacy of the war, as the TPLF was the primary adversary of the Eritrean government. Consequently, when the political power balance shifted in Addis Ababa with the change of prime minister in 2018, so also did the formal bilateral relations between the two countries.
