## Enzymatic Oxidation of Methane

ABSTRACT: Methane monooxygenases are enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of methane to methanol in methanotrophic bacteria. As potential targets for new gas-to-liquid methane bioconversion processes, methane monooxygenases have attracted intense attention in recent years. There are two distinct types of methane monooxygenase, a soluble, cytoplasmic methane monooxygenase and a membrane-bound, particulate methane monooxygenase. Both oxidize methane at metal centers within a complex, multisubunit scaffold, but the structures, active sites, and chemical mechanisms are completely different. This Current Topic review article focuses on the overall architectures, active site structures, substrate reactivities, protein-protein interactions, and chemical mechanisms of both methane monooxygenases, with an emphasis on fundamental aspects. In addition, recent advances, including new details of interactions between the soluble methane monooxygenase components, characterization of soluble methane monooxygenase intermediates, and progress toward understanding the particulate methane monooxygenase metal centers are highlighted. The work summarized here provides a guide for those interested in exploiting methane monooxygenases for biotechnological applications.

Aerobic methane oxidation in nature is carried out by methanotrophic bacteria, organisms that can use methane as their sole source of carbon and energy. Despite the extremely strong C-H bond in methane, these bacteria are capable of oxidizing methane to methanol under ambient conditions using metalloenzymes called methane monooxygenases. Understanding the biochemistry of methane monooxygenases is critical to their applications in bioremediation and to the development of biological processes for conversion of natural gas to liquid fuels and chemicals. Moreover, detailed characterization of methane monooxygenase active sites may lead to new biomimetic catalysts. A range of alkane-oxidizing enzymes exist in the environment, but only the two types of methane monooxygenase, soluble methane monooxygenase and particulate methane monooxygenase, as well as the close particulate methane monooxygenase homologue ammonia monooxygenase, can oxidize methane. Although soluble methane monooxygenase and particulate methane monooxygenase perform the same chemical reaction, their structures, cofactor requirements, and mechanisms are completely different.

Soluble methane monooxygenase requires three protein components for activity: a hydroxylase, a reductase, and a regulatory protein. The hydroxylase is responsible for methane oxidation and is composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits encoded by the mmoX, mmoY, and mmoZ genes, respectively. The regulatory protein and reductase are encoded by the mmoB and mmoC genes. The particulate methane monooxygenase hydroxylase consists of the pmoB, pmoA, and pmoC subunits, encoded by the pmoCAB operon. No regulatory protein has been identified for particulate methane monooxygenase, and the identity of its native reductase remains unclear. Most methanotrophs express only particulate methane monooxygenase. A few species express only soluble methane monooxygenase, and a subset contains genes for both particulate methane monooxygenase and soluble methane monooxygenase. In this subset, soluble methane monooxygenase expression occurs when copper levels in the growth medium are below one micromolar, and particulate methane monooxygenase expression is predominant at copper levels

above five micromolar. This "copper switch" parallels the metal cofactor requirements of the methane monooxygenases: soluble methane monooxygenase has a catalytic diiron center, and particulate methane monooxygenase utilizes a copper active site. The mechanism of the copper switch is still unknown, but recent work suggests that the copper-chelating natural product methanobactin, genes encoded by the methanobactin operon, and mmoD, a gene product of unknown function encoded by the soluble methane monooxygenase operon, could play a role. A transcriptional activator, mmoR, and a GroEL-like chaperone protein, mmoG, are required for soluble methane monooxygenase expression.

Studies of both methane monooxygenases over the past quarter century have provided much insight into their structure and function. This Current Topic summarizes work addressing the architecture, active sites, substrate reactivities, protein-protein interactions, and chemical mechanisms of both systems, with emphasis on fundamental aspects that must be considered if methane monooxygenases are to be exploited in new gas-to-liquid methane bioconversion processes. In addition, recent advances that have not been reviewed previously are highlighted. A more comprehensive review is available elsewhere.


## Enzyme Architecture

Soluble methane monooxygenase. To date there are twenty-eight crystal structures of the hydroxylase, primarily from Methylococcus capsulatus Bath, one structure of the hydroxylase-regulatory protein complex, two NMR structures of the regulatory protein, and two NMR structures of the reductase. The first crystal structure of the hydroxylase was determined in nineteen ninety-three, and a resolution of one point seven Å has been achieved. The alpha, beta, and gamma subunits are arranged as an alpha two beta two gamma two dimer composed mainly of alpha helices except for two beta hairpins in the beta and gamma subunits. The dimer interface involves interactions between the alpha and beta subunits, and a canyon region formed by

kDa) subunits are arranged as an a2/212 dimer composed mainly of a-helices except for two ß hairpins in the @ and y subunits (Figure 2A). The dimer interface involves interactions between the a and B subunits, and a canyon region formed by the alpha and beta subunits in each alpha-beta-gamma protomer provides the docking surface for the reductase and regulatory protein. The regulatory protein, which has no cofactors, consists of seven beta strands arranged in two beta sheets and three alpha helices. The reductase consists of two mixed alpha-beta domains: an FAD- and NADH-binding domain provides electrons to a two iron two sulfur ferredoxin domain for transfer to the hydroxylase active site.

Particulate MMO. The first crystal structure of pM M O was that of the M. capsulatus (Bath) enzyme, determined in two thousand five to two point eight angstrom resolution. Structures of pM M Os from Methylosinus trichosporium OB three B, Methylocystis species strain M, and Methylocystis species strain Rockwell have also been reported. The pmoB, pmoA, and pmoC subunits are arranged as a three hundred kDa trimer, which is consistent with electron microscopic data. The pmoB subunit, forty-two kDa, consists of two cupredoxin-like domains linked by two transmembrane helices. The pmoA, twenty-four kDa, and pmoC, twenty-two kDa, subunits are composed primarily of transmembrane helices. In three of the four pM M O crystal structures, an additional helix not connected to any of the pM M O subunits is observed and appears to interact closely with the pmoC. In the Methylocystis species strain Rockwell pM M O structure, this interaction is mediated by a lipid molecule. Since pM M O is crystallized from the native organism, this yet to be identified helix is likely physiologically relevant.


## METAL CENTERS AND ACTIVE SITE STRUCTURE

Soluble MMO. M M O H contains only one type of metal center, the diiron active site located in each a subunit in the a28212 dimer. This diiron center is housed within a four-helix bundle of which surface-exposed helices E and F play key roles in modulating structural changes throughout the catalytic cycle. Fe one is coordinated by His147, Glu114, and a water molecule, and Fe two is coordinated by His246, Glu243, and Glu209. The two iron ions are bridged by residue Glu144 and two hydroxides. Upon reduction, the Fe-Fe


## Current Topic

distance increases from approximately three point one angstroms to approximately three point three angstroms, and Glu243 undergoes a carboxylate shift, replacing the bridging hydroxide ion as a ligand to the diiron center. This shift opens a site for reaction with dioxygen. It is well established that the two iron ions are present as an antiferromagnetically coupled diiron three site in oxidized M M O H and a weakly ferromagnetically coupled diiron two center in reduced M M O H. A mixed valence form can also be generated, but does not play a role in the catalytic cycle.

Particulate MMO. In contrast to M M O H, several metal centers are observed in the structures of pM M O. All structures contain a copper binding site at the N-terminus of the pmoB subunit with ligands His33, which is the amino terminal residue of pmoB, His137, and His139, M. capsulatus, Bath numbering. Guided by extended X-ray absorption fine structure data, this site was modeled as two copper ions with a Cu-Cu distance of approximately two point five angstroms in the structures of M. capsulatus Bath and M. trichosporium OB three B pM M O, and in one protomer of Methylocystis species strain M pM M O. However, the moderate crystallographic resolution, two point six to three point nine angstroms, precludes definitive assignment of the nuclearity. This site was modeled as monocopper in Methylocystis species strain Rockwell pM M O and in two protomers of Methylocystis species strain M pM M O. Both of these pM M Os exhibit low copper binding stoichiometries once the enzyme is purified and concentrated. In the Methylocystis species strain Rockwell pM M O structure, a solvent molecule is modeled coordinated to the single copper ion and is within hydrogen bonding distance of Glu31, Glu35 using M. capsulatus Bath numbering. A monocopper site is also present at the equivalent location in the one point eight angstrom resolution structure of the soluble domain of the amoB

subunit from Nitrosocaldus yellowstonii AMO, indicating conservation of this site over the broad pMMO/AMO superfamily. However, in this structure, the copper ion is involved in a crystal lattice contact, and the N-terminal histidine ligand is disordered. In the M. capsulatus (Bath) pmoB subunit, an additional copper ion is present at the interface of the two cupredoxin domains, coordinated by His forty-eight and His seventy-two. The His forty-eight ligand is not conserved in other pMMO sequences, and the site is not observed in the other pMMO structures.

Several lines of evidence suggest that the crystallographically modeled dicopper center is the active site of pMMO. First, the ligands to the dicopper center are conserved in almost all methanotroph pmoB sequences as well as in homologous subunits from all members of the pMMO/AMO superfamily. The only exceptions are a few pmoB sequences from methane- oxidizing Verrucomicrobia. These sequences are evolutionarily distant, and it is possible that their extreme growth environments, pH zero point eight to five and twenty-two to eighty-eight degrees Celsius, require a different type of active site. Second, metal loading of apo membrane-bound pMMO only results in methane oxidation after addition of two to three copper equivalents per one hundred kilodalton alpha beta gamma pMMO protomer, consistent with an active site requiring more than one copper. Third and most important, a recombinant soluble fragment of the M. capsulatus (Bath) pmoB subunit, spmoB, can oxidize methane to methanol in the presence of copper, and this activity is abolished upon mutagenesis of two or all three of the ligands to the dicopper site. Consistent with this model, mutagenesis of the ligand equivalent to His one hundred thirty-nine in a homologous Mycobacterium NBB four hydrocarbon mono-oxygenase, HMO, that oxidizes C two to C four alkanes reduces activity significantly. However, in that enzyme, approximately twenty percent residual activity is retained, perhaps due to copper binding by the other ligands, as has been observed for spmoB.


## Current Topic

Both copper one and copper two are routinely detected in pMMO by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and all samples of pMMO exhibit an electron paramagnetic resonance, EPR, spectroscopic signal attributable to a type two copper two site. Correlation of EPR signals with specific crystallographic copper sites in M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO has been facilitated by comparative analysis of pMMO and the spmoB proteins. EPR and metal analysis using pMMO and spmoB variants that disrupt the monocopper, H forty-eight N, H seventy-two A, dicopper, H thirty-three, one hundred thirty-seven, one hundred thirty-nine A, or both copper, H forty-eight N_H thirty-three, seventy, one hundred thirty-seven, one hundred thirty-nine A, sites indicate the presence of a valence localized, mixed valence copper one copper two center at the dicopper site and a copper one ion at the monocopper site. The location of the copper two is proposed to be valence scrambled between the two copper binding sites with one copper coordinated by His one hundred thirty-seven and His one hundred thirty-nine, and one coordinated by His thirty-three and the N-terminal amino group. No water or hydroxide ligands to the copper two ion are detected.

An additional metal binding site is present in the pmoC subunit of pMMO. This site can bind zinc or copper, and the metal ion is coordinated by residues Asp one hundred fifty-six, His one hundred sixty, and His one hundred seventy-three, M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering. Recent metal binding studies using pMMOs from M. capsulatus (Bath) and Methylocystis sp. str. Rockwell suggest that zinc binding at this site partially inhibits activity, perhaps by interfering with proton transfer, and that this site is likely unoccupied by metal ions in vivo. Interestingly, a structure of Methylocystis sp. str. Rockwell pMMO soaked in zinc reveals a fourth ligand to this site, Glu two hundred one, Glu two hundred twenty-eight using M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering, which derives from a loop region of pmoC that is disordered in all previous structures. This region spanning pmoC residues two hundred to two hundred twenty-three, Methylocystis sp. str. Rockwell numbering, contains many strictly invariant residues, including Glu two hundred eleven, Phe two hundred thirteen, His two hundred eighteen, Phe two hundred twenty-one, and Val two hundred twenty-two, Glu two hundred thirty-eight, Phe two hundred forty, His two hundred forty-five, Phe two hundred forty-eight, and Val two hundred forty-nine using M.


## Biochemistry

capsulatus (Bath) numbering. The potential importance of this pmoC region is underscored by mutagenesis studies of the Mycobacterium NBB four HMO in which individual mutations in the residues corresponding to ligands Asp one hundred fifty-six, His one hundred sixty, and His one hundred seventy-three, M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering, completely abrogated hydrocarbon oxidation activity. Replacement of the residue equivalent to Asp one hundred sixty-six, M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering, also abolished activity, which is interesting because this residue is located on a flexible loop that points away from the metal binding site in the pMMO structures.


## SUBSTRATE BINDING AND REACTIVITY

Soluble MMO. In most studies, the activity of sMMO has been determined by measuring the epoxidation of propylene. This assay was preferred historically because the product, propylene oxide, is not further oxidized by methanotroph cells and extracts. For M. capsulatus (Bath) sMMO, the turnover number for methane is in the range of zero point two to one point zero per second at forty-five degrees Celsius and that for propylene is approximately zero point seven per second. The Km values for methane and propylene are zero point ninety-four and two M, respectively, and the Km value for oxygen is approximately sixteen micromolar with both substrates. For M. trichosporium OB three B sMMO, turnover numbers of three point seven per second and four point four per second at thirty degrees Celsius have been reported for methane and propylene, respectively, and the Km for methane is approximately twelve micromolar. The whole cell M. trichosporium OB three B sMMO turnover number is at least three point five per second.

sMMO can oxidize a wide range of hydrocarbons, including carbon one to carbon eight n-alkanes, alkenes, and larger substrates such as benzene, styrene, naphthalene, ethylbenzene, and cyclohexane. In addition, sMMO oxidizes various halogenated


## Current Topic

hydrocarbons, including pollutants such as trichloroethylene. Crystallographic data indicate that substrates and products can occupy a chain of hydrophobic cavities, denoted cavities one to three, in the alpha subunit of MMOH.

Cavities two and three are linked, but are only connected with cavity one, which is next to the diiron active site, when MMOB is bound to MMOH. A number of crystal structures with bound xenon, halogenated alkanes, and product alcohols have been obtained. The substrate analogues dibromomethane, iodoethane, and xenon bind in cavities two and three. Along with methanol and ethanol, the product analogues two-bromoethanol, three-chloropropanol, and three-bromobutenol bind in cavities one through three and can bridge the diiron center, replacing a bound water molecule. These structures are consistent with optical, resonance Raman, magnetic circular dichroism, electron nuclear double resonance, and EPR spectroscopic data showing that substrates and products can affect the diiron site. However, recent time-resolved resonance Raman data indicate that the product alcohol does not bind directly to the diiron center. Access to the active site cavity from cavities two and three is mediated by conformational changes in two residues, Leu one hundred ten and Phe one hundred eighty-eight, which form a gate. The functional relevance of this chain of cavities to the catalytic cycle remains controversial, however. Finally, an approximately ten angstrom long hydrophilic pathway called the pore region is present and may

function in alcohol and water release as well as play a role in proton transfer.

Particulate MMO. Because of difficulties isolating stable and active purified samples of pMMO, the enzyme kinetics have not been investigated thoroughly. Assays are further complicated by the use of different reductants, including NADH and duroquinol for isolated membranes, duroquinol for purified pMMO, and formate for whole cells. For isolated M. capsulatus Bath membranes, of which pMMO is the main component (such preparations are referred to as membrane-bound pMMO and can sometimes be crystallized upon solubilization without further purification), methane oxidation activities are in the range of twenty-five to one hundred thirty nanomoles per minute per milligram, depending on the preparation and reductant. Assuming that these samples are eighty percent pMMO, a turnover number in the range of three to sixteen per minute can be estimated. For propylene, membrane-bound pMMO activities are sixteen to one hundred twenty-three nanomoles per minute per milligram, giving an estimated turnover number of two to fifteen per minute. For purified M. capsulatus Bath pMMO, specific activities of seventeen to one hundred sixty nanomoles per minute per milligram for propylene have been reported, corresponding to turnover numbers of zero point one seven to sixteen per minute. Lower activities of two to twenty-three nanomoles per minute per milligram have been obtained for membrane-bound pMMO samples from M. trichosporium OB3b, Methylocystis sp. strain M, and Methylocystis sp. strain Rockwell, with very little activity after solubilization and purification. The whole cell M. trichosporium OB3b pMMO Vmax is eighty-two to three hundred nanomoles per minute per milligram total protein (measured by methane consumption), which corresponds to a turnover number of thirty to one hundred fifty per minute, assuming twenty percent of the total protein is pMMO. Similar Vmax values were measured by propylene epoxidation for whole cells of M. capsulatus Bath pMMO. Thus, preserving pMMO activity upon removal from the membranes remains an important issue. Apparent pMMO Km values for methane have been reported in the range of one to sixty-two micromolar. Notably, some methanotrophs, including Methylocystis sp. strain SC two, can produce a high affinity pMMO with a much lower apparent Km for methane. The molecular basis for this enhanced methane affinity is not known.

pMMO has a much narrower substrate range than sMMO and can oxidize only C one to C five n-alkanes and terminal alkenes to two-alcohols and one, two-epoxides. Analysis of the pMMO structures reveals a cavity at the proposed dicopper active site as well as a second cavity extending to the zinc binding site. However, the functional relevance of these cavities remains unclear due to the moderate resolution of the pMMO structures and the lack of structures in the presence of substrates and products or analogues thereof. A hydrophobic pocket the size of pentane in the pmoA subunit has also been identified computationally but is not near any of crystallographically observed metal binding sites. The narrow substrate specificity of pMMO and its ability to selectively orient substrates to produce R-alcohols suggests that a fairly restricted cavity must be present at the active site. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of the Mycobacterium NBB four HMO suggest that residue Ala one hundred fifty-one, which is equivalent to pmoC Asp one hundred sixty-six in M. capsulatus Bath pMMO, is important for determining substrate specificity. This residue lies at the interface of pmoB and pmoC, about eight angstroms from the dicopper center, and could modulate the sizes of the aforementioned cavities. Notably, AMO has a much broader substrate specificity, but there are no crystal structures of AMO, and the molecular basis for this difference remains unclear.

■ PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS

Soluble MMO. MMOH interacts with MMOB and MMOR. MMOB is essential for efficient hydrocarbon oxidation by MMOH. Binding of MMOB increases the reaction rate of reduced MMOH with oxygen by one thousand-fold, lowers the redox potential of the diiron center, changes the regioselectivity of substrate oxidation, and affects the structure of the diiron center. The two point nine Angstrom resolution structure of the M. capsulatus (Bath) MMOH-2MMOB complex reveals that MMOB binds to the canyon region at the dimer interface of MMOH, leading to the ordering of the N-terminal thirty-five residues of MMOB, which are not observed in the NMR structures, into a ring-like fold (Figure 7A). MMOB binding also causes conformational changes in MMOH residue Phe one hundred eighty-eight of the alpha subunit, opening up a pathway from the surface to the active site. In addition, Thr two hundred thirteen of the MMOH alpha subunit rotates inward toward the active site, forming new hydrogen bonds with Glu two hundred forty and closing the hydrophilic pore (Figure 7B,C). This residue has been proposed to play a role in proton delivery. Finally, MMOB binding induces small changes in

some of the ligands, including a shift of Glu two hundred forty-three to a coordination more similar to that in reduced MMOH.

MMOR transfers two electrons from NADH one at a time to the diiron site in MMOH via its FAD and two iron-two sulfur cofactors. There is no crystal structure of the MMOH-MMOR complex, but NMR titrations indicate that residues twenty-four to thirty-four in alpha helix one and residues sixty-seven to sixty-nine in alpha helix two interact with MMOH. Chemical cross-linking studies have suggested that MMOR interacts with both the alpha eighty-eight and beta eighty-one subunits of MMOH, and recent work using hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry and computational docking suggests that the ferredoxin domain of MMOR binds to MMOH at the same location where MMOB binds. At this binding site, the MMOR two iron-two sulfur cluster is positioned fourteen Angstroms away from the diiron active site and does indeed interact with both subunits. Consistent with these findings, MMOB inhibits MMOR binding as well as electron transfer. However, it is also possible that MMOB inhibits MMOR binding by forming a complex with MMOR.

Recent fluorescence anisotropy experiments suggest that MMOB has a higher affinity for MMOH in the reduced form, with a dissociation constant of zero point one seven micromolar, than in the oxidized form, with a dissociation constant of zero point five five micromolar, an observation that is difficult to reconcile with the lowered redox potential of MMOH in the presence of MMOB. Double electron-electron resonance spectroscopic data further suggest that the conformation of the N-terminal tail of MMOB is more rigid when MMOH is reduced. The key role of the MMOB N-terminus is underscored by data showing that mutants of MMOB disrupting the N-terminus display significantly reduced activity. In one functional model, MMOR is proposed to replace MMOB, transfer electrons to reduce the active site, and then MMOB is proposed to rebind to the reduced form, displacing MMOR, and initiating oxygen activation and methane oxidation. In the absence of experimental evidence for MMOR displacing MMOB from the oxidized MMOH, this scenario remains speculative.

Particulate MMO. Protein-protein interactions are not required for pMMO activity in vitro, but protein-protein complexes involving pMMO have been suggested. Besides the interaction with the mystery helix observed crystallographically (Figure 3), pMMO has been proposed to interact with the next enzyme in the methane oxidation metabolic pathway, methanol dehydrogenase. MDH is a periplasmic enzyme that oxidizes methanol to formaldehyde and is composed of a sixty-three kilodalton alpha subunit, which contains a pyrroloquinoline quinone/calcium ion cofactor, and an eight kilodalton beta subunit arranged as an alpha two beta two dimer. The M. capsulatus (Bath) MDH can also form higher order heterogeneous oligomers. A putative pMMO-MDH super-complex was isolated, and its structure was determined to sixteen Angstrom resolution by electron microscopy. This structure was interpreted as three alpha beta MDH monomers capping the periplasmic pmoB soluble domains of the pMMO alpha three beta three gamma three trimer. This pMMO-MDH complex exhibited moderately higher propylene epoxidation activity than pMMO alone, but its methane oxidation activity was not reported. Recent biolayer interferometry studies of MDH and pMMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) reveal a specific protein-protein interaction was also detected between MDH and the spmoB recombinant protein, indicating that the periplasmic regions of pmoB are involved. These data are consistent with reports that MDH is associated with the membranes in various methanotrophs. The observed complex is likely dynamic


## Current Topic

since a stable complex cannot be isolated by size exclusion chromatography, and its formation may depend on the presence of the membrane or other proteins. One proposal is that the lysine-rich beta subunit of MDH, of which the function is not known, interacts with pMMO and/or negatively charged phospholipid headgroups at the periplasmic membrane, thus associating with pMMO in a fashion that would be difficult to reconstitute in vitro. Such a model would not apply to methanotrophs that utilize a subset of MDH enzymes lacking the beta subunit, but these methanotrophs, which include the Verrucomicrobia, also have different types of membranes.

A pMMO/MDH supercomplex would provide a direct pathway for methanol produced at the proposed dicopper active site in the pMMO pmoB subunit to the active site of MDH where it is oxidized to formaldehyde. In addition, such a complex could directly provide reducing equivalents to pMMO through the cytochrome c sub L, the electron acceptor of MDH. Another and perhaps more widely accepted electron source for pMMO involves ubiquinol generated by a type two NADH: quinone oxidoreductase. In support of this pathway, NADH is an effective reductant for membrane-bound pMMO, but duroquinol is the only reductant that is effective after detergent solubilization. Duroquinol may mimic the function and redox potential of endogenous quinols, and it is known that methanotrophs produce a range of ubiquinones, but not menaquinone. Moreover, addition of NADH and NDH-2 to purified pMMO samples leads to a modest increase in propylene epoxidation activity. NDH-2 and pMMO can be copurified, but there is no evidence that they form a specific protein-protein complex. Finally, in M. capsulatus Bath, a cytoplasmic hemerythrin protein increases the activity of pMMO, suggesting that hemerythrin facilitates oxygen delivery to pMMO. However, there is no evidence for a protein-protein interaction between pMMO and this hemerythrin.


## Mechanism

Soluble MMO. The details of how sMMO activates dioxygen have been probed extensively by single turnover kinetic studies, resulting in the identification of transient oxygen intermediates, the kinetic and spectroscopic properties of which are detailed elsewhere. First, the reduced diiron two MMOH reacts with O two in the presence of two equivalents of MMOB to form a species O in which O two is bound, but not directly to the diiron cluster. Intermediate O is then converted to peroxo intermediates P star and P. For M. capsulatus Bath MMOH, P star is observed to be a diiron three site that differs from the subsequent intermediate P only in ligand arrangement. However, recent studies of M. trichosporium OB3b MMOH utilizing a variant of MMOB that slows conversion of P star to P indicate that P star contains a diiron two site similar in structure to the diiron two site in reduced MMOH. In this system, P star is proposed to form by displacement of the H two O by O two without electron transfer from the diiron two center. Thus, it remains unclear whether the two intermediates denoted P star are the same. The second peroxo intermediate, P, is a diiron three species, and spectroscopic comparisons as well as computational work suggest that a mu one two peroxo bridge is likely. Formation of P is pH-dependent and exhibits a kinetic solvent isotope effect in D two O, indicating that proton transfer plays a role. It is also possible to bypass the requirement for MMOB and MMOR in these steps by reacting the oxidized MMOH with H two O two as a source of both oxygen and

Biochemistry electrons. However, very high concentrations of H two O two are required, with an apparent K m value of approximately sixty-six mille M.

Intermediate P is then converted to Q in a proton-dependent step that results in O-O bond breaking. Intermediate Q is the species that reacts with methane to break the C-H bond. On the basis of Mössbauer spectroscopic data indicating the presence of two Fe ions in similar coordination environments and EXAFS data best fit with an Fe-Fe distance of two point four six Angstroms, Q was proposed to adopt a di mu-oxo diamond core structure. Difficulty reproducing this distance computationally combined with the observation that a model complex with an open core terminal Fe equals O unit can oxidize C-H bonds rapidly, although not those in methane, suggested Q might have an alternative structure. However, a recent time-resolved resonance Raman study reveals a vibration from Q that best matches vibrations observed for the diamond core in model compounds. Additional experiments with mixed isotopes of O two further indicate that Q forms via homolytic cleavage of the O-O bond. Once Q is formed, there are several mechanistic possibilities for C-H activation, including both concerted and radical or cationic processes. A range of approaches, such as the use of chiral alkane and radical clock substrates, the measurement of kinetic isotope effects, and computational analysis, have been used to investigate these options. After methane oxidation, Q is converted to the product complex T, which is proposed to have a mono-mu-oxo bridged structure.

Particulate MMO. Mechanistic studies of pMMO are far behind those of sMMO, due to ongoing difficulties isolating highly active purified enzyme and uncertainty as to the atomic details of the active site. Density functional theory and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics studies suggest that a monocopper copper two oxo species or a di mu-oxo copper two copper two species could oxidize methane and that formation of the dicopper species is more favorable. Calculations using a dicopper active site model suggest that either a mu-n-one colon n-two-peroxo copper two copper two or mu-n-two colon n-two-peroxo copper two copper two species is formed first and then is transformed into the more reactive di-mu-oxo copper two copper two species after O-O bond cleavage.

In later studies, a mu-oxo mu-hydroxo copper two copper three center was proposed to be the active species and was calculated to be more reactive toward methane than a di mu-oxo copper two copper three species. Formation of this mu-oxo mu-hydroxo copper two copper three species is proposed to be facilitated by proton transfer involving residues Tyr three seventy-four and Glu thirty-five in the second coordination sphere of the dicopper center. It is important to note that these intermediates have been calculated based on the moderate resolution crystal structures of pMMO and have not been detected experimentally. Related to these ideas are recent studies of the zeolite Cu-ZSM-five, which can oxidize methane to methanol. Spectroscopic studies and DFT calculations show that the zeolite active species is a mono mu- oxo copper two copper two core formed from a mu-n-two colon n-two-peroxo copper two copper two intermediate. Although pMMO and the zeolite are fundamentally different, this work does suggest that it may be feasible to oxidize methane in an enzyme with a dicopper site.

One putative oxygen intermediate has been detected experimentally for pMMO. When reduced pMMO is reacted with hydrogen peroxide or reduced spmoB is reacted with oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, a new species with an absorbance feature at three forty-five nanometers is formed. The energy and intensity of this feature are consistent with a mu-n-two colon n-two-peroxo copper two copper two species like those formed in oxy-


## Current Topic

hemocyanin and oxytyrosinase, a met copper two copper two species like that in methemocyanin, or a hydroxo-bridged copper two copper two center like that in the type three copper centers of multicopper oxidases. Because of the instability of spmoB and heme contaminants present in pMMO, further studies of this species by resonance Raman spectroscopy have not been conducted. Importantly, this intermediate does not form in variants of spmoB in which the ligands to the dicopper center have been mutated, consistent with oxygen binding at the proposed active site. In addition, this species disappears in the presence of methane, and some methanol product is detected, indicating that it may be a relevant intermediate during methane oxidation. The identity of the actual species that reacts with methane, the pMMO equivalent to Q, remains unclear. Several studies using chiral alkanes suggest that carbon-hydrogen bond activation by this unknown species proceeds via a concerted, nonradical mechanism.


## CONCLUSIONS

The two methane-oxidizing enzymes in nature, sMMO and pMMO, are completely different. The sMMO hydroxylase component, MMOH, is a soluble alpha two beta two gamma two dimer, whereas pMMO is an alpha three beta three gamma three trimer with both membrane-bound and periplasmic regions. The active site of sMMO is a well- characterized diiron center, but the atomic structure of the pMMO copper active site remains unclear. Similarly, the structural basis for substrate and product access to the sMMO active site has been partially elucidated but is not well-defined for pMMO. Both MMOs oxidize a range of hydrocarbon substrates, but pMMO has a narrower substrate specificity. sMMO exhibits higher turnover numbers than pMMO both in cells and in isolated enzyme preparations, but neither enzyme achieves levels desirable for biological gas-to-liquid conversion processes. The delivery of electrons to the sMMO active site in MMOH and the roles of MMOB and MMOR are reasonably well understood on the molecular level, although some aspects remain controversial. By contrast, the source of electrons for pMMO is still under debate, and possible protein interaction partners such as MDH require further investigation. The catalytic cycle of sMMO has been mapped out, and the intermediate that breaks the methane carbon-hydrogen bond, Q, has been characterized. Although mechanistic possibilities for pMMO have been considered, its mechanism cannot be further elucidated until lingering questions about the active site are resolved. Despite all these differences, the two systems share the unique ability to oxidize methane, and it is remarkable that nature has evolved two distinct large enzyme complexes for oxidation of a small gaseous substrate. Further study of how each MMO orchestrates the delivery of methane, oxygen, protons, and electrons to the active site, and how the oxygen-oxygen and carbon-hydrogen bonds are broken is essential to understanding these enzymes, their roles in the environment, and their potential biotechnological applications.
