You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

i3e0 | 3.2.3. Langevin dynamics. We now outline some examples for Langevin dy- namics, presented in Section 2.1.3. Since this dynamics evolves two variables, namely positions q and momenta p, we can in theory use both differential operators Vq and Vp to construct our synthetic forcings. This leads to additional options for each class of extra forcings.
78dj | Example 3.4 (Divergence-free vector field). The extra perturbation can be chosen as a first-order differential operator of the form
c1pj | (3.10) Čextra = GTV = G{ V q + G2 Vp,
6v9y | where G1, G2 are such that
deen | divq(G170) + divp(G270) =0.
27bo | A perturbation of similar form to (3.10) has been used and studied in [9]. For in- stance, in any dimension d > 2, a natural choice is G = AVH, or more gener- ally G = &'(H)AVH, where A is an antisymmetric matrix. Typical choices include

emhp | the symplectic matrix
tcgw | -I 0 0 I ,
4d8s | (3.11)
1cmq | or, more generally, linear combinations of matrices of the form
u8s6 | A = -BT 0 B
86m5 | 0 or A1 0 0 ,
lzzv | A2
623p | with A1, A2 antisymmetric. In all these expressions, A1, A2 and B can be functions of (q,p). The choice (3.10) leads to the generator
50lp | (Čextra4) (q, p) = G1(q,p)TVq+G2(q,p)}Vp,
i4nn | and the dynamics
nuk3 | dqt = M-1pt dt + anG1(qt, Pt) dt,
y2cn | dpt = - VV(qt) dt + n(F(qt) +@G2(qt, Pt)) dt - YM-1pt dt + VB 27 dWt.
hgm4 | When G = JVH with J the symplectic matrix, the extra perturbation corresponds to rescaling the Hamiltonian part of the dynamics, which is equivalent, up to a time rescaling, to changing the strength of the fluctuation-dissipation.
nc42 | Example 3.5 (Modified fluctuation-dissipation). We first consider an op- erator that is second-order in p. A simple choice for the extra forcing is Lextra = -B-1 *
tbfm | Ln, a = Cham + (y + an) CFD + Cphys.
ok18 | For this forcing to be admissible, we require that 1 +on > 0. The dynamics associated with Ln,a reads
pgqe | dqt = M-1pt dt,
qo9m | dpt = - VV(qt) dt + nF(qt) dt - (y + an) M-1pt dt + 2(y + an) β dWt.
e7zz | The effect of the extra forcing is to rescale the strength of the fluctuation-dissipation, either increasing it when an > 0, or reducing it when an < 0. More generally, one can scale this forcing by a function of q, i.e. consider Lextra = - a(q) * 2 with a(q): X -> R. One can also extend this form to matrix-valued diffusions of the form *D(q,p)Vp.
lhzk | We can similarly consider a second-order forcing in q. One possible choice for the generator is then Lextra = - B-1V q 7q. Here, we require that on > 0. The associated dynamics is
wdpw | dqt = M-1pt dt - anVV (qt) dt + 1 + V201 B .
twiq | dpt = (-VV(qt) dt + nF(qt)) dt - YM-1pt dt + V 27 · dWt,
cchx | β
2vma | where Bt is a standard d-dimensional Brownian motion independent of Wt. One can also generalize this choice by scaling it by a function of p, leading to the more general choice -b(p) VVq, or introduce a matrix-valued diffusion and consider VD(q, p)V q.
z4aw | Additionally, one could consider a mixed-term forcing, such as -B-1V q p or -- Vg. However, since the diffusion matrix must be symmetric and positive- definite, this prevents us from considering these mixed forcings without adding also a contribution -- 1Vq. Upon writing Ln,a as the sum of a first-order differential operator and Do: V2, we require that Da be symmetric positive, so that one can simulate the associated SDE upon taking the square root of Do, with
mo0p | Da = Do + QĎ, Do = Y 0 Id 0 0 ,
tyxr | where D denotes the diffusion associated with the extra forcings.
txaa | Example 3.6 (Feynman-Kac forcing). One possible form of the general forcing in item (3) of Section 3.2.1 is the following, for two functions §1 : Rd -> R and §2 : X -> R:
qz8s | Čextra = {1 (p)TV* + 52(q) TV+
y7de | The associated dynamics reads
rukn | dqt = M-1pt dt - an§1 (pt) dt,
5tu7 | dpt = - VV (qt) dt + n(F(qt) - a§2(qt)) dt - YM-1pt dt + V 27 β dWt,
vqgg | whose trajectories are reweighted using the Feynman-Kac weight involving §1 (Ps)TVV (qs)+ §2(qs)TM-1ps in the integral (3.4).
sbs5 | 3.3. Choosing the magnitude of the forcing. The synthetic forcing is com- prised of a physical forcing and an extra one, which translates into a perturba- tion Lphys + QLextra at the level of generators. We discuss here how to choose the magnitude o of the extra forcing in order to optimize it in terms of the linear response.
n413 | Recall from Section 2.2.1 that, for small values of n, we can think of the response as a polynomial in 7:
mvxd | ra(n) = En, (R) = np1(a) + n2 p2(a) + · + nn-1 pn-1(a) + O(n).
gyzb | In practice, we want to choose a such that the contribution from nonlinear terms is minimized. There are two main approaches to choosing such an optimal a, by (i) canceling the second-order response, or (ii) bounding the relative error with respect to the linear regime. We next discuss both options.
rrp1 | Canceling the second-order response. A first approach to reduce the nonlinear response is to cancel the second-order term 02, as this is the dominant part of the nonlinear bias when n is small. The second-order response is characterized by f2 in (2.25), which reads here
8b70 | (3.12) f2(a) = (Lo1)*(Čphys + @Čextra)*(Lo1)*S = f2,phys + @f2,extra,
nivt | where we decomposed the second-order perturbation of the invariant measure into its physical and synthetic parts. Since f2 is linear in a, the value of a for which p2 is
