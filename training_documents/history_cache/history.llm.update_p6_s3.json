However, most of the symptoms listed by Still and described in his cases do not refer to ADHD. Still also reported children who \"seemed to take a delight in tormenting the other children,\" for example by throwing other children's toys in the fire and laughing at their grief. He furthermore described children who pathologically stole or lied with extraordinary insensitivity to any punishment, children who were aggressive and attacked strange children or threatened to hurt their mothers, \"lawless\" children with \"a reckless disregard for command and authority,\" children with \"a complete lack of natural affection\" even to their parents, and children who showed cruelty to animals for example by attempting to put a cat in the fire or by \"cutting a rabbit alive smothered in blood.\"\nbfax | Still's concept of a \"defect of moral control\" is not consistent with the concept of ADHD. Still did not predominantly refer to inattentive-impulsive children, but rather described several types of deviant behavior observed in children. \"His description included the full range of externalizing behavior disorders,\" presumably many cases that would meet today's criteria for conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, learning disabilities, or antisocial personality disorder. All these cases were combined in the concept of \"defect of moral control.\" Among these cases, there were probably also some cases of ADHD such as the ones depicted above. Although the signs described by Still are consistent with some symptoms of ADHD, they are not sufficient for a clinical diagnosis of ADHD. Hyperactivity as a main symptom of ADHD is hinted at in one case, i.e., a girl who showed \"marked fidgety, almost choreiform movements.\" Still's work, nevertheless, \"represents a break from the more general medical discussions of morality\" and his original notion of an impulsive syndrome which was distinguishable from general intellectual retardation and symptoms caused by physical diseases is pioneering. He discusses both nature and nurture as possible factors underlying a lack of \"moral control\" and includes an elaborate description of family history in his cases. Still's Goulstonian lectures can be considered \"the groundwork for a\nf2y8 | category of mental illness that is specific to child deviance\" and a historically significant moment for child psychopathology in general. Regardless of whether or not Still's descriptions include some cases of ADHD, his work is nevertheless important in the analysis of historical ideas concerning ADHD. Still's demonstration of a connection between brain damage and deviant behavior in children was highly influential regarding the further conceptualization of ADHD.\no7qm | Postencephalitic behavior disorder\nd52l | Some authors including Tredgold in nineteen oh eight gave an account of a correlation between early brain damage, for example caused by birth defect or perinatal anoxia, and subsequent behavior problems or learning difficulties. This was confirmed by the encephalitis lethargica epidemic, which spread around the world from nineteen seventeen to nineteen twenty-eight and affected approximately twenty million people. The residual effects appeared as fatal as the encephalitis itself. The disease was thought to irreversibly damage the patients physically or mentally. Many of the affected children who survived the epidemic encephalitis subsequently showed remarkably abnormal behavior. The residual effects were described as \"postencephalitic behavior disorder\". Frequently observed features included a significant change in personality, emotional instability, cognitive deficits, learning difficulties, sleep reversals, tics, depression, and poor motor control. Children often became \"hyperactive, distractible, irritable, antisocial, destructive, unruly, and unmanageable in school. They frequently disturbed the whole class and were regarded as quarrelsome and impulsive, often leaving the school building during class time without permission.\" Bender described the postencephalitic behavior disorder to be \"best understood as an organic driveness of brain stem origin. This hyperkinesis leads the child to contact the environment continually, by touching, taking and destroying.\" Many descriptions of children with this disorder include some characteristic symptoms of ADHD, and some behaviors of postencephalitic cases might also be attributed to ADHD. Most of the afflicted children, however, would not have met the current ADHD criteria. The postencephalitic behavior disorder aroused, nevertheless, a broad interest in hyperactivity in children, and the findings were influential\nqlbb | The history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\nnhsg | for the further scientific development of the concept of ADHD. The era of the postencephalitic child pursued the course of Still and explained unconventional behavior of children physiologically and medicalized deviant child behavior. The assumption of a causal connection between brain damage and symptoms of hyperactivity and distractibility was important to the further conceptualization of ADHD.\nhy0l | Hyperkinetic disease of infancy Franz Kramer eighteen seventy-eight through nineteen sixty-seven, and Hans Pollnow nineteen oh two through nineteen forty-three\n4jmz | In nineteen thirty-two, the German physicians Franz Kramer and Hans Pollnow reported \"On a hyperkinetic disease of infancy\". The most characteristic symptom of affected children was a marked motor restlessness. The authors point out that the symptoms of this \"hyperkinetic disease\" had previously been observed and described by several authors, but the disorder had not been distinguished from other diseases with similar symptoms, such as the residual effects of the encephalitis lethargica epidemic. In their cases, the authors observed no bodily symptoms, sleep disturbances, or nocturnal agitation, which were specific to the postencephalitic behavior disorder. In contrast to the postencephalitic motor drive, the restlessness observed in the cases of Kramer and Pollnow could be observed only by day. The main symptoms of the \"hyperkinetic disease\" as described by Kramer and Pollnow are very similar to the current concept of ADHD.",
