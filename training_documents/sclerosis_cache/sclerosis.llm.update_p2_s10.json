        "content": "1k9e | There is proof that some individuals have an inherited susceptibility to MS. However, this genetic susceptibility is not inherited since there is no MS-specific gene. Genetic studies have shown a connection between first, second, and third-degree relatives.\n5bjs | Diseases\nuodj | It has been postulated that bacterial or viral infections may promote the later development of MS in genetically susceptible individuals. Disorders in late childhood may introduce foreign antigens that activate Th1 cells and induce the characteristic of the autoimmune response of MS.\nk16v | Injury\nb2lm | Severe injuries that directly damage the brain or spinal cord have been investigated as possible triggers for MS. Trauma increases the permeability of the BBB, thus facilitating the entry of Th1 cells into the CNS. This\nti7f | is the initiating factor for the inflammatory response that leads to myelin destruction and the formation of MS lesions.\noksu | Cigarette Smoking\nwtow | Smoking is associated with higher risk of MS. Smokers with MS have a worse long-term prognosis and a greater incidence of brain atrophy than non-smokers. In addition, MS sufferers are more likely to smoke than general population. MS patients are more likely than the general population to have comorbid conditions associated with worse quality of life, a higher burden of disability, and higher mortality rates.\no22k | Epidemiology\nnwfz | MS is one of the most prevalent neurologic illnesses in the world and, in many countries, the leading cause of non-traumatic neurologic impairment in young people. MS affects around four hundred thousand people in the United States and two point five million worldwide. MS is now more prevalent among women; however, this was not always the case. In the early nineteen hundreds, the sex ratio was about equal. Since then, the sex ratio in most industrialized nations has progressively increased and is close to three to one female to male. Smoking raises MS risk by about fifty percent. Although the average age of onset is between twenty and forty years, the disease can manifest at any age. Almost ten percent of cases are diagnosed before the age of eighteen. In some cases, MS diagnosed after the age of fifty is known as \"late-onset multiple sclerosis,\" which is a rare case. Populations of European ancestry are estimated to have a prevalence of one in one thousand. Less is known about prevalence among non-European groups, and most research points to a lower frequency among individuals of East Asian and African heritage. Recent research has shown that African-American communities have a prevalence rate comparable to European communities. MS has a prevalence gradient dependent on latitude, with a higher incidence in the northern latitudes of Europe and North America. Observations indicating varied genetic susceptibility factors have also been observed in distinct human subpopulations, independent of latitude, indicating the interaction of poorly understood genetic and environmental components. Multiple studies have shown that populations that relocate to regions with a higher incidence of MS during infancy have a higher chance of developing the disease.\nnvfy | Pathophysiology\nmror | MS refers to the formation of plaques in CNS along with inflammation, demyelination, axonal damage, and axonal loss. These plaques are located in the brain and spinal cord, mainly in the white matter surrounding the ventricles, optic nerves and tracts, corpus callosum, cerebellar peduncles, long tracts, and subpial area of the spinal cord and brainstem, as well as gray matter. They have expressed in all forms of MS (primary, secondary, and relapsing-remitting MS). Still, their expression varies over time, demonstrating a profound heterogeneity in the immunopathological patterns of demyelination and oligodendrocyte degeneration between the relapsing-remitting course and the progressive forms of the disease. MS is considered an autoimmune disease caused by autoreactive immune cells that traverse BBB and attack the CNS. Regular deletion of autoreactive immune cells during development occurs in the thymus or bone marrow through central tolerance B cells. Although some may escape this process and be released into circulation, peripheral tolerance mechanisms prevent them from causing disease in most cases. The impaired function of regulatory T cells and the resistance of autoreactive T cells to suppression are two mechanisms through which peripheral tolerance might fail. A complicated interaction between genetic and environmental risk factors may affect the activity and activation of these autoreactive cells, therefore contributing to the development of disease. The primary T cell subsets implicated in MS include CD8 positive T cells, CD4 positive Th1 cells, and Th17 cells. Interferon gamma, IL-17, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors are cytokines produced by autoreactive T cells that may contribute to the pathophysiology of MS. The increased immunoglobulin in cerebral fluid suggests a role for B cells in MS. Intrathecal production of oligoclonal immunoglobulins, also known as oligoclonal bands, is a diagnostic feature of MS. In MS, the majority of B cells in cerebrospinal fluid and brain parenchyma are CD27 positive memory B cells. Memory B cells are clonally enlarged in the CSF and brain parenchyma and exhibit somatic hypermutation and class-switched immunoglobulin transcripts. Furthermore, the overlap of the CSF immunoglobulin proteomes and the B cell immunoglobulin transcriptomes provides evidence that antibody-secreting cells derived from clonally expanded B cells within the CNS are a significant source of excessive intrathecal clonal immunoglobulin production, as demonstrated by the presence of oligoclonal bands in CSF.\nzlxc | Meninges in MS patients include inflammatory B cell infiltrates, and a greater load of these injects to the severity of cortical lesions, neurodegeneration, and clinical impairment. B cells may serve as Epstein-Barr Virus reservoirs. After EBV infection, B cells transform into antigen-processing cells, resulting in a more precise presentation of antigens. Recombinant human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein was shown to be internalized and cross-presented by EBV-infected B-cells, which were efficiently identified by cytotoxic CD8 positive T-cells. Furthermore, B cells obtained from MS patients had more CD40 on their surface, indicating that B cells deliver antigens more effectively. Increased expression of B cell activation markers in individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis was related to a high degree of neurodegeneration, as indicated by a rise in the number of T1 hyperintense lesions and a decrease in brain",
