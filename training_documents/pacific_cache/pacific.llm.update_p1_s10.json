Their productivity, structural complexity, and biodiversity critically depend on ecosystem services provided by corals that are threatened because of climate change effects-in particular, ocean warming and acidification. The coral holobiont is composed of the coral animal host, endosymbiotic dinoflagellates,\nccpt | associated viruses, bacteria, and other microeukaryotes. In particular, the mandatory photosymbiosis with microalgae of the family Symbiodiniaceae and its consequences on the evolution, physiology, and stress resilience of the coral holobiont have yet to be fully elucidated. The functioning of the holobiont as a whole is largely unknown, although bacteria and viruses are presumed to play roles in metabolic interactions, immunity, and stress tolerance. In the context of climate change and anthropogenic threats on coral reef ecosystems, the Tara Pacific project aims to provide a baseline of the \"omics\" complexity of the coral holobiont and its ecosystem across the Pacific Ocean and for various oceanographically distinct defined areas. Inspired by the previous Tara Oceans expeditions, the Tara Pacific expedition, from twenty sixteen to twenty eighteen, has applied a pan-ecosystemic approach on coral reefs throughout the Pacific Ocean, drawing an east-west transect from Panama to Papua New Guinea and a south-north transect from Australia to Japan, sampling corals throughout thirty-two island systems with local replicates. Tara Pacific has developed and applied state-of-the-art technologies in very-high-throughput genetic sequencing and molecular analysis to reveal the entire microbial and chemical diversity as well as functional traits associated with coral holobionts, together with various measures on environmental forcing. This ambitious project aims at revealing a massive amount of novel biodiversity, shedding light on the complex links between genomes, transcriptomes, metabolomes, organisms, and ecosystem functions in coral reefs and providing a reference of the biological state of modern coral reefs in the Anthropocene.\n0fpw | Introduction\ndqn8 | The twentieth century has seen the earth enter into the now widely called Anthropocene. Anthropogenically induced changes are happening on both global and local scales and are altering the physiology of organisms and ecosystems by modifying the entire earth's physical, chemical, and biological processes. Among marine ecosystems, coral reefs have the unfortunate privilege of being highly sensitive to these environmental modifications. In particular, the thermally mediated process of coral bleaching-i.e., the loss of the obligate photosynthetic microalgal endosymbionts-is increasingly decimating corals. Projections estimate that approximately twenty-five percent of reefs have already been lost, and up to ninety-nine percent will be threatened and dramatically transformed by twenty fifty. Even though they cover only approximately zero point two percent of the ocean's surface, coral reefs harbor approximately thirty percent of ocean biodiversity, providing ecological services (fisheries, tourism, coastal protection) to nearly one billion people, and are estimated to be worth thirty billion U.S. dollars per year.\ncop0 | The late twentieth century has also seen our world entering into the \"omics\" revolution sparked by the development of high-throughput analyses of D.N.A., R.N.A., proteins, and metabolites. This revolution has changed our approach to investigate organisms, and it is about to change the descriptions of ecosystems as genes-to-ecosystem modeling improves. It will advance our capabilities to investigate the biodiversity and functioning of our oceans in a holistic way. Holistic approaches, interrogating components across the various levels of organization of an ecosystem, appear accessible today, as exemplified in the Tara Oceans project, which continues to decipher biodiversity and structural networks across all plankton organisms in the ocean.\nlhkq | Tara Pacific is a unique scientific expedition inspired by earlier maritime explorations that uncovered the uncharted territories of marine biodiversity. Coral reef research\n82ju | started with the contribution of Charles Darwin during \"the voyage of the Beagle\" from eighteen thirty-one to eighteen thirty-six, when Darwin explored many reefs in the Indian and Pacific Oceans and established his biophysical theory of the formation of coral reefs and atolls. He also highlighted the paradoxical high diversity of reef organisms living in a nutrient-poor system. Later, the Great Barrier Reef Expedition from nineteen twenty-eight to nineteen twenty-nine led by Charles Yonge was a landmark in coral reef research, as it established the scientific basis of coral physiology (nutrition, symbiosis, growth, etc.). The \"polypifers,\" later called coral polyps, were then demonstrated to host a large population of organisms (protists, viruses, bacteria, archaea, and all sorts of unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes), which are intimately involved in the physiology of the coral animal host in a complex and still mysterious system named the holobiont.\ny2qo | The Tara Pacific expedition has built on these early tracks, applying the most recent technologies to map the \"omics\" complexity of the coral holobiont within its ecosystem and across the Pacific Ocean. Through the exploration of marine biodiversity at scales spanning from organisms to genes to biomolecules, Tara Pacific is undertaking the first pan-ecosystemic study of coral reef diversity across an entire ocean basin (Figure one). Given that a holistic approach integrating all components of the reef biota is unrealistic, the Tara Pacific expedition focuses its approach on widely distributed coral and fish holobionts and their contextual biological (plankton) and physicochemical environment, including modifications in the context of global changes (Figure two).\n1piq | The geographic and sequencing extent of Tara Pacific will bring an exceptionally comprehensive description of coral holobionts, together with the surrounding fish and plankton biota. Such unprecedented sequencing coverage and depth will place coral reefs among the first ecosystems with a comprehensive description of their hologenomic diversity (i.e., the totality of genomes making up the coral holobiont) across their natural environments. We will go beyond the mere description of species composition to investigate in detail the gene content and gene expression of these communities, as well as the interconnectedness with their hosts and habitats. Broad emerging patterns will then be accessible through large-scale data mining and network analyses.\n7fqw | The coral holobiont\nrhaz | The coral host\nwak1 | Scleractinian corals evolved over four hundred fifty million years ago and belong to the phylum Cnidaria, animals located close to the root of the metazoans. Because of their place in the early Eumetazoa and as a sister group of bilaterians, the cnidarians allow interesting evolutionary analyses regarding the origins of animal complexity and the coevolution of early animals with microbes. Shinzato and colleagues were the first to show that the coral genome is as complex as the one of vertebrates and that it has retained many ancestral genes lost in other lineages. Subsequent studies confirmed the deep genomic differences between coral taxa. Moreover, the exceptional longevity of corals, reaching several hundred to thousands of years, makes them attractive emerging models for aging studies.\nwtfz | The coral endosymbiont microalgae\nqy1i | Reef corals host symbiotic unicellular algae of the family Symbiodiniaceae inside their endodermal cells, raising intriguing questions on animal-plant interactions, photosymbiosis, coevolution, and speciation. The divergence and genetic variation within and between populations of coral species is also investigated, allowing us to firmly ground the exact taxonomic status of each coral host.\n1k9e | The coral microbiome",
