However, it is also worth remembering that journals don't publish big ideas; they publish manuscripts where authors have successfully communicated their big ideas in such a way that they can be readily understood and evaluated by others. As the mission statement for this journal notes, \"AMR publishes novel, insightful, and carefully crafted conceptual work.\" Of course, a necessary part of the crafting is in the conceptualization of good theory, but equally important is structuring the paper well.\nex5k | To use an analogy, the organization of a manuscript that is macrostructure and the quality of the writing therein are like a window. A manuscript's window is \"dirty\" when its organization is awkward, unclear, or a poor fit with the concepts being explained, or when the writing is sloppy. The effect is to distract the reader by causing him or her to focus on the window the poor structure, rather than to look through it to the underlying message. In early rounds of the journal review process, editors and reviewers all too often have to advise authors to clean up their paper e.g., streamline the writing, coordinate the text with the figures, add or reword propositions before they can begin to actually evaluate the merits of any theoretical contribution. And that is if the authors are lucky; confusing structure or poor writing may so dominate a manuscript that it diminishes any perceived potential theoretical contribution the paper might have, leading to a first-round rejection.\n9d4o | Although in reality the two are often inextricably connected, in this essay I focus on the window-that is, on the craft of constructing a theory paper-rather than on the process of generating theory per se. And while there is much to be said about grammar, sentence structure, language usage, and specifics of writing technique what Daft calls \"microstructure\", I mostly focus on issues of manuscript organization and presentation, including the title and abstract, headings and sections, the use or nonuse of formal propositions, and the use of tables and figures.\ncjq2 | In a recent editorial essay King and Lepak recommended that aspiring authors \"outline or map out the structure of exemplar articles and then customize the learning gained in this process to come up with new and more effective approaches for communicating fundamentally good ideas.\" Modeling this approach, I use AMR Best Articles from the last ten years published twenty o one through twenty ten to illustrate both the structural variety and the similarities in articles published in AMR.\n5esx | FIRST IMPRESSIONS: THE TITLE AND ABSTRACT\nm5ka | It is a sobering thought, but the only parts of a published paper that most people will ever read are the title and abstract. Whether retrieved in long lists of search engine results or appearing in table of contents notifications, these either grab the reader's attention immediately or never. The title and abstract are also\nbyu8 | often the only information that potential reviewers see in the journal's request to review a paper and, of course, are the first things that reviewers, and ultimately readers, will see if and when they do encounter the full manuscript. Although these elements of a paper are the smallest, they do a lot of work. We as authors need to think of them as appetizers.\n76b0 | Good authors know how to make the title and abstract \"hook\" a reader, but they don't all do it in the same way. Among the ten Best Articles, for example, seven exhibit what one of my colleagues refers to, tongue in cheek, as the \"colonic\" title-that is, a longish title consisting of two phrases separated by a colon. Of the remaining three, two articles go to the other extreme, with simple two- or three-word titles (\"Systems of Exchange\" and \"Management Innovation\"). One advantage of the latter is that brevity, especially in academic writing, is novel and therefore attention grabbing. An advantage of the longer style is that the author can use the \"precolonic\" part of the title either to succinctly state the topic e.g., Social Capital: or to artfully begin to tell the story using some sort of image or metaphor Stealing Fire, while still being able to give additional clarifying information after the colon to help position the idea in the reader's mind.\nzxz6 | What most of these articles' titles have in common is that they reference the core construct or idea of the paper in simple language. Rather than trying to impress with an ostentatious title, they aim to draw the reader in. More pragmatically, they aim to draw the right reader in-that is, the audience most likely to understand and appreciate the paper.\nxnth | As with the titles, the abstracts of these articles vary considerably. Some present a brief outline of the article in three to four sentences, whereas others simply state succinctly what the authors create or argue in the article. One even starts with a hypothetical question and then uses the answer to lead into a description of what the article does.\nvafm | part, they also steer clear of jargon and are relatively conversational in tone.\n2zmw | MACROSTRUCTURE: ORGANIZATION OF MAJOR SECTIONS\nbf9k | Among the ten Best Articles, authors differ in how they use the formal structure of the article as a device for advancing the narrative. With the exception of the conclusion or discussion section, which is usually labeled as such, not one of the ten award-winning articles uses solely generic section headings, such as Background, Literature Review, Model and Propositions, and so on. Instead, each employs descriptive headings that introduce concepts or mirror the structure and flow of the theoretical model. As an example, \"Social Capital: Prospects for a New Concept,\" by Adler and Kwon twenty o two has five main headings-\"Defining Social Capital,\" \"Sources of Social Capital,\" \"Benefits and Risks of Social Capital,\" \"The Contingencies and Value of Social Capital,\" and \"Conclusion\"-that roughly map onto the conceptual model depicted in the first figure of their article.\n```",
