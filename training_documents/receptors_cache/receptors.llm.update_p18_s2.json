        "content": "d8zj | advance to pancreatic adenocarcinoma, as well as appendiceal mucinous tumors where signalling driven by Gas has been found to play a critical role.\nywxn | par\nuxhs | Gas, and Gas-driven signalling also plays a critical role in stem cell populations, where it has been found to suppress self-renewal. In contrast to the pro-oncogenic effects of gain-of-function mutations in Gas, in some stem-like cell states, Gas has a tumor suppressive role where loss-of-function mutations, or Gas deletion has been found to drive tumor initiation and progression by de-repression of the Sonic Hedgehog and Hippo pathways. In particular, the loss of GNAS, or low Gas expression is tightly linked to poor overall survival in a subset of aggressive medulloblastomas with alterations and activation of SHH signalling, and in neuroblastoma. Strikingly, deletion of GNAS in neural stem/progenitor cells consistently leads to medulloblastoma-like tumors in mice by derepressing SHH signalling thus contributing to the development and malignancy of SHH- associated medulloblastoma tumors. In epidermal and hair follicle progenitor cell populations, conditional deletion of Gas leads to rapid formation of basal cell carcinoma by repressing PKA-mediated inhibition of SHH and YAP signalling. Of note, activation of Gas in epithelial stem cells leads to exhaustion of hair follicle stem cells and subsequent hair loss, demonstrating the cell-context specific impact of Gas signalling.\ned6e | Mutations in genes encoding Gai/o proteins in cancer\n6qqm | Pente\nonum | The Gai/o subfamily of G proteins elicit signalling through a broad range of effectors, including activation of MAPK and PI3K signalling. In opposition to Gas signalling, Gai inhibits adenylyl cyclase, leading to a decrease in cyclic AMP. This was originally discovered through studies examining the mechanism of action of Islet Activating protein, also known as pertussis toxin, as it was isolated from Bordetella pertussis. Islet Activating Protein was found to release inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and enhance receptor mediated cAMP generation. Multiple groups studying the substrate of Islet Activating Protein found that Islet Activating Protein ADP-ribosylated Gai, thereby inactivating it, and enhancing adenylyl cyclase activity. Similar to other G proteins, constitutively active mutants of Gai have been shown to possess the ability to transform cells and are known proto-oncogenes. Cancer derived activated mutants of GNAO1, encoding Gao, have also been found to promote oncogenic transformation and anchorage-dependent growth when expressed in cells.\n3iir | In particular, hotspot activating mutations in GNAI2, which has been termed as the gip two oncogene, has been found in several tumor types, including ovarian and adrenal tumors, and has been shown to underlie a dysfunctional state in a subset of growth hormone-secreting pituitary\n7a0a | adenomas; however the small number of patients with this particular disorder have limited efforts to study the effect of germline GNAI variants and warrant further investigation. Strikingly, GNAI2 is in the top one per cent of copy number gains in brain, central nervous system, and kidney cancers suggesting there could be a larger role for Gai-driven signalling. In particular, many G protein coupled receptors that are well established as drivers of metastasis, such as CXCR4 (see below) couple to Gai. Aligned with this, GNAI2, encoding Gai two, has been found to be highly amplified in breast invasive carcinoma.\no1qp | rtic Remarkably, Gai/o-coupled receptors are the most commonly deleteriously mutated class of G protein coupled receptors across cancers. Coupled with this, inactivating mutations in Gai/o coupled receptors have been found to be mutually exclusive with activating mutations in Gas, suggesting that they lead to the same functional outcomes, converging on increased cyclic AMP activity. Indeed, a large subset of G protein coupled receptors mutated in GI-tract cancers are Gai coupled, and the Gai/o subfamily of G proteins are altered at similar frequencies in GI cancers to the Gas subfamily; however, the functional significance of their mutations have not yet been comprehensively tested. Aligned with the recurrent incidence of Gas-pathway activation in GI cancers, upregulated cAMP/PKA activity may be a common mechanism of tumorigenesis in these tissue types, and warrants further investigation, both from a signalling and clinical perspective.\njrik | Mutations in genes encoding Ga twelve proteins in cancer\nxv78 | The Ga twelve subfamily of G proteins is comprised of two a subunits, encoded by GNA12 and GNA13. Expressed in almost every tissue type, Ga twelve and Ga thirteen play critical roles in cell proliferation and cytoskeletal remodelling, including cell polarity, cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. The Ga twelve/thirteen subunits were originally discovered based on their amino acid sequence similarity to other Ga subunits and determined to be unique based on their insensitivity to pertussis toxin. Wild-type Ga twelve was identified from a sarcoma-derived cDNA library screen to cause transformation of NIH3T3 cells, representing the only G protein subfamily whose overexpression is sufficient to be transformative without mutation. The transforming ability of wild-type Ga twelve was found to be dependent on the presence of serum; however, mutation of GNA twelve leading to expression of an activated, GTPase deficient Ga twelve was found to be potently transforming, and eliminated serum-dependence for transformation. Similar work demonstrating the potent transforming activity of Ga thirteen led to the designation of GNA twelve and GNA thirteen active mutants collectively referred to as the gep oncogene.\nsdks | Ga twelve/thirteen have since been widely explored as drivers of cellular transformation, cancer progression and metastatic potential in a variety of cell types. Signalling driven by Ga twelve/thirteen is largely mediated via the RhoGEF family, including p one one five RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF and Leukemia- associated RhoGEF to mediate signalling to Rho. Initial studies on the mechanism by which active mutant of Go twelve was fully transforming in fibroblasts demonstrated that Ga twelve strongly stimulated transcriptional activity through the c-fos promoter element and the serum response element, which was dependent on Rho. Further work has revealed that Ga twelve/thirteen can signal through multiple effectors including beta-catenin, Radixin, and MAPK among others. All together, these signalling pathways regulate a diversity of cancer-related transcriptional networks and cellular functions, including the activation of AP-one, STAT three, and YAP.\ny8fb | pag\n521q | Induction of aberrant Ga twelve/thirteen driven signalling by overexpression or mutation of Ga twelve/thirteen or of Ga twelve/thirteen coupled G protein coupled receptors such as protease activated receptor one PAR-one, or thromboxane A two receptor TA two R, have been shown to be transforming, and significantly increase the invasive ability of different cancer types. Of interest, Ga twelve/thirteen, Ga twelve/thirteen-coupled G protein coupled receptors and their effectors including Rho, are overexpressed in several cancer types including breast, prostate, and hepatocellular carcinomas. In particular, GNA thirteen is upregulated in several solid tumors and its expression levels have been found to modulate drug resistance in squamous cell cancers, such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. GNA twelve also exhibits significant copy number gain in ovarian cancer, which is a cancer type characterized by generally few driver mutations.",
