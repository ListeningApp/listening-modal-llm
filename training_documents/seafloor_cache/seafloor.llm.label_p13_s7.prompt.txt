You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

Hannington et al., 2005; Monecke et al., 2016). Calcium concentrations are low in the chimneys (avg 0.06 wt %; <LATEX>\left. n = 3 6 \right) ,</LATEX> but <LATEX>B a</LATEX> (avg 6.49 wt %; <LATEX>\left. n = 3 6 \right)</LATEX> and Sr (avg 2,157 ppm; <LATEX>n = 3 6 ;</LATEX> up to 0.85 wt % in barite-rich samples) are high. The SiO2 contents average 11.67 wt % <LATEX>\left( n = 3 6 \right) ,</LATEX> but one chimney contains 75.09 wt % SiO2 together with 1.75 wt % Ba. The Cu-rich chimneys have high Mo (avg 343 ppm; n = 2) and In (avg 262 ppm; <LATEX>\left. n = 2 \right) ,</LATEX> with high Au (9,260 ppb) present in one sample. The Zn-rich samples contain very high Ga (up to 1,540 ppm), Ge (up to 99 ppm), Hg (up to 95 ppm), and Se (up to 20 ppm). Concentrations of Ag, Sb, As, and Au are also higher than in the Cu-rich chimneys, although high As is found in both Zn- and Cu-rich samples. Mercury concentra- tions are especially high in samples containing marcasite and late sphalerite + galena. The four sampled barite-rich chim- neys also have high Pb (avg 7,073 ppm), As (avg 299 ppm), Sb (avg 82 ppm), Au (avg 2,038 ppb), and <LATEX>\mathrm { A g }</LATEX> (avg 121 ppm). Statistical correlations between the different trace elements clearly reflect the higher (>250â„ƒ) and lower temperatures <LATEX>\left( < 2 5 0 ^ { \circ } C \right)</LATEX> of the Cu-rich and Zn-rich assemblages, respec- tively (App. Figs. A21, A22), as well as various lattice substitu- tions in the corresponding minerals (e.g., Cd in sphalerite, Sr in barite, As and Sb in Pb-rich sulfosalts, etc .; App. Table A2; cf. Hannington et al., 2005; Monecke et al., 2016). Gallium is incorporated mainly in galena in low-temperature assem- blages, whereas in higher-temperature assemblages it mainly resides in sphalerite with moderate to high Fe contents. Arse- nic is high in low-temperature assemblages, reflecting the presence of As in low-temperature minerals such as galena and sulfosalts. In a single sample containing secondary born- ite (chalcopyrite-rich chimney GMA13-010), Ag concentra- tions are 1,253 ppm. Contents of Co, Ni, Sn, W, Bi, and Te are generally below detection limits in all samples, unlike other arc-related hydrothermal systems that commonly contain dis- crete Bi and Te minerals, e.g., Monecke et al. (2016).
bbpr | Subseafloor mineralization consists of (1) unconsolidated and locally hydrothermally cemented chimney talus (Fig. 10A, B), (2) chimney talus, mixed with altered volcanic clasts, that is generally hydrothermally cemented (Fig. 10C), (3) chim- ney talus associated with oxidized intervals (Fig. 10D), (4) dis- seminated to patchy sulfides (chalcopyrite, pyrite, sphalerite) within altered volcaniclastic rocks (Fig. 10E, F), and (5) sul- fide minerals associated with late sulfate veins that extend to maximum depths of ~21 m b.s.l. (e.g., Figs. 3E, 4G, H; App. Fig. A2). Drilling shows that the majority of the mineraliza- tion at Tinakula comprises chimney talus that occurs directly beneath the unconsolidated volcaniclastic material (generally between 0.6 and 5.3 m b.s.f.). The oxidized intervals contain variable amounts of sulfide material (mostly chimney talus). Disseminated and vein-controlled sulfide (pyrite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite) occur in <LATEX>t h e \quad u p p e r \sim 0 . 5</LATEX> to 2.6 m of most drill holes (e.g., Fig. 4F, G). Seven samples of mineralized volcanic breccia down to 5.8 m b.s.f. contain mostly pyrite (9.7-30.1 wt % sulfide S) with minor anhydrite accounting for ~0.1 to 0.5 wt % sulfate S. Taking into account the dilution from wall rock, mineralized portions of the

2e62 | The chimney talus and oxidized intervals appear continu- ous between drill holes at sites A, B, and D, but mineraliza- tion was not encountered in the two drill holes at site C (Figs. 11, 12). Since the drill platform required relatively flat slopes, drilling at this site was limited to the areas beside the known chimney mounds. Therefore, the occurrence of chimney talus below the mounds was not confirmed at the location. The

c6hh | lithology of the footwall is monomict to polymict lapillistone that is crudely bedded with both matrix- and clast-supported horizons. Alteration and late infill by patchy sulfate cement obscures many of the primary volcanic textures, resulting in a high degree of uncertainty regarding facies interpreta- tions. The altered volcaniclastic material extends to maximum drilled depths of 22.32 m b.s.f .; however, the full depth and areal extent of the alteration is unknown, with most of the drilling having been focused along the central row of cinder cones (sites A-E; Fig. 2). Alteration minerals in the footwall breccias identified by XRD include dioctahedral smectite (montmorillonite and nontronite), chlorite (mainly chamosite,
y7ea | with minor clinochlore), minor chloritoid, illite, and mixed- layer clays: illite/smectite, muscovite/illite (rectorite), and chlorite/smectite (corrensite) (Table 2; App. Fig. A23). These minerals constitute five alteration facies that are distinguished in drill core by different colors (Table 2): (1) montmorillonite/ nontronite, with yellow-orange, yellow-gray, and red-brown hues; (2) nontronite + corrensite, with greenish-yellow to greenish-gray hues; (3) illite/smectite + pyrite, with yellowish- gray to olive-gray hues; (4) illite/smectite + chamosite, with bluish-white, olive, olive-gray, and greenish-yellow hues; and (5) chamosite + corrensite, with greenish-yellow to pale olive, with minor brown to reddish-brown hues.
