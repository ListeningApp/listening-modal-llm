You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

erx1 | In some cases, interactions with a technology may embody subject positions that exist without any representation, either in the design process or in technical implementation. A prime example comes from recent work studying
b3bt | Interactive Design Methodologies
0w8m | technology non-use [9]. As a designer, one might want to account for the ways that a system may impact people who do not directly interact with it. For example, media discourse around sites such as Facebook can readily influence those who do not have an account [2,29,73,93]. Williamson and Williamson [89] document how the presence of a pervasive display may impact those who do not interact with it, e.g., by altering flows of foot traffic for those who wish to avoid the display.
vcu3 | Other subtler cases of absence may occur. For instance, a "smart" thermostat such as the Nest may be interacted with by multiple different householders, a fact represented in the design process. However, the Nest maintains no systems representation of these different individuals, only a representation of the house itself [94]. As another example, search queries including stereotypically African-American names (e.g., Latanya or Latisha) vs. stereotypically white names (e.g., Kristen or Jill) result in a higher chance of seeing advertisements that suggest the person has an arrest record [82]. Since employers often perform internet searches for the names of potential employees, a disproportionately high rate of ads suggesting a criminal history may amount to racially-based employment discrimination [7]. Much of the current discourse around these issues involves questions of responsibility, such as who should be held accountable for such computationally- enacted discrimination. Another equally important but less often considered question deals with how we might account for the person being discriminated against. While the users of services such as Google Ad Words might be seen to include the companies taking out advertisements, the individuals performing searches, or both, the person whose name is being searched occupies a different subject position.
hjzj | Alternatives
j79f | One strategy for dealing with such situations involves accounting for these alternative subject positions. For instance, one might represent those who are excluded or disenfranchised from technology access [76,83,92], those who are impacted without direct interaction with a technology [93], or other subject positions in the design process. Strategies from speculative and critical design [33] may prove particularly useful in exploring such alternatives. Note that these representations need not persist to the interface or systems levels. As noted above, post-userism does not require resolving breakdowns across representational levels. Rather, it involves attending and designing around such breakdowns.
6tbv | Hybridity
xb13 | A final type of post-userism occurs when a subject position is comprised of a hybrid network of human and non-human actors. Consider a phone call to, say, customer service for your internet service provider (ISP). Rarely do you call an individual person. Rather, you are connected with an individual representative, chosen mostly at random from a
cxqi | group of representatives. That individual person inhabits a subject position speaking and acting on behalf of your ISP-changing your bandwidth, completing connection or disconnection requests, resolving issues with your bill (or perhaps not). Similar subject positions arise when a mostly de-individuated person acts as the interface to a larger group or organization, such as clerks at a department of motor vehicles (DMV) office, building receptionists, citizens contacting their elected representatives, cashiers, or crowd workers.
qfmx | Other kinds of hybrids involve more sophisticated computing technology. They are common in infrastructure: Geiger, for example, has detailed the cooperative relationships between editors and bots in the maintenance of Wikipedia [38-40]. However, they are increasingly entering everyday interactions. For instance, Facebook M offers a hybrid digital assistant [49]. Similar to other digital assistants, it uses a combination of natural language processing and artificial intelligence to perform tasks. However, when this automated system encounters a request it cannot handle, though, it recruits aid from a team of human Facebook employees. At the interface level, the user sees a consistent representation; users are blind to whether they are interacting with a human, a machine, or some combination thereof. A similar although less seamless example can be seen in phone-based customer service systems that use voice recognition for fairly rote tasks but then fall back to human operators for more complex processes.
rut3 | Assemblages
m3cp | These kinds of scenarios highlight the influence of post- humanist thinking [30,62,64]. Attending to hybridity allows us to acknowledge the kinds of agency and statuses that non-human entities may have [55]. Some work in HCI has even suggested studying animal-computer interaction and the ways that computers may mediate the relationships between pets and their owners [68,70].
mq4s | The goal here is not to claim that we need to account for or design for the subject position of a hybrid digital assistant, a cat using an iPad [68], or a crowd worker. While doing so may be important, we aim instead to elucidate the particular kinds of subject positions that people take in relation to those hybrid assemblages. Subject positions are always constituted relationally. By acknowledging both the kinds of human/non-human hybrids with which people interact and the differences in those hybrids across different representational levels, we can begin to design for the subject positions taken in relation to such assemblages.
95el | TWO PATHS FORWARD
a0a5 | Based on the critiques and alternatives presented in this paper, we suggest two primary paths forward:
gocl | 1. To examine the kinds of relationships that are occurring in HCI, but that are under-accounted.
ob1z | Interactive Design Methodologies
m4cb | 2. To begin to explore what HCI might look like in the absence of the traditional user.
m61y | Although this paper focuses primarily on the former, this section considers the differing shape that each direction might take in the evolution of the field.
u2ob | Research and Design Beyond the User
2gnm | First, post-userism provides a way for HCI to move toward a more comprehensive account of the relationships that occur between humans and computers. In our description of post-user scenarios, we intentionally focused on how research findings and design challenges were connected to larger conceptual issues with the user. Practically, one of the most productive strategies should involve identifying how others have managed similar post-user scenarios. Currently our ability to do this is limited and labor intensive.
emgw | HCI is exemplary in identifying limitations of existing systems, both in their practical usage and in the design work behind their development. However, relatively little work connects limitations arising from our conceptualization of the user with design work that addresses those limitations.
xaqt | This situation stems in part from HCI's pragmatic tendency to focus on specific domains. For example, while doctors acting on behalf of their patients when managing medical records is certainly a form of indirection, design interventions based on such an observation will likely be limited to medical informatics as a domain. However, there are certainly connections between this case and others, such as intermediary users observed in an ICTD context [75]. This similarity offers but one example. More generally, relationships within ecologies of subject positions have commonalities, but those commonalities are difficult to connect across different domains within HCI. It is for this reason that we intentionally drew on examples from multiple domains to demonstrate how the structure of the user causes problems across many different application areas.
5rcb | Scholarship that makes use of the practical strategies we have enumerated would benefit the community by explicitly sharing:
524j | · How did we, as researchers or as designers, realize we were facing a post-user scenario?
xd3m | · What were the relevant subject positions in our scenario?
8qb6 | · What were the relationships among them?
wkbn | · How did we represent that ecology of subject positions and their relationships across different levels in our design?
ftfg | · What were the repercussions of the representations we used?
7xi5 | While much of the work in HCI implicitly does the above, it does so while presuming the centrality of the user. Rather
