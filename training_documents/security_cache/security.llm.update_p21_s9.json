Self-assessment exercises\nrblh | Self-assessment one: An organisation has been identified as being involved in an oil spill in Alaska. The Board have decided that the security system around its headquarters offices on the thirteenth to twentieth floors of an office block in Canary Wharf need to be reviewed, and if necessary improved. Using the principles covered in this module, what recommendations could you make to the Board?\ngl5i | Self-assessment two: Your Chairman has returned from a visit to Japan, where he has heard about Kaizen. He has requested you give a presentation to the next Board meeting, identifying how Kaizen can be of use to the overall security management of the organization. Put together a PowerPoint briefing (about twenty minutes), that could be given to the Board, together with notes that could be distributed to the Board at the meeting.\nx0yg | Self-assessment three: Your company has taken over a production factory in Ukraine. It stands in its own area within a larger industrial park. As Head of Security E.M.E.A., you are going to visit the facility to assess the level of current security, and to identify possible areas that might need improvement. Put together a checklist of points that you would need to cover during your visit to the facility.\nmjt8 | Five point eight. Further Reading\nhtcn | Six. Gold, Silver, Bronze Operations Management System\n86d4 | The Gold, Silver, Bronze (G.S.B.) command system is used across the world to manage any sort of operation that involves multi-team coordination. Multi-team operations inevitably create issues of command and control, communication, information transfer, and integration with other teams, and possibly other outside organisations. This chapter introduces the basic concepts behind the G.S.B. command system, as well as giving examples of where the G.S.B. system has been used in real-life situations. An understanding of the G.S.B. system will give the security manager the skills to design more complex security operations, safe in the knowledge that they will be able to function effectively and with a high degree of coordination and adaptability in the widest range of possible scenarios.\nz7qp | Six point one. Gold, Silver, Bronze - Creating Operational Capability\n6t1g | One of the basic problems in security management is turning good ideas into operational capabilities. Unless it is little more than a one-office operation, the likelihood is that the security management operation will consist of various teams, each with their own duties and responsibilities, and which might well be based in different sites, geographical areas, or even countries. The security manager will be passing instructions on to other people, often Team Leaders, who will then be expected to carry out those duties. As such, it is likely that there will be the need for a Command and Control (C and C) Structure that will allow effective daily operations to take place. This module looks at the most common form of C and C Structures, and is designed to give you an understanding of the various components and functions of the system that will enable you to design the most appropriate C and C system for your own organisation.\ncpls | The three-tiered management structure is common to almost all operational management programmes, whether it is in government, military, emergency services or corporate organisations. It consists of Gold, Silver and Bronze Command levels, each of which have their own duties and functions, and it is designed to allow information to pass speedily up the chain, commands and instructions to cascade down the system, and overall a high-level of coordination between the different teams and other units involved in the command structure. If designed correctly, the C and C system should be able to deal equally effectively with standard daily activities, minor incidents that might require immediate response, and crisis management situations that demand a high level of coordination and organisational resilience.\nm50n | Almost all security management systems are based on a three-level management system, Gold (Strategic Management), Silver (Tactical Management) and Bronze (Operational Management).\neztf | Bronze Command level denotes the lowest level of the command chain, and consists of the people, and teams who complete the task on the ground. This is often called the Operational Command. This could mean interfacing with the public, as in a hotel security team, the security teams in an airport or the door supervisors in a pub. The Bronze level teams are the people on the ground, so they will often be the first people who are aware of changes in the immediate situation. As such, as well as carrying out their individual functions, their role is also to be the ears and eyes of the Silver and Gold Commanders, and to pass information up the command chain as required.\nbwsu | Silver Command is the level of command responsible for making sure that that work is carried out effectively, and is often known as the Tactical Command level. Tactical Command could involve defining roles and responsibilities, creating working protocols, delivering training programmes, ensuring that the correct equipment and other resources are in place, and in general ensuring that operational capability is at the required level. The Silver Command level may well be on charge of a number of Bronze level teams, and one of the functions of the Silver Command is to coordinate the work of the individual bronze teams so that they can respond in the most effective manner to any incident that might occur.\noqod | Gold Command level is responsible for creating the overall strategy, so that each team knows where they fit into the overall command structure, and how their roles contribute to the overall success of any operation.\ntey0 | As an example in a hotel chain, the Gold Commander might be the regional security manager, who is responsible for ensuring that there are clear security policies within each hotel, that there is sufficient training and resources to allow the security teams to carry out the functions, and who would review the security operations on a regular basis. The Silver Commander would be equivalent to the hotel security manager, who is responsible for ensuring that the hotel, its staff, guests and general operations are kept safe, and that all appropriate steps are taken to ensure that those processes are adhered to. The Silver Commander would also be responsible for managing the response to any situation that would come outside 'normal daily activities', such as a complaint from a guest, a report that a member of staff was stealing from rooms, or a tree falling down in the car park. The Bronze Commander would be the person acting as Shift Manager or Team Leader, who would be actively interacting with staff and guests as their first point of contact, and who would be the people actually responsible for the ongoing safety and security of the hotel.\nghiv | Six point two. Advantages of the G.S.B. System\no5ts | One of the advantages of the G.S.B. system is that it allows different Bronze Commanders, Silver Commanders or Gold Commanders to coordinate their actions with similar-level commanders in different systems, so as to create effective multi-team working groups. This is the basis of the most 'senior' of the G.S.B. Command system in the United Kingdom, COBR, which is the government-level crisis management system. COBR stands for Cabinet Office Briefing Room, and is used when there is the need to coordinate a large number of different organisations for a national crisis, such as terrorism, health scare or natural disaster (such as flooding).\nhd7d | The COBR Strategic Coordinating group is comprised of Gold Commanders of various representative groups, each of which comprises organisations which have their own Gold Commanders. This is an extremely effective system for allowing a large amount of information and expertise to be brought together into one meeting, as well as allowing orders and requests to cascade down the command chain extremely quickly and efficiently.\nehux | This outline gives an indication of the number of stakeholders that need to be included in a strategic coordination team. However, this is an extremely effective way of getting senior decision-makers together, allowing fast decisions to be made that can then be cascaded down through a variety of chains of command.\npoxj | This is the Command Chain of a sub-section of an overall operation - in this case, the Resources Support Section in the U.S. government Federal Emergency Management Agency. As in previous examples, the purpose of such a system is to create an effective chain of command that allows communication and commands to be passed down the system, and relevant information to be passed up the system.\n2xvb | Six point three.
