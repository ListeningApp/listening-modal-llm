        "content": "tb74 | The majority of consumers prefer crisp apples to firm ones. Apple cultivars with relatively high flesh crispness but low firmness, such as 'Honeycrisp', are currently commercially successful and are expected to remain so in the future. The apple expansin genes, MdEXPDCA1, MdEXPA2, MdEXPA3 and MdEXPA8 were considered markers for flesh crispness retention during cold storage. We observed that the expression of Beta-Gal genes, MdBGLs and MdBGLU, was significantly high in flesh firmness and crispness unretainable hybrids, which was consistent with the results of a previous report. These data indicated that flesh crispness retainability is a more crucial fruit quality attribute than flesh firmness retainability and that genomics-assisted selection for good flesh crispness retainability may also inadvertently select for good flesh firmness retainability.\n8l69 | Unlike the QTLs on chromosomes ten and fifteen for fruit firmness at harvest, chromosomes three and sixteen were 'QTL hotspots' for apple flesh firmness and crispness retainability, which is consistent with the results of previous reports. The markers SNP two six six eight four six eight zero and SNP three four seven three two zero three two on chromosome three, and SNP three eight five seven three four six one, SNP three zero five nine one two nine, and SNP nine one two seven two six nine on chromosome sixteen accounted for relatively large effects for both flesh firmness and crispness retainability.\n1jyv | RNA-seq enriched a large group of ethylene synthesis-related and cell wall degradation-related genes in DEGs between flesh firmness and crispness retainable and unretainable samples, which was consistent with previous reports.\nolce | In addition to these functional genes, many ethylene receptors and signalling genes were involved in regulating fruit firmness, such as MdEIN3, MdERF1, MdERF2 and MdERF4. Here, we observed that several ethylene-responsive genes were up-regulated in firmness and crispness retainable apples. As expected, the allelic variations on QTL-identified MdERF3 and MdERF118 were detected and were validated to affect flesh firmness and crispness retainability. These two allelic variations were considered diagnostic markers, which is consistent with QTL-derived ERF genes for apple fruit firmness retention. MdERF3 contains an ethylene-responsive element-binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression motif, and thus may function as negative regulator of MdPGLR3, MdPME2 and MdACO4 expression. MdERF118 also inhibited MdPGLR3 and MdACO4 expression by directly binding to their promoters; however, MdERF118 does not contain an EAR motif, which is similar to SlERF6 in tomato. SlERF6 negatively regulates fruit maturity and does not contain the EAR motif. The protein-protein interaction between MdERF3 and MdERF118 rendered the genetic variation network more complex.\nerx1 | GAP models for apple flesh firmness and crispness retainability were developed and were efficiently used in simulative selection. Fivefold cross-validation showed the prediction accuracy was zero point five five four one and zero point six zero one eight for the retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively. The predictability of these models was not only better than that of the activator-depleted substrate model, but also better than that of pure GS by ridge regression BLUP, the accuracy of which was more than zero point four for apple firmness after storage and was zero point zero eight to zero point four five for changes in fruit firmness. The improvement in predictability of the GAP models may be attributed to the taking into account non-additive allelic effects. Additive, dominant, and even over-dominant non-allelic epistasis or interactions among\nb3bt | QTLs or candidate genes for fruit firmness were detected in tomato. Dominant or partially dominant allelic effects were common in this study for apple flesh firmness and crispness retainability.\n0w8m | Conclusion",
