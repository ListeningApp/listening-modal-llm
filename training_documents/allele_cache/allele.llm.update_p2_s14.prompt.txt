You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

j79f | We present a reproducible workflow for ASB calling and meta- analysis across human TFs and cell types (Fig. 1b). First, the variants are called from premade ChIP-Seq read alignments against the hg38 genome assembly. Next, the variant calls are filtered by excluding homozygous and low-covered variants (<5 reads supporting any of two alleles), as well as variants absent from the dbSNP26 common subset (as putative de novo point mutations). The filtered SNVs from related ChIP-Seq data sets (sharing the cell type and particular wet lab) are used to identify the cell type features (aneuploidy and CNVs). A total set of variants is used to assess the global read mapping bias that is used as the basis for statistical model parametrization. Finally, ASB calling is performed separately for each ChIP-Seq experiment, and the resulting allele read bias P values are aggregated using the George-Mudholkar's method27 for each SNV, either at the TF level (across ChIP-Seq data for a selected TF from all cell types) or the cell type level (across ChIP-Seq data for a selected cell type for all TFs).
6tbv | We used the workflow to process 7669 ChIP-Seq read align- ments from GTRD covering 1025 human TFs and 566 cell types, and detected more than 2 hundred thousand ASBs at more than 2 hundred thousand SNPs for various TFs and 3 hundred thousand ASBs for cell types passing the Benjamini-Hochberg (FDR) adjusted P value of 0.05, see Fig. 1c, d for an overview. Reaching these numbers has become possible because of the large volume of the starting data (the filtered list of considered variant calls contained more than 54 million entries) and the advanced sta- tistical framework that we describe below.

rut3 | Estimating background allelic dosage (BAD) from single- nucleotide variant calls. ASB is assessed against expected relative frequencies of reads supporting alternative alleles of a particular SNV in a particular genomic region. Assuming there was no read mapping bias, these expected frequencies would be mostly determined by the copy number of the respective genomic seg- ments. In this study, we estimated the joint effect of local copy- number variation and global chromosome ploidy from the read counts at SNV calls, taking into account that the background for ASB calling is defined by the expected relative frequencies of the read counts supporting alternative alleles rather than by absolute allelic copy numbers.
m3cp | We introduce BAD as the ratio of the major to minor allele dosage in the particular genomic segment, which depends on chromosome structural variants and aneuploidy. BAD can be estimated from the number of reads mapped at each allelic variant and does not require haplotype phasing. For example, if a particular genomic region has the same copy both alleles, e.g., 1:1 (diploid), 2:2, or 3:3, then it has <LATEX>B A D = 1 , i . e . , t h e</LATEX> expected ratio of reads mapped to alternative alleles on a heterozygous SNV is 1. All triploid regions have <LATEX>B A D = 2 ,</LATEX> and the expected allelic reads ratio is either 2 or <LATEX>1 / 2 .</LATEX> In general, if BAD of a particular region is known, then the expected frequencies of reads supporting alternative alleles are <LATEX>1 / \left( \mathrm { B A D } + 1 \right)</LATEX> and BAD/
mq4s | <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { B A D } + 1 \right.</LATEX> Importantly, accounting for BAD provides an answer to the question of the necessity of overdispersion in the statistical evaluation of ASBs19,22. In fact, a large portion of overdispersion of read counts disappears once the variant calls are segregated according to BADs of the respective genomic segments (see "Methods").
95el | BAD calling with Bayesian changepoint identification. In this study, we present a novel method for reconstructing a genome- wide BAD map of a given cell type. The idea is to find genomic regions with approximately stable BAD using the read counts at SNV calls. Assuming that both differential chromatin accessibility and sequence-specific TF binding affect only a minor fraction of variants, the read counts for most of the SNVs must be close to equilibrium and thus provide imprecise but multiple measure- ments of BAD.
a0a5 | We have developed a Bayesian changepoint identification algorithm, which (1) segments the genomic sequence into regions of the constant BAD using dynamic programming to maximize the marginal likelihood and then (2) assigns BAD with the maximal posterior to each segment (see "Methods"). An additional preprocessing employs distances between neighboring SNVs to exclude long deletions and centromeric regions from BAD estimation. The BAD caller in action is illustrated in Fig. 2a for two chromosomes using ENCODE K562 data (see the segmentation map of the complete genome with multiple deletions in Supplementary Fig. 2).
gocl | We performed the BAD calling for 2556 groups of variant calls, where each group consisted of calls obtained from ChIP-Seq alignments for a particular cell type and GEO series or ENCODE biosample ID (i.e., for K562 cells of different studies, the BAD calling was performed independently). In BAD calling, recurrent SNVs sharing dbSNP IDs and found in different data sets within the same group were considered as independent observations. To systematically assess the reliability of the resulting BAD maps, we compared the predicted BADs at all SNVs with the ground truth BADs estimated from COSMIC28 CNV data for 76 matched cell
