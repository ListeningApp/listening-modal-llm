You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

cjq2 | On a different note, the advent of seamless and multimodal virtual reference tools has provided users with multichannel points of entry to hubs of information. Virtual reference services, sometimes called digital or mobile reference services, have ex- 66 Web-based applications on smartphones and other mobile de- vices provide users with additional mobility, and the global reach and 24/7 anytime/anywhere point-of- need access of these new tools mean that reference services are not place bound. tended the reach of traditional reference services by offering users synchronous and asynchronous computer-mediated reference services via email, chat/instant messaging (IM), texting/short mes- sage service (SMS), voice chat and cloud-based vid- eoconferencing, and more. Web-based applications on smartphones and other mobile devices provide users with additional mobility, and the global reach " and 24/7 anytime/anywhere point-of-need access of these tools mean that reference services are not place bound.27 These tools proved invaluable to information intermediators for providing reference services at a distance during the pandemic.
5esx | Despite the use of technology in online interactions, virtual reference interviews are not that dif- ferent from face-to-face transactions because many of the same reference skills and techniques are used. Information professionals today have a variety of virtual reference tools (e.g., text messaging, synchronous reference options, etc.) to support their user needs but also encounter some challenges (e.g., real-time typed interactions can be cumbersome).

For example, Springshare offers LibAnswers as a 24/7 reference cooperative that includes an international multichannel platform using a LibChat widget and the ability for libraries to answer questions via email, SMS, Facebook, and Twitter as well as providing access to FAQ knowledge bases for academic and public libraries.28 Other information institutions participate in consortial arrangements, such as Florida's statewide Ask-a-Librarian consortium of public and academic libraries. However, challenges can arise with consortial reference arrangements when the staffing of the virtual reference desk is shared among various participating libraries, and information professionals are asked to answer questions about library systems with which they have no personal knowledge or experience.
byu8 | Technological advances have also impacted readers' advisory services that information pro- fessionals offer, particularly in school and public libraries (see also Chapter 8: Literacy and Media Centers: School Libraries and Chapter 10: Community Anchors for Lifelong Learning: Public Libraries). Information professionals use digital readers' advisory tools (such as NoveList, Goodreads, and even Pinterest) to provide book recommendations on topics ranging from Christian fiction and graphic nov- els to popular crafts and local history. Public libraries also quickly expanded their digital advisory ser- vices when in-person help and in-library browsing were not feasible during the COVID-19 pandemic.

bf9k | Discussion Question
otkr | What are the pros and cons of reference services delivered in person, by phone, and by various online virtual methods of communicating?
ibgs | Web 2.0 social tools also encourage reference interactions through blogs, wikis, and group messaging. Social media tools (including TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, and Twitter) are frequently used to engage with personal learning networks, promote library resources and services, and even respond to information queries. The technological advancements in social tools have had a profound impact on library and information services, contributing to changes in the ways that refer- ence services are delivered and to the development of a twenty-first-century service model called Ref- erence 2.0.29 Reference 2.0 is the term used to describe this new service model of collaborative social networking tools used in conjunction with information sources to provide digital reference services.
colo | Reference 2.0 services have made it possible to move beyond the place-bound services offered at the reference desk to a two-way seamless interaction between information users and reference librarians that can be used to facilitate information intermediation services. For example, information professionals can:
d6r4 | · amplify their social networks by tweeting on Twitter when they may want expert help with spe- cific questions, 30
9mrz | · use social media to promote reference services and enhance information intermediation (see also Chapter 30: Communication, Marketing, and Outreach Strategies), and
pk06 | · co-browse with a user through chat services (see also Chapter 12: Virtual Resources and Services).

However, information professionals have unique expertise and skills that are otherwise not available to users via these other alternatives, and they are able to target their services to the needs of their " local communities. Specifically, reference librarians provide value-added help to users with specialized research questions, are able to address patron-driven wants, and provide a "high-tech and high-touch" ap- proach.31 This expertise positions them well to be knowledge professionals in the age of Google and adapt to the myriad circumstances and unforeseen challenges in delivering reference services.

b8hf | Roles for Information Intermediators
hntf | As information-seeking behaviors become increasingly user driven, virtual, and self-directed, refer- ence librarians and other information intermediators continue handling traditional reference roles and taking on new methods for mediating between users. Management is one of those areas that plays an important role for providing reference work in all types of settings. For example, information sources need to be collected and managed, while service points used to deliver reference services need to be organized and assessed (see also Chapter 27: Managing Collections).32 This work can range from de- signing online and in-person services that meet the needs of the community being served to evaluating and improving how those services are delivered. Reference librarians also must ensure that reference staff are adequately trained and have ongoing professional development opportunities.
99fo | Outreach and marketing of services and resources that are offered by information organizations to the broader community of users are other important areas of responsibility handled by today's reference librarians.33 Although librarians had been using social media for marketing and outreach in addition to more traditional tools for some time, the importance of promoting reference services virtually became much more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic.
y5r7 | Embedded librarianship is one specialized method for offering outreach where librarians have an information intermediary role in a team or community.34 For example, public librarians can be embed- ded personally or virtually in local government or community organizations and can serve as a great resource in times of crisis.35 Academic outreach librarians, also called liaison librarians,36 may have office hours or get embedded in online classes (see also Chapter 9: Learning and Research Institutions: Academic Libraries),37 and they can serve as resources on curriculum planning committees at the de- partmental and university levels.38 Embedded librarians have also developed a variety of collaborative relationships with patrons, city administrators, and even medical teams doing hospital rounds.39 In fact, embedded librarians serve as information resources for everyone from local boards doing city planning to rapid response teams during medical emergencies.40
lrry | A more traditional but still successful application of embedded librarianship is when information professionals collaborate in team-taught information literacy components of online courses and face- to-face classes.41 Providing just-in-time individual instruction and research assistance for students ensures that an information professional is available at the point of need in classes.42 Whatever their specific role is, embedded librarians are there to provide relevant information for students, teams, and the community whether it is in person or on demand asynchronously.
hvhm | Supporting the educational mission of schools, community colleges, universities, and more is another important role of information intermediators. Reference librarians play an educational role in person and virtually by helping users learn how to locate, navigate, and evaluate information. For example, library staff support the information needs for the College Depot at the Phoenix Public Library43 in addition to providing homework help and tutoring services for local school students and homeschoolers alike. During the COVID-19 pandemic when schools44 and institutions of higher edu- cation had to pivot most or all their classes online, librarians were already positioned to use streaming media to deliver virtual reference transactions and library instruction at the point of need for students.
863b | Information professionals are also stepping up and using their information skills to take a more active community service role. In his book Palaces for the People, Eric Klinenberg,45 discusses how li- braries can help address social inequality in civic life by helping with information needs in community hubs46 during times of crisis. For example, librarians can help communities address everything from hurricanes and wildfires to food insecurity and a global pandemic47 or by providing on-demand infor- mation via mental health kiosks (see Textbox 13.4).48
fj24 | Helping individuals use new technologies and develop new skills is another role for reference librarians. Brian Kenney49 addresses this issue in his article, "Where Reference Fits in the Modern Library," when he argues that users are looking for ways to do everything from using 3D printers to doing genealogy research rather than simply locating information. Libraries offer technology help in

Likewise, help with in- formation on how to do things also takes place in makerspaces and beta spaces that foster innovation and experimentation.
v3r2 | A unique challenge for information professionals is that their roles have had to constantly change and adapt as today's modes of services also change and evolve. This means that twenty-first-century information professionals need the flexibility to deal with rapid political, health, climate, and work-re- lated changes and to learn new processes and procedures in support of their service philosophy for the communities they serve.50 For example, while information professionals were pivoting to provide ser- vices virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic, they were also simultaneously challenged to reimagine how their information services would be provided in the postpandemic new normal.51 This means that reference librarians and information intermediators of all kinds need to be creative, innovative, and technologically skilled, and information intermediators need new skill sets to offer the high-tech reference services their users want.
nv42 | For example, school librarians were frequently the go-to people as technology integration leaders when schoolteachers and students had to switch to online instruction during the 2020-2021 academic year. In addition, school librarians assisted with everything from helping configure and distribute Chromebooks to students and helping teachers learn to use various learning management platforms such as Canvas on one hand to expanding online learning resources for online classes on the other.52
xags | Academic, public, and special librarians all faced similar challenges when figuring out how to safely offer reference services while working from home, using Zoom for instruction, meetings, and reference interviews, and developing online tutorials, Bitmoji virtual libraries,53 and subject guides. However, no matter which delivery model is used or what type of information organization is involved, information professionals have demonstrated that they are pre- pared to integrate intermediation services and tech- nology skills with other parts of their organizations to pivot and address the information needs of users in and outside of those organizations.54
