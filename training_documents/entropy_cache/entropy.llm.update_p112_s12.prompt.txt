You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

3w0z | Okay, now we know the entropy of a classical ideal monatomic gas! We even know what it means. Unfortunately we're trying to figure out the entropy of hydrogen, which is diatomic. But we can do helium, which is monatomic ... and then we'll do hydrogen.
uwfw | ENTROPY PER MOLE VERSUS BITS PER MOLECULE
0caz | A nat of unknown information is 1.380649 . 10-23 joules/kelvin of entropy: this is Boltzmann's constant.
4auz | There are 6.02214076 . 1023 molecules per mole: this is Avogadro's number.

zae5 | joule/kelvin of entropy per mole.
oa93 | By the way, the values of Boltzmann's constant and Avogadro's number here are exact, fixed by the definition of SI units. So there is no experimental uncertainty in any of the numbers on this page.
lcuj | THE ENTROPY OF HELIUM: THEORY
cua2 | The Sackur-Tetrode equation says that assuming helium is a classical ideal monatomic gas, its entropy is
uipb | <LATEX>S _ { i } \approx k N \left( \ln \frac { V } { N \Lambda ^ { 3 } } + \frac { 5 } { 2 } \right)</LATEX> which corresponds to
bjno | <LATEX>\ln \frac { V } { N \Lambda ^ { 3 } } + \frac { 5 } { 2 }</LATEX> nats of unknown information per atom. At standard temperature and pressure, this gives about 15.041 nats or
w2lh | <LATEX>\frac { 1 5 . 0 4 1 } { \ln 2 } \approx 2 1 . 7 0 0</LATEX> bits of unknown information per atom.
qryo | Now let's calculate the entropy of helium in its gaseous state. NIST has tabulated its entropy at standard temperature and pressure, specifically temperature <LATEX>T = 2 9 8 . 1 5</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { K }</LATEX> and pressure <LATEX>P = 1 \mathrm { b a r } ,</LATEX> so that's what we'll try to calculate. An atom of helium has a mass of <LATEX>m = 6 . 6 4 6 4 7 7 \cdot 1 0 ^ { - 2 7 } \mathrm { k g } ,</LATEX> so at standard temperature its thermal wavelength is
d0c0 | <LATEX>\Lambda = \frac { h } { \sqrt { 2 \pi m k T } }</LATEX> <LATEX>\approx \frac { } { \sqrt { 2 \pi \times 6 . 6 4 6 4 7 7 \cdot 1 0 ^ { - 2 7 } \mathrm { k g } \times 1 . 3 8 0 6 4 9 \cdot 1 0 ^ { - 2 3 } \mathrm { J } / \mathrm { K } \times 2 9 8 . 1 5 \mathrm { K } } }</LATEX> <LATEX>\approx 5 . 0 5 3 7 2 1 \cdot 1 0 ^ { - 1 1 } \mathrm { m } .</LATEX> 6.62607 . 10-34 Js
c4id | For a mole of an ideal gas we have <LATEX>N = 6 . 0 2 2 1 4 0 7 6 \cdot 1 0 ^ { 2 3 }</LATEX> (this is Avogadro's number), and at standard temperature and pressure a mole of ideal gas has <LATEX>V \approx 0 . 0 2 4 7 8 9 6 \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } :</LATEX> this is called its 'molar volume'. The molar volume of helium is actually slightly different from this, because helium is not an ideal gas: the atoms interact. But since we're doing a calculation assuming helium is a classical ideal gas, let's ignore that for now. We then get
2fj6 | <LATEX>\frac { V } { N \Lambda ^ { 3 } } \approx \frac { 0 . 0 2 4 7 8 9 6 \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } } { 6 . 0 2 2 1 4 0 7 6 \cdot 1 0 ^ { 2 3 } \times \left( 5 . 2 7 9 9 2 9 1 \cdot 1 0 ^ { - 1 1 } \mathrm { m } \right) ^ { 3 } } \approx 2 7 9 6 6 3 .</LATEX> We thus have
5mai | <LATEX>\ln \frac { V } { N \Lambda ^ { 3 } } \approx \ln 2 7 9 6 6 3 \approx 1 2 . 5 4 1 .</LATEX> As explained earlier, this means that the logarithm of the number of accessible states of each helium atom would be 12.541 if it were trapped in its own small box of volume <LATEX>V / N .</LATEX> But density fluctuations contribute 1 extra nat of entropy per atom. Thus, the
pqyp | free energy part of the entropy per atom is 13.541 nats. On the other hand, the expected energy part of the entropy per atom is 2, coming from the atom's 3 momentum degrees of freedom. The total entropy per atom is thus
