You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

90no | Sufi studies in the West and in the contemporary East, it should be remembered, are repeating a pattern .* Throughout the ages there have been Sufis and imitators. Perhaps, to clarify things in your own mind, you might like to ask yourself this question: "Why do I imagine that there is any activity that does not have imitators, charlatans, confusion and "tourists" and passengers?' People do not find that they can do anything about tricksters or .Not only do humorous tales contain valuable structures for understand- ing. Their use also helps to weed out people who lack a sense of humour. Sufis hold that people who have not developed or who have suppressed their capacity to enjoy humour are, in this deprived state, also without learning capacity in the Sufi sphere.

qb7o | cranks who offer a trip to the Moon-except to increase public information on spaceflight.
oae5 | I cannot help feeling that the questioner is denning his own mentality and showing us that he is thinking in a more confined way than his limitations require.
s0fl | If we can do anything about the imitation, it is to spread the information of the real. But our doing this depends upon the audience being prepared. The preparation involves a wideness of horizon and the intelligent use of the clear thinking methods which are already current in all present-day societies, though only lately coming into use in our area of interest.
43ia | The negative attitude is to look at the imitators. The positive one, surely, is to remember the words of Jalaluddin Rumi, who said that false gold only exists because there is such a thing as the Real ...
3g2y | JAMI AND THE EXTERNALS
gc7v | Both imitators and the followers of previous formulations whose externals alone persist can be reminded, especially if they read the Sufi classics, that externals are not the same as content. It is in this vein that the great teacher Jami speaks, in his Baharistan, 'The Abode of Spring':
wqfv | The rose is gone from the garden, what can I do with the thorns and leaves?
j30a | The Shah is not in the city, what shall I do with his court? The attractions are the cage: beauty and goodness the parrot.
7bdk | When the parrot has flown, what can I do with the cage?
fim0 | ANALOGY OF THE FUR JACKET
ojro | In Fihi ma Fihi we find the allegory of the jacket. 'In Winter,' says Rumi, 'you look for a fur garment, but when summer comes you have no time for it, it is an encumbrance. So it is with imitations of real teachings. They keep people warm until the time comes when they can be warmed by the Sun ... '
l6t9 | So, like the fur garment, people will cleave to cults and
1ujy | imitations because these things suit them, respond to something within them which calls for cults and imitations.
qzor | At the same time, of course, they imagine all sorts of things about themselves, such as that they are genuine, sincere, un- concerned about themselves and concerned about others or about truth.
a0by | SHIBLI AND THE STONES
u1ky | In a famous instance, recorded for instance in the Ilahi-Nama of Hakim Sanai, the Sufi teacher Shibli of Khurasan made this self-deception a matter of illustration-teaching in a dramatic event which he initiated.
htm9 | Because of his extravagant utterances, disliked by the authori- ties, Shibli was chained up as a madman. A number of people who respected him went to him on a visit, enquiring about bis welfare. He asked them who they considered themselves to be, and they answered that they were his friends.
8hul | At this Shibli hurled stones at them, and they ran away.
87vz | Shibli shouted: "You say that you are my friends, thinking of el But I have shown you that you flee from my affliction, and hence you are concerned not for me, but for your own protection from stones !'
ym66 | TO RECEIVE WHAT IS NOT IN YOUR DESTINY
l0a3 | Besides, we should bear in mind the teaching of the great sage Abu'l Hasan Khirqani, recorded in Attar's Recitals of the Saints:
u8nw | The people of the world have a fixed destiny. But the spiritually developed receive what is not in their destiny.'
l2v9 | Q: What is the harm in imitating? I am sure that most, if not all, of the human development systems which are publicly offered are only imitations. If, however, these give people pleasure and some taste of a deeper reality, they surely must have a value?
afbe | THE KNOTS STANDING IN THE WAY OF THE TEXTILES
78r8 | A: If you take an analogy, you might see it differently. Suppos- ing we were discussing the art of weaving which might be de- veloped. Supposing people were at a stage where they could only tie knots in string, which gave them pleasure and might be re- garded as a foretaste of weaving. If the people only imitated the knotting phase, and in addition regarded the knotting as the entire art-when would weaving itself come into being, no matter how much pleasure there was attached to it? Certainly, knotting would have a value as such: but it would also constitute a barrier to going further if the idea of anything further were 'abolished' by people thinking that knots were as far as anyone could go in textile work.
320g | There are two points worth noting here.
tp8g | The first is that 'pleasure' certainly is not to be opposed, but there are many sources of pleasure, and to seek pleasure as a part of something more specific leads to confusion and more.
gxfd | The second is that if you get obsessed by the early stages of something, imagining it to be the whole, you will not go further.
s2v1 | THE WOMAN AND THE SPIRITUAL BEING
jkp9 | Look at the ancient tale of the woman and the spiritual being.
z8tt | There was once a poor woman who helped a spiritual being disguised as a wanderer from far away, giving him hospitality when others had cast him out. As he left her house, he said: 'May your first task tomorrow last all day!'
9g22 | She thought that this was a strange way of thanking someone, but soon forgot.
41fx | The following day a merchant brought her a short length of gold thread and asked her to embroider it onto a garment, for embroidery was her work, when she could get any.
7um8 | She unwound the gold and embroidered the cloth. When she had finished, she saw that there was more gold thread on the floor than she had started out with.
uow2 | The more she wound it up into a ball the more there was. She
iat7 | wound gold thread all day, and by nightfall she had an enormous quantity. By tradition, left over thread belonged to the embroi- dress.
ywwr | She sold this thread and with the money she was able to re- build her house and furnish it, as well as setting herself up with a fine shop.
0i6j | Naturally the neighbours became curious, and she told them how her luck had changed, and what had caused it.
87cq | Some time later, a merchant in the same town saw and recog- nised the 'stranger with magical powers' from what the woman had said about him and invited him into his shop and home. He showed the spiritual being great hospitality, imitating the way in which open-handed people behave; even carrying his attentiveness to extremes.
0qs3 | He thought: 'There must be something in this for me - and of course for everyone in this town.' He added the second phrase to his thoughts because, although greedy, he imagined that just to think of others would get him something for himself. Because, however, he was imitating charity, and because he did not think of the good of others equally with his own good but only as an afterthought, things turned out differently for him than for the charitable woman.
z8f7 | When the stranger was about to leave, the merchant said:
7w7j | 'Give me a blessing.'
51vd | 'I do not do that,' said the stranger, "but I wish that your first concern today should endure for a week.'
baj1 | He went on his way and the merchant set off for his counting- house, where he proposed to count money, multiplying it for a whole week.
n1wo | On the way across his own courtyard, the merchant stopped for a drink of water at his well. No sooner had he pulled up one bucketful than he found himself compelled to draw another, and another, and this went on for an entire week.
5bq3 | The water flooded his house, then that of the neighbours, and finally the whole town, almost causing it to collapse ...
ezla | Attaining Knowledge
rsbu | Q: How can I attain knowledge of myself? I look at organisa- tions and institutions, such as schools or universities, or business enterprises or professions, and I can see that they have estab- lished reputations. They also have enrolment and recruitment, and they have objectives. For instance, if I become a politician I am aiming for cabinet rank; if I want to study medicine it is in order to become a practising doctor or a research worker or a teacher. When I approach Sufi ideas, whether through books or individuals, I find that a similar kind of coherence is not there: or if it is, I cannot find it. I often become confused, and I have met many other people who are also confused, who are trying the same thing. Because of this I also feel that an answer to this question would be of great value to many other people who believe that there must be truth and value in Sufi thought and activity, because it has continually produced great people, but that the 'way in* and the curricula are baffling.
magd | A: It is interesting, not as a lesson in what Sufis are like, or what the Sufi enterprise is about, to look at these words, for they display, very clearly, what people are like, and we will see in a moment, how easily one can answer them by using materials, analogies and ways of thought which they would have been able to use for themselves if they had really been as analytical and co- herent as they imagine they are.
tb74 | First it must be said that it is precisely because someone thinks like this that he is baffled. He has arbitrarily selected parallels and assumptions, and seeks to apply them to us. Interestingly, he had misapplied them, with the result that he arrives at what he could even have subconsciously sought, confusion.
8l69 | One traditional way of answering this question would be to quote the proverb: However fast you run, or however skilfully, you can't run away from your own feet.'
1jyv | We will go through the analogies, and show how they apply to
olce | 26
erx1 | us just as much as to anyone or anything else cited.
b3bt | First of all, it is not for us to satisfy each and every would-be student about Sufi applicability to himself and Sufic probity or otherwise. It is for him to satisfy himself; and he will probably use the same methods he uses when he applies to learn anything else. But he should remember that if he goes, for instance, to a school of medicine and asks: "How do I know that you can teach me?' he will be shown the door. He is not eligible. Such an approach is neither correct behaviour nor indicative of a stage of intelligence in which one can be taught. There are plenty of people who do not adopt the attitude of an idiot, and it is the duty of the medical school to give its limited time to such people. It is someone else's task to do the more preliminary work with you. One function of the books already published is to provide this briefing.
0w8m | Secondly, the reputation of the Sufis is already well enough established, and continues in that role from a base of repute which they established even long before numerous contemporary institutions existed. Sufic continued flexibility, viability and effec- tiveness (if you must measure in this way) are themselves evidences of their value in terms of the levels on which such things are assessed in the familiar world.
vcu3 | The coexistence of genuine Sufic enterprises and imitation ones only parallels similar imitations of almost every other kind of institution in the world. It is no new thing, and it has virtually the same characteristics and origins.
hjzj | Thirdly, the idea of 'enrolment and recruitment' naturally varies with the kind of institution. The enrolment and recruitment of, say, bank clerks differs from that of, say, soldiers. People may become bank clerks and find that they are not suited for banking life. They may become politicians and discover that they are suited to this life. They may enrol as deep-sea divers and discover that deep-sea diving is not what they thought it was, in spite of plenty of divers around, sufficient schools, and an abundance of literature on the subject. What are you seeking from Sufi studies or activity which differs from these things?
j79f | Fourthly, of course, there is the question which comes under the heading of objectives. Suppose you want to be a politician: no-
6tbv | body would say that you could become a Cabinet Minister before you were perhaps a leg-man for a minor parliamentary candidate, or an envelope-licker in Party HQ, or even a canvasser for an obscure Rural District Council Member. The objective, again, may be to be a Cabinet Minister or a Prime Minister. How many people who at the beginning of their political careers: (a) know what it is like to be a Prime Minister, even if they are aiming for it; (b) really will become a Prime Minister? In any case, the people who do attain such rank are the ones who obey the Chinese proverb 'The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step'.
xb13 | Fifthly, as to confusion: people frequently become confused either because they cannot understand the elementary steps they have to take, or because they invariably enjoy confusion, or for some other reason which they do not know. The origins of a state of confusion can often be discovered merely by transposing the problem into terms whose structure is more familiar, as I have just done.
cxqi | Among the Sufis, as among those of other paths, it has always been required that the intending participant practise certain re- quirements to fit him or her for higher learning. In modern societies, equivalent and often exactly similar prerequisites are found. Because so many familiar institutions with clearly laid out requirements already exist in contemporary cultures, it should be easier, not more difficult, for people to understand, given real desire, the requirements. These include: humility, dedication, abstinence, restraint, obedience. Unless you exercise these 'virtues', you will get nowhere in banking, the Army, medicine, politics, human service or anywhere else in many forms of mundane endeavour. If, on the other hand, you want to escape these tire- some preliminaries and flee into Sufism, then we know what you are like, and we cannot talk to you at all. 'To say "yes" to the Sufi way is to say "no" to imagined escapes.'
qfmx | It is no accident that Sufis find that they can connect most constructively with people who are well integrated into the world, as well as having higher aims, and that those who adopt a sensible attitude towards society and life as generally known can usually absorb Sufi teachings very well indeed.
rut3 | You started your question with the matter of the visibility of study institutions. But the world itself, as well as special attitudes, properly understood, constitute the Sufi school. Remember the words of Maghribi, who said to a monkish individual: 'What you are seeking in your retreat/I see clearly in every road and alley- way'.
m3cp | It is no use adding external things, say observances - to the life of someone who is carrying on too many unproductive observances. It is hopeless to add ideas to minds already too full of ideas. Study institutions may become visible when the head is more emptied of imaginings.
