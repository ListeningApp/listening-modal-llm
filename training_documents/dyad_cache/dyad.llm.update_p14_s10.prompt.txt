You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

7hgg | The efforts to monitoring China, primarily its preparations for a massive intervention in the war, went somewhat better, and the source of the failure here lay within the sphere of analysis. Although the CIA had
xwsv | lost all its assets in mainland China following the Communist victory there, it succeeded in receiving some relevant information through other sources. On October 19, the same day the PLA started crossing the Yalu, a Hong Kong-based Chinese businessman warned that 400,000 PLA troops had started or were about to start crossing into North Korea.10 CIA officers in Tokyo warned twice of a 300,000-strong PLA force deployed near the Yalu.10 These warnings had no impact on intelligence estimates. MacArthur himself rejected them, and threatened to arrest a CIA officer stationed in Tokyo for warning about a coming Chinese intervention.103
756b | Aerial reconnaissance occasionally yielded some useful information. In early September, one warning indicator concerning possible Chinese intervention involved aerial photographs that showed three air-force bases, capable of handling a total of 300 aircraft, had been built in close proximity to the Yalu.104 104 On October 18, aerial photographs showed that close to a hundred Soviet-made aircraft had been deployed in those fields.105 The obvious conclusion should have been that the Chinese were building air support for a potential large-scale confrontation with the UN forces.
6bx7 | Sigint coverage of the Chinese preparations for war suffered from a number of problems. The Chinese military hardly used radio equipment. On average, a CPV division had about 5 percent of the communication devices 4 of a US division.100 The PRC was also ranked relatively low in AFSA's order of priorities, although it climbed to the top when UN forces crossed the 38 parallel and advanced northward. Sigint collection efforts also suffered from a lack of Chinese linguists, primarily in the Mandarin dialect that was used by the PLA. The Allies' contribution was also limited. The British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) operated a listening post in Hong Kong, but it covered southern China, not Manchuria. The Taiwanese Sigint, which provided relevant information, was rejected for being "biased or self-serving."10
spl6 | Although one of the best experts on the subject regarded the Sigint contribution as "extremely poor,"the NSA account claimed that the lack of warning about the intervention "was a failure to utilize already available intelligence."1" Indeed, AFSA's monitoring, mainly of personal and administrative traffic, provided reasonable indications of the preparations to intervene. In May and June, it reported that 70,000 PLA troops, from two army groups, had moved down the Yangtze River.11 On July 17, it provided information that the Fourth Field Army, considered the PLA's best combat force, had deployed units in Manchuria and in east China. Based on this information, the Army G-2 assessed that the PRC intended to attack Taiwan, whereas G-2 in Tokyo concluded that the Fourth Army had "returned to its normal operating area in North China." The Watch Committee did a far better job on July 17, when estimating that "concentration of Chinese Communist troops in Manchuria might be intended for use in Korea."In early September, AFSA located the deployment of six PLA armies in Manchuria, and in the weeks that followed, it reported their move closer to the border, as well as the transfer by railroad of artillery units and of Chinese aircraft to newly established air bases in Manchuria. On the basis of this information, the Watch Committee 4 concluded on September 22 that the PLA could cross the Yalu "with little advance notice."112
7wzm | Other indications that were collected by AFSA included the reservation of ferries for military use in the Yalu, the ordering of 30,000 maps of Korea, shipments of medical supplies to the border area, and North Korean traffic mentioning a "regiment that came from China.115 Nevertheless, neither Sigint monitoring nor other means of collection provided indications for the actual crossing of the Yalu, which started on October 18 and took place at night under strict radio silence.114
e9xj | MacArthur's G-2 reports usually correctly reflected the available information. On July 3, Willoughby estimated that China "stationed two cavalry divisions and four armies in Manchuria." Since a Chinese Army amounted to about 30,000 soldiers, their total number reached at least 150,000. In late August, he estimated that 246,000 soldiers had been deployed there, and after the Inchon landing he "speculated that 450,000 Chinese troops were massed in Manchuria."115 On October 5, two weeks before the actual crossing had started, MacArthur's G-2 who relied on Taiwanese sources raised the possibility that nine Chinese divisions
9vl6 | had already deployed in Korea."" At the same time, and in contrast to the CIA, Willoughby did not report on the buildup of air fields near the border, although this indicated preparations for a confrontation with UN forces. When US reconnaissance flights revealed on October 18 that close to a hundred Soviet-made aircraft had been deployed in these airfields, MacArthur's air commander, Gen. Stratemeyer, estimated it to be a means to back up the Chinese intervention threats but, like Willoughby, regarded it as a bluff.118
c2fd | Chinese public and diplomatic intervention threats constituted a major source of concern, primarily in Washington, which was otherwise completely dependent on intelligence from the Far East Command. On September 26, a day after China's foreign minister Zhou Enlai warned that China would respond if the UN forces crossed the 38th parallel, the Chinese Foreign Office issued another public statement: "The American warmongers are mistaken in thinking that their accusations and threats would intimidate the people of
jzvp | Neither the warning indications about the PLA buildup in Manchuria nor the Chinese public and diplomatic warnings changed the American estimate that an intervention was unlikely. In an October 12 memorandum to President Truman, the CIA did not rule out "full-scale Chinese Communist intervention" but estimated that "barring a Soviet decision for global war, such action is not probable in 1950." The Kremlin, according to the CIA, had no interest in such a confrontation.12 President Truman and Secretary Acheson saw no reason to change their previous assessment. Acheson assessed that the military and political risks involved in intervention were too high and the strategic gains too low." 124
f71y | Basing his estimate on military factors, Willoughby said, in late September, "If the Chinese were going to intervene they would have done so when we made the Inchon landing."12 On the eve of MacArthur's conference with President Truman on Wake Island, Willoughby estimated that the Chinese intervention warnings were "probably in a category of 4 diplomatic blackmail."12 MacArthur echoed this estimate, telling President Truman during their October 15 meeting that the likelihood of Chinese intervention was "[v]ery little. Had they intervened in the first or second months it would have been decisive."127
31e1 | ii. The decision-making process: Washington, Tokyo, Korea
40ry | Most studies of the surprise Chinese attack in late November have focused on the failure, primarily in Washington, to realistically judge Beijing's public and diplomatic intervention threats. This mistaken estimate contributed to the American surprise, but its main source was the adherence of MacArthur and his G-2 to the belief that China would avoid massive intervention, despite undisputable evidence to the contrary. This misconception was the foundation of MacArthur's decision to advance to the Yalu, of Washington's political and military approval of this move, and of the operational risks taken by the UN forces in order to complete their mission as early as possible, which furthermore exposed them to the CPVF counteroffensive.
d1j2 | The clearest evidence for the PRC's intentions and capabilities was the PVF's First Campaign, which lasted two weeks. On October 25, the CPVF, which by this stage amounted to more than 260,000 soldiers, initiated
