        "content": "l6t9 | We investigated whether a transient expression of the Yamanaka factors in the four-factor mouse affects the module eigengenes. The experimental design is shown in Figure four D, with additional details reported in the original article. Four of six of the above-mentioned murine intervention modules showed a nominally significant dose-dependent rejuvenation in murine skin (P is less than zero point zero six), and two modules showed the same in kidney (dose refers to the duration of four-F treatment: zero, one, seven, and ten months of intermittent expression of four-F factors) (Figure four E). The purple, ivory, and lavenderblush three modules were particularly sensitive to the four-F treatment (Pearson's r negative zero point six four in skin). In addition, the purple Relative Age plus module's response to the four-F treatment is consistent with bioinformatic findings that OCT four is an upstream regulator of this module. Among the life span modules, only the black module demonstrates an increase (P equals zero point zero zero seven) in skin of four-F treated mice, but this was not observed in the kidney.\n1ujy | Epigenome-wide association analysis of maximum life span\nqzor | We performed epigenome-wide association studies to identify individual CpGs with methylation levels that correlate with maximum life span. To reduce bias resulting from different levels of sequence conservation, our studies of maximum life span focused on three hundred thirty-three eutherian species, excluding marsupial and monotreme species. We restricted the analysis to twenty-eight thousand three hundred eighteen high-quality probes that are conserved between humans and mice.\na0by | When relating individual CpGs to log-transformed maximum life span, we used several modeling approaches (for details, see the supplementary text). Briefly, our first approach, generic modeling, applied regres-\nu1ky | sion analysis ignoring tissue type and age. In our second approach, we repeated the regression analysis after focusing on a given tissue type. Third, we focused on specific nonoverlapping age groups: young animals (defined as age less than one point five times the age at sexual maturity), middle-aged, and old (defined as age greater than three point five times the age at sexual maturity; figure S19). Some of these regression models were further adjusted for average species weight (denoted Lifespan Adj Weight).\nhtm9 | For brevity, we will focus on linear regression models because phylogenetic regression models led to qualitatively similar conclusions (tables S13 and S14). The most significant life span-related CpGs are located in the distal in-neighboring TLE four (Pearson's r equals zero point six eight, P equals five point eight times ten to the negative forty-six; Figure five A and table S11) and HOXA four (r equals zero point six six, P equals seven point five times ten to the negative forty-five; Figure five A), module) and are negatively correlated with an intron of GATA three (r equals negative zero point six five, P equals eight point eight times ten to the negative forty-two); remained so after phylogenetic as the CpGs neighboring TLE four and HOXA four (P equals four point two times ten to the negative five and P equals four point eight times ten to the negative three, respectively; figure S17 and tables S11 and S12). The top one thousand life span-related CpGs (comprising five hundred positively and five hundred negatively life span-related CpGs) significantly overlapped (Fisher's exact P equals five point five times ten to the negative one thirty-four) with those found in our weight-adjusted analysis (Lifespan Adj Weight).\n8hul | In general, methylation of life span-related CpGs does not change with age in mammalian tissues (Figure five B and figure S20). The same can be seen from studies of life span restricted to animals of a given age group (e.g., only very young animals; figure S20D). The studies of life span in all animals (irrespective of age) is highly correlated (r greater than zero point seven), with the analogous studies restricted to animals that are young, middle-aged, or old.\n87vz | Studies of life span showed good consistency with the eigengene-based analysis in the mammalian comethylation network. As expected, the following previously discussed life span-related modules were enriched with CpGs implicated by our study of life span: midnightblue (hypergeometric test P equals two point two times ten to the negative forty-seven; 67/249 overlapped CpGs), greenyellow (hypergeometric\nym66 | P equals two point one times ten to the negative thirty-six, P equals six point seven times ten to the negative twenty-three, P equals fifty times ten to the negative eighteen: 104/1542 overlapped CpGs). In total, one thousand six genes had a differential methylation association with life span (union of cognate genes resulting from the marginal model analysis for life span and Lifespan Adj Weight). The gene expression levels of sixteen of these genes exhibited a highly significant repeated-measures correlation with chronological age (rmCorr P value less than ten to the negative fifty) in different human tissues (Figure five C). The cognate genes next to the top five hundred positively life span-related CpGs play a\nl0a3 | Modules sensitive to lifespan-related interventions",
