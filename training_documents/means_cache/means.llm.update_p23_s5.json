        "content": "rut3 | Observed power: This option provides an estimate of the probability that the statistical test could detect the difference between the observed group means (see Section two point nine point seven). This measure is pointless because if the F-test is significant then the probability that the effect was detected will, of course, be high. Likewise, if group differences were small, the observed power would be low. Do power calculations before the experiment is conducted, not after (see Section two point nine point eight).\nm3cp | Parameter estimates: This option produces a table of model parameters (b-values) and their tests of significance for the variables in the model (see Section thirteen point six point two).\nmq4s | Contrast coefficient matrix: This option produces matrices of\n95el | the coding values used for any contrasts in the analysis, which is useful for checking which groups are being compared in which contrast.\na0a5 | Homogeneity tests: This option produces Levene's test of the homogeneity of variance assumption (see Section nine point three). You'll have seen by now that I think this test needs to be taken with a pinch of salt.\ngocl | Spread versus level plot: This option produces a chart that plots the mean of each group of a factor (x-axis) against the standard deviation of that group (y-axis). This plot is useful to check that there is no relationship between the mean and standard deviation. If a relationship exists then the data may need to be stabilized using a logarithmic transformation (see Chapter six).\nob1z | Residual plot: This option produces a matrix scatterplot of all combinations of pairs of the following variables: observed values of the outcome, predicted values from the model, standardized residuals from the model. These plots can be used to assess the assumption of homoscedasticity. In particular, the plot of the standardized residuals against the predicted values from the model can be interpreted in a similar way to the zpred versus zresid plot that we have discussed before.\nm4cb | Heteroskedasticity tests: There are four tests for heteroscedasticity that you can select (two variants of the Breusch-Pagan test, White's test and an F-test). For the same reasons that I don't recommend Levene's test, I also don't recommend these (that is, because they are significance tests your decisions based on them will be confounded by your sample size).\nm61y | Parameter estimates with robust standard errors: This produces one of five methods (HC0 to HC4) to estimate standard errors (and, therefore, confidence intervals) for the model parameters that are robust to heteroscedasticity. These methods are described clearly in Hayes and Cai in twenty zero seven. In short, HC3 has been shown to outperform HC0 to HC2 (Long and Ervin in two thousand) but HC4 outperforms HC3 in some circumstances (Cribari-Neto in two thousand four). Basically choose HC3 or HC4.\nu2ob | Oditi's Lantern ANCOVA\n2gnm | Thirteen point five point seven Bootstrapping and plots\nemgw | There are other options available from the main dialog box. For example, if you have several independent variables you can plot them against each other (which is useful for interpreting interaction effects, see Section fourteen point seven). There's also the\nxaqt | Bootstrap button, which you can use to activate bootstrapping. Selecting this option will bootstrap confidence intervals around the estimated marginal means, parameter estimates (b-values) and post hoc tests, but not the main F-statistic.\n5rcb | O K\n524j | Select the options described in Section six point twelve point three and click\nxd3m | in the\n8qb6 | main dialog box to run the analysis.\nwkbn | Thirteen point six Interpreting ANCOVA Thirteen point six point one What happens when the covariate is excluded?\nftfg | Output thirteen point five shows (for illustrative purposes) the ANOVA table for these data when the covariate is not included. It is clear from the significance value, which is greater than zero point zero five, that puppy therapy seems to have no significant effect on happiness. Note that the total amount of variation in happiness (SST) was one hundred ten point ninety-seven (Corrected Total), of which the therapy condition accounted for sixteen point eighty-four units while ninety-four point twelve were unexplained\n7xi5 | differ in their levels of happiness.\nw8r5 | Thirteen point six point two The main analysis\nybik | The format of the ANOVA table in Output thirteen point six is largely the same as without the covariate, except that there is an additional row of information about the covariate (Puppy_love). Looking first at the significance values, the covariate significantly predicts the dependent variable which is less than zero point zero five. Therefore, the person's happiness is significantly influenced by their love of puppies. What's more interesting is that when the effect of love of puppies is removed, the effect of puppy therapy is significant which is less than zero point zero five. The amount of variation accounted for by puppy therapy has increased to twenty-five point nineteen units and the unexplained variance has been reduced to seventy-nine point zero five units. Notice that SST has not changed; all that has changed is how that total variation is partitioned.\ngii5 | This example illustrates how covariates can help us to exert stricter experimental control by taking account of confounding variables to give us a 'purer' measure of effect of the experimental manipulation. Looking back at the group means from Table thirteen point one, you might think that the significant F-statistic reflects a difference between the control group and the two experimental groups - because the fifteen and thirty-minute groups have very similar means (four point eighty-eight and four point eighty-five) whereas the control group mean is much lower at three point twenty-two. However, we can't use these group means to interpret the effect because they have not been adjusted for the effect of the covariate. These original means tell us nothing about the group differences reflected by the significant F. Output thirteen point seven gives the adjusted values of the group means (which we calculated in Section thirteen point three), and we use these values for interpretation (this is why we selected Display Means for in Section thirteen point five point six). From these adjusted means you can see that happiness increased across\nq5eu | the three doses. Output thirteen point seven",
