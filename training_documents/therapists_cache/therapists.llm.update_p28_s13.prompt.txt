You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

gx97 | This ability to integrate and see an increasing number of parallels between one's therapeutic style and one's in- terpersonal style outside of therapy, combined with the ability to draw on a wide repertoire of interpersonal be- haviors as appropriate for any given interaction, may be associated with decreased feelings of burnout and frustra- tion. Having a therapeutic style that feels consistent with one's day-to-day personality is referred to as an integrated use of self.
ppkp | Assessing Mode Use
8br6 | To date, nine assessments of mode use based on the IRM have been developed. One of these assessments is featured in this chapter: The Self-Assessment of Modes, Version III. The Self-Assessment of Modes, Version III, consists of nine different clinical scenarios, each portraying a client or caregiver facing a dilemma. Four possible therapeutic responses (i.e., modes) are presented beneath each clinical scenario. Respondents are required to rank-order the re- sponses from one to four based upon the degree to which they agree with the given response. The additional IRM assessments, most of which have been validated or are in the process of being validated, are available at the IRM website: http://irm.ahslabs.uic.edu/.

cbb5 | Self-Assessment of Modes Questionnaire, Version III
5qcf | This assessment is designed to allow you to identify whether you have a dominant way or central set of ways of responding to various interpersonal events that arise in therapy. Please do not think too hard about the responses and respond as if you were facing the situations described in real-time practice. All responses represent plausible therapeutic actions, and there are no incorrect responses.
8u2c | For every scenario, please rank-order each of the four response options accord- ing to the extent to which you would view the option as being consistent with your predominant (i.e., usual) way of interacting. Please rank the general idea or feeling you have about the response, even if the way that the example is worded is not identical to what you would actually say. Your numeric rankings should adhere to the following scale:
c1e3 | 1 = highly consistent with how I would usually respond
7pez | 2 = very consistent with how I would usually respond
qs5t | 3 = moderately consistent with how I would usually respond
en4s | SUMMARY
csb5 | The "cautions" section under each of the interpersonal modes reveals one of the hidden secrets of therapeutic use of self-that no therapist is perfect. There is no way to escape the caveats and downsides that go along with any therapeutic mode or set of modes. Additionally, no one is immune from communicating the modes suboptimally from time to time. One key to the intentional use of self is to familiarize oneself with the caveats to each of the modes that are part of one's therapeutic style. The more you develop an ability to draw on as many modes as neces- sary and appropriate for a given client, the more likely you are to avoid overutilizing one style at the expense of using a more appropriate or more indicated style for that client.
i096 | Please note that you may only assign a number once; please do not assign the same number to more than one response option. It is recognized that your actual response may depend on information that is not available in the case description. The point of this questionnaire is not to ascertain a correct response but to ascertain the one that is most representative of your interpersonal style. Please do not dwell on the options for too long. Instead, choose the response that would be the easiest, most natural, or most typical for you in each situation.
tlzt | Please see the following example, where, in this case, option "d" is the response most consistent with the respondent's usual way of interacting:
6iyf | 1. You are working with a 92-year-old retired steelworker who has always performed his own handiwork around the house. He is receiving postsurgical therapy for a shoulder in- jury that he endured after a fall from a stepstool while changing a light bulb in his home. When the client is not in the room, his family members tell you that this is not the first accident that he has had doing handiwork. They add that, recently, he has become more accident-prone while completing tasks that should be done by hired workers. The cli- ent's family is concerned about his safety. They feel that he does not listen to them when they ask him to call a hired worker instead of performing household duties on his own. The family reports that the client is otherwise safe when not engaging in household tasks. Please rank-order each response to the family according to the following scale:
o1nk | 1 = highly consistent with how I would usually respond
mnaf | 2 = very consistent with how I would usually respond
0yxe | 3 = moderately consistent with how I would usually respond
erre | 4 = slightly or not at all consistent with how I would usually respond
835g | 2. You are working with a 42-year-old engineer specializing in geomechanics. Work has always been one of the most gratifying things in his life. He is receiving occupational therapy following a spinal cord injury. Because of the injury, the client now requires a special form of powered mobility that traverses different types of terrain in order to complete fieldwork assignments. However, neither his employer nor his insurance company is willing to cover the cost of the equipment, arguing that the powered mobil- ity that he currently uses should be adequate. The client tells you that this specialized power mobility is vital to his ability to complete his work. He adds that his current chair frequently gets stuck, limiting his timeliness, efficiency, and overall productivity. Please rank-order each response according to the following scale:
x3l9 | 1 = highly consistent with how I would usually respond
d2fj | 2 = very consistent with how I would usually respond
geyi | 3 = moderately consistent with how I would usually respond
2181 | 4 = slightly or not at all consistent with how I would usually respond
9ubl | 3. You are working with a 74-year-old homemaker and accountant from a rural commu- nity. She has invested her entire life in raising a family while simultaneously operating a successful part-time tax-assistance business from home. Until now, she has been in perfect health and has never experienced any injuries or impairments. Newly referred for rehabilitation and having successfully accomplished all of the activities thus far, she is clearly frustrated and demoralized over the difficulty that she is having making a toilet transfer. After two transfer attempts, she tells you that she knows she cannot do it, and that she is going to end up in a nursing home. She is concerned that she won't be able to return to her home, where she has lived for 30 years. Most individuals with her level of impairment are eventually able to return to independent living and are able to make the transfer. Please rank-order each response according to the following scale:
o8pj | 1 = highly consistent with how I would usually respond
27b9 | 2 = very consistent with how I would usually respond
09xa | 3 = moderately consistent with how I would usually respond
yi97 | 4 = slightly or not at all consistent with how I would usually respond
4zj7 | 4. You are working with a studious and well liked 13-year-old client with cerebral palsy you have worked with for the past 2 years. She tells you she is feeling hurt and betrayed by something she overheard one of her friends say to another peer at school today in reference to her disability. Because of the presence of many bullies and a lack of appropriate disciplinary oversight, her school is a socially tough environment for many students. Though she is quite gregarious and popular with most of her peers, this is not the first time that she has been hurt by jokes and disparaging comments by peers and
