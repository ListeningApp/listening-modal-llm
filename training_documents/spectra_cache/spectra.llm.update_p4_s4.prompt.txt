You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

vbni | The time of SL flash is very short, <LATEX>\approx 1 0 ^ { - 1 0 } s ^ { 2 7 }</LATEX> Atoms and molecules can take part in <LATEX>1 0 ^ { 3 }</LATEX> collisions in this time.13 Consequently, the equilibrium can be achieved only for the translational degrees of freedom, partly for dissociation and electronic, rotational, and vibrational transitions. The ionization and ionic recombination processes are far from the equilibrium.13 Probably, more correctly, one should discuss the "effective" temperature inside the bubble.29 Hence, we shall mean the effective temperature inside the bubble in discussing the results obtained in this work.
dgcw | The luminescent nature of SL has been repeatedly proved so the supposition that sonoluminescence has to be blackbody radiation needs addition argumentations. Probably, this conclu- sion has been made by the authors of refs 6 and 7 because they did not detect any lines or bands in the spectra. Actually, SL was obtained from the bubble, which contains air gases and water vapors. These spectra are broadened; the band from the excited OH* radical is not prominent13,15 because of the luminescence of the products of the chemical reactions of nitrogen and oxygen atoms and molecules inside the cavitation bubble.2,15
gvwz | The results of recently published papers on the spectra of SL of organic liquids14 are in contradiction with the blackbody mechanism.6 Those spectra show a prominent emission from the excited <LATEX>C _ { 2 } *</LATEX> radical.14 The SL spectra of dodecane were studied in the presence of He, Ne, and Ar and in the mixture of He/Ar. The data showed that the ratio of the intensity of <LATEX>C _ { 2 } *</LATEX> emission to the intensity of a continuum does not depend on the thermal conductivity of the dissolved gas. Besides, no bands or lines were detected in those spectra at wavelengths shorter than 300 nm.14 Thus, one can conclude that the bands at <LATEX>A <</LATEX> 270 nm in the SL spectra of water saturated with noble gases (Figure 1) are not the emission of the heated gas. Otherwise, they must be presented in the spectra of ref 14. Thus, these bands originate from the emission of water molecules or some particles which contain a water molecule (or the product of its dissociation) with the atoms of noble gases. It is very difficult also to explain with the help of the blackbody mechanism of sonoluminescence the very short time of SL flash and the fact that it is over before the minimum size of a bubble is reached.10 Thus, the blackbody mechanism of SL is inconsistent with the experimental results.
sk5m | Interpretation of Spectra. The compression of a cavitation bubble starts slowly, almost isothermally. Vapors are partly condensed, and the evolved heat of condensation is extracted by the thermal conductivity of a liquid. Next, the velocity of a bubble compression increases, and it shrinks almost adiabati- cally with the continuous growth of temperature and pressure. The kinetic energy of particles inside the bubble also increases. It can be converted into the energy of electronic excitation by means of inelastic collisions3,15
