You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

qdn7 | Secondly, a deficiency of fully connected architectures is that the topology of the input is entirely ignored. The input variables can be presented in any (fixed) order without af- fecting the outcome of the training. On the contrary, images (or time-frequency representations of speech) have a strong 2-D local structure: variables (or pixels) that are spatially or temporally nearby are highly correlated. Local correlations are the reasons for the well-known advantages of extracting and combining local features before recognizing spatial or temporal objects, because configurations of neighboring variables can be classified into a small number of categories (e.g., edges, corners, etc.). Convolutional networks force the extraction of local features by restricting the receptive fields of hidden units to be local.
dib4 | A. Convolutional Networks
yvqj | Convolutional networks combine three architectural ideas to ensure some degree of shift, scale, and distortion in- variance: 1) local receptive fields; 2) shared weights (or weight replication); and 3) spatial or temporal subsampling. A typical convolutional network for recognizing characters, dubbed LeNet-5, is shown in Fig. 2. The input plane receives images of characters that are approximately size normalized and centered. Each unit in a layer receives inputs from a set of units located in a small neighborhood
vz2f | in the previous layer. The idea of connecting units to local receptive fields on the input goes back to the perceptron in the early 1960's, and it was almost simultaneous with Hubel and Wiesel's discovery of locally sensitive, orientation- selective neurons in the cat's visual system [30]. Local connections have been used many times in neural models of visual learning [2], [18], [31]-[34]. With local receptive fields neurons can extract elementary visual features such as oriented edges, endpoints, corners (or similar features in other signals such as speech spectrograms). These features are then combined by the subsequent layers in order to detect higher order features. As stated earlier, distortions or shifts of the input can cause the position of salient features to vary. In addition, elementary feature detectors that are useful on one part of the image are likely to be useful across the entire image. This knowledge can be applied by forcing a set of units, whose receptive fields are located at different places on the image, to have identical weight vectors [15], [32], [34]. Units in a layer are organized in planes within which all the units share the same set of weights. The set of outputs of the units in such a plane is called a feature map. Units in a feature map are all constrained to perform the same operation on different parts of the image. A complete convolutional layer is composed of several feature maps (with different weight vectors), so that multiple features can be extracted at each location. A concrete example of this is the first layer of LeNet-5 shown in Fig. 2. Units in the first hidden layer of LeNet-5 are organized in six planes, each of which is a feature map. A unit in a feature map has 25 inputs connected to a 5x5 area in the input, called the receptive field of the unit. Each unit has 25 inputs and therefore 25 trainable coefficients plus a trainable bias. The receptive fields of contiguous units in a feature map are centered on corresponding contiguous units in the previous layer. Therefore, receptive fields of neighboring units overlap. For example, in the first hidden layer of LeNet-5, the receptive fields of horizontally contiguous units overlap by four columns and five rows. As stated earlier, all the units in a feature map share the same set of 25 weights and the same bias, so they detect the same feature at all possible locations on the input. The other feature maps in the layer use different sets of weights and biases, thereby extracting different types of local features. In the
wyu0 | case of LeNet-5, at each input location six different types of features are extracted by six units in identical locations in the six feature maps. A sequential implementation of a feature map would scan the input image with a single unit that has a local receptive field and store the states of this unit at corresponding locations in the feature map. This operation is equivalent to a convolution, followed by an additive bias and squashing function, hence the name convolutional network. The kernel of the convolution is the set of connection weights used by the units in the feature map. An interesting property of convolutional layers is that if the input image is shifted, the feature map output will be shifted by the same amount, but it will be left unchanged otherwise. This property is at the basis of the robustness of convolutional networks to shifts and distortions of the input.
s8xw | Once a feature has been detected, its exact location becomes less important. Only its approximate position relative to other features is relevant. For example, once we know that the input image contains the endpoint of a roughly horizontal segment in the upper left area, a corner in the upper right area, and the endpoint of a roughly vertical segment in the lower portion of the image, we can tell the input image is a seven. Not only is the precise position of each of those features irrelevant for identifying the pattern, it is potentially harmful because the positions are likely to vary for different instances of the character. A simple way to reduce the precision with which the position of distinctive features are encoded in a feature map is to reduce the spatial resolution of the feature map. This can be achieved with a so-called subsampling layer, which performs a local averaging and a subsampling, thereby reducing the resolution of the feature map and reducing the sensitivity of the output to shifts and distortions. The second hidden layer of LeNet-5 is a subsampling layer. This layer comprises six feature maps, one for each feature map in the previous layer. The receptive field of each unit is a 2×2 area in the previous layer's corresponding feature map. Each unit computes the average of its four inputs, multiplies it by a trainable coefficient, adds a trainable bias, and passes the result through a sigmoid function. Contiguous units have nonoverlapping contiguous receptive fields. Consequently, a subsampling layer feature map has half the number of rows and columns as the feature maps in the previous layer. The trainable coefficient and bias control the effect of the sigmoid nonlinearity. If the coefficient is small, then the unit operates in a quasi-linear mode, and the subsampling layer merely blurs the input. If the coefficient is large, subsampling units can be seen as performing a "noisy OR" or a "noisy AND" function depending on the value of the bias. Successive layers of convolutions and subsampling are typically alternated resulting in a "bipyramid": at each layer, the number of feature maps is increased as the spatial resolution is decreased. Each unit in the third hidden layer in Fig. 2 may have input connections from several feature maps in the previous layer. The convolution/subsampling combination, inspired by Hubel and Wiesel's notions of "simple" and "complex" cells, was implemented in Fukushima's Neocognitron [32],
afv1 | though no globally supervised learning procedure such as back propagation was available then. A large degree of invariance to geometric transformations of the input can be achieved with this progressive reduction of spatial resolution compensated by a progressive increase of the richness of the representation (the number of feature maps).
fwf1 | Since all the weights are learned with back propagation, convolutional networks can be seen as synthesizing their own feature extractor. The weight sharing technique has the interesting side effect of reducing the number of free parameters, thereby reducing the "capacity" of the machine and reducing the gap between test error and training error [34]. The network in Fig. 2 contains 345 308 connections, but only 60 000 trainable free parameters because of the weight sharing.
