You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

wtfz | (1) The initial magmatic crystallization (4.56 Ga) and subsequent thermal metamorphism occurred prior to 4.5 Ga. The U-Pb ages of the various eucrite zircons reveal the timing of the ubiquitous thermal metamorphism of the initial basaltic crust of Vesta to be 4.55 Ga at a metamorphic temperature of ~900℃ (lizuka et al., 2015). After an intensive initial differ- entiation at 4.56 Ga, the magmatism on Vesta lasted until 4.53 Ga, according to the Hf-W records of unbrecciated eucrite zir- con (Roszjar et al., 2016). In addition, the asteroid may have suffered a large basin-forming collision at this stage (Hopkins et al., 2015; Kennedy et al., 2019). The U-Pb, and Hf-W studies of mesosiderite zircons also provide a high-temperature re- heating age of 4.53 Ga (Haba et al., 2017, 2019; Koike et al., 2017) that is attributed to a catastrophic collision.
qy1i | (2) After this early event 1, the asteroid experienced moderate col- lisions prior to 4.15 Ga. At this stage, none of the earlier zircon crystals were remelted or recrystallized and the crystals' U-Pb and Hf-W chronologies remained closed. Instead, the impacts were recorded by the U-Pb systems in phosphates (this study; Liao and Hsu, 2017; Zhou et al., 2011) and silicates (Galer and Lugmair, 1996; Tera et al., 1997) in several brecciated eucrites. The reheating temperature likely exceeded their closure tem- peratures (~590-1000℃) and rapidly quenched. Some regions may have exceeded the basalt melting point and formed the
1k9e | impact melt. Because the studied eucrites resided at different locations on their parent body, their records indicate multiple collisions during ~4.4-4.15 Ga.
5bjs | (3) Later collisions occurred at ~3.9-3.5 Ga. These events were recorded only by the 40 Ar-39 Ar ages, where the reheating tem- perature may have slightly exceeded the K-Ar closure tem- perature <LATEX>\left( \sim 2 5 0 ^ { \circ } C - 5 0 0 ^ { \circ } C \right.</LATEX> Table S3). Theoretical calculations indicate that such moderate reheating can be achieved by low- velocity (i.e., slower than the typical relative speed of aster- oidal bodies) mild collisions. The absence of a U-Pb record (for either phosphates or silicates) at ~3.9 Ga suggests that these later collisions were much weaker than the earlier ones.
uodj | The multiple moderate collisions prior to 4.15 Ga (event 2) could be attributed to the start of the LHB (Liao and Hsu, 2017; Zhou et al., 2011), even though some data in Fig. 5 are significantly earlier than the 40 Ar-39 Ar ages. Conversely, event 2 can be ex- plained as an "end-tail" of the cataclysmic collisions at the earlier
k16v | stage of >4.5 Ga (event 1). Such "end-tail" collisions significantly decreased by ~3.9 Ga (event 3), when only weak (or low-velocity) impacts occurred. This interpretation matches the recent theoreti- cal models of an early bombardment (≥4.5 Ga) and a subsequent monotonic decrease in impacts in the inner solar system (Mojzsis et al., 2019; Brasser et al., 2020). Even though the number of key chronological data is still small, this is an important piece of ev- idence for the early collisional history of the inner solar system. Future studies of other asteroidal materials are expected to help reconstruct the whole history.
b2lm | 6. Conclusions
ti7f | NanoSIMS U-Pb dating was conducted on apatite and merril- lite minerals in three brecciated basaltic eucrites (Juvinas, Camel Donga, and Stannern) and two unbrecciated basaltic achondrites (Agoult and Ibitira). The weighted mean model <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / ^ { 2 0 6 } p b ^ { * }</LATEX> age of the Agoult apatite was determined to be <LATEX>4 5 2 4 . 8 \pm 9 . 6 M a ,</LATEX> sig- nificantly younger than its zircon age (4555 Ma) and older than the
