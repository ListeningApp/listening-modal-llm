The model consists of a modified form of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for the evolution of the magnetization vector in a rigid ferromagnet. We give a global existence result and characterize the long time behaviour of the obtained solutions. The sensitivity of the model with respect to large and small nonlocal damping parameters is also discussed.\nvbni | One. Introduction and Preliminary Results\ndgcw | In this work, we are dealing with a mathematical model arising in the theory of magnetization dynamics with nonlocal damping. We will consider the model proposed by Nembach et al. It is given by a modified Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. The modification lies in the presence of a second-order space derivative of magnetization in the effective field. To describe the model equations, we consider section two of R cubed a bounded and regular open set of R cubed. The generic point of R cubed is denoted by x. We assume that a ferromagnetic material occupies the domain two.\ngvwz | In what follows, S two represents the unit sphere of R cubed. The magnetization field of the ferromagnetic material which belongs to S two almost everywhere is denoted by M of t and x. Its evolution is governed by the following modified Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. \nsk5m | One plus alpha squared times the partial derivative of M with respect to t minus alpha times the cross product of M and the effective field equals negative M cross the effective field.\nqws8 | The first equation\n877u | in the set of t between zero and T times Q.\nrzhj | Subject to initial conditions\nbfax | M of zero and x equals M naught of x in Q.\nf2y8 | and boundary conditions\no7qm | Cross product of M and the normal derivative of the effective field at the boundary plus alpha times partial M with respect to t equals zero on the boundary of Q.\nd52l | where the symbol x denotes the vector cross product in R cubed. The positive constant alpha represents the damping parameter. The effective magnetic field H depends on M and is given by\nqlbb | H of M equals D times Laplacian of M plus the Gilbert term times the cross product of M and M plus Lee term of M plus the demagnetizing field.\nnhsg | The first term on the right-hand side of the fourth equation is called the exchange magnetic field, where the positive constant D is the exchange coefficient and the term parameterized by the positive constant describes nonlocal damping in ferromagnets. The term was introduced in past studies. The third term is the bulk anisotropy field, which generally is taken as linear with respect to M, and the demagnetizing field satisfies in the set of t between zero and T times R cubed the stray field equation\nhy0l | divergence of demagnetizing field plus M equals zero, curl of demagnetizing field equals zero.\n4jmz | The fifth equation\nb7cq | where M is the extension by zero of M outside the magnetic domain Q.\n0b39 | Notice that, for the sake of simplicity, the bulk uniaxial anisotropy field, generally taken as linear in M, and the magnetostatic field which satisfy the stray field equation are\nqecd | not considered since they only induce more computations and have no mathematical influence on the results we obtain.\n1o7p | We define the energy\ncp13 | The energy C of t equals D times the integral over the set of the magnitude of the gradient of M squared with respect to x.\nbgre | The following energy estimate holds.\n57lp | Lemma One. If M is a solution of problem one, then it satisfies, at least formally, the energy estimate\nukth | The time derivative of energy of t plus two times zeta times the integral over the set of the magnitude of the partial time derivative of M squared with respect to x plus two alpha over one plus alpha squared times the integral over the set of the magnitude of the partial time derivative of M squared with respect to x equals zero.\nkpvt | Proof. The techniques to obtain the seventh equation are analogous to those used, for example, in past studies. We rewrite Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation one in the following form:\njie2 | The term alpha times the partial time derivative of M minus the term one plus alpha squared times H equals alpha times M cross the term alpha times the partial time derivative of M minus the term one plus alpha squared times H minus the term one plus alpha squared times H.\nd0ik | Multiplying the eighth equation by the term alpha times the partial time derivative of M minus the term one plus alpha squared times H and using the saturation constraint magnitude of M squared equals one almost everywhere yields to\n0x0s | alpha over one plus alpha squared times the magnitude of the partial time derivative of M squared equals H dot product with the partial time derivative of M.\n4exe | Integrating the ninth equation on the set, the right-hand side of the ninth equation becomes\n0myz | The tenth equation\nxh3i | The integral over the set of H dot product with the partial time derivative of M with respect to x equals negative D times the integral over the set of the partial time derivative of M times the second partial time derivative of M with respect to x minus zeta times the integral over the set of the partial spatial derivative of the partial time derivative of M squared with respect to x plus the integral over the boundary of the set of D times the partial normal derivative of M plus zeta times the partial normal derivative of the partial time derivative of M times the partial time derivative of M with respect to the boundary, where we have used the summation convention that repeated indices are summed over and partial sub i denotes the derivative with respect to space variable x. Converting the two last terms of the right-hand side of the tenth equation allows us to get",
