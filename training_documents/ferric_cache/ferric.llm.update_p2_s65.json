        "content": "y2qo | The C-N linkage of two molecules of cWP involves a two-electron oxidation of the substrates, and mechanisms that are initiated by indole or DKP N-H abstraction by CYP-I have been advanced. A structural alignment of AspB with other well-characterized CYP monooxygenases shows a distinct alteration of residues at the I-helix that are known to be critical for O-O heterolysis in O two-activating CYPs. Notably, AspB lacks the highly conserved acid (Asp or Glu) on the I-helix distal pocket that forms half of the \"acid-alcohol pair\" that is crucial for mediating proton delivery to the ferric peroxo-anion intermediate. Due to this deviation (a proline is found at the corresponding position in AspB), we performed steady-state kinetic solvent isotope effect (KSIE) experiments to determine if an alternative mode of proton delivery was operant. A comparison of the rates of product formation by AspB in H two O and D two O buffers revealed an inverse KSIE of zero point six six Â± zero point one. This phenomenon is highly unusual for a P four fifty that employs CYP-I as an oxidant, as rate-limiting proton-transfer steps are involved in its generation. Furthermore, increasing the concentration of protons in AspB reactions by lowering the pH resulted in a slower rate of product formation. This is the opposite trend from what was previously observed for the analogous I-helix acid mutant (D two fifty one N) in the camphor monooxygenase CYP one-oh-one. In that case, an increase in the turnover rate and corresponding approximately five-fold increase in the KSIE at lower pH was attributed to an extended proton-delivery chain involved in the generation of CYP-I. In contrast, the availability of protons appears to impede product formation in AspB despite the absence of an I-helix acid.\n\n1piq | Inverse KSIEs have been reported for some atypical P four fifty reactions and used as a rationale to invoke intermediates that precede compound I. These include substrate transformations that are either postulated or demonstrated to be mediated by a ferric-peroxoanion species, such as the seventeen, twenty lyase chemistry catalyzed by CYP seventeen A one in the conversion of seventeen-hydroxypregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone, and more recently, an epoxide ring-opening cascade of tirandamycin L by mutants of the CYP TamI. However, the nucleophilicity of a ferric peroxoanion complex would make it unlikely to serve as an effective reagent for cWP dimerization.\n\n7fqw | Transient Kinetic Studies. To gain insight into the potential involvement of an alternative oxidant in AspB, we\n\nrhaz | performed stopped-flow absorption experiments at four degrees Celsius where the reduced enzyme-substrate (E-S) complex was rapidly mixed with excess O two. The resulting ferric-superoxide (or \"oxy\") complex represents the last semistable intermediate in CYP catalysis and the first branchpoint between productive catalysis and uncoupling. The intermediate can either decay via the release of superoxide via autoxidation, or if a second reducing equivalent is suitably provided, be further activated to form a (hydro)peroxo or CYP-I following the O-O bond cleavage. In the first one hundred milliseconds after mixing of the reduced substrate-saturated AspB with excess O two, the ferrous enzyme rapidly decays to form a new species with absorption characteristics (Soret approximately four hundred twenty-four nanometers and merged Q-bands approximately five hundred fifty-six nanometers and a shoulder approximately five hundred eighty-five nanometers) that are similar to other reported Fe three plus-O two negative complexes. As a second electron is not provided for catalysis to occur, one would anticipate that autoxidation should result in reformation of the ferric enzyme-substrate bound resting state. Substrate-saturated AspB is composed of a mixture of high- and low-spin (HS and LS) species (approximately fifteen percent HS at four degrees Celsius). However, the AspB oxy-complex appears to directly decay to a purely LS-form from zero point one to two point five seconds.",
