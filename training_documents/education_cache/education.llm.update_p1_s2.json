Rising costs are no longer matched by a willingness of governments and students to pay for them. And yet the traditional operating model of a university cannot produce sufficient productivity gains to cover the gap.\ns2v1 | Even before the pandemic, the relentless rise in costs was going to bring matters to a head. The broad support for universities that has been a feature since the nineteen sixties is faltering and real increases in per-student funding are unlikely in many jurisdictions.\njkp9 | In addition, universities are being buffeted by other forces. Technological change and a new world of work are generating calls for new types of post-secondary education. Demographic change will likely mean smaller domestic cohorts of students in most liberal democracies. Climate change is leading to expectations that public bodies will be carbon neutral in their operations. Competition from non-traditional entrants investing in large scale digital delivery threatens a portion of their markets. The Age of the Customer has arrived and students have higher expectations about the experience and what it will lead to.\nz8tt | Traditional universities are approaching a crossroads. They must decide whether to transform themselves into new kinds of entities, optimize their existing operations in a search for further efficiencies and increased capability, do nothing in the hope that if no rescue appears they will have time to decide what to do later, or do nothing in the belief that they are invulnerable.\n9g22 | This report analyzes the current state of higher education in a disruptive world and suggests four building blocks for a way forward, in terms of strategy, capabilities, operating model and technology. The result will be a 'connected university' able to keep delivering the extraordinary benefits that higher education can deliver for its communities.\n41fx | The future of higher education in a disruptive world\n7um8 | Introduction\nuow2 | The Golden Age of universities enjoyed in the developed world since the mid- twentieth century is passing. Good times are giving way to tough times. Success will be harder to come by.\niat7 | This was already the case in twenty nineteen, but twenty twenty saw the black swan event of the pandemic, with the closure of international borders and the lockdown of domestic economies.\nywwr | For many universities, the future arrived ahead of schedule, abruptly and without invitation.\n0i6j | Universities have been caught up in the post-COVID-nineteen trends affecting society but they have also experienced a world of pain uniquely their own, starting in Australia, where the new academic year was about to begin when borders were closed in February twenty twenty. By the end of the year, many OECD members will have seen clearly what international education has really meant to their economy.\n87cq | Bail-out packages for universities which were initially assumed to be coming, didn't arrive early, on the scale expected, or in some cases at all. Society, it turns out, had higher priorities.\n0qs3 | Large numbers of lectures were put online, quickly, by scholars who had previously vowed never to have anything to do with it. Large numbers of adjuncts or sessional teachers were laid off, and faculty members were left with ... the students!\nz8f7 | The business and operating models of many universities were exposed as critically reliant on the good times continuing.\n7w7j | Real and painful as all this has been, most of the consequences of the pandemic were at least evident as emerging trends. Little of what follows in this report changes as a result of it; only the timing and urgency. The future has just arrived inconveniently early.\n51vd | As with all discussions of the future, one makes educated judgments based on trends and the experience of sectors which were exposed earlier to the same drivers of change. In this, universities are lucky. The transformations many industries and organizations have gone through can be examined, and better practice adopted. Much of what follows in this report about the future state of universities is based on and adapted from hard evidence about what has worked elsewhere. Of all the claims and predictions that follow, perhaps the one most-confidently made is that higher education will move from relative uniformity to great diversity.\nbaj1 | Different types of providers and forms of provision will proliferate. Physically, we will see a mix of actual campuses, augmented campuses (where mixed reality and the analogue world fuse) and virtual learning environments. Educationally, we will see much more experimentation with content and delivery.\nn1wo | And of all the forces impelling this diversity, the most powerful will be the search to meet the needs of individual students. The quality of personalized student learning will be key to institutional success.\n5bq3 | This report is part of a wider project on KPMG Connected Enterprise for Higher Education, a framework for university transformation in the interests of stakeholders.\nezla | Much of the hard work of this transformation will be behind the scenes, invisible even. Transformation is not only about the curriculum, learning delivery, student support and research. It is about the back office, the operating model, the technology and, fundamentally, the sum of capabilities that reside in the organization: to be flexible, agile, deliberate and led by insights from the evidence.\nrsbu | No one is guaranteed of success, but those institutions that have high levels of these capabilities will be far better equipped to survive disruption and, in turn, create it. And to be blunt, they will likely be more efficient, cost less to run and have more resources for their core purposes of learning and discovery.\nmagd | The focus of this report is higher education, and for practical purposes that means universities, which at this point in our history are by far the dominant providers. 'Higher education' itself is defined differently around the world, with some systems including within it quite practical, training institutions.\ntb74 | Broadly, we are focusing on those institutions that deliver bachelor degrees and above, whether or not they also conduct research. However, much of what follows will still be relevant to vocational education in jurisdictions where that is clearly separated out as a sector.\n8l69 | The focus is also on the institution rather than the system, but post-secondary systems around the world will need to be reimagined as well. The good news is that leading, transformed member institutions of those systems will have the most influence on the redesign.\n1jyv | Universities are at or approaching a crossroads: Do they transform? Optimize? Do nothing and hope there is time to react? Or simply do nothing because they are invulnerable? This report, and the framework it introduces, is intended as a guide to the choice of roads to take.\nolce | Transformation is not only about the curriculum, learning delivery, student support and research. It is about the back office, the operating model, the technology and, fundamentally, the sum of capabilities that reside in the organization.\nerx1 | End of a golden age for universities\nb3bt | The combination of human capital theory, equality of opportunity, the emergence of an export industry and the need for research combined to create a Golden Age of expansion and esteem. \n0w8m | Higher education since the Second World War has been an extraordinary growth story, moving from an elite system to a mass- or high-participation system in most jurisdictions. On average globally, one in three young people now enter higher education and more than three in four do so in Europe and North America. This expansion has contributed greatly to life-enrichment, nation-building, social well- being and technological progress.\nvcu3 | Higher education growth has far outpaced other forms of growth. Higher education grew by a factor of six point one two between nineteen seventy and two thousand thirteen, while population multiplied by one point nine three and real GDP by three point six three. The growth was advocated and justified on various grounds, all of which commanded popular support. 'Human capital theory' gave it an economic justification, showing that spending on higher education was actually an investment in economic growth. Equality of opportunity gave it a social justification. It is hard to argue against the idea of equality of opportunity or its close cousin, meritocracy.\n```",
