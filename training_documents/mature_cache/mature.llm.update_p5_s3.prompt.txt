You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7um8 | Positioning
uow2 | For the purpose of analysing the discourse data of adolescent males, we draw on the concept of 'positioning'. This concept has gained current relevance in theorizing identity and subjectivity, where 'positions' are typically conceptualized being grounded in discourses (also variously called 'master narratives', 'plot lines', 'master plots', 'dominant discourses' or simply 'cultural texts'). These discourses are taken to provide the meanings and values within which subjects are 'positioned' (Davies & Harré, 1990; Harre & van Langenhove, 1999; Hollway, 1984). Here, the 'problem of agency' is addressed by giving the subject a semi-agentive status inasmuch as discourses are construed as inherently contradictive and in competition with one another, so that subjects are forced to choose. In other words, subjects 'agentively' pick a position among those available. Thus, positions, within this view, are resources that subjects can choose; when practised for a while, these positioning activities become repertoires that can be drawn upon in other contexts.
iat7 | In a somewhat contrasting view, and by elaborating on Butler's (1990, 1995) notion of performing identities in acts of 'self-marking', we argue for a view of positioning that is more concerned with self-reflection, self-criticism and agency (all ultimately orientated toward self-revision). In so doing, we suggest that a line be drawn between the 'being positioned' orientation, which is susceptible to discursive determinism, and a more agentive notion of the subject as 'positioning itself', in which the discursive resources or repertoires are not always and already given but rather are accomplished. Moreover, Bamberg (in press a, b) has argued that 'being positioned' and 'positioning oneself are themselves metaphoric constructs of two very different agent-world relationships: the former with a world-to-agent direction of fit, the latter with an agent- to-world direction of fit. One way to overcome this rift is to argue that both operate concurrently in a kind of dialectic as subjects engage in talk-in-interaction and make sense of self and others in their stories. However, the interaction between these two direction-of-fit metaphors may be a lot more complex than that suggested by the idea of subjects employing relatively ready-made resources or repertoires within talk-in- interaction and becomes even more complex if we see positions themselves as constructed in talk by lexical, grammatical and interactive means (and not just 'expressed' through them). As such, we may be better off analysing the process by which such positions come into existence and with how such positions are instrumental in the construction of a sense of self and identity.
ywwr | In taking this orientation, the 'who-am-I?' (identity) question should no longer start from a notion of a unitary subject as the ground for its investigation. Rather, the agentive subject is the 'point of departure' for its own empirical instantiation (Butler, 1995, p. 446) - as a subject that is constantly seeking to legitimate itself, situated in language practices and interactively accomplished: 'world- and person-making take place simultaneously' (Bamberg, 2000, p. 763). Thus, the pluralization of identities 'disrupts the social ontology of the subject itself ... as the internal impossibility of the subject as a discrete and unitary kind of being' (Butler, 1995, p. 446). This pluralization simultaneously opens up a new empirical territory for where and how subjects come to existence; that is, a conversational and discursive territory where positions are actively and interactively taken (and explored) for the purpose of self and world construction.
0i6j | Our analysis of how speakers actively and agentively position themselves in talk starts from the assumption that the orderliness of talk is situationally and interactively accomplished. However, since this orderliness is the result of what is being achieved,
87cq | and therefore inherently oriented to, we begin our actual discursive analysis by paying close attention to the ways in which the represented world (what the talk is 'about') is drawn up. Here we attempt to spot descriptions and evaluations of characters as well as time and space coordinates in the way that these relate to social categories and their action potential. From there we move into a closer analysis of the way these referential and representational aspects of language construction are used in their sequential arrangement among the participants of the conversation. The assumption is simply that particular descriptions and evaluations were chosen for interactive purposes. These descriptions and evaluations rhetorically function to convey how the conversationalists signal to each other how they want to be understood.
0qs3 | In working from these two levels of positioning (one vis-à-vis the content of what the talk is supposedly about, the other vis-à-vis the coordination of the interaction by the speakers), we are better situated to make assumptions about the ideological orientation within which the speakers are positioning a sense of self (as a sense of who they are). The analysis of the first two positioning levels is intended to progressively lead to a differentiation of how speakers work up constructions of normative discourses. It is at this juncture that we come full circle by showing how subjects position themselves in relation to discourses by which they are positioned. In other words, analysing talk-in-interaction along these lines enables us to circumvent the aporia of two opposing subject theories, one in which the subject is determined by existing discourses, the other in which the subject is the ground from which discourses are constructed.
z8f7 | Ironically, this way of analysing talk-in-interaction for the purpose of gaining an understanding of how interactants establish a sense of self (in talk-in-interaction) resembles closely what in developmental theorizing is termed 'microgenesis' (see Bamberg, 2003, in press a). This approach focalizes the momentary history of human sense-making in the form of emergent processes. It assumes that developmental changes (such as learning or better understanding) emerge as individuals create and accomplish interactive tasks in everyday conversations. In our group discussions, the interactive space between the participants is the arena in which identities are micro- genetically performed and consolidated and where they can be micro-analytically accessed. Here we are borrowing from developmental (Bamberg, 2000; Catan, 1986; Riegel, 1975; Werner, 1948; Werner & Kaplan, 1984; Wertsch & Stone, 1978), conversation-analytic (Sacks, 1995; Sacks, Schegloff, & Jefferson, 1974; Schegloff, 1982), and 'communities of practice' approaches (Eckert, 1989, 2002; Hanks, 1996) to analyse the sequential and relational structure of talk-in-interaction, for the purpose of inquiring not only into the developing sense of self and others, but also into what is shared as a cultural model of sense-making. This does not imply that such 'senses' of self, other and generalized other (culture) do not exist previously to or outside of the discourse situation. However, for analysing talk-in-interaction, we are suggesting bracketing these categories together so that we can be open to the analysis of what the participants make currently relevant in the interactive setting. In entering this orientation from a sociolinguistic/ethnomethodological vantage point, we will deal with talk and identity work that focuses on the active and interactive 'occupation of discursive spaces', making particular use of contextualization and contextualization cues (cf. Bamberg, 2000; Gumperz, 1981 Sacks, Schegloff & Jefferson, 1974, 1992 Sacks, Schegloff & Jefferson, 1974, 1996).
