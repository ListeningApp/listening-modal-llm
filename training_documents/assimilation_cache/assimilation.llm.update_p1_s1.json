Data Assimilation\n5sfj | Data assimilation is a powerful methodology for incorporating data into a mathematical model in a way that is consistent with physical processes. In this chapter we present a Bayesian approach to data assimilation, discuss the Kalman filter algorithm for data assimilation for linear processes and linear data models in the presence of Gaussian noise, and describe a simple version of the ensemble Kalman filter, which relies on stochastic simulation.\nvk4h | Twenty point one. Data Assimilation and Climate\nnsm3 | To predict the state of the climate system at any future time or to recreate its past, we must necessarily rely on mathematical models and numerical simulations. Throughout this book, we have encountered several types of models, some of them conceptual and others closer to the \"real\" world of physics, chemistry, and biology. Most of these models are process models-models that are described by systems of equations that determine the state variables (also called process variables) and their evolution in time. In data assimilation, one links such process models with data models-models of observational data of these same state variables, together with their uncertainties. The idea is that, by making it consistent with the available observations, a process model becomes better at predicting future states of the system. Data assimilation is an essential technique in any scientific discipline that is data-rich and for which well-founded predictive mathematical models exist. The technique originated in engineering and has found widespread application in many other disciplines, most notably in weather prediction, where it has extended the ability to predict weather more or less accurately from hours to days. Not only does the technique generate estimates of the state of the weather system, but it also produces an assessment of the uncertainties in the prediction, often in the form of probability distributions for process variables or parameters.\njdfw | A typical example of a data model is the record of SSTs obtained with a drifting instrument that periodically reports local measurements. The record contains information about the temperature at the location of the instrument (but not anywhere else). The\nuc9r | \nl0ap | Chapter twenty. Data Assimilation\nx815 | record may have gaps for times when the instrument is shut down, and there may be uncertainties regarding the drifter's location and due to limited accuracy of the thermometer. Any data model contains an element of randomness.\nepbj | Data assimilation can be applied to estimate process variables at a certain time using all available observational data, including those made at a later time (reanalysis or smoothing mode), or to estimate the present state using past and present observations (analysis or filtering mode), or to estimate process variables that are inaccessible to observations, such as future states or states between measurements (forecasting or predicting mode). In any of these modes, problems can be approached with a variety of techniques, including optimization methods, which attempt to find the best fit of a parameterized process model to a given set of data; maximum likelihood methods, which work in a similar spirit but have more detailed statistical models for the uncertainties in the process; and Bayesian methods.\nnmn2 | Twenty point two. Example\ng3tm | The following example illustrates the application of data assimilation methodology to reanalysis, filtering, and forecasting.\ntfra | Consider a process with four real-valued state variables, {X; : i equals one, ..., four}. The state variables are related by the process model\n5lm9 | X sub i plus one equals a X sub i plus {;, i equals one, two, three, (Equation twenty point one)\nwp2c | where a is a known positive constant and the random process error terms 5, are either identically zero or have a standard normal distribution, ยง; ~ N(0, one). The convention is to use upper-case letters X, Y, Z, etc., for random quantities and the corresponding lower-case letters x, y, z, etc., for their realizations. Random error terms are indicated by Greek letters.\nus5v | The data model consists of two observations, {Y; : i equals two, three}, and is related to the process model through the identities\nrs2m | Y sub i equals X sub one plus {; i equals two, three, (Equation twenty point two)\nuz9y | where the random observational error terms {; are independent and identically distributed with a standard normal distribution. The entire model is shown schematically in Figure twenty point one. The problem of estimating X sub one from the observations Y sub two and Y sub three is a reanalysis problem, estimating X sub two from Y sub two or X sub three from Y sub two and Y sub three is a filtering problem, and estimating X sub four from Y sub two and Y sub three is a forecasting problem.\n8ov0 | X sub one minus X sub two minus X sub three minus X sub four plus Y sub two Y sub three\nmj9m | Twenty point two point one. Variational Approach\n94h3 | We first demonstrate a variational approach. If the process error terms ยง; are all zero, we minimize the cost function J,\n9jx1 | J(x sub two, x sub three; )23/3) equals (x sub two minus two) squared plus (x sub three minus y sub three) squared.\nc3lz | (Equation twenty point three)\n8bwk | \nez9s | Twenty point two. Example\nmqot | Because of the process model relation x sub { three } equals alpha x sub { two }, J reduces to a function J sub { zero } of x sub { two } alone,\noc99 | J ( x sub { two } , alpha x sub { two } ; y sub { two } , y sub { three } ) equals J sub { zero } ( x sub { two } ; y sub { two } , y sub { three } ) equals ( x sub { two } minus y sub { two } ) squared plus ( alpha x sub { two } minus y sub { three } ) squared.
