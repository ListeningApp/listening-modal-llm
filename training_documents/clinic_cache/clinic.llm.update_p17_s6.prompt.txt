You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

tfra | This systematic review has many strengths including analyses of very large amount of clinical data from several settings and countries reflecting global periodontal practices, which increases its external validity and power. Limitations are evident, such as potential selection bias due to exclusion of studies, cases with no available data and restriction to studies published from 2017. Most included studies were retrospective cohort studies. Information and residual confound- ing bias cannot be excluded because of the unavailability of some of the required data. Multi-level and meta-regression analyses were not per- formed, as not all required data were available. Therefore, the low tooth loss rate may not be generalizable for all periodontitis patients. Including different stages of periodontitis and APT protocols may affect the dis- criminative power of the study. Study selection was limited to those pub- lished after 2017, as they better reflect current practice globally, particularly since official endpoints were proposed by the WWC 2017. IPD analyses are resource-intensive and we felt a 5-year restriction, which still included 12,884 subjects, would be pragmatic.
5lm9 | Further research is required to assess the different endpoints and their accuracy when predicting tooth loss, oral-health-related quality of life and the systemic impact of periodontitis, which collectively form the true endpoints of periodontitis.
wp2c | Overall, the data collected from 12,884 periodontitis subjects and presented here demonstrate the following:
us5v | . An overwhelming majority of subjects and teeth do not success- fully achieve 'stability' or meet the recommended 'endpoints of therapy' of current guidelines following APT. This suggests that either periodontal treatment still has a long way to go before being considered efficacious or the currently proposed endpoints are not realistic. We, with a certain degree of optimism based on the rela- tively low tooth loss during SPC, would like to believe in the latter.
rs2m | . Certain surrogate endpoints may be more relevant at the tooth level than <LATEX>\mathrm { a t }</LATEX> the subject level. Endpoints should be specific to the tooth type if more personalised treatment approaches are required.
uz9y | . The present findings apply to patients compliant with SPC. Yet, non-compliant patients represent a major proportion of treated patients. The generalisability of the results may depend on the extent, stage and grade of periodontitis.
8ov0 | Periodontally involved teeth can be well maintained when compli- ant with SPC. Rethinking endpoint selection may resolve any
mj9m | controversy surrounding periodontal treatment efficacy, particularly in relation to 5-year tooth survival rates, and prevent unnecessary overtreatment. Furthermore, as healthcare moves towards persona- lised medicine and the paradigm surrounding pathogenesis of peri- odontitis has shifted to consider the individual's host immune- inflammatory response, it may be justified to consider individualized endpoints acknowledging the patients' demographic, systemic and lifestyle factors.
