You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

95el | It is no accident that Sufis find that they can connect most constructively with people who are well integrated into the world, as well as having higher aims, and that those who adopt a sensible attitude towards society and life as generally known can usually absorb Sufi teachings very well indeed.
a0a5 | You started your question with the matter of the visibility of study institutions. But the world itself, as well as special attitudes, properly understood, constitute the Sufi school. Remember the words of Maghribi, who said to a monkish individual: 'What you are seeking in your retreat/I see clearly in every road and alley- way'.
gocl | It is no use adding external things, say observances - to the life of someone who is carrying on too many unproductive observances. It is hopeless to add ideas to minds already too full of ideas. Study institutions may become visible when the head is more emptied of imaginings.
ob1z | SAADI AND THE MAN WITH A FULL HEAD
m4cb | Saadi has a tale about a man, whose head was full of imagined knowledge and arrogance as a result, who went to visit Koshyar, from a great distance. Koshyar taught him nothing, saying: 'You may think yourself wise, but nothing can be put into a full pot.'
m61y | If you are full of pretence, Saadi continues, you are in fact empty. Become empty of fruidess ideas, he teaches, so that you may come and fill with higher perceptions, and understand real meaning.
u2ob | There is a widespread notion in non-traditional societies such as the current Western one, that their scientific base causes the people to think, for some reason, in a way different from that of 'ancient* or 'Eastern' peoples. Anthropologists, interestingly enough, have pointed out that human thinking habits are everywhere very similar, and that the models and assumptions used by, say, the Africans of old and the Europeans and Americans are not at all different. The fact that this expert information has not filtered down to general knowledge is in itself an indication of the conten- tion of, for example, R. Horton, who commented on the un- examined assumptions of Western and African people thus:
2gnm | 'The (Western) layman's ground for accepting the models pro- pounded by the scientist is often no different from the young African villager's ground for accepting the models propounded by one of his elders. In both cases the propounders are deferred to as the accredited agents of tradition. As for the rules which
emgw | 29
xaqt | guide scientists themselves in the acceptance or rejection of models, these seldom become part of the intellectual equipment of mem- bers of the wider population. For all the apparent up-to-dateness of the content of his world-view, the modern Western layman is rarely more 'open' or scientific in his outlook than is the tradi- tional African villager.'*
5rcb | Knowledge of yourself may involve, if we are learning at the present time, a knowledge of the way of thinking of your society, and to realise that you are probably its product, and that this knowledge can be attained in fact by such anthropological and psychological observations made by the Sufis in the course of their teaching how to assume new and more promising extra per- spectives.
524j | This involves knowing more through knowing oneself; knowing oneself through knowing how one thinks about others; and 'seeing yourself with other eyes than your own' - all ways of applying the lessons which so far in the West are mainly only being pointed out, and are not linked with attempts to further one's perceptions of what lies beyond familiar consciousness.
xd3m | The statement 'He who knows himself, knows his Lord' means, among other things, that self-deception prevents knowledge. The question asks about how to attain knowledge of oneself. The first self about which to attain knowledge, is the secondary, essentially false, self which stands in the way, however useful it may be for many daily transactions. It must be set aside, made something which can be used or not used: not something which uses you.
8qb6 | The way in which this is done is by self-observation: registering how and when this self is operating, and how it deceives. A man once remarked, in the hearing of the Sufi ancient Junaid of Baghdad that at that time it had become difficult to find brothers.
wkbn | HOW TO FIND YOUR BROTHERS
ftfg | Junaid instantly identified the onesidedness of this attitude. 'If you seek a brother to share your burden, brothers are in truth hard to find. But if you are in search of someone whose own burden you will yourself share, there is no scarcity of such brothers,' he said. *R Horton: African traditional thought and Western science, in: Africa,
7xi5 | 37, 1967, International African Institute.
w8r5 | ANSARI ON LOOKING AT YOURSELF
ybik | You want to be able to evaluate institutions of the Sufis. You want to gain knowledge of yourself. You can do the former when you have done the latter. Sheikh Abdullah Ansari, of Herat, in common with all classical Sufi teachers, insists that you must see yourself other than with your own eye, that is to say, apart from your present way of looking at things, or your fixation with this secondary self will only increase in strength and blot out objective understanding.
gii5 | ANALOGY OF THE GARDENER
q5eu | Until you can see yourself clearly and constantly for what you are really like, you have to rely upon the assessment of a teacher: the 'gardener" of Rumi's comparison:
a7ao | 'A gardener going into an orchard looks at the trees. He knows that this one is a date, that one a fig, the other a pomegranate, a pear or an apple. To do this, he does not have to see the fruit, only the trees.'*
29a3 | DIFFICULTIES
sb1e | Q: What are the difficulties in the way of transmitting know- ledge today in the West?
w2yn | A: Very little different in essence, though different in appear- ance, from the difficulties at all times. To understand this you have to obtain some perspective.
ap6l | If, in the Middle Ages in Western Europe, you had preached, sayj hygiene, what would have happened to you? You would have been seen as heretical, for a start - because only infidels washed. You would have been castigated by reputable people for assuming that you were bener than they were, because you washed and they didn't. If you taught about microbes, would you have got away with it? If you used their mass-media, you would have been accused of immodesty and worse; if you tried to set up your own, you would be accused of sinister intentions or worse ...
iest | And-equally important - who would listen to you? The freaks, the occultists, the failures who were out to find a short-cut to success ... Not the people who were to become the authorities on hygiene ... Much preliminary groundwork would have to be done, explaining assumptions, proving that bias was not reality, living down unwarranted mud-slinging.
cox8 | RISE ABOVE YOUR OWN BARRIER
ppqi | The great Sufi poet Hafiz says, and how rightly, that the diffi- culties are within people, for they imagine things which are really irrelevant to be important in this search: 'You yourself are your own barrier - rise from within it.'
oxou | THE PRIEST AND THE PUBLIC
495n | People mistake information for knowledge, and one indication for another. This is mainly because they generally do not know what they want, and often think that they want something when they do not. This difficulty besets all kinds of activities in the West.
awri | I have recently been talking to the priest in charge of a church in a new town development. He had carried out a careful poll of what his new parishioners wanted, what kinds of sermons, how they are to be delivered, what subjects they were interested in. This all took him several months. In the end he had a picture of what was required and he provided the themes, treatment and atmosphere which the people had asked for.
bl28 | The people came to his church services for the first few weeks, and then came in smaller and smaller numbers. The only reason which they gave when questioned about their lack of interest is: 'It isn't what we thought it would be like.'
d5bz | This shows (as you will find in innumerable Sufi stories) that neither the teacher nor the learner knows, without a real situation, how the teaching is to be carried on, if it is not done merely by indoctrination or emotional arousal, in specific instances.
ap5o | The fact that teachers in many disciplines think that they know how to teach, and classes think that they know how to learn, obscures the fact that people in general accept this folkloric belief without testing. The only exception to both parties carrying on for centuries with diminishing returns is in areas, such as
7zvf | commerce, where nobody can afford to imagine things: tests have to be made.
mov9 | THE DEMAND FOR LAUGHTER
ks7m | There is an instructive example in British television where many people complained about the production habit of putting a laughter sound-track onto shows, following every joke, or having a studio audience. Viewing audiences did not like it The Head of Light Entertainment at London Weekend Television in 1970 bowed to the bitter criticism and flood of letters by removing the laughing audience. The actors now complained that they could not act properly without laughter to help their timing. 'So', con- tinued Mr. Barry Took, 'I brought the audiences back, and everything was fine again. Almost exacdy the same people who had written in to complain wrote again to say how much they preferred the shows with audiences.'
w1w1 | HOW TO SELL BOOKS TO SCHOLARS
h8gv | When circularising scholars with lists of new books, we found a similar result. Postal advertisements couched in impeccable scholastic language brought hardly any sales. But circulars which were written like advertisements for soap-powder had large num- bers of these respectable gentlemen sending in their orders by return: even though the books were on serious subjects. When I mentioned this result in a newspaper interview, several academics wrote to me agreeing that they preferred an 'exciting' advertise- ment and that 'scholarly treatments' bored them ...
kwkp | THE DEAD WHO WALK ...
yj0m | Whether in the East or in the West, one of the difficulties in the way of transmitting Sufi knowledge has not changed in many centuries. As the Sufi ancient Abu'l Hasan Khirqani stated, 'Many people who are in reality dead are walking in the streets; many who are in their graves are in reality alive', he tells us, in Attar's lives of the masters.
ewfp | The difficulties of transmitting knowledge about which you ask
oczy | mean that only a small number of people can immediately learn what is being taught. The others have to go through exposure to experience and teaching until their inward perceptions are able to connect with the transmission.
2ttg | Many people believe that their interest in a subject is prepara- tion enough. Further, they cannot credit that others may have the perceptive capacity while they themselves must wait.
his3 | JUNAID AND THE JEALOUS STUDENTS
m50z | Junaid illustrated this on the overt level one day when some of his twenty students were jealous of his attachment to one of their number. The parable-in-action which he devised is worth thinking about.
me84 | He called all the disciples and ordered them to bring twenty fowls. Each pupil was instructed to take one bird to a place where he could not be seen, and to kill it.
o56m | When they all returned, the birds were dead: all except the one taken by the controversial student.
slz6 | Junaid asked him, in the presence of the others, why he had not killed his bird.
90k5 | 'Because you told me to go to a place where I could not be seen, and there is no such place: God sees ah", answered the man.
9m8s | The difficulty of transmission of knowledge is bound up with the orientation of the student. Wanting knowledge is not enough. As we see in the case of Junaid's students, only one in twenty acted in accordance with his own beliefs.
893y | TEACHERSHIP ACCORDING TO MUINUDDIN CHISHTI
favz | The institution of teachership is there for this reason, that the learner must learn how to learn. Understanding this one realises why it is not an extreme statement to say, as did Muinuddin Chishti:
7szx | 'It should be taken to heart that whatever the Spiritual Guide persuades his disciples to do and to practise, it is for the benefit of the spiritual disciple himself.'
hx9e | Secrets and the Sufis
ywn2 | Q: Why do Sufis hint at secrets, and speak of remarkable places and strange books, and so on, ifnot to titillate?
a63r | THE CULTIVATED VOLUNTEERS
dqvj | A: When they do so, it may only be to identify the super- ficialists who scramble for these things. This resembles the old Army technique when the sergeant says to recruits: 'Hands up those who are too cultivated for manual work'-and then, when some hands go up, says, 'These are the men who need the most training in manual labour!', and assigns them the roughest tasks.
r17u | Another reason may be that what to you is titillating, is to me my everyday life. Words like 'remarkable', 'strange' and so on, have no absolute meaning, and are utterly subjective. What is the meaning of 'secret, strange, remarkable'?
3c47 | It is not unknown for Sufis to deal in things which cause people to react in this manner, in order to allow the audience to experience and to observe their own changes of mood and sensa- tion, to realise that too many people have too many buttons to be pressed in them, as it were.
g345 | There is no single answer to the question. Yet it is one of the most widely misunderstood: because careless students have as- sumed that Sufi teachings aimed at single individuals or groups, or intended for short-term uses, are perennial injunctions, applic- able under all circumstances. Much Sufi literature is no longer applicable, since the mentality of the audience has changed over the years.
svhz | Rumi speaks of the matter of so-called secrets, when he says: 'If you do not see the secrets of truth, laugh at us ... '
oaen | BREAD FOR THE HUNGRY
5u67 | Secrets and strange places and remarkable books, too, are often the current coin of the language in which uninstructed people
dvms | 35
qrd3 | think about certain matters. In order to connect with these people you may have to use their language at the outset. This does not make it your language. You remember the saying: 'To a hungry man, "two and two" means "four loaves of bread'"? If you are speaking to a hungry man, your first words might well be about bread.
rxrg | If you want a shorter answer to the inference that Sufis simply want to titillate, here is an old proverb:
tf43 | 'If you believe it, and think that you are sure of it, know that you are in fact in need of improvement. Being sure and believing are stages to be superseded on the Path to Certainty.'
fcco | Words like 'secret', too, are technical terms among the Sufis. A better rendition of 'secret' is often 'innermost consciousness'.
8uji | When to have Meetings
df3e | Q: People hear about something and immediately crave it, as you have pointed out. Why does just any meeting with a teacher or a source of knowledge not produce results for the student?
53eu | THE SPRING OF SWEET WATER
a5u1 | A: There is a Persian saying, from the classical Gulistan of Saadi, to this effect:
ry7u | Wherever a spring of sweet water may be -
5mda | Men, birds and ants will circle around it.
i4li | Wherever there is a source of attraction, people will surround it, in accordance with their nature. I say, 'in accordance with their nature' because human beings resemble animals in being attracted to the aspect of things which immediately attracts them. As with animals, sometimes these things are suitable for them, sometimes not.
