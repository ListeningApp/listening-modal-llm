In practical applications, the problem of computing or estimating the covariance matrices becomes important. For those I for which no observations are available, the filtering distribution and the forecasting distribution agree.\nnaev | The basic reanalysis Algorithm twenty point two can also be rewritten in terms of matrix operations for this situation.\n7h0h | Twenty point six - Numerical Example\na64c | The following numerical example illustrates the results of Kalman filtering and reanalysis. The example uses the one-dimensional process model X subscript I equals alpha X subscript i minus one plus Xi subscript I for I equals one to thirty where alpha equals zero point eight and\ngi7n | xi subscript I is distributed normally with mean zero and variance q squared where q equals zero point four. The value X subscript zero is drawn from a standard normal distribution. A typical sequence is plotted in black in Figure twenty point two. The data model is y subscript I equals b subscript I x subscript I plus zeta subscript I where\n3pn1 | zeta subscript I is distributed normally with mean zero and variance r squared where r equals zero point one. h subscript I equals zero point one for I from eleven to twenty, and equals one for I from one to ten and from twenty-one to thirty. The data model is set up so that for I from eleven to twenty, there is a period of \"low observability.\" Figure twenty point two shows a single realization of the true process, the filtering estimates, and the reanalysis estimates. It is clear that these estimates are not the same. As expected, all estimates are much closer to the true values where\nwjuz | b subscript I equals one. Figure twenty point three shows computed standard deviations, bold lines, for the forecasting estimates x subscript i for i minus one in black, filtering estimates x subscript i for i in blue, and reanalysis estimates x subscript i for N in red, together with their negative values. Forecasting standard deviations are always larger than\n3yxv | Chapter twenty. Data Assimilation\nd8zj | Errors\nywxn | Twenty point seven. Extensions\nuxhs | filtering standard deviations which, in turn, are larger than reanalysis standard deviations. During the interval of low observability (I equals eleven to twenty), all these standard deviations are larger. Also plotted in the same figure, thin lines, are the forecasting errors x subscript I minus x sub i for i minus one in black, filtering errors x subscript I minus x sub i for i in blue, and reanalysis errors x subscript I minus x sub i for N in red for a single realization.\ned6e | Twenty point seven. Extensions\n6qqm | The Kalman filter and reanalysis algorithms have theoretical and practical limitations if the error distributions are not Gaussian or if the process model is nonlinear. In the latter case, even Gaussian errors typically become immediately non-Gaussian, and biases, systematic errors, appear. Another practical difficulty arises because in weather forecasting or climate science temporal and spatial features may lead to state variables with millions of components, with error covariance matrices with ten to the power of twelve or more entries.\nonum | Twenty point seven point one - Extended Kalman Filter\n3iir | Nonlinear process and data models are often handled by linearization. The resulting algorithm is known as the extended Kalman filter. In essence, it uses the nonlinear process model without noise terms to compute the forecasting estimate and uses linearization about the most recent filtering estimate to compute the forecasting covariance and the gain matrix. The filtering estimate and its covariance are then computed from these quantities more or less in the same way as in Algorithm twenty point three. This approach works well in engineering applications with a modest number of process variables but quickly becomes infeasible in high-dimensional situations. Variational methods for data assimilation that were mentioned earlier can avoid these difficulties but do not readily produce an assessment of errors.\n7a0a | Twenty point seven point two - Ensemble Kalman Filter\no1qp | The ensemble Kalman filter, introduced in the nineteen nineties, uses stochastic simulation techniques known as Monte Carlo methods. The archetypical use for a Monte Carlo approach is the computation of an expected value of a random variable X with density fx of x. Formally, the definition is the integral of F of x times fx of x with respect to x, where the integral is over the space in which X takes its values. Numerical computation of the integral is essentially impossible if the dimension of X exceeds ten or so. In a Monte Carlo approach, one draws m independent random samples x of one to m from the distribution of X and approximates the expected value,\njrik | F of x of i.\nxv78 | By the law of large numbers, the right-hand side converges almost surely to the correct expected value as m approaches zero, and the speed of convergence can be determined, it is always slow.\nsdks | For a simple version of EnKf, we assume a nonlinear process model,\ny8fb | the equation twenty point twenty-three.\n521q | Where the M are functions from the range of the X of i to itself. All other assumptions are left unchanged-the model errors are Gaussian, there is a linear data model,\nyogo | Chapter twenty. Data Assimilation\n2285 | and the background state is Gaussian, X of zero is distributed normally with mean u and variance sigma squared. Suppose we are given an estimate of the filtering mean at i minus one, an estimate of the filtering covariance matrix at this time step, and an estimate of the distribution of X of i minus one given y of one to i minus one. For the simulation, draw m independent samples x of i minus one given i minus one, j equals one to m, from this distribution, propagate them forward with the process, and add simulated model errors n distributed normally with mean zero and covariance Q that have the same distribution as the model errors at this time step. The result is an ensemble of simulated forecasts,\nys0g | X of i given i minus one equals M of X of I given i minus one plus n, j equals one to m.\n7zvp | The forecasting estimate is now computed as the sample mean of this ensemble,\nww6u | and the sample covariance matrix provides an estimate of the forecasting covariance matrix. Next, compute the gain matrix, just as in equation twenty point twenty, but with the estimated covariance,\n4uhb | R equals the product of S and the transpose of H times the inverse of the sum of the product of H, S, and the transpose of H and R.\n```",
