You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

p1l0 | The issue at stake
1i8b | Relatively speaking, postwar Korea was terra incognita for American Far Eastern policy. Japan had been well-known since the time of Commander Perry's visit there in the mid-nineteenth century. Its conversion under MacArthur into a peaceful democratic state attracted much attention. Americans thought of rural life in China in terms of Pearl Buck's books, primarily the Good Earth, which also became a major film; these images of course involved wild distortions but many Americans were unaware of the misrepresentations. Extensive American resources, including more than two billion dollars in aid, were invested in Chiang Kai- shek's struggle to win the civil war in China. The Philippines had been an American colony since 1898, and the independent government that was established there after the Japanese occupation received US aid in its war against the Hukbalahap ("Huks") Rebellion.
5sfj | In contrast, the Korean Peninsula that was occupied by Japan in 1905 had received very little attention in US policy. The summit meetings of Cairo, Yalta, and Potsdam included only vague references to the future of Korea. Its occupation was left to the Soviets, who committed themselves to enter the war against Japan three months after the end of the war in Europe, primarily because Korea was considered to be a secondary target that did not justify the shedding of American blood. According to some reports, secretary of state Edward Stettinius had asked where Korea was during a meeting in 1945. And following Japan's surrender, the separation of the Korean Peninsula along the 38th parallel into two temporary occupation zones had been improvised within hours by two relatively junior officers on a National Geographic map.51
vk4h | The remote role of Korea in American strategy during the war had undergone no change in the postwar years, when a tight order of priorities had to be built because of scarce military resources and new global commitments. Popular pressures to bring American soldiers home and the need to get the American economy back to peacetime production led to a fast demobilization process in 1945-46 and deep budgetary cuts. The 12-million-soldier army of 1945 had shrunk to 1,566,000 soldiers by June 1947, and defense expenditures dropped from 37.5 percent of the GDP in 1945 to 3.8 percent 4 in 1947. On the eve of the Korean War, the US Army forces in the Far East Command were made up of four tactical divisions and one regimental combat team, altogether amounting to fewer than 110,000 soldiers.53
nsm3 | The combination of strained resources, global commitments, and a strategic thinking that assigned no prime role to South Korea predetermined its fate. In May 1947, secretary of war Robert Patterson urged the evacuation of American forces from Korea for reasons of both the tight military budget and the relatively strategic insignificance of the peninsula. In September 1947, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)favored such an evacuation because "the United States had little strategic interest" in Korea and because in case of a general war, "our present forces in Korea would be a military liability." In June 1949, when the withdrawal of the American forces from Korea was to be completed, the Army chief of staff, Gen. Omar Bradley, raised doubts about the policy, but the consensus in the JCS reaffirmed it:
jdfw | From the strategic viewpoint the position of the Joint Chiefs of Staff regarding Korea, summarized briefly, is that Korea is of little strategic value to the United States and that any commitment to United States use of military force in Korea would be ill-advised and impracticable in view of the potentialities of the over-all world situation and of our heavy international obligations as compared with our current military strength.55
uc9r | Besides Bradley, there were others in the administration who tended to regard the Korean Peninsula as a strategically important asset. The CIA assessed that a Communist takeover of South Korea "would seriously diminish US prestige and adversely affect US security interest in the Far East." In addition to this political, economic and psychological damage, having Soviet bases in South Korea would allow the Soviets to launch "air, airborne, or amphibious attacks on Japan, Formosa and the Ryukyus, or submarine forays against shipping in Japanese waters."5 MacArthur himself was not too resolved on this issue. On the one hand, he said in private talks that he did not want to get involved in the "messy" Korean situation and estimated that in case of a serious challenge, the ROK would have to be abandoned. On the other, he told President Rhee during a visit to Seoul in August 1948 that "I would defend Korea as I would my own country, just 4 as I would California." But this commitment was no more than a gesture. Most soldiers in the Far East believed that "[t]here are only three things the troops in Japan are afraid of: Gonorrhea, diarrhea and Korea."58
l0ap | The political leadership accepted the position of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In April 1948, President Truman stated that military action in Korea would not be considered a "casus belli" for the United States." And secretary of state Dean G. Acheson's famous speech at the National Press Club on January 12, 1950, in which he defined the American "defensive perimeter" in the Pacific as a line running through Japan, the Ryukyus, and the Philippines, left South Korea and Formosa out of a US military guarantee. This may have influenced Stalin to approve the North Korean planned invasion. The administration's temporary failure to pass a $60 million Korean aid bill in Congress in January 1950, and public declarations such as the one given by Senator Tom Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who expressed in May concern about a Soviet occupation of Korea and Formosa, increased the impression that the administration was ready to accept the loss of these allies.61
x815 | In the last months before the invasion, some efforts were made to limit this impression. Prominent among them was a special visit of roving ambassador (and later secretary of state) John Foster Dulles to Korea two weeks before fighting commenced. But altogether, its low ranking in the US strategic calculus between 1945 and 1950 meant that the Korean Peninsula received inadequate attention when it came to intelligence collection and estimation. The result was a poor level of intelligence collection, low quality of intelligence estimation concerning the looming threat and its nature, and lack of attention at the top decision-making level to the possibility that the next threat to United States' global interests would come in the Far East rather than Europe. At least part of this difference in the assessments of relative importance of Europe and Asia may have resulted from elements of racism within American leadership.62
epbj | As had been the case with Pearl Harbor, the source of the failure to provide high-quality warning against the KPA's offensive and its impact was insufficient intelligence information. But in December 1941, this intelligence gap had involved a specific issue: the fact that Pearl Harbor was the target of the Japanese attack. In June 1950, the gap was far wider: insufficient information about the KPA preparations for war and, even more important, no information at all about Kim's invasion intentions and Stalin's and Mao's reluctant acceptance of the move. In this sense, the mistaken American estimation of the North Korean threat was rooted in a wider misconception of the real nature of the Communist threat.
nmn2 | This misconception received a clear expression about two months before the war, in the first draft of NCS- 68. In essence, it regarded US nuclear capability as sufficient to deter the USSR until 1954, when the Soviet
