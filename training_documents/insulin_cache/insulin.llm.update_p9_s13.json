Insulin resistance has an impact on reward sensitivity\n0i6j | The effect of insulin on motivation and reward sensitivity goes beyond food intake. Insulin deficiency due to fasting increased reward sensitivity in an intracranial self-stimulation task. This effect was reversed by insulin and leptin administration. Equally, insulin deficiency due to STZ-application increased reward sensitivity, but only in the first three weeks. Afterward, this effect was abolished or even turned to the opposite showing reduced reward sensitivity. In this case, insulin application improved reward sensitivity. Equally HFD for fifteen to seventeen weeks reduced the attraction of male rodents to female urine, that is normally perceived as rewarding indicating that insulin resistance over a longer period of time leads to anhedonia - the loss of experiencing pleasure from usually rewarding activities.\n87cq | Three point four point four. Insulin resistance leads to a depressive, anxious phenotype\n0qs3 | Moreover, insulin resistance has been associated with behavioural despair and anxious behaviour. In life-threatening situations, insulin-resistant mice showed increased immobility in the tail-suspension test and the forced swim test and avoided exploratory behaviour in the open field task and during exposition to novel food stimuli indicating anxiety.\nz8f7 | Three point four point five. Insulin resistance impairs preference formation\n7w7j | There is accumulating evidence that insulin plays an important role in learning and preference formation. During flavour-nutrient conditioning, a previously neutral flavour is associated with a positive postingestive consequence to form a preference for the flavour. While insulin-sensitive rodents fed ad libitum or after food restriction are able to establish flavour preferences, this effect is abolished in insulin resistance following HFD. Particularly, after HFD, there was less IR activation in the NAc after intragastric glucose infusion. Similarly, flavour-nutrient conditioning was inhibited after deactivating insulin bilaterally in the NAc via local administration of insulin antibodies. To differentiate whether this observation was driven by a change in motivation or indeed by a change in the learned reward value, Carr analysed the microstructure of licking for glucose: Insulin antibodies did not affect the number of lick bursts emitted, but decreased the size of lick bursts. This effect was shown to depend on previous flavoured glucose consumption under insulin antibody treatment rather than on insulin antibody treatment per se, indicating that impaired insulin signalling in the NAc shell impairs learning by diminishing the estimated reward value rather than motivation per se.\n51vd | Three point four point six. The effect of insulin resistance on motor activity\nbaj1 | Several models using insulin resistance after HFD or IR knockout in DA neurons or astrocytes did not show any changes in voluntary motor activity. In STZ-diabetic mice, however, the results are very inconsistent, providing evidence for reduced, increased, and unaffected spontaneous locomotor behaviour, which might be related to the large variability in STZ-protocols in terms of timing, dosage and strains. These findings suggest that the shortage of insulin availability and the resistance of insulin receptors have differential effects on motor activity.\nn1wo | Collectively, impaired insulin signalling increases food approach, attenuates value formation and preference learning and promotes anhedonia and anxious behaviour. However, it is important to consider,\n5bq3 | that many aspects of reward-seeking behaviour that are distorted by impaired insulin signalling cannot be solely attributed to DA signalling in the VTA or NAc but are also related to their interaction with further brain systems.\nezla | Three point five. Effect of insulin resistance on reward behaviour in humans\nrsbu | There is no direct measure of central insulin resistance in humans. Using fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, Antony discovered that glucose metabolism in regions subserving appetite and reward, including the mesostriatal system, is impaired in response to peripheral insulin administration in diabetes patients compared to healthy controls. This indicates that peripherally measured insulin resistance can be used as a surrogate for central insulin resistance. Since PET using radioactive ligands is limited in its accessibility, fMRI has emerged as a valuable tool for studying changes in brain signalling associated with insulin resistance. In fact, using resting state fMRI data, we demonstrated that the modulation of midbrain connectivity by intranasal insulin is compromised in participants with decreased peripheral insulin sensitivity.\nmagd | Three point five point one. Insulin resistance changes food preference\ntb74 | Tiedemann showed that nondiabetic participants with incipient insulin resistance have a lower preference for food items than healthy controls along with diminished activation of the NAc. At the same time, others reported that food-specific responses within the basal ganglia including the NAc are significantly greater in participants with insulin resistance or type two diabetes than in healthy controls. Stronger activation in the NAc was related to higher appetite ratings. Besides the immediate response to food cues, the anticipatory response has also been shown to increase proportionally with BMI and insulin resistance. However, these studies have to be interpreted with care, because they included small sample sizes and differ in the fasting conditions and study populations. Studies assessing the modulation of the brain response to food pictures by insulin have been more consistent: both intranasal insulin, as well as a glucose challenge, fail to decrease the brain signal to food pictures in insulin-resistant participants indicating that the ability of insulin to curb food intake by reducing the salience of highly palatable food cues may be impaired. In line with this, during fasted conditions, intranasal insulin failed to decrease wanting for food in insulin-resistant participants. However, a recent study demonstrated that in postprandial conditions, a high dose of one hundred sixty IU intranasal insulin reduced snacking in overweight women with insulin resistance suggesting that sufficiently high doses of intranasal insulin may enhance satiety signalling and compensate for reduced central insulin sensitivity.\n```",
