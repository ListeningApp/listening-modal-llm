They often promote their own dependency on their partners (or they might promote their partners' dependency on them) in a way that discourages doing things separately from each other. Engaging in compulsive caretaking can also become a way to prevent the discomfort of feeling lonely and enhance the perceived security of not being abandoned. Even though people with this style tend to sacrifice themselves for the relationship, the ways in which they are preoccupied and compulsively give care are not necessarily attuned. In such cases, the caregiving is more of a strategy to keep a person close than an actual response to what their partner genuinely needs. If someone with this attachment style perceives even the slightest possibility that their partner is disconnected or disinterested, they can become demanding, possessive or needy for approval, reassurance, connection, contact, and greater emotional or sexual intensity.\n47j0 | From their partner's perspective, the needs of the person with the preoccupied attachment style may seem insatiable. The partner may feel they can never do\n1c60 | enough, which can in turn create the very pulling away or even breaking up that the person with the preoccupied style is so desperate to avoid. Compared to people with a more secure attachment style, people with the preoccupied style report increased jealousy and relationship conflict, as well as feelings of ambivalence about their sex life, since they are less likely to use consistent contraception and more likely to engage in sex they don't fully want.\n0gex | Similar to people with a dismissive attachment adaptation, people with the preoccupied adaptation also have difficulty identifying and describing their own emotions. Initially, this may seem counterintuitive since the preoccupied person is much more emotionally focused, self-disclosing and heightened in both their emotional experience and expression in comparison to someone with a dismissive style, who typically has less access to their feelings. But it makes sense if you look a little closer. Someone with a preoccupied style has more awareness of both their feelings and their partner's feelings, but they still struggle with differentiating and communicating their feelings and with managing their emotional responses in healthy ways. Also, although they're aware of their partner's feelings, they're not necessarily reading those feelings accurately. People with this attachment style might be very precise in detecting even the slightest change in their partner's mood or state, but they're more likely to assume that the shifts are personal to them and that they are negative, when neither may be true.\n8r7m | Part Three covers ways to heal the different attachment styles, and provides a more in-depth look at self-soothing. It also explains a model called HEARTS, which describes secure functioning in ways that can be applied to healing your own attachment challenges. For now, I'll just say that someone with a preoccupied style must first come back to themselves. I will often guide clients to tune into where their sense of self is. Is it within their own body or out there in someone else's body? If it is with someone else, we can then focus on calling themselves back to establish a sense of inner authority and self-trust.\nqj19 | Statements that someone with a preoccupied attachment style might make:\nl5ia | . I am comfortable with connection and usually crave it more than my partners\necp0 | do.\ncujm | . I am very attuned to others and can detect subtle shifts in their emotional or mental states.\n25y0 | . I often worry about being abandoned, rejected or not valued enough.\n8u4f | . I tend to overfocus on my partners and underfocus on myself.\n5bai | . When I am going through something, I tend to reach out and turn towards others to make sense of what I'm experiencing or to make myself feel better.\n2z5m | . I need a lot of reassurance that I am loved or desired by a partner; however, when my partners give me reassurance or show their desire for me, it either doesn't register for me or I have trouble receiving and believing it.\n63p4 | . I tend to commit to relationships and get attached very quickly.\nlvik | . I get frustrated or hurt if a partner is not available when I need them.\n16a3 | . I get resentful or take it personally when a partner spends time away from me.\n49ye | . I do well with the transition from being alone to being together with partners, but I struggle when going from being together to being alone again.\n850s | I tend to hold on to resentments and have trouble letting go of old wounds.\nyusd | The Disorganized/Fearful-Avoidant Attachment Style\nnoq3 | Disorganized Attachment in Childhood\nkdhu | The final insecure style was not initially classified in Mary Ainsworth's original studies, but was named later by Main and Solomon. Ainsworth observed that a percentage of the children in her Strange Situation Procedure did not neatly fit into one of the three categories of secure, anxious and avoidant. Some children displayed confusing, even chaotic, behaviors such as running towards their parent then immediately away from them, freezing up, hitting their parent for no apparent reason, rolling or throwing themselves on the floor, and more. Main and Solomon later reassessed these findings, and furthered our understanding of the attachment styles by adding the fourth classification of disorganized.\no8es | Children with a disorganized attachment style have an attachment system that seems to be hyperactivated and deactivated at the same time. They don't display a\n2k63 | consistent organized attachment strategy in the same way that children with a secure, anxious or avoidant style do. Instead, they seemed to lack a coherent organization of which strategy to employ, often vacillating between the anxious and avoidant insecure attachment styles.\np1p2 | The disorganized attachment style is most commonly associated with trauma and it typically arises when a child experiences their attachment figure as scary, threatening or dangerous. When we are afraid, our attachment system gets activated to seek proximity to and comfort from our attachment figure, but what happens when our attachment figure is the person causing the threat? This puts the child in a paradoxical situation where their caretaker, who is supposed to be the source of their comfort and the solution to their fears, is actually the source of their fear instead. Diane Poole Heller refers to this conflicting experience as having one foot on the gas and one foot on the brake. The child's attachment system wants to move towards their attachment figure, while the protective defensive mechanism of flight / flight / freeze / appease wants to move away from the attachment figure, and the two systems are coactivated.\nmuok | The predominant factor leading to this style in childhood is having parents who are suffering from their own unresolved trauma or losses. When a parent has a history of unresolved trauma, they are more easily overwhelmed by life's demands and emotionally flooded by their child's emotional states. Unable to regulate their own emotions, parents with their own history of unhealed trauma, neglect or abuse might then act out, lash out or completely tune out in ways that are scary to the child. Whether that parent is being terrifyingly overresponsive or frighteningly underresponsive, the child learns that they're not safe with the very person who's supposed to protect them. Research has shown that approximately twenty to forty percent of the general population has some degree of a disorganized attachment style, and approximately eighty percent of children who have experienced abuse develop a disorganized attachment style to one or both of their parents.\nqozi | Additional factors that can lead to a disorganized attachment style include:\n801o | .
