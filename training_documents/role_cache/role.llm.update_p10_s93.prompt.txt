You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

8qb6 | GAP models for apple flesh firmness and crispness retainability were developed and were efficiently used in simulative selection. Fivefold cross-validation showed the prediction accuracy was 0.5541 and 0.6018 for the retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively. The predictability of these models was not only better than that of the activator-depleted substrate model (van der Sman and Sanders, 2012), but also better than that of pure GS by ridge regression BLUP, the accuracy of which was more than 0.4 for apple firmness after storage and was 0.08-0.45 for changes in fruit firmness (McClure et al., 2018). The improvement in predictability of the GAP models may be attributed to the taking into account non-additive allelic effects. Additive, dominant, and even over-dominant non-allelic epistasis or interactions among

ftfg | QTLs or candidate genes for fruit firmness were detected in tomato (Causse et al., 2007; Chapman et al., 2012). Dominant or partially dominant allelic effects were common in this study for apple flesh firmness and crispness retainability.
7xi5 | Conclusion
w8r5 | Fifty-six candidate genes for apple flesh firmness and crispness retainability were predicted from the intervals of 62 QTLs. GAP models were developed using genotype effects of the QTL-based marker, and the prediction accuracy of the GAP models was 0.5712 and 0.6585 for the retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively. On the QTL hotspot of chromosome 3, an 8-bp deletion in the MdERF3 promoter perturbed the binding of MdDOF5.3, reduced MdERF3 expression, relieved the inhibition on MdPGLR3, MdPME2, and MdACO4 expression, and ultimately decreased the flesh firmness and crispness retainability. From a QTL on chromosome 16, a 3-bp deletion in the promoter of MdERF118 decreased its expression by perturbing the binding of MdRAVL1, which increased MdPGLR3 and MdACO4 expression and reduced flesh firmness and crispness retainability. The results implied a sophisticated genetic variation network regulating flesh firmness and crispness retainability. The GAP models can be potentially applied in apple breeding.
ybik | Experimental procedures
gii5 | Plant materials and growth conditions
q5eu | The plant materials were 2,664 bi-parental hybrids derived from 'Zisai Pearl' x 'Red Fuji' (1185), 'Zisai Pearl' x 'Golden Delicious' (967), and 'Jonathan' x 'Golden Delicious' (512). 'Zisai Pearl' is a Chinese apple cultivar that belongs to Malus asiatica Nakai., while the other three parents are commercial cultivars belonging to M. domestica Borkh. All the hybrids were grown at a density of <LATEX>2 . 5 m \times 0 . 5 m</LATEX> under conventional management and pest con- trol in the Fruit Experimental Station, China Agricultural University (Changping District, Beijing, China).
a7ao | In 2016-2017, fruit samples were harvested at commercial maturity based on fruit background colour and starch degradation (selected at 7 on a scale of 1-10) (Blanpied and Silsby 1992). After harvest, apples were cold-stored at 1 ℃ with -95% relative humidity in polyethylene bags. Flesh firmness and crispness of three apples per hybrid (all 2,664 hybrids if fruit samples were available) were measured at 0-6th month with one month interval. Apples from hybrids with year-stable extremity phenotypes (randomly five hybrids from each phenotype type) were used for ethylene measurement in 2017. Flesh tissue of 'Zisai Pearl', 'Red Fuji' and hybrids with phenotype type I (12-190, 17-103, and 14-107) and type II (01-067, 11-169, and 17-138) of flesh firmness retainability were used for qRT-PCR analysis for MdERF3 and MdERF118 relative expression. The fruit flesh and leaf samples were collected, imme- diately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 ℃ until use.
29a3 | Apple calli induced from the flesh of the cultivar 'Orin' were sub-cultured every three weeks on Murashige and Skoog medium used for <LATEX>A .</LATEX> tumefaciens infection (Jia et al., 2018).
sb1e | Measurements of flesh firmness/crispness and the retainability
w2yn | To evaluate the ability of flesh firmness and crispness retention during cold storage, the maximum time (months as unit) till which the apples maintained acceptable flesh firmness (≥7.0 kg/cm2) and crispness (≥0.7 kg/cm2) was recorded as the retainability of
ap6l | flesh firmness and crispness, respectively (Costa et al., 2010; Nybom et al., 2012). Flesh firmness and crispness were measured with a computer-controlled texture analyser TAXT (StableMicroSystem, Godalming, UK) (Costa et al., 2011, 2012). The diameter of the penetrating probe was 0.2 cm, and the penetration depth was 0.5 cm. Punctures were performed on the maximum equator of each apple. Three biological replicates were performed, and each included at least three technical replicates.
iest | Measurements of ethylene production
cox8 | To determine ethylene emission, each fruit was weighed and enclosed in a gas-tight container and incubated for 2 h at room temperature (20-25 ℃). One millilitre of gas was sampled from the headspace in the container using a BD syringe (No. 309602, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The ethylene concentration of gas samples was measured with a gas chromatography (HP 5890 series II) (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector. The fruit ethylene production was calculated as described previously (Dougherty et al., 2016).
ppqi | BSA-seq and QTL identification
oxou | As hybrids with longer flesh firmness and crispness retainability over six months can only be detected in the population of 'Zisai Pearl' x 'Red Fuji', hybrids from this population were used to make BSA bulks. Thirty hybrids were randomly chosen from each phenotype type: type I, type II, and type III for flesh firmness or crispness retainability, respectively. Totally six phenotype extremity bulks were constructed (Figure S3). Genomic DNA from each hybrid was extracted from young leaves and pooled. Each bulked DNA sample was sequenced to obtain 30x genome coverage using a paired- end 150-bp read strategy (Illumina X10, Illumin a, USA). The parental cultivars have been re-sequenced previously (Shen et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020). The re-sequencing data were processed, and QTLs were identified using the BSATOS software package (https://github.com/maypoleflyn/BSATOS) (Shen et al., 2019).
