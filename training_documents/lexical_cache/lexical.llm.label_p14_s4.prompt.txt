You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

fj24 | A single-syllable fragment (e.g., the first syllable of octopus or oktober) produced significant facilitation if it matched, but did not produce inhibition if it mismatched, i.e., was taken from a word with the contrasting stress pattern (Donselaar et al.,
uz3c | 278 Anne Cutler
d5bi | 2005); the same pattern appeared in a fragment priming study in German by Friedrich (2002). Friedrich, Kotz, and Gunter (2001) presented fragments of varying length, but did not use target pairs contrasting in onset stress such as octopus- oktober, so that (as in Donselaar et al.'s study with museum) no competition and hence no inhibition was involved; however, these authors found that facilitation did not significantly increase with increasing fragment size. The difference in inhibition due to the constraint in the competition process exercised by two syllables versus one is presumably a function of number of remaining potential competitors; after two syllables the competitor set will be smaller. In either case, cues to stress in the realization of word-initial portions are clearly used by listeners.
ba4l | This series of studies on Spanish, Dutch, and German has brought the invest- igation of cues to stress into the currently accepted activation-competition frame- work of spoken-word recognition theory. Friedrich (2002) also measured evoked response potentials (ERPs), and found evidence for a difference in these measures between prime-target pairs which matched versus mismatched in F0 correlates of stress. It is to be expected that the coming years will see more studies of this issue using electrophysiological and brain imaging techniques. What is remarkable is that although, overall, most research on the perception of stress has been conducted on English, directly comparable experiments to those just described in Spanish, Dutch, and German have not been done in English. In fact there is good reason for this: directly analogous experiments are actually impossible. This is because of the strong tendency in English for any unstressed syllable adjacent to a stressed syllable to contain a reduced vowel. Thus there are effectively no such pairs in English as octopus/oktober in Dutch; the second syllable of English octopus, for instance, is reduced and hence has a different vowel than English October.
ffx8 | This does not however rule out partially comparable experiments. One pos- sibility in English is to compare pairs in which the stress placement contrast does not involve primary stress on the first syllable versus primary stress on the second syllable, but another placement contrast. In fact Soto-Faraco et al.'s (2001) stress experiment included some pairs contrasting primary stress on second versus third syllables (e.g., coMEdia 'comedy' versus comeDOR 'dining room'), and so did Donselaar et al.'s (2005) Dutch fragment priming experiment (e.g., dyNAmo 'dynamo' versus dynaMIET 'dynamite'). These are again not possible to match exactly with English examples; but a first- vs. third-syllable contrast in primary stress can be achieved. There are in fact many English pairs in which the second syllable is reduced in both, but primary stress is either on the first or the third syllable - e.g., admiral versus admiration. In such pairs a fragment comprising only the first two syllables (e.g., admi-) would in one case have primary stress plus a weak syllable, in the other secondary stress plus a weak syllable.
s6su | Cooper, Cutler, and Wales (2002) carried out a fragment priming study using such English word pairs, and found clear evidence that English listeners too can make use of cues to stress in recognizing spoken words: admi- with primary stress on the first syllable activated ADMIRAL to a greater extent than ADMIRATION, while admi- with secondary stress on the first syllable activated ADMIRATION to a greater extent than ADMIRAL. Single-syllable fragments (e.g., mus- from music or museum) also produced facilitation when stress cues matched. Cooper et al. found, however, no evidence of inhibition from stress-mismatching primes, either with one- or two-syllable fragments; they argued that stress cues contribute less

06ht | to resolution of inter-word competition in English than segmental information does, and in particular less than the wider range of stress contrasts contributes in Spanish and Dutch.
v3r2 | However, their results do show that English listeners can exploit suprasegmental stress cues in word recognition if they are given the opportunity. Cooper et al.'s conclusion thus modifies an earlier conclusion by Cutler (1986), reached on the basis of a priming study using not fragments but minimal stress pairs: for example FORbear versus forBEAR, or trusty versus trustee. Such pairs are rare but a few do exist in English. The task used was cross-modal priming of associated words: listeners were presented with sentences which were neutral until the occurrence of the critical pair, e.g .: The person that she was hurrying to see was the trusty/ trustee ... , and made lexical decisions about words presented visually at offset of the critical word in the sentence. Whichever member of the stress pair had been heard, listeners' responses to associates of both members of the pair were facilitated in comparison to control words. Cutler argued that the undoubted suprasegmental differences between, for instance, FORbear and forBEAR were ineffective in constraining lexical activation, so that for English listeners forbear was effect- ively a homophone. L. Slowiaczek (personal communication) reached the same conclusion on the basis of the finding that phrase-stress and compound-stress realizations of sequences such as green house primed associates related to both. The findings of Cooper et al. (2002) suggest, however, that the proposed inutility of stress cues in the initial stages of lexical activation does not extend to all types of stress contrast in English. Note that a cross-modal priming study in Dutch, planned as a direct replication of Cutler's (1986) experiment, failed to find significant priming at all by initially-stressed members of minimal stress pairs (VOORnaam 'firstname'), and inconsistent results for finally-stressed tokens (voorNAAM 'respectable') (Jongenburger & van Heuven, 1995a; Jongenburger, 1996), despite the other clear evidence for the use of stress cues in activation in Dutch; studies of minimal pairs may thus not provide the best window on the exploitation of stress information.
nv42 | 11.3.2 Lexical selection
xags | Other types of word recognition studies, using tasks which do not tap into the early activation and competition stages, also show that listeners exploit stress cues in distinguishing between spoken words. Connine, Clifton, and Cutler (1987), for example, asked listeners to categorize an ambiguous consonant (varying along a continuum between [d] and [t]) in either DIgress-TIgress (in which tigress is a real word) or diGRESS-tiGRESS (in which digress is a real word). Listeners' responses showed effects of stress-determined lexical status, in that /t/ was reported more often for the DIgress-TIgress continuum, but /d/ more often for the diGRESS-tiGRESS continuum. The listeners clearly could use the stress information in the signal, and in their stored representations of these words, to resolve the phonetic ambiguity. However, this does not entail that knowing stress patterns in advance can facilitate access to the stored representations of words. Cutler and Clifton (1984) examined the effects of providing such information in a word recognition task, by comparing recognition of the same words in a blocked-

ko3c | presentation condition (all items presented were bisyllabic and initially stressed, for example) versus a mixed condition. They found that neither visual nor auditory lexical decision was speeded by prior specification of stress pattern.
xek3 | Another way in which stress can play a role in word recognition is via canonical correlations between stress pattern and word class (e.g., initial stress for bisyllabic nouns in English, final stress for bisyllabic verbs; see Sereno, 1986, for the relevant statistics). Words which can be either nouns or verbs (such as rescue or control) show slight prosodic differences consistent with the canonical patterns when read in their two word class realizations (Sereno & Jongman, 1995). Listeners know and can use this; in studies by Kelly and colleagues (Cassidy & Kelly, 1991; Kelly, 1988, 1992; Kelly & Bock, 1988), subjects who were asked to use bisyllabic nonwords in a sentence as if they were words treated initially-stressed nonwords as nouns and finally-stressed nonwords as verbs. Further, when asked to use verbs as nonce-nouns subjects chose verbs with initial stress, while for nouns acting as nonce-verbs they chose nouns with final stress. This is analogous to knowledge of other stress regularities which has been demonstrated in produc- tion studies (see Colombo, 1991, for a review).
bbpr | However, canonical patterning again does not directly speed spoken-word recognition, so that, for instance, whether or not a bisyllabic word conforms to the dominant noun/verb pattern does not affect how rapidly its grammatical category is judged - cigar is perceived as a noun just as rapidly as apple, and borrow is perceived as a verb as rapidly as arrive (Cutler & Clifton, 1984). Arciuli and Cupples (2002) replicated this result. Davis and Kelly (1997) also found no significant difference in the same classification task for native English speakers, but interestingly nonnative speakers of English - whose responses were of course much slower than those of the native speakers - did show a response advantage in their study for words which conformed to the canonical stress pattern for nouns and verbs respectively.
5zyf | Gating is a task in which words are presented in fragments of increasing size; the dependent variable is how large a fragment is needed for listeners to recognize the word. Jongenburger and van Heuven (1995b; see also Jongenburger, 1996), using Dutch minimal pairs such as voornaam in sentence context, found that listeners' word guesses only displayed correct stress judgments for the initial syllable of the target word once the whole of that initial syllable and part of the following vowel were available. This result suggests again that minimal stress pairs may not exhibit the strongest possible effects of stress information on word activation, since it contrasts with another gating study (Van Heuven, 1988), in which listeners could correctly assign just the first syllable of a word, in sen- tence context, to one of two words in which it was respectively stressed versus unstressed (e.g., si- to SIlo versus siGAAR).
9own | For English, Lindfield, Wingfield, and Goodglass (1999) conducted a gating study in which the presentation of word-initial fragments was contrasted with a condition in which the same fragments were presented along with additional information about how long the target word was, or how many syllables it had and what the stress pattern was. Recognition of the target occurred earlier in the latter condition. Arciuli and Cupples (2003) found however that adding low-pass filtered versions of the remainder of a gated word did not lead to earlier recogni- tion compared with the gated fragment alone.

wwdt | Related to gating studies are experiments in which listeners are presented with parts of words and asked to select (usually in a two-way forced choice) the source word. In Dutch, van Heuven (1988), Jongenburger (1996), and Cutler and Donselaar (2001) found that listeners could correctly select between two Dutch words with a segmentally identical but stress-differentiated initial syllable (e.g., ORgel and orKEST, or a minimal pair such as VOORnaam-voorNAAM) when presented with only the first syllable; Cutler and Donselaar found that the second syllables of minimal stress pairs (e.g., -naam) could also be accurately judged.
mn1r | The high proportion of correct responses in the Dutch studies (for example, 85% for first and 80% for second syllables in Cutler and Donselaar's experiment) was not equaled in a similar study in English by Mattys (2000), though here too listeners performed above chance with both two-syllable and one-syllable word- initial fragments (on average 62% and 54% correct, respectively). Similarly, Cooper et al. (2002) found that English listeners correctly assigned 59% of initial syllables to source words such as music versus museum. Remarkably, however, Dutch listeners outperformed the native speakers in the same experiment, scoring 72% correct assignments. As discussed in section 11.3.1, the contribution of stress information in resolving lexical competition may be greater in some other lan- guages than in English, and this difference may allow some proficient non- native users of English to exploit English stress cues more effectively than native speakers do.
5vqw | 11.3.3 Lexical mismatch
meyw | Other evidence that English listeners do not make maximal use of stress informa- tion in speech comes from studies of the perception of mis-stressed words. Small, Simon, and Goldberg (1988) found that mis-stressing did not inhibit word recog- nition if it effectively created the target word's stress pair (e.g., INsert pronounced as inSERT or vice versa), though recognition was significantly inhibited if the mis-stressing created a nonword (e.g., chemist pronounced cheMIST, or polite pro- nounced POlite). Similarly, Bond and Small (1983) found that word recognition in shadowing was achieved despite mis-stressing as long as the mis-stressing did not result in an alteration of vowel quality; Slowiaczek (1990) found the same for word identification in noise. Cutler and Clifton (1984) found that shifting stress without altering vowel quality had a much smaller adverse effect on recognition than stress shifts which changed full vowels to reduced or vice versa.
2e62 | In contrast, Dutch experiments on the perception of mis-stressed words (using gating: van Heuven, 1985; van Leyden & van Heuven, 1996; or a semantic judg- ment task: Cutler & Koster, 2000; Koster & Cutler, 1997) have shown that mis- stressing harms word recognition in that language, and at least in Koster and Cutler's (1997) study the effects of mis-stressing were of similar magnitude to the effects of segmental mispronunciation. Mis-stressing of finally-stressed Dutch words (PIloot instead of piLOOT) is more harmful than mis-stressing of initially- stressed words (viRUS instead of VIrus) both in gating (van Heuven, 1985; van Leyden & van Heuven, 1996) and in a semantic decision task (Koster & Cutler, 1997).
75y3 | 282 Anne Cutler
s2g2 | In German, the same result appeared when ERPs were recorded as listeners made decisions about correctly stressed versus mis-stressed words (Friedrich, 2002): KAnal instead of kaNAL produced a deviant electrophysiological response, while kaNU instead of KAnu did not.
q1q2 | The suggestion from these cross-linguistic comparisons is that mis-stressing is more harmful in other stress languages than in English. In English, deviant stress sometimes seems to have no effect at all. Thus, Slowiaczek (1991) presented listeners with a sentence context and a stress pattern and asked them to judge a target word for acceptability; she found that the stress pattern information was often ignored, in that listeners responded "yes" to words which were semantic- ally acceptable in the context but did not have the target stress pattern.
