You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

68xu | In German, the same result appeared when ERPs were recorded as listeners made decisions about correctly stressed versus mis-stressed words (Friedrich, 2002): KAnal instead of kaNAL produced a deviant electrophysiological response, while kaNU instead of KAnu did not.
hd35 | The suggestion from these cross-linguistic comparisons is that mis-stressing is more harmful in other stress languages than in English. In English, deviant stress sometimes seems to have no effect at all. Thus, Slowiaczek (1991) presented listeners with a sentence context and a stress pattern and asked them to judge a target word for acceptability; she found that the stress pattern information was often ignored, in that listeners responded "yes" to words which were semantic- ally acceptable in the context but did not have the target stress pattern.
2zpk | A cross-splicing study by Fear, Cutler, and Butterfield (1995) suggested that listeners pay more attention to the distinction between full and reduced vowels than to stress distinctions among full syllables. Listeners in this study heard tokens of words such as audience, auditorium, audition, addition, in which the initial vowels had been exchanged between words; they rated cross-splicings among any of the first three of these as insignificantly different from the original, unspliced tokens. Lower ratings were received only by cross-splicings involving an exchange between the initial vowel of addition (which is reduced) and the initial vowel of any of the other three words. Especially the vowels in stressed syllables seem to be important to listeners. Bond (1981) compared the disruptive effects on word recognition of several types of segmental distortion; most disruptive was distortion of vowels in stressed syllables. The number of features involved in disruption of a stressed vowel is irrelevant; any replacement of such a vowel is harmful (Small & Squibb, 1989). Likewise, mispronunciations in stressed syllables inhibit phantom word recognitions resulting from the combination of dichotically presented input (Mattys & Samuel, 1997).
epu7 | 11.4 Conclusion
7od1 | Unsurprisingly, given the distribution of psycholinguistic laboratories across the world, a majority of the research concerning the use of stress information in spoken-word recognition has been carried out in English. However, the role of lexical stress in word recognition may not be the same in English and in other free-stress languages. The evidence certainly suggests that stress cues play a role in the initial activation of lexical forms in those languages where it contributes significant information to word identification; Dutch, German, and Spanish all appear to be included in this category. English is less clearly a good member of the category; English listeners can use stress information in activation if given the opportunity, but the opportunity in fact arises less often in word discrimination in English than in the other languages studied. Furthermore, several experi- mental demonstrations of better use of English stress information by nonnative than by native speakers now exist. Thus the language in which most psycholin- guistic research (on any topic) is conducted unfortunately turns out to be rather unrepresentative in the role its word prosody plays in word recognition.
0bqy | Recommendations for future research are therefore obvious. More laboratory investigations of the role of stress in word recognition in other languages with

ccmb | lexical stress are needed. The application of new techniques to study lexical processing on line is also recommended. But it is not only in spoken-word recog- nition that the predominance of research on English has skewed the picture of lexical stress perception. The fact that most early studies were carried out in a language with free stress, i.e., in which stress can fall at different positions in different words, also determined expectations in later research. Stress is certainly the same across all stress languages in that it always refers to a distinction be- tween those syllables which may express accentual prominence and those which may not; but its manifestations are different in free- versus fixed-stress languages. In English and similar languages, stressed syllables and unstressed syllables dif- fer acoustically, and much research effort focused on the perceptual consequences of this. But in fixed-stress languages, as Section 11.2 described, such intrinsic acoustic differences between stressed and unstressed syllables are not necessarily to be expected. There are at least as many fixed- as free-stress languages in the world (Goedemans, 2003). In fixed-stress languages, too, far more perceptual research is needed. In all cases, effects due to intrinsic characteristics of stressed versus unstressed syllables must be distinguished from effects which arise from differences in the applicability of intonational prominence.
