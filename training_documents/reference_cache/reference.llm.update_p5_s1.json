Secondly, people on the other side of the digital divide have become increasingly informationally disadvantaged and disenfranchised, which became critically apparent when many people's access to the internet was restricted due to school and library closures in twenty twenty during the pandemic. End users without access to the internet continue to face challenges to accessing reliable and appropriate information to meet their formation needs.\nb2lm | On a different note, the advent of seamless and multimodal virtual reference tools has provided users with multichannel points of entry to hubs of information. Virtual reference services, sometimes called digital or mobile reference services, have extended the reach of traditional reference services by offering users synchronous and asynchronous computer-mediated reference services via email, chat/instant messaging, texting/short message service, voice chat and cloud-based videoconferencing, and more. Web-based applications on smartphones and other mobile devices provide users with additional mobility, and the global reach and twenty-four seven anytime/anywhere point-of-need access of these tools mean that reference services are not place bound. These tools proved invaluable to information intermediators for providing reference services at a distance during the pandemic.\nti7f | Despite the use of technology in online interactions, virtual reference interviews are not that different from face-to-face transactions because many of the same reference skills and techniques are used. Information professionals today have a variety of virtual reference tools (e.g., text messaging, synchronous reference options, etc.) to support their user needs but also encounter some challenges (e.g., real-time typed interactions can be cumbersome).\noksu | Because many information institutions do not have the staff to offer extended hours of reference services in person and online, online cooperative reference services that offer expanded or around-the-clock help have become another virtual reference option. For example, Springshare offers LibAnswers as a twenty-four seven reference cooperative that includes an international multichannel platform using a LibChat widget and the ability for libraries to answer questions via email, SMS, Facebook, and Twitter as well as providing access to FAQ knowledge bases for academic and public libraries. Other information institutions participate in consortial arrangements, such as Florida's statewide Ask-a-Librarian consortium of public and academic libraries. However, challenges can arise with consortial reference arrangements when the staffing of the virtual reference desk is shared among various participating libraries, and information professionals are asked to answer questions about library systems with which they have no personal knowledge or experience.\nwtow | Technological advances have also impacted readers' advisory services that information professionals offer, particularly in school and public libraries. Information professionals use digital readers' advisory tools (such as NoveList, Goodreads, and even Pinterest) to provide book recommendations on topics ranging from Christian fiction and graphic novels to popular crafts and local history. Public libraries also quickly expanded their digital advisory services when in-person help and in-library browsing were not feasible during the COVID-19 pandemic.\no22k | Information Intermediation and Reference Services\nnwfz | TEXTBOX Thirteen point two\nnvfy | Discussion Question\nmror | What are the pros and cons of reference services delivered in person, by phone, and by various online virtual methods of communicating?\nzlxc | Web Two point zero social tools also encourage reference interactions through blogs, wikis, and group messaging. Social media tools (including TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, and Twitter) are frequently used to engage with personal learning networks, promote library resources and services, and even respond to information queries. The technological advancements in social tools have had a profound impact on library and information services, contributing to changes in the ways that reference services are delivered and to the development of a twenty-first-century service model called Reference Two point zero. Reference Two point zero is the term used to describe this new service model of collaborative social networking tools used in conjunction with information sources to provide digital reference services.\nk0bw | Reference Two point zero services have made it possible to move beyond the place-bound services offered at the reference desk to a two-way seamless interaction between information users and reference librarians that can be used to facilitate information intermediation services. For example, information professionals can:\naq5a | · amplify their social networks by tweeting on Twitter when they may want expert help with specific questions,\nsc5y | · use social media to promote reference services and enhance information intermediation (see also Chapter Thirty: Communication, Marketing, and Outreach Strategies), and\n0yab | · co-browse with a user through chat services (see also Chapter Twelve: Virtual Resources and Services).\nw95z | Because users today have online access to decentralized, distributed, and often free sources for information intermediation services, reference services offered by libraries are competing with a variety of other information intermediation options in this age of Google. However, information professionals have unique expertise and skills that are otherwise not available to users via these other alternatives, and they are able to target their services to the needs of their local communities. Specifically, reference librarians provide value-added help to users with specialized research questions, are able to address patron-driven wants, and provide a \"high-tech and high-touch\" approach. This expertise positions them well to be knowledge professionals in the age of Google and adapt to the myriad circumstances and unforeseen challenges in delivering reference services.\n0i1k | TEXTBOX Thirteen point three\ndqlg | Discussion Question\np6pq | How do you envision the \"new normal\" reference services offered in your information organization in terms of service to diverse communities?\nzse6 | Roles for Information Intermediators\np2n3 | As information-seeking behaviors become increasingly user driven, virtual, and self-directed, reference librarians and other information intermediators continue handling traditional reference roles and taking on new methods for mediating between users. Management is one of those areas that plays an important role for providing reference work in all types of settings. For example, information sources need to be collected and managed, while service points used to deliver reference services need to be organized and assessed. This work can range from designing online and in-person services that meet the needs of the community being served to evaluating and improving how those services are delivered. Reference librarians also must ensure that reference staff are adequately trained and have ongoing professional development opportunities.\nohh7 | Outreach and marketing of services and resources that are offered by information organizations to the broader community of users are other important areas of responsibility handled by today's reference librarians. Although librarians had been using social media for marketing and outreach in addition to more traditional tools for some time, the importance of promoting reference services virtually became much more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
