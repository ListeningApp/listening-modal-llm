You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

4jmz | The culminative function of stress may be contrasted with the so-called demarcative function, a term applying to stress which falls always at a particular position within the word. Again, one syllable within a polysyllabic word is the location of this fixed stress. The term demarcative refers to the potential for fixed- position stress to function as a marker of word boundaries (perhaps especially in languages with fixed word-initial stress, such as Finnish, Hungarian, Czech). Note, however, that fixed placement of stress of course implies that stress is not contrastive, i.e., cannot distinguish one word from another.
b7cq | These properties are potentially important in perception. If stress can distinguish between words, listeners may use cues to stress in identifying spoken words; but if stress cannot help in this way, there is no reason for listeners to use it in word recognition. Similarly, if stress can signal word boundaries, listeners may use stress cues for segmenting continuous speech into words; but if stress were to have no systematic relation to position within the word, it could not be of use in segmentation.
0b39 | 11.2.3 Free stress and segmentation
qecd | Most research on the role of stress in the segmentation of speech has in fact been conducted in free-stress languages: notably in English and Dutch. Although both these languages are classified as having free stress, the place where stress will fall is not arbitrary, but is determined by considerations of syllable weight; morpho- logical factors then conspire to place the designated stress-bearing syllable more often than not, as Figure 11.2 showed, in word-initial position. In typical conver- sational speech in English, the tendency to word-initial stress is even stronger than in the lexicon (Cutler & Carter, 1987). Listeners' behavior shows effects of this regularity; nonwords with initial stress can be repeated more rapidly, and attract higher word-likeness ratings, than nonwords with final stress (Vitevitch et al., 1997). The distributional asymmetry, combined with listener sensitivity to the pattern, opens the way for stress to be useful in segmentation in these languages, too.
1o7p | Indeed, a substantial body of evidence from both English and Dutch indicates that listeners do treat stressed syllables as probable word onsets. Missegmentations of speech are more likely to involve stressed syllables being erroneously taken for word-initial and unstressed syllables being erroneously taken for word-internal than the reverse pattern, both in English (Cutler & Butterfield, 1992) and Dutch

bgre | (Vroomen, Van Zon, & De Gelder, 1996). Thus a must to avoid heard as a muscular boy is a natural error - the stressed last syllable is taken as a new word, while the unstressed two syllables preceding it are taken as internal to another word. Similarly, English listeners find word-spotting - detecting a real word in a spoken nonsense sequence - difficult if the word is spread over two strong syllables (e.g., risk in [riskib]) but easier if it is spread over a strong followed by a weak, unstressed syllable (e.g., risk in [rIskab]) (Cutler & Norris, 1988; see Quené & Koster, 1998, and Vroomen et al., 1996, for analogous evidence from Dutch). The difficulty in the former case is explained as resulting from division of the sequence at the onset of the second strong syllable on the strategy that any such syllable (with primary or secondary stress) is likely to be a new word; consequently, detection of risk in [riskib] requires that its component phonemes be reassembled, while no such delay affects detection of risk in [rskab]. These findings suggest that listeners use distributional consistencies of stress placement to segment speech even in languages in which stress is not strictly demarcative. So far, however, similar studies of segmentation in fixed-stress languages are not available.
57lp | 11.2.4 Fixed stress discriminability
ukth | In fact, there are reasons for caution with the superficially appealing notion of a demarcative role for stress cues in listening. One relevant consideration is that the acoustic realization of stress in fixed-stress languages is "weak" (Dogil, 1999; Rigault, 1970) in comparison to stress in free-stress languages. Early measure- ments of Hungarian (fixed initial stress) by Fonagy (1966) found the unstressed final syllables of bisyllabic words to be both longer and louder than the stressed initial syllables. Janota (1967) reported that F0 did not serve as a perceptual cue to stress in synthesized nonwords for Czech listeners (fixed initial stress); Rigault (1970) found in both Czech and French (fixed accent on final syllable of rhythmic groups) an absence of systematicity in stress realization. For Polish (fixed penul- timate stress), Jassem (1962, cited in Morton & Jassem, 1965 and in Dogil, 1999) found no effective acoustic correlate of stress other than in F0. Dogil (1999) observed that Jassem's study was confounded with intonational variation, and conducted measurements of the same Polish words in different intonational frames; he found no consistent acoustic correlates of stress at all, and also no consistent reflections of putative rhythmic stresses in this language. Dogil proposed that in Polish, word stress has no other expression than as the abstract feature marking positions with which intonational movement may be associated. In contrast to lexical-stress languages, then, fixed-stress languages may not dis- tinguish stressed from unstressed syllables at all in the absence of intonational realization of the abstract difference.
kpvt | Another consideration is that although fixed stress is sometimes located at a word boundary, this is not always so (as in Polish, where stress is on the penul- timate syllable). Given that the process of spoken-word recognition involves con- tinuous exploitation of incoming acoustic information (see Frauenfelder & Floccia, 1998, for a review), fixed stress other than at a word edge will involve additional processing complexity. A third consideration is that fixed stress may affect all words irrespective of word class, or may be sensitive to grammatical factors.
