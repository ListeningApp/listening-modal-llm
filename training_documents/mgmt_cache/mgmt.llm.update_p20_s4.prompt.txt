You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

afbe | Some questions on the future development of Rendanheyi are unresolved, as the transfer of Rendanheyi to Haier's foreign affiliates, other companies, and other national contexts will be challenging. The challenges Haier faces in the implementation of Rendanheyi are, to some extent, archetypical of breakthrough innovations. It is well documented that key stakeholders are often cautious and even unwilling to adopt or participate in breakthrough innovations for a myriad of reasons.35 More fundamentally, as we have seen, there are cultural and legal impediments that limit Rendanheyi's applicability in other institutional contexts. Rendanheyi may not work as well, or not at all, in other countries. In fact, the implementation of Rendanheyi has been very limited in Haier's foreign affiliates. Haier executives still hope to eventually transfer Rendanheyi to Haier's global affiliates, but the takeover of GE's white goods division may render this objective even more difficult.
78r8 | Within those affiliates where Rendanheyi has been fully introduced, Haier also needs to consider some critical issues going forward, including how organization-wide process innovations can be implemented by semi-autono- mous xiaowei, given that user-facing xiaowei are obsessed with product innova- tions with relatively quick payoffs and are less concerned with the longer term collective interests of the Haier Group. As the Haier Group is progressively dilut- ing its ownership stakes in the xiaowei, Haier must also consider how successful xiaowei can be prevented from fully disengaging themselves from the Haier Group organization. One possible future for Haier would be to transform into a "flotilla" model away from the "ocean liner," as Zhang has already indicated that "we may be entering the era of losing control" in the quest to serve customers better.
320g | Future research will need to further investigate to what extent Rendanheyi and other context-specific management innovations from emerging countries are transferable across national borders and organizational boundaries. There is much evidence that the transfer of organizational innovations across institutional con- texts often fails. The failed or incomplete transfer of management innovations from Japan to the West and the mixed success of novel, hierarchy-free organiza- tional forms such as holacracy should serve as a warning to managers.36 As we have seen, China's institutional context is particularly conducive to Rendanheyi. There is no written manual for introducing Rendanheyi, and, in fact, the ambigu- ity and vagueness of the precise contents of Rendanheyi are typical of most Chinese management models, as Chinese organizations tend to develop broad and imprecise strategies that are short on details and vague on the specific steps to implement them.37 Furthermore, Rendanheyi took a long time to develop into
tp8g | what it is today, and compared with key historical management innovations, only the making of Toyota's lean production platform has taken as long.38 Haier's long experimentation with Rendanheyi may have been an important reason why the practice was successfully implemented within the company, since the practice was molded by the specific experiences of the company, and Haier employees gradu- ally got used to assuming greater management responsibilities. Therefore, the Rendanheyi case suggests that organizations must be cautious before cutting and pasting radically innovative processes and mechanisms to obtain the same goals. Nonetheless, some elements of Rendanheyi could well be emulated by companies around the world, and this case will surely inspire managers and academics work- ing with management innovation.

Huang, "The Influence of National Culture, History and Institution on Strategic Management in Chinese Firms: A Complexity Based Perspective," International Journal of Business Studies, 17/1 (June 2009): 1-18. On one hand, this is chiefly due to the fluid and highly dynamic business environment that requires companies to favor broad strategies that provide them with a wide array of options and allow them to experiment and adapt. On the other hand, there are cultural (holistic view and dialectical thinking) and historical reasons that made Chinese organizations more reflexive in order to absorb unex- pected external changes and continuously morph to cope with heightened complexity and uncertainty in the business environment.
