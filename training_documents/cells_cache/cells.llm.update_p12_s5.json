        "content": "```\nukth | In conclusion, shear stress from blood flow potently regulates phenotypic and functional changes in endothelial cells that either prevent or promote atherogenesis. Endothelial cells transduce these biomechanical cues through mechanosensors that mediate various mechanosignal transduction pathways, which in turn regulate transcriptomic and epigenomic changes and cellular functions. The advent of high-throughput omics combined with in vivo and in vitro experimental models have revealed numerous flow-sensitive genes, proteins and pathways that regulate endothelial cell dysfunction and atherosclerosis development. Whereas stable flow induces an atheroprotective endothelial cell phenotype, disturbed flow induces an atherogenic phenotype characterized by alteration of endothelial morphology and barrier function, impairment of endothelial metabolism, redox regulation, proliferation and apoptosis, induction of inflammatory pathways, and transdifferentiation to other cell types, such as EndMT. Additionally, scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq studies in vivo have revealed that disturbed flow not only induces endothelial inflammation and EndMT, but also EndIT, which we define as FIRE (flow-induced reprogramming of endothelial cells). The mechanisms and roles of FIRE in endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis are major unanswered questions that could reveal important novel mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis. Moreover, the flow-sensitive molecules regulating FIRE could be novel therapeutic targets.\n```",
