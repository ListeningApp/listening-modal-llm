        "content": "sc5y | In sum, the Netherlands initially took an opposite reform trajectory than Norway in the nineteen nineties, with a move to NPG for PES instead of Norway with a more traditional administration combined with a principal-agent model. In the next decade, both countries switched their system in opposite directions, with the SUWI reform in two thousand two and the NAV reform in two thousand six. Reform in both countries thus shows major divergence, both over time and between the two nations. Since two thousand eight, we have seen more convergence as both nations have adopted (or extended) NPM to increase efficiency. Subsequent convergence is also visible in reforms for decentralization and street-level professionalism; and most recently in recentralization and standardization alongside a continued push for collaborative, person-centered services. So there is growing hybridity, but not necessarily more balance in welfare state governance.\n0yab | Divergence between Norway and the Netherlands in the current welfare administrations\nw95z | Despite growing convergence in reform trends over the past fifteen years, there is significant divergence between the current two welfare administrations. We focus here on two key themes:\n0i1k | the relationship between central and decentralized governance (levels) and the role and position of key stakeholders (clients, social partners).\ndqlg | Divergence in the relationship between governance levels\np6pq | At the ministry level in Norway, both the state and the municipal part of NAV are the responsibility of Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion. From the establishment of NAV in two thousand six, there were four hundred fifty-six local/regional offices, small and large. NAV consists of two hierarchies: one a state hierarchy of the directorate (national agency), regional offices and frontline offices, governed hierarchically, by instructions (although with a certain level of local autonomy), and two a relationship from the national level (the directorate), via supervision authorities at the regional level inspecting that municipalities fill their legal obligation to provide social services to the citizens. Cooperation at the local level can be voluntarily extended with other municipal social services, for example social housing, debt counseling, or for integration of newly arrived\nzse6 | municipal services such as services for people with problems on (mental) health and drug abuse.\np2n3 | The NAV governance system is complicated in more ways: The regional offices (at the provincial level) are only \"state\" offices, with no role for municipalities. Also, the NAV directorate is both the highest management (of employment services and national insurances) with instructional authority, and supervisor (of municipal social services) but without instructional authority. As a result of mergers between municipalities and formalized cooperation between many NAV offices, the number of first-line offices was reduced to two hundred sixty-eight since twenty twenty, with a simultaneous increase in scale to enable more \"robust\", professional offices. This will probably result in more internal specialization and less voice for the municipalities.\nohh7 | Table Three Central and decentralized governance in two welfare administrations\nvbni | The Dutch welfare administration is managed differently, but the relationship between levels of government is just as complicated. Unlike the NAV, the national state agency UWV and the three hundred forty-two Dutch municipalities (twenty twenty-three) are separate public agencies. There is a split in regulation, clients and tasks: UWV is responsible for social benefits and employment services to the insured population of unemployed and disabled. Municipalities are responsible for social assistance and related services to the unemployed without acquired rights for insurance-based benefits or other income means (partner income, savings, house etc.). As a national executive agency, UWV is governed within ministerial authority (but with a certain leeway). But municipalities have formal autonomy, even though many tasks are delegated and financed by the central state. The UWV and municipalities in thirty-five labour market regions are obliged to\ndgcw | cooperate with social partners for the Jobs Agreement Act twenty fifteen (and for regional labour market projects subsidized by national government), but neither the central level nor the local government (or social partners) have instructional authority and they will all have to arrive at shared goals and decisions.\ngvwz | Divergence between Norway and Netherlands in relationships with key stakeholders Increasingly the NAV offices are serving clients with reduced work capacity (not only caused by health conditions). Contact between jobseekers and employers is digitized and based on self-service. Retirement pension is digitized, so is income security under parental leave. Related to the NAV reform, the Directorate established \"user councils\" at the central, regional, and local level with members representing associations of clients as well as the employers (although not particularly well-functioning at the local level). New mandates for the councils were given in twenty fifteen. At the central level, the council is now described as a collaborative forum and an advisory body.\nsk5m | The Dutch UWV is serving only the insured clients with a work history. Contact between jobseekers and UWV is digitized and based on self-service, with face-to-face contact especially for the 'hard-to-place'. Municipalities serve clients on social assistance. With the SUWI reform, the Ministry established \"user councils\" at the central and local level with members representing associations of clients. Municipalities also have client councils, often volunteers. At the central level, the client council is described as an advisory body. They are only asked for advice by the government on policy implementation, not on policy or legislation itself.\nqws8 | Table Four Welfare administrations: Relationships with clients and partners\n877u | In Norway, social partners do not have a governing role in the welfare administration for long now. Before nineteen ninety-nine the Directorate of Labour had a board with members of the social partners; in nineteen ninety-nine this board was replaced by an advisory council, with additional employer and employee associations. The ministry argued that this was in compliance with the ILO obligations. From two thousand four the Ministry has had a council for labour market and pension policy with social partners as members. Another kind of involvement of the social partners is the steady progress of so-called tripartite agreements on a more inclusive working life (the first concluded in two thousand one), aimed at preventing and reducing absenteeism and withdrawal from working life, previously also at the inclusion of people with disabilities and other groups outside the labour market. The latter goal has been removed from the agreement and replaced by a so-called \"Inkluderingsdugnad\" - a type of voluntary joint effort, introduced in twenty eighteen.\nrzhj | In the Netherlands, before two thousand two, social partners had a strong governing role in the welfare administration. With the SUWI reform, the social partners lost all their power in the executive\nbfax | bodies of social benefits and the PES, which was a major shock in the Dutch corporatist landscape. The former governing role of the social partners in social benefits was moved to a national state agency (UWV) and their major role in the PES board was 'replaced' by an advisory body (the Council for Work and Income, two thousand two - two thousand twelve). In twenty thirteen, the social partners reached a so-called \"social agreement\" with the government, including a Jobs Agreement for people with (physical/mental) disabilities. In twenty fifteen, this led to a certain return of social partners in the governance of the Dutch welfare administration, as members of the Central and Regional Work Chambers of the thirty-five Dutch labour market regions. Despite this role, their current position is much less direct and powerful than it was before two thousand two.\nf2y8 | In short, divergence between current systems is expressed for both 'levels' and 'stakeholders'. Compared to the Netherlands, the Norwegian system has a much stronger degree of (compulsory) cooperation between the state and the municipalities (levels). However, the role of the social partners in the governance of the activation policy is stronger in the Netherlands. Clients are represented in advisory bodies in both countries, without a direct governing role.\no7qm | Discussion",
