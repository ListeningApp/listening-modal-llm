You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

otkr | 3. Newton-MR Two-Metric Projection
ibgs | We now propose and theoretically study our extensions of the TMP framework, which involves simultaneously em- ploying gradient and inexact Newton steps, which are, re- spectively, restricted to the active and inactive sets.
colo | 3.1. MINRES and Its Properties
d6r4 | The inexact Newton step is based on the recently proposed Newton-MR framework (Liu & Roosta, 2022b; Roosta et al.,
9mrz | 2022), where instead of CG, subproblems are approximately solved using the minimum residual (MINRES) method (Paige & Saunders, 1975). Recall that the tth iteration of MINRES is formulated as
pk06 | s(t) = arg min |Hs + g|2. SEKt (H,g)
7wn9 | (8)
wcd0 | where Kt (H, g) = Span{g, Hg, ... , Ht-1g} is the Krylov subspace of degree t generated from H and g. On each itera- tion MINRES minimises the squared norm of the residual of the Newton system over the corresponding Krylov subspace. Note that, from an optimisation perspective, the residual itself can be viewed as the gradient of the second-order Taylor approximation typically considered by second-order methods (e.g. Newton-CG), that is, r ^ -Hs - g = -Vs (g, s) + (s, Hs). This highlights an advantage of MINRES over CG. Indeed, unlike CG, which aims to min- imise the second order Taylor approximation, minimisation of the residual norm remains well defined even if H is in- definite. For more theoretical and empirical comparisons between CG and MINRES, see Lim et al. (2024).
caos | Recently, Liu & Roosta (2022a) established several prop- erties of MINRES that make it particularly well-suited for nonconvex settings. For example, to assess the availability of a nonpositive curvature (NPC) direction in MINRES, one merely needs to monitor the condition
qrvy | (r(t-1), Hr(t-1)) ≤0, (9)
pn9j | This condition is shown to be both necessary and sufficient for the existence of NPC directions in Kt (H, g) (Liu & Roosta, 2022a, Theorem 3.3). In addition, MINRES en- joys a natural termination condition in non-convex settings. More specifically, for any user specified tolerance n > 0, the termination condition
1pmc | |Hr(t-1) | < |Hs( -1)|, (10)
5z6q | is satisfied at some iteration. Note that the left hand side, Hr(t-1), is simply the residual of the normal equation H2s = - Hg. Condition (10) is particularly appealing in non-convex settings where we might have g ¢ Range(H) and therefore ||r|| > 0 for all s & Rd. In this case a more typical termination condition ||r(t-1) || < n may never be satisfied for a given n > 0. By contrast, (10) is applicable in all situations since |Hr(t-1) || is guaranteed to monoton- ically decrease to zero, while ||Hs(t-1) | is monotonically increasing (Liu & Roosta, 2021, Lemma 3.11). Remark- ably, both Conditions (9) and (10) can be computed with a scalar update directly from the MINRES iterates without any additional Hessian-vector products; see Lemma A.1.
yeoh | A Newton-MR step is computed by running MINRES until (9) is detected, in which case r(t-1) is returned. Since r(t-1) is a nonpositive curvature direction, we label this
b8hf | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimisation with Nonnegativity Constraints
hntf | case as a "NPC" step. Otherwise, when the termination condition (10) is satisfied, <LATEX>s ^ { \left( t - 1 \right) }</LATEX> is returned. This step serves as an approximate solution to (8) and so we label this case as a "SOL" step. Let p denote the direction returned by negative curvature detecting MINRES. Liu & Roosta (2022a) shows that <LATEX>\mathrm { p }</LATEX> serves as a direction of first and second- order descent for the function <LATEX>f ,</LATEX> namely <LATEX>\langle \mathrm { p } , \mathrm { g } \rangle < 0</LATEX> and <LATEX>\langle \mathrm { p } , \mathrm { g } \rangle + \langle \mathrm { p } , \mathrm { H p } \rangle / 2 < 0</LATEX> (Liu & Roosta, 2022a, Theorem 3.8), as well as a direction of non-ascent for the norm of its gradient <LATEX>\| \mathrm { g } \| ^ { 2 } ,</LATEX> that is, <LATEX>\langle \mathrm { p } , \mathrm { H g } \rangle < 0</LATEX> for a SOL step and <LATEX>\langle \mathrm { p } , \mathrm { H g } \rangle = 0</LATEX> for a NPC step (Liu & Roosta, 2022a, Lemma 3.1).
99fo | We include the full MINRES algorithm (Algorithm 3) as well as some additional properties in Appendix A.
y5r7 | 3.2. Global Convergence: Minimal Assumptions
lrry | We first present a variant that is globally convergent under minimal assumptions. Algorithm 1 is our simplest vari- ant of the Newton-MR two-metric projection method. Re- calling the definition of the x-active and &k-inactive sets as in <LATEX>\left( 2 \right) ^ { 1 } ,</LATEX> Algorithm 1 combines an active set gradient step (i.e., <LATEX>\left. \mathrm { p } _ { k } ^ { \mathcal{A} } = - \mathrm { g } _ { k } ^ { \mathcal{A} } \right)</LATEX> = with an inactive set Newton-MR step (i.e., <LATEX>\mathrm { p } _ { k } ^ { \mathcal{I} } = \mathrm { s } _ { k } ^ { \mathcal{I} } ,</LATEX> if <LATEX>\mathrm { D } _ { \mathrm { t y p e } } = \mathrm { S O L } ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>\mathrm { p } _ { k } ^ { \mathcal{I} } = \mathrm { r } _ { k } ^ { \mathcal{I} } ,</LATEX> if <LATEX>\left. \mathrm { D } _ { \mathrm { t v e } } = \mathrm { N P C } \right) .</LATEX> In Algorithm 1, the curvature condition (9) is considered with a positive tolerance, <LATEX>\bar { \varsigma } = \left( d + 1 \right) \varsigma > 0 ,</LATEX> i.e., <LATEX>\langle \mathrm { r } ^ { \left( t - 1 \right) } , \mathrm { H r } ^ { \left( t - 1 \right) } \rangle \leq \bar { \varsigma } \| \mathrm { r } ^ { \left( t - 1 \right) } \| ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> Lemma B.1 demon- strates that <LATEX>\langle \mathrm { r } ^ { \left( i \right) } , \mathrm { H r } ^ { \left( i \right) } \rangle > \bar { \varsigma } \| \mathrm { r } ^ { \left( i \right) } \| ^ { 2 }</LATEX> for all <LATEX>0 < < t \quad - \quad 1</LATEX> is a certificate that <LATEX>\mathrm { H }</LATEX> is s-strongly positive definite over
hvhm | <LATEX>\mathcal{K} _ { t } \left( \mathrm { H } , \mathrm { g } \right) .</LATEX> Once the step direction is computed, the step size is selected with a line search criteria similar to that of Bertsekas (1982). Specifically, letting <LATEX>\mathrm { x } _ { k } \left( \alpha \right) = \mathcal{P} \left( \mathrm { x } _ { k } + \alpha \mathrm { p } _ { k } \right) ,</LATEX> we find <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> that, for some <LATEX>\rho \in \left( 0 , 1 / 2 \right) ,</LATEX> satisfies
863b | <LATEX>f \left( \mathrm { x } _ { k } \left( \alpha \right) \right) - f \left( \mathrm { x } _ { k } \right) \leq \rho \langle \mathrm { g } _ { k } ^ { \mathcal{A} } , \mathcal{P} \left( \mathrm { x } _ { k } ^ { \mathcal{A} } + \alpha \mathrm { p } _ { k } ^ { \mathcal{A} } \right) - \mathrm { x } _ { k } ^ { \mathcal{A} } \rangle</LATEX> <LATEX>+ \alpha \rho \langle \mathrm { g } _ { k } ^ { \mathcal{I} } , \mathrm { p } _ { k } ^ { \mathcal{I} } \rangle</LATEX> (11) ,
fj24 | Note that the term corresponding to the inexact set in (11) is negative due to the descent properties of <LATEX>\mathrm { p } _ { k } ^ { \mathcal{I} }</LATEX> discussed earlier. On the other hand, the active set term in (11) is negative due the descent properties of the gradient mapping (Bertsekas, 1999, Proposition 3.3.1). This is crucial for our analysis as it allows us to consider the decrease in the inactive and active sets independently of each other. The two terms are unified since
uz3c | <LATEX>\langle \mathrm { g } _ { k } , \mathcal{P} \left( \mathrm { x } _ { k } + \alpha \mathrm { p } _ { k } \right) - \mathrm { x } _ { k } \rangle = \langle \mathrm { g } _ { k } ^ { \mathcal{A} } , \mathcal{P} \left( \mathrm { x } _ { k } ^ { \mathcal{A} } + \alpha \mathrm { p } _ { k } ^ { \mathcal{A} } \right) - \mathrm { x } _ { k } ^ { \mathcal{A} } \rangle ,</LATEX> <LATEX>+ \alpha \langle \mathrm { g } _ { k } ^ { \mathcal{I} } , \mathrm { p } _ { k } ^ { \mathcal{I} } \rangle ,</LATEX> so long as <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> is chosen small enough. This is a direct conse- quence of <LATEX>\mathcal{I} \left( \mathrm { x } _ { k } , \delta _ { k } \right)</LATEX> containing only strictly feasible indices.
