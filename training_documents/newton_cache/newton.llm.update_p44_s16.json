In this case, is nonconvex in both W and H, when considered simultaneously, but convex so long as one of the variables is held fixed. This motivates the standard approach to solving based on alternating updates to W and H where one variable is fixed while optimising over the other.\nndxn | By contrast, to test our algorithm, we specifically consider solving as a nonconvex problem in W and H simultaneously. For our first experiment, we consider a text data application. When comparing text documents, we aim to have a similarity measure that is independent of document length. Indeed, we consider documents similar if they have similar word frequency ratios. This notion of similarity is naturally captured by measuring alignment between vectors, which motivates the use of a loss function based on cosine similarity as\nsb9k | D of Y,WH equals one minus cosine theta of Y sub I, WH sub I.\nz2gn | \nmgx1 | where theta of Y sub I, WH sub I is the angle between the ith predicted and true document. This loss function only considers the alignment between documents. Indeed, we can write\nx0do | cosine theta of Y sub I, WH sub I equals Y sub I, WH sub I.\nr8qt | However, using this representation it is clear that, due to the nonnegativity of Y and WH, ranges between zero and one. It is also clear that is equivalent to a Euclidean distance with normalisation\nsga6 | norm squared of WH sub I.\n7af5 | equals Y sub I.\nuds2 | In our second example, we consider with a standard Euclidean distance function and a nonconvex regularisation term R one. Specifically, we consider a version of the smooth clipped absolute deviation regularisation first proposed in Fan and Li. SCAD uses a quadratic function to smoothly interpolate between a regular one penalty and a constant penalty\njp0o | norm X is less than one,\nakty | SCAD A comma A of X equals\nolz9 | A minus one, norm X is less than A, norm X is greater than A.\n5rex | The SCAD penalty reduces the downward bias on large parameters typical of the one penalty while still allowing for sparsification of small parameters. We consider a twice smooth clipped absolute deviation, which we call TSCAD. TSCAD replaces the quadratic interpolant with a quartic, Q X comma A of X, which allows for a twice continuously differentiable penalty\nhiwi | norm X is less than A, A minus one.\nzsp2 | TSCAD A comma A of X equals Q X comma A of X.\nqzw0 | norm X is greater than A.\n6hya | The regularisation term is simply given by\nh0lh | R X of W, H equals sum over I and J of TSCAD A comma A of W sub I J plus sum over I and J of TSCAD A comma A of H sub I J.\nu5th | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimisation with Nonnegativity Constraints\nkelb | Due to the inherent nonconvexity of the NNMF problem, initialisation is key to obtaining good results. We utilised a simple half normal initialisation. Indeed, because the data matrix for each NNMF example satisfies zero is less than or equal to Y is less than or equal to one, we produced the initialisation by drawing W sub zero prime sub I J is distributed according to N of zero comma one and H sub zero prime sub I J is distributed according to N of zero comma one and normalising in the following manner\nxtdb | W sub zero maps to W sub zero prime elementwise absolute value divided by square root of max of elementwise absolute value of W sub zero prime H sub zero prime, H sub zero maps to H sub zero prime elementwise absolute value divided by square root of max of elementwise absolute value of W sub zero prime H sub zero prime, where elementwise absolute value of dot is taken elementwise.
