You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

82ju | In the causal pie model, traits are correlated when they share one or more component cause(s). For instance, in Figure 1, A is a component cause for both sufficient causes I and II, leading to correlation. If one sufficient cause is subject to natural selection, the force of selection extends to all component causes. Some of these compo- nent causes can be component causes also of sufficient causes for neutral traits, leading to selection of. In Figure 1, selection on sufficient causes I and II leads to selection on component causes A E. Sufficient cause III is not selected for (it is in itself a neutral trait). Still, there is selection of sufficient cause III, because there exists selection on all its component causes (B, C, E).
y2qo | Example 4: Trade-offs
1piq | Correlated traits of particular interest are trade-offs (e.g., Stearns 1989; Stearns 1992). For instance, an organism could have to balance the risk of starvation against the risk of being eaten by a predator while foraging. The pre- ferred choice under this trade-off obviously depends on the presence of food versus the presence of predators. To give an example at a molecular level, consider the case in which a higher metabolic rate leads to higher short-term survival, for instance by higher vigilance, but also leads to increased damage accumulation due to oxygen radicals. This trade-off depends on the presence of scavengers for
7fqw | Causal Pies in Ecology and Evolution
rhaz | oxygen radicals and on the vulnerability of the macromol- ecules to oxygen radicals.
wak1 | A component cause has an effect only in the presence of its complementary set. This is true also for component causes that give rise to trade-offs. Therefore, trade-offs depend on the presence or absence of complementary sets. In the first example above, predators and food (comple- mentary component causes) may be distributed probabi- listically over the habitat or over time. As the causal pie model is also probabilistic, it fits the examples above well. The probability distribution of either outcome depends on the probability distributions of the complementary com- ponent causes, which determine the preferred behavior.
wtfz | Trade-offs depend on the presence of complementary component causes. There is selection toward optimal out- comes given the complementary component causes that are present: Evolution will have the tendency to optimize within the limitations of the trade-off. For instance, in the molecular example in the first paragraph of this section, the trade-offs depend on the presence of scavengers for oxygen radicals and on the vulnerability of the macromolecules to oxygen radicals. Given the vulnerability of macromolecules to oxygen radicals, and given a certain concentration of scavengers, evolution will optimize metabolism. At the same time, there is selection on the complementary compo- nent causes: Evolution will have the tendency to push the boundaries of the trade-off, such that the trade-off becomes less restrictive. To stay with the example of oxidative dam- age, evolution will tend toward using less vulnerable mac- romolecules (if possible), and toward increasing scavenging capacity, thus changing the trade-off that it faces.
qy1i | Example 5: The problem with age-specific genes
1k9e | The evolutionary theory of aging is sometimes defined in terms of "age-specific genes", genes that are active at a par- ticular age or during a particular age range and not before or after. The idea is that natural selection acts less forcefully against detrimental genes the later they are expressed (Me- dawar 1952; Williams 1957; Hamilton 1966; Charlesworth 1994). However, age as such causes nothing and cannot activate or deactivate genes (Kirkwood 1977; Kirkwood and Shanley 2010; Wensink 2013). At first sight, a way around this objection is to define a "substance S" (for senescence, deterioration with age), that is not in itself "deleterious in any normal sense" (Dawkins 2006), in line with Williams's genes that "act differently in a different somatic environ- ment" (Williams 1957). Some independent somatic change would trigger the expression of deleterious genes at high ages, thus making them "age-specific".
5bjs | The causal pie model shows that it is not logically correct to say that substance S is not deleterious "in any normal sense". The causal pie is made up of two component causes
uodj | Causal Pies in Ecology and Evolution
k16v | a certain concentration of substance S, and a substance S- sensitive gene which together form a sufficient cause for deterioration and death. Completing the causal pie, sub- stance S is as causal to the detrimental effect as is the sub- stance S-sensitive gene. Without substance S, there would be no senescence, just like without the substance S-sensitive gene, there would be no senescence. As a result, the force of natural selection on deterioration that results from the expression of the deleterious gene extends to both the gene and substance S (Wensink 2013). Theories about age-spe- cific genes are in fact theories about state-specific genes and some state variable, in this case, the concentration of sub- stance S. Both are part of the evolutionary analysis.
b2lm | Partitioning of outcomes
ti7f | Generally speaking, partitions are useful only when they are based on qualities that are mutually exclusive. If this is not the case, something could belong to more than one partition. Because the whole point of partitioning is to divide things up, making partitions based on qualities that are not mutually exclusive should not be attempted, because it will fail.
oksu | In the causal pie model, multiple component causes need to interact for an outcome to occur. It is not useful to partition outcomes as caused by one versus the other component cause, as an outcome could be caused by both component causes at the same time. It can be useful, however, to make a partition between outcomes in which a particular component cause plays a role, versus out- comes in which it does not.
wtow | Example: Extrinsic mortality
o22k | Although they acknowledge a role for vulnerability of an organism to extrinsic threats, Carnes et al. (2006) set out to partition mortality "based on whether the primary cause of death does or does not originate from within the organism". Extrinsic mortality has been invoked at many points in evolution (e.g., Medawar 1952; Williams 1957; Kirkwood 1977; but see Caswell 2007).
nwfz | Mortality, however, is a prime example in biology of interacting component causes, some extrinsic, some intrin- sic to the organism. Therefore, it is not possible to charac- terize mortality either extrinsic or intrinsic. A typical example is predation, where the presence of a predator (component cause 1) interacts with a state of vulnerability of the prey (component cause 2) and an environment that co-determines if prey and predator effectively meet, for instance a quality of vegetation (component cause 3). These three component causes could be partitioned in more detailed component causes if required, such as the cardio- pulmonary capacity or fur color of predator and prey.
