You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

5f7e | On a flight from his home in Missouri to Washington, President Truman described his gut reaction to the news:
h83u | This was not the first occasion when the strong had attacked the weak. I recalled some earlier instances: Manchuria, Ethiopia, Austria. I remembered how each time that the democracies failed to act it had encouraged the aggressors to keep going ahead. Communism was acting in Korea just as Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese had acted ten, fifteen, and twenty years earlier. I felt certain that if South Korea was allowed to fall, Communist leaders would be emboldened to over-ride nations closer to our own shores. If the Communists were permitted to force their way into the Republic of Korea without opposition from the free world, no small nation would have the courage to resist threats and aggression by stronger Communist neighbors. 13
kjoa | Truman's advisers shared a similar mood. Upon arriving in Washington, Truman told secretary of defense Louis Johnson that he was going to "hit them hard." Johnson thanked him "in a voice broken with emotion." Acheson noted in his memoirs that by this stage, he believed that the attack had been instigated by the USSR "and that it would not be stopped by anything short of force."> Indeed, the discussions in the Blair House, which started immediately on Truman's return, reflected a high level of "intra-group solidarity" and "the finest spirit of harmony."" The decision to intervene in the war was taken shortly afterward without any objection.
wb1c | As a result, Janis regarded this decision-making process as a typical case of groupthink. It is important to note, however, that the discussions also lacked professional preparedness and coordination, " certainly the product of the complete surprise. Moreover, experts such as Kennan and the CIA Soviet analysts, who regarded the Kremlin's policy as more cautious, did not participate in the discussions." It is very possible that within this atmosphere of "they shall not pass" that dominated the discussions, their participation would have made no difference. But the atmosphere itself reflected the frustration of being caught unprepared by what seemed to be a clear case of Soviet aggression. 4
ak13 | A timely warning about the North Korean attack could have allowed President Truman to resort to public deterrence. Without it, the US intervention in the war was almost inevitable.
s7el | iii. The personal level
0lfu | Like in the case of Pearl Harbor, in which the blame for the mistaken assessment of the Japanese target was shared by everyone, there was no major individual culprit in the initial Korean failure. Hence, and in contrast to Barbarossa and Yom Kippur, the source of the failure is to be found at the other levels.
cnjl | d. Summary
rtdl | The complete American surprise at the North Korean invasion was the product of two factors. One was the low level of political, military, and intelligence attention that was given to the events in the Korean Peninsula once it was decided that South Korea had no real value for American strategy in the Far East. The other, which derived from the first, was the low level of intelligence collection and analysis concerning North Korea and the Communist bloc. The combination of these two, and the lack of expertise on Korean affairs in the administration, yielded this initial failure.
norp | Case Study II: Failure II: The Chinese Intervention of Fall 1950
chx3 | The North Korean offensive, which started in the early hours of June 25, was highly successful. Within less than three days, the KPA occupied Seoul and by June 30 most of the ROK army was lost. Under these circumstances, the goal of US-UN intervention in the war was defined by Acheson as "solely for the purpose of restoring the Republic of Korea to its status prior to the invasion of the north.""" The intervention by US Eighth Army prevented the complete occupation of South Korea and stabilized the Pusan Perimeter, which made up about 10 percent of the ROK territory.
sfcf | Operation Chromite, the landing at Inchon on September 15, turned the course of the war. Although many experts doubted its feasibility, 4 MacArthur's amphibious landing that combined the principles of surprise and indirect approach was a major operational success. Within two weeks, most of the KPA forces in South Korea disintegrated. X Corps, which landed in Inchon, joined forces with the Eighth Army that broke out of Pusan, and Seoul was recaptured. The main question became whether to exploit this success and cross the 38th parallel in order to unify the Korean Peninsula under a pro-American rule or to avoid making such a move for fear of Chinese or Soviet intervention in the war.
nuxs | The presidential decision-making process that led to the decision to expand the war to North Korea has been the subject of numerous studies that offer many strategic, domestic political, and psychological explanations for this ill-considered decision. The most critical factor in making the decision was the estimate of policymakers and intelligence experts of the likelihood of Soviet or Chinese military response, as was evident in the September 27 presidential directive. It allowed MacArthur to escalate the ground warfare into North Korea, "providing that at the time of such operation there was no entry into North Korea by major Soviet or Chinese Communist forces, no announcements of intended entry, nor a threat to counter our operations militarily."80
umx0 | Although MacArthur later received wider room for maneuverability, the risk of a major confrontation with the Chinese army remained the dominant consideration in the US strategy. One indication of Beijing's intentions was a series of public and diplomatic warnings, which started during the last week of September and threatened intervention if UN forces crossed the 38 parallel. Another indication was accumulating intelligence information about the buildup of PLA forces in Manchuria. Although the massive PLA crossing (about 280,000 soldiers) of the Yalu was missed by the American intelligence community, divisional attacks by the CPVF (Chinese People's Volunteers Force) that started on October 25 and lasted until November 8 constituted undeniable proof of a large-scale Chinese intervention in the war. Nevertheless, MacArthur's G-
o306 | As the discussion below will show, the failure to correctly estimate the magnitude of the Chinese threat in November 1950 had a number of sources. Essentially, however, it was the product of a lack of proper learning from past estimation failures in the war.
qm1b | a. The Chinese road to war
n9ms | The Chinese intervention in the war was the product of a rational decision-making process, which reflected a cautious calculus of military and political considerations. Militarily, the Chinese were well aware of their weaknesses. When making his decision to intervene by the CPVF, Mao wrote to Stalin that the American forces in Korea had over 1,500 guns of 70mm to 240 mm caliber, whereas the CPFV would have only 36 such guns. The American forces, moreover, had a complete control of the air, while the Chinese had just started training their air-force pilots."" The Soviet reluctance to provide the Chinese ground forces with air support almost led Mao to avoid intervention and brought a number of Chinese leaders-including Lin Biau, the foremost field army commander of the Chinese civil war and the natural candidate to head the CFPV-to object to this move.82
icdp | Politically, as Whiting's classic study suggested, the decision to intervene was mainly motivated by the desire to prevent the presence of a strong and determined enemy on China's doorstep. The Chinese leadership regarded a pro-Western unified Korea as the least desired and most dangerous outcome of the war. Mao also considered preserving North Korea as a Socialist state an important factor.35 The UN forces' fast advancement into 4 North Korea was perceived as a direct threat to China itself. Marshal Peng Dehuai, who headed the CPVF and who had participated in the October 2 meeting when Mao made the decision to intervene, gave this fear a vivid expression: "The tiger always wants people, and the time when it wants to eat depends on its appetite. Since America came to invade us, we had to resist its invasion."86
