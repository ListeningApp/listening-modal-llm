Most M L algorithms require high computation power and large volumes of storage capacity to save the logs, results and analysis. In recent years, M L models can be deployed on dedicated graphics processing units and cloud computing platforms such as Amazon E C two, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. The related costs should be considered well in advance before planning an M L-based multi-omics workflow.\nr8sm | Three point five. What algorithm works best for what conditions?\ncuin | The commonly used M L algorithms have different attributes and therefore it is crucial to choose an appropriate algorithm for the multi-omics analysis. In the literature, many reviews cover the key strengths and weaknesses of different M L algorithms using single omics and multi-omics datasets. Most of them use a systematic workflow that involves simultaneous performance evaluation of different algorithms using a common dataset. Since each multi-omics dataset is unique, using a similar workflow could allow the selection of the best-suited algorithm. Later, in Section six a recommendation flowchart is proposed which can help the interdisciplinary user to choose from available methods.\nn1i7 | Recently, various artificial intelligence-driven automated M L platforms and tools have also emerged which can be utilized to exhaustively search for the best M L model and corresponding parameter tuning, however, they are computationally expensive.\n0r5m | Three point six. Translating M L: bench to bedside\nne2o | Various M L-based multi-omics publications have emerged in the past five years and some use performance metrics such as decision curve and calibration analytics to evaluate their diagnostic utility. Still, only very few have been translated into clinical practice, for example, I D x (diabetic retinopathy detection), FerriSmart (measure liver iron concentration) and Subtle M R (image processing software for radiology).\nsqxn | One of the key issues which hinder the clinical deployment of M L methods is transparency and explainability. A transparent and explainable M L algorithm seems essential to building trust for clinical decision making. Recently, the U S Food and Drug Administration has issued the \"Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (A I/M L)-Based Software as a Medical Device Action Plan\" to ensure deployment of M L-based products is safe for patients to better assist the health care providers. A recent in-depth analysis by Muehlematter showed most of the F D A approved and \"Conformité Européenne\" marked M L products are in the field of radiology. It also highlighted the key differences between U S and European policy implications around the approval of A I/M L-based devices.\n6pmo | All the above challenges directly impact the use of M L for multi-omics analysis. However, there are few other challenges related to multi-omics studies which are not M L related such as study design, multi-site sample collection and management, multi-site data sharing and governance, visualization, ethical standards, and finally making the research reproducible and translational. A broader checklist of criteria is investigated by McShane while focusing on various aspects ranging from specimen requirements, predictive model development to clinical trial designing and related regulatory approvals.\n195r | Four. Data integration methods for multi-omics\nkqmi | In recent years, various new data integration methods have been introduced from the modern developments in mathematical, statistical and computational sciences. For the benefit of the readers, Table five includes a summary of a few reviews which cover the breadth of multi-omics integration for generic as well as specialized domains such as oncology and toxicology. Most of these reviews have strived to introduce different categorical terminologies (for example: \"early', 'late' and 'intermediate' or 'bottom-up' and 'top-down') which enable them to group the integration methods based on different factors or parameters.\ng8rd | As mentioned earlier, this section adopts the categorical terminologies from Ritchie and builds upon it to summarize a complete spectrum of recent integration methods. It concisely covers them giving a clear perspective to a new interdisciplinary user. The various integration methods are classed as either 'concatenation-', 'model-' or 'transformation'-based and described below in detail.\nnns9 | Four point one. Concatenation-based integration methods\n9uwy | Concatenation-based integration methods consider developing a model using a joint data matrix which is formed by combining multiple omics datasets. Fig. two shows the stages of concatenation-based integration. Stage one includes the raw data from three individual omics (e.g. genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) along with the corresponding phenotypic information. Commonly, concatenation-based integration does not require any pre-processing and hence does not have a Stage two. In Stage three, the data from the individual omics is concatenated to form a single large\nsrly | matrix of multi-omics data. Finally, in Stage four the joint matrix is used for supervised or unsupervised analysis. The main advantage of using concatenation-based methods is the simplicity of employing M L for analyzing continuous or categorical data, once the concatenation of all individual omics is completed. These methods use all the concatenated features equally and can select the most discriminating features for a given phenotype.\ndl6i | The different concatenation-based integration methods can be further classed as:\n89ub | Four point one point one. Supervised learning concatenation-based methods\ndhle | Different concatenation-based supervised learning methods have been used for phenotypic prediction. In scenarios where the number of features in the joint matrix is higher, different feature selection methods described in Section three can be employed during concatenation.\n```",
