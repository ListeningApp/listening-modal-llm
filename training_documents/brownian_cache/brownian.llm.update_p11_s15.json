The W F R version of one hundred five reads:\nhkd8 | zeta sub comma chi dot chi times negative partial sub chi V sub k equals zero divided by zeta sub comma chi squared partial sub chi chi squared V sub k equals zero minus zeta comma chi chi divided by zeta sub comma chi partial sub chi V sub k equals zero equals zero.\nsptg | where partial sub x zeta and partial sub chi squared zeta are also evaluated at k equals zero. Both of these second order differential equations can actually be reduced to a first order differential equation like so:\n2k40 | dot chi equals negative V sub comma chi of chi.\nkrk7 | where we have introduced the effective dynamical potential V tilde defined by\n4tyc | V tilde sub comma chi of chi equivalent to a piecewise function: V sub comma chi of k equals zero, chi for L P A or V sub comma chi of k equals zero, chi divided by zeta sub comma chi squared of k equals zero, chi for W F R.\n2mjl | Here we can clearly see that for L P A the effective and effective dynamical potentials are equivalent whereas W F R provides an additional factor for the latter.\n6d9q | Equation one hundred eight tells us that the equation of motion for the average position chi is an extremely simple first order differential equation that appears like a Langevin equation with no noise. This means that once you have obtained the effective dynamical potential you can compute the evolution of the average position chi trivially from any starting position.\nwsc1 | At equilibrium the average position of the particle should not change, this means that dot chi equals zero. It naturally follows from this condition and the E E O M for x one zero eight that equilibrium is defined for both L P A and W F R by the condition\nor3l | partial sub chi V sub k equals zero of chi sub e q equals zero.\nfbyc | As the potential V sub k equals zero of chi should be convex by definition equation one twenty-seven tells us that chi sub e q corresponds to the minimum of V sub k equals zero of chi. Or more concretely:\nvceo | limit as t approaches infinity of the expectation of x of t equals x that minimizes V sub k equals zero of x.\nkd78 | The equilibrium position is obviously the same for both L P A and W F R as they both lead to the same effective potential. As the equilibrium position is straightforwardly computed from the Boltzmann distribution verifying that the minimum of the effective potential matches the predicted equilibrium position is a good first test for the numerical solution of V sub k equals zero of x, at least close to its minimum.\n896u | B.
