You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

yeoh | bodies of social benefits and the PES, which was a major shock in the Dutch corporatist landscape. The former governing role of the social partners in social benefits was moved to a national state agency (UWV) and their major role in the PES board was 'replaced' by an advisory body (the Council for Work and Income, 2002-2012). In 2013, the social partners reached a so called "social agreement" with the government, including a Jobs Agreement for people with (physical/mental) disabilities. In 2015, this led to a certain return of social partners in the governance of the Dutch welfare administration, as members of the Central and Regional Work Chambers of the 35 Dutch labour market regions. Despite this role, their current position is much less direct and powerful than it was before 2002.
b8hf | In short, divergence between current systems is expressed for both 'levels' and 'stakeholders'. Compared to the Netherlands, the Norwegian system has a much stronger degree of (compulsory) cooperation between the state and the municipalities (levels). However, the role of the social partners in the governance of the activation policy is stronger in the Netherlands. Clients are represented in advisory bodies in both countries, without a direct governing role.
hntf | Discussion
99fo | In this paper we analysed whether reform trajectories in two welfare administrations reflect NPM and NPG ideas, and how the relationships between levels of government and between public and private stakeholders evolved into the current design of the welfare administrations. Three main lessons about convergence and divergence can be learned from our longitudinal study.
y5r7 | Growing convergence and hybridity in reform
lrry | We have seen more convergence in reform paths lately but after an equally long period of strong divergence. In the first decade since 1990, both countries changed their welfare administration
hvhm | 19
863b | twice, and both times in different directions; we call this a 'double divergence' (over time and between nations). While Champion and Bonoli (2011) perceived the NAV and SUWI reform as having similar characteristics, our findings suggest they represent different governance models: NPG ideas were prominent in the original 2006 NAV reform (Breit et al. 2022), and NPM ideas are clearly reflected in the 2002 SUWI reform (Van Gestel and Herbillon 2007). Lately we saw more convergence in reform trajectories: a joint adoption of NPM in both countries (2008-2014) and a shared resurgence of NPG ideas (since 2015), in line with the broader international trend towards decentralization and collaborative services (Finn et al. 2019). Recently both countries have again made efforts towards greater standardization and efficiency (NPM). Although there seems increasing convergence in reforms between the two countries, it is early to say whether it will persist, as the period of (more) convergence lasts about as long as the previous divergent reforms.
fj24 | Related to the many shifts in governance since 1990, both countries have developed more hybrid and complex systems over time. Alternating NPM and post-NPM, all reforms criticized the previously dominant organization of the welfare state according to traditional hierarchy and functional differentiation. But despite their often radical character, reforms did not completely replace previous models (see also, Christensen et al. 2009; Fossestøl et al. 2015; Greve et al. 2016; Lægreid and Rykkja 2015). Although hybridity with coexisting, overlapping and partly competing elements can be viewed "the rule rather than the exception of the new modes of governance currently being practiced in the provision of social services" (Van Berkel and Borghi 2007, p.283), so far the frequent reforms do not indicate that the different principles of TPA, NPM and NPG are well aligned. At least more balanced combinations of public management models appear necessary to prevent hybridity in a form of barely cohesive layers. Divergence between nations and policy fields
uz3c | 20
d5bi | A second lesson is that increasing convergence in reform paths does not necessarily imply more similar welfare administrations (see also, Christensen et al. 2009). On the contrary, despite greater convergence in reforms since 2008, the present welfare administrations in Norway and the Netherlands are more different than alike (see Tables 3 and 4). Norway and the Netherlands thus proved to be two cases that can illustrate how a common 'activation' policy has led to significantly different welfare administrations.
ba4l | Divergence usually points to the need for contextualized research as it is expected that the new welfare administrations take on a specific form due to different (national) socio-economic, institutional and political contexts (Pollitt and Bouckaert 2017; Van Berkel and Borghi 2007). For example, Christensen et al. (2009, p. 1003) found "a strong element of path dependence in the reform trajectories" in a comparison of Germany, the UK and Norway. Champion and Bonoli (2011, p.330) described the impact of path dependence as "once a country has started down a path, it becomes increasingly difficult and costly to completely depart from it", given increasing returns on prior investments. Contrasting, in our study path dependency does not seem an obvious explanation for the different reform paths and their impact on welfare administrations. After all, path dependence would imply that the initial path is reproduced in both countries, which is very different from the radical shifts we found over the past 30 years, most prominently in NAV and SUWI.
ffx8 | Also, it has been debated if economic crises and 'activation policies' have triggered similar reform trends across countries (Hemerijck et al. 2012; OECD 1995). For example, the economic crisis since 2008 (with the government in a strong role for saving banks) could easily be viewed an important driver of common NPM-type interventions for efficiency gains in welfare administrations (Hemerijck et al. 2012). It is tempting to link such an explanation e.g. to NAV's return of the benefit administration to the central level (2008) and SUWI's merger of UWV and CWI (2009). But economic crises may also be a welcome excuse for national governments
s6su | 21
y219 | rather than a driver for administrative reform - as the said shifts in NAV and SUWI were already planned in 2006 and 2007, before the banks in 2008 erupted. So we should be careful to give too much explanatory power to common economic pressures.
06ht | To better understand governance/organizational reforms and hybrid shifts in governance regimes, we may need to delve deeper into the specificity of the policy field in which these shifts are taking place (see also Greve et al. 2016). Our study highlights important differences between the subfields in the welfare administrations. For example, there appears to be growing scope for decentralized actors and organizations in the PES, but the benefit administration shows an opposite trend towards (more) centralization. This might be related to the specific tasks and risks in national social insurance where decentralization could be less effective for large, automated systems and increase the risk of error. Conversely, the services provided by PES are closely tied to the local/regional labour market, and require cooperation with third parties and beyond professional borders to be effective, so here decentralization is a recurrent trend.
v3r2 | Our study also found a certain order in the reforms of the different areas of welfare administration over time that may help explain divergence and convergence. In both countries reforms started in the 1990s with PES - a relatively small field compared to the social benefits administration in terms of public finance, vested interests of social partners, and employee numbers - , and in the 2000s reforms were expanded to the much larger field of social benefits. Despite the fact that we observed divergence between the leading public management models in the reforms in both countries, we view convergence in a similar attempt to enlarge the initial reform area of PES to the large field of social benefits in establishing a much wider reform (NAV and SUWI). Viewed in this way, there is divergence in reform trends between the two countries in terms of dominant NPG or NPM ideas, but convergence in increasingly comprehensive reform.
nv42 | Governance levels and relationships between stakeholders
xags | A third lesson is that the (political) preference for central or decentral governance and for involving parties other than the government in the welfare administration can rapidly change. Norway has been described as social democratic (Christensen et al. 2009) and the Netherlands as corporatist (Van Berkel 2009), each with a tradition of strong relations with interest groups, social partners and civil society organizations. Both countries have then moved to coordination by 'market' and 'management' within a wider frame of state hierarchy and with a less crucial role of social partners in the welfare administration. However, we also saw divergence, especially in the past decade, that led to a certain "revival" of social partnership in the Netherlands, but not so much in Norway. This divergence needs more investigation. More broadly, we may ask is the reduced role of social partners over the past decades merely an effect of a political preference for 'more state' and/or 'more market', or is it the specific position of social partners in relationship with other policy areas or issues (e.g. pensions), that can explain differences between countries?
jc47 | Critical doubts may also arise about reform trends that are often taken for granted in many policy studies, e.g. decentralization, outsourcing or client orientation. For example, Weishaupt (2011) suggested decentralization could also be viewed as a process of recentralization where regional and local authorities are used as transmitters of national policy. Our study notices a common trend in Norway and the Netherlands where regional offices (from NAV, UWV), and also municipalities and regional networks (e.g. the Dutch Regional Work Chambers) receive cumulative responsibilities, but at the same time operate under more central regulation and demands for efficiency. Our paper also pointed to the complexity associated with decentralization, where (smaller) municipalities have to scale up through mergers, joint intermunicipal social services or outsourcing to private and/or non-profit organisations (see also, Rice 2012).
ko3c | Moreover, welfare administrations are coordinated in a multi-level environment (Lægreid and Rykkja 2015), where not only PES, social benefits and social assistance are involved, but also other policy areas (e.g. health, education). Especially in the NPG reforms, more and more actors are involved within the various administrative levels that have different views on the service provision and the organizational and administrative principles (Van Gestel and Grotenbreg 2019). More research is needed of this wider policy context and organizations, in light of the importance of optimizing welfare administrations and the ongoing struggle between central and regional needs and related stakeholders to influence social and labour market policies.
xek3 | Conclusions
bbpr | In this paper, Norway and the Netherlands have been used as critical cases to analyse convergence and divergence in reform efforts and their impact on the current welfare administrations. The two countries represent a general trend to change the labour market and social security system towards more "active" welfare states, to improve service coordination and responsiveness to client needs, and increase efficiency and innovation in service delivery (Bonoli 2011; Van Berkel 2009). Their successive changes in social security and the promotion of paid work, as well as reforms in structure and coordination, such as the introduction of marketization in PES or the establishment of one stop-shops, reflect a broader international modernization trend visible in many OECD countries (Considine and Lewis 2012; Finn et al. 2019; Fuertes et al. 2014; Jantz et al. 2015; Knuth and Larsen 2010). We found that both countries significantly reformed their systems for welfare and employment services, using elements of NPM and post-NPM models, first moving in divergent ways and later showing more convergence in reform paths. However, although the welfare administrations in both countries significantly changed with increasingly similar types of reform, their current characteristics are more different than alike.
5zyf | One conclusion is that a theory of public sector reform that aims to capture the role of NPM and NPG ideas in new welfare state arrangements should encompass the wider institutional context. Such a theory should go beyond the assumptions of the public management models and allow more room for explanations that take into account the (social, historic and economic) environment in which those reforms take place (Barbier 2015; Lægreid and Rykkja 2015; Lepuante and Van der Walle 2020). However, as demonstrated by the radical reforms in both countries, path dependency did not explain divergence in our cases. Also the wider economic environment and economic crises did not fully explain divergence or convergence in reform. In has been noted that there is no clear explanation for variation in administrative reforms and their effects (Pollitt and Bouckaert 2017; Christensen and Lægreid 2012) and there are still many differences in Europe when it comes to administrative reform. However, these are influenced not only by national institutions, but also by other institutional characteristics, "such as differences between ministries and agencies, policy areas, degree of autonomy and size of the organization" (Greve et al. 2016). Rather than the usual focus on high-level institutional context factors (Christensen et al. 2009; Pollitt and Bouckaert 2017; Weishaupt 2011), we suggest to dive more deeply in the (political) decision-making process, and the relationships between different policy fields, levels and stakeholders in understanding reform.
9own | Another conclusion is that a long-term research perspective is crucial to understand the complex interplay between NPM and NPG ideas and wider context factors as drivers of reform (see also Considine and Lewis 2012; Jantz et al. 2015; Knuth and Larsen 2015). When studying characteristics of welfare administrations over relatively short periods, findings may only reflect a "temporary truth" (Van Gestel and Hillebrand 2011). For example, comparing Norway and the Netherlands in the 1990s and early 2000s would have stressed their most different pathways of change rather than the later convergence. Also, certain stakeholders can take on different roles over time. For example, the social partners are more important in the past and

wwdt | present Dutch welfare administration compared to Norway, but studying their role exclusively between 2000 and 2013/2015 would have shown that the social partners were virtually absent in the Dutch welfare administration (except pension fund boards). These are important arguments for longitudinal studies to draw more balanced conclusions about public sector reform.
mn1r | Our study also raises some further questions for future research. For example, in 2015, well after the crisis of 2008, a reform followed in both countries with a 'revival' of NPG ideas and a focus on decentralization. This raises the question of whether NPG-type reforms are contingent on relatively favourable economic conditions? Another fundamental issue is how different NPG reforms actually are from TPA and NPM? As Lapuente and Van der Walle (2020) argued: "Post-NPM represents a reassertion of old public administration values as well an attempt to remedy some of the disintegrating tendencies associated with NPM, and not an abandonment of NPM reforms." (p.463). Other scholars have theoretically questioned if the models are internally consistent: NPM has at least two faces: market and management (Pollitt and Dan 2011; Mongkol, 2011); and also NPG would have many meanings (Reiter and Klenk 2019; Lapuente and Van der Walle 2020). However, we have shown in this paper that despite internal variety, the NPM and NPG models can be used to uncover convergence and divergence in reform characteristics and their impact on welfare administrations over time.
