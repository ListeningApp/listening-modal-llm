You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1k9e | "As we learned more, the meaning of the question continued to evolve. We asked our- selves, "How can we go out and plant this seed? How do we frame it as we bring other people into the conversation?" The question always worked in stimulating the dialogue. Sometimes as leaders it's important not to col- lectively work on what the answer is but to work on what the question is. That was a big insight for me as we did this work. The ques- tion never failed us."
5bjs | Improving Questions at Pfizer. In another recent case, professionals at Pfizer, the world- renowned pharmaceutical firm, are experimenting with a systematic method of improving the quality of their questions. Through a custom-designed workshop, marketing and finance professionals in Pfizer's European business unit have been learning to articulate powerful questions. These executives have discovered that meetings have more energy and creative ideas flow more quickly when they place attention on for- mulating catalytic questions. With this discipline in place, new ideas are more easily finding their way into key products and services.

k16v | From these examples, it's clear that improving the quality of the questions you ask and creating a frame- work of engagement that encourages their explo- ration can create business value. Because learning to engage thoughtful questions can lead to insight, inno- vation, and action, doing so will become an essential strategic capability for leaders of organizations who want to create sus- tainable results in the face of both short- and longer-term challenges and opportunities.
b2lm | Fostering Strategic Inquiry
ti7f | Beyond building the capacity of individ- ual employees to ask powerful ques- tions, an organization can design processes that use such queries to enhance the emergence of knowledge creation and strategic thinking. As the chairman and CEO of a major multina- tional corporation says, "Discovering strategic questions is like panning for gold. You have to care about finding it, you have to be curious, and you have to create an anticipation of discovering gold, even though none of us may know ahead of time where we'll find it. You head toward the general territory where you think the gold may be located, with your best tools, your experience, and your instincts. And then you begin a disciplined search for the gold."We've partnered with this leader to create a set of tools for fostering strategic inquiry and working with powerful questions in the service of positive futures called the "Game Plan" process. The following steps may not apply to all situations and they may not always play out in the same sequence. However, the Game Plan sug- gests ways that organizations can create both formal and informal processes to support individuals as well as teams in discovering the "gold" for themselves.
oksu | The Game Plan Process
wtow | The steps in the Game Plan can be used both as a process discipline by individuals looking at a particular situation, as well as by functional and cross-functional groups and leadership teams charged with the responsibility for key decisions regarding future courses of action. The Game Plan can also involve diverse stakeholders to provide important perspec- tives both on the current situation and on possible future actions.
o22k | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
nwfz | Assess Your Current Situation. Get a feel for the larger context in which you are operating. Scan the internal and external business and organizational envi- ronments that may affect the future of the system or project you are working with. This situation analysis might include the assessment of critical results data, meetings with key stakeholders, and the mapping of your strengths, opportunities, and threats. It might also involve looking for "signals"-inter- nal and external events, develop- ments, and trends that can affect the future of your situation. Like trackers in the mountains, look for both obvi- ous and subtle indicators that point to storms as well as sunny skies. Allow your curiosity and imagination to take the lead as you begin to iden- tify the many questions that the broader landscape within which you're operating reveals.
nvfy | "STRATEGIC QUESTIONS CREATE A RESONANT FIELD INTO WHICH YOUR OWN THINKING IS MAGNIFIED, CLARIFIED, AND NEW MOTION CAN BE CREATED."
mror | It will be challenging, but important, to frame your findings as questions rather than as problems or concerns-questions that end with a question mark, not with a period or an exclamation point. To help in designing these queries, ask yourself, "How does A affect C and what questions does that suggest? If X were at play here, what question would we be asking? What's the real question underneath all this data?"
zlxc | Discover the "Big Questions." Once you think you've posed most of the relevant questions (and there may be many of them), look for patterns and themes. This is not a mechanical process, even though it should be disciplined and systematic. You are on a treasure hunt, seeking the core questions-usually three to five-that, if answered, would make the most difference to the future of the project or situation you are exploring. Cluster related questions, and consider
k0bw | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
aq5a | the relationships among them. Begin to clarify the "big questions" that the initial clusters reveal. Frame these as clear and concise queries, not as problems. Something fundamental changes when people begin to ask questions together-they go beyond the nor- mal stale debate about problems that passes for strat- egy in many organizations.
sc5y | Create Images of Possibility. Ask yourself, "What would our situation look like or be like if the 'big questions' were answered?" Creating vivid images of possibility differs from pie-in-the-sky visioning, especially if people with a variety of perspectives have participated in the earlier stages of your analysis. This part of the conversation can also provide clues for refining or reframing your big questions as well as inventing creative strategies. Developing scenarios- stories of the future based on different ways your big questions might be answered-can also be useful. These often reveal new territory and opportunities for action that are grounded in real life.
0yab | Evolve Workable Strategies. Workable strategies begin to emerge in response to compelling questions and to the images of possibility that these questions evoke. In a sense, such strategies are the "big answers"-the key initiatives you invent to address your "big ques- tions." Once you clarify key initia- tives, you can formulate and imple- ment specific action plans.
w95z | Of course, the cycle is never complete. You need continuous "sensing" based on relevant business and organizational data, ongoing conversations with internal and external stakeholders, informal conversations among employees, and feedback from the organizational environment. This input enables you to continually reassess the landscape you're operating in-revealing new questions for exploration.
0i1k | The innovative leader with whom we developed the Game Plan process has shared this tool with the entire organization. People from throughout the com- pany have found that it provides a way to discover questions that matter to the future of individual units and to the firm as a whole. The company has also used the Game Plan as part of refining the corporation's

p6pq | To what degree do leaders in your organization foster an environment in which discovering the "big questions" is encouraged as much as coming up with workable solutions?
zse6 | Does your organization have rewards or incentives for members to work across functional boundaries to find challenging questions that create common focus and forward movement for knowledge creation?
p2n3 | Do your leadership development programs contain as much of a focus on the art and architecture of framing powerful questions as they do on tech- niques for solving problems?
ohh7 | Do your organization's strategic planning processes include structured ways to discover the "big questions" that, if answered, would have real strategic leverage?
vbni | What enabling tools or technologies does your organization employ to "seed" itself with strategic questions that "travel well" and catalyze learning conversations both within and across functions?

By moving from a problem orien- tation toward a more rigorous and disciplined focus on essential questions, the organization is slowly shifting from a "fix-it" mode to an inquiry model for business and organizational strategy evolution.This company has found that maintaining a rigorous focus on "questions that matter" and hosting strategic conversations on the organization's "big questions" is a core competence for leaders at all levels.

877u | How Can Leaders Engage Powerful Questions?
rzhj | For all organizations, in today's turbulent times, engag- ing people's best thinking about complex issues with- out easy answers will be the key to creating the futures we want rather than being forced to live with the futures we get. Leaders will need to develop capacity in the design of "inquiring systems" in order to learn, adapt, and create new knowledge to meet emerging opportunities and challenges in the more fluid organi- zational structures of the future. For example, the lead- ership challenges of the next 20 years are likely to revolve around the art of engaging and energizing net- works rather than solely managing hierarchies as in the past. Successful leaders will be those who see organiza- tions as living networks of conversation and collective meaning-making through which members create new knowledge and bring forth the future. They will under- stand how to operate in networks that are both internal and external to their organization.
bfax | In particular, we believe the following core capa- bilities, rarely taught in today's MBA or corporate lead- ership programs, will help define leadership excel- lence in a networked world where knowledge and learning are keys to success:
f2y8 | Engaging Strategic Questions. How many lead- ers today know how to frame strategic questions that open the space for thinking about possibilities rather than solving problems? How many leaders are com- fortable with not knowing and can constructively help others bring forth their collective knowledge? How many leaders can engage their workers in dis- covering the "big questions" that lie at the heart of their organization's future?
o7qm | In a volatile and uncertain environment, one of the strongest steps leaders can take is to assist their organ- izations in discovering the right questions at the right time. One of their key responsibilities is creating infra- structures for dialogue and engagement that encourage others at all levels to develop insightful questions and to search for innovative paths forward. Leaders also need to consider reward systems that provide incen- tives for members to work across organizational bound- aries to discover those challenging lines of inquiry that create common focus and new knowledge.
d52l | Convening and Hosting Learning Conver- sations. A core aspect of the leader's new work involves creating multiple opportunities for learning conversations around challenging questions.
qlbb | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
nhsg | However, authentic conversation is less likely to occur in a climate of fear, mistrust, and hierarchical control. When the human mind and heart are fully engaged in authentic conversation and listening for core ques- tions, new knowledge often begins to surface. Thus, the ability to facilitate working conversations that enhance trust and reduce fear is an important leader- ship capability.
hy0l | To succeed in this pursuit, it's essential for leaders to strengthen their skills in the use of dialogue and other engagement approaches that deepen mutual inquiry and foster collective intelligence. These capa- bilities include:
4jmz | · Creating a climate of discovery
b7cq | · Suspending premature judgment
0b39 | · Exploring underlying assumptions and beliefs
qecd | · Listening for connections between ideas
1o7p | · Encouraging diverse perspectives
cp13 | • Honoring everyone's contributions
bgre | · Articulating shared understanding
57lp | • Harvesting and sharing collective discoveries
ukth | These skills are especially important in situations in which there are no simple answers and finding cre- ative paths forward can make a positive difference.
kpvt | Including Diverse Perspectives. Leaders must become connectors-of both people and ideas. Diverse voices and new perspectives that aren't limited by traditional boundaries of function, hierarchy, discipline, technology, tenure, and geograph- ic region play an increasingly important role in a company's strategizing.As Gary Hamel of the London School of Economics points out, "Strategizing depends on creating a rich and complex web of conversations that cuts across previously isolated pockets of knowl- edge and creates new and unexpected combinations of insight."
jie2 | "A QUESTION NOT ASKED IS A DOOR NOT OPENED."
d0ik | The connections among these diverse voices and perspectives allow employees to fruitfully explore critical strategic questions. Building and encouraging personal relationships through networks of collabora- tive conversations across traditional boundaries helps critical strategic questions travel well. In this way, workers enhance their collective intelligence and their capacity to nurture creative futures together.
0x0s | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
4exe | Supporting Appreciative Inquiry. Opening spaces of possibility in our organizations requires a shift in leadership orientation from focusing primari- ly on what is not working and how to fix it, to also dis- covering and appreciating what is working and how to leverage it. Appreciative Inquiry (AI), developed by David Cooperrider and his colleagues at Case Western University, is a process for leveraging emerging possi- bilities rather than just fixing past mistakes. When used in a disciplined way, this kind of inquiry stimu- lates lively conversations that use the best of what is as the foundation for what might be.
0myz | Leaders who ask, "What's possible here and who cares?" have a much easier time gaining the coopera- tion and best thinking of their constituents than those who ask, "What's wrong here and who is to blame?" In assessing the results of more than a decade of research and practice in the area of Appreciative Inquiry, Cooperrider has stated unequivocal- ly that "the most important insight we have learned with AI to date is that human systems grow toward what they persistently ask questions about." By asking positive questions, organizations have the opportunity to grow in new directions and tap innovative sources of knowledge, vitality, and energy.
xh3i | Fostering Shared Meaning. We make meaning of our experiences through stories, images, and metaphors. To tap into this pool of shared meaning, which is the ground from which both powerful ques- tions and innovative solutions emerge, network leaders need to put time and attention into framing common language and developing shared images and metaphors. They can do so by constructing compelling scenarios- stories of the future-that provide a context for work- ing on today's "big questions," as in the case of the Game Plan process described earlier. In addition, leaders must
