You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

1mvw | crucially, Patel's assertion to Breitbart seemed to preview Trump's own approach to the case: In August, shortly after federal investigators executed a search on Mar-a-Lago, Trump's office claimed that, as president, he had a standing order that any materials moved from the Oval Office to Mar-a-Lago were considered declassified. It did not appear to bother Patel that numerous Trump officials flatly denied the existence of such an order.
6d4s | That October, the far-right personality Benny Johnson asked Patel on his podcast how he would respond if Trump offered him the job of FBI director in a second term. Patel leaned back, laughed, and waved off the question, but a minute later he decided to chime in after all. "Yes, to answer your question, of course," he said. "Who would turn that down?" Some in Trump's orbit acknowledge that Senate confirmation is unlikely for Patel-that if he were to lead an agency, it would probably be in an acting capacity. On a podcast in November 2023, Donald Trump Jr. floated the idea of installing Patel as an "interim" attorney general at the outset "just to send that shot across the bow of the swamp."
mqah | "A lot of people say he's crazy," Trump once said of Patel, according to a longtime Trump adviser. "But sometimes you need a little crazy."
xxr8 | Such is the present dynamic of Kash Patel's life: marketing "Orange Man Bad" Punisher-skull license plates and dubious supplements while fielding questions about which major national-security or law-enforcement agency he might soon like to run. "Kash, I know you're probably going to be head of the CIA," Steve Bannon said on his podcast, War Room, this past December. "But do you believe that you can deliver the goods on this in pretty short order, the first couple of months, so we can get rolling on prosecutions?"
rl4j | Bannon was talking here about "receipts," the supposedly incriminating documents and emails that a second Trump administration would use to bring cases against deep- state dwellers and members of the press. Patel expressed no doubt about his capacity to deliver the goods. "We will go out and find the conspirators, not just in government but in the media," he said. "Yes, we're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections-we're going to come after you."
vz32 | "A lot of people say he's crazy," Trump once said of Patel, according to the longtime adviser. "I think he's kind of crazy. But sometimes you need a little crazy."
ncb0 | I T WAS ONLY a matter of time before they found each other, is how Patel seemed to see it. Just a "couple of guys from Queens," he has said, trying to synonymize his brand with Trump's home borough, and the scrappy knuckle-crack caricature that comes with it. In Government Gangsters, Patel reminds readers of this piece of shared heritage four times.
8mp0 | Perhaps it makes sense, then, to go back to the beginning, to the affluent Nassau County village of Garden City, New York, where Kashyap Patel was actually born and raised. Just north of the Garden City Golf Club, one finds the charming corner-lot home to which he returned after school and football practice and hockey games and occasionally, yes, a father-son jaunt for butter chicken about an hour away in Queens. Just a guy from Garden City-it's true; it doesn't quite sing.
xjyk | Patel, who is of Gujarati ancestry, has said that his parents both grew up in East Africa; in the 1970s, his father, Pramod, fled the despotic regime of Idi Amin in Uganda. The young couple immigrated to the United States and settled on Long Island. Children soon followed. Their first chapter in America began in close quarters, according to Patel, with his family and Pramod's eight siblings all sharing the same home.
mt0f | Before long, Patel writes in his book, his family gained access to the thrills of "milquetoast Americana"-New York Islanders hockey games, annual sojourns to Disney World. It was the Reagan era, and in 1988, Patel's parents registered to vote for the first time in the U.S., as Republicans. But their conservatism, according to Patel, was "dispositional"-they valued hard work, fairness, personal responsibility. American opportunity, meanwhile, arrived just as advertised: Pramod ultimately became CFO at a global distributor of aircraft bearings.
awab | Patel was raised Hindu, the family going to temple together and praying in their shrine room at home. It's difficult to envision many neighbors joining them. Of the roughly 22,000 residents recorded in Garden City in the 1990 census, 96 percent were white. Four years later, when Patel began his freshman year at Garden City High School, he was one of only a handful of people of color in his class.
ixcc | His senior-yearbook quote came from the Jewish theologian Abraham Joshua Heschel: "Racism is man's gravest threat-the maximum of hatred for a minimum reason."
8p6h | I N GARDEN CITY, Patel caddied for "very wealthy" and "important" New Yorkers at the local country club, some of them defense attorneys, he writes in Government Gangsters; as they played, he listened to their stories about the drama of court. "I could be a first-generation immigrant lawyer at a white shoe firm making a ton of money," Patel thought. After he graduated from the University of Richmond and then Pace University's law school, however, his dreams of Big Law and high retainers were complicated when, by his account, no firm would hire him.
pmgl | On the advice of a friend, he sent an application to the Miami-Dade County public defender's office in Florida, considered one of the best state defender's offices in the country. Many of the people I spoke with for this story were quick to highlight his time as a public defender-how incongruous it seems in the context of the revenge- driven exploits that now appear to consume him. Public records show that Patel moved into a condo in a new building in Coral Gables, which his parents bought in the summer of 2005. "He just was a normal, good lawyer; did a good job, never stood out," recalled Bennett Brummer, who was the Miami-Dade elected public defender
90no | for 32 years. Patel writes that, by this time, he was shifting "more and more to the right." But even if he struck his colleagues as a little more conservative than the norm, as Todd Michaels, who was an attorney in the Miami-Dade office, put it to me, he was not overtly partisan.
jt0y | State court was well suited to Patel's strengths as an attorney, his former colleagues told me. He was personable and quick on his feet, and adept at "marketing" and "presenting" himself. After a few years, however, Patel moved to the federal public defender's office in Miami. There, the work was more complex, more writing- and research-intensive. Despite some successes, he developed a reputation for "style over substance," a former colleague said-one he seemed aware of but not terribly motivated to change. "He always was like, 'Look, I'm really good at trial skill. But all of this reading and writing and arguing about, like, the intricacies of the law-I'm not really interested,'" a second former colleague recalled. (Patel disputed this characterization, referring to a complex drug-trafficking case he'd handled.)
qb7o | "I'm not saying he wasn't capable of it," this person added. "But I think he always liked being the face."
oae5 | Patel seemed caught between a brewing resentment of elites and an abiding desire to be seen as one.
