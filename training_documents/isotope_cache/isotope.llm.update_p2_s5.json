        "content": "y5r7 | Both the chemistry involved in the decay of compound Q and the proposed formation of an intermediate substrate radical can be investigated through the use of isotopically labeled methane. If we are correct in our proposals that the substrate oxidation chemistry of MMO occurs during com- pound Q decay, and that this chemistry involves complete\nlrry | substrate C-H bond cleavage, then a substantial primary kinetic isotope effect in the decay of compound Q should result from deuteration of the methane. In contrast, the concerted reactions proposed in many of the other postulated mechanisms for MMO would not be expected to exhibit large primary KIEs. We demonstrate here that the oxidation of methane does show a large primary isotope effect. Indeed, the KIE is possibly the largest observed for any biological system reported to date, consistent with the hydrogen-atom abstraction mechanism for MMO.\nhvhm | EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\n863b | Enzyme Preparation, Characterization, and Assay. Bacte- rial growth and purification of MMO from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, as well as enzyme activity assays, were as reported previously. MMOH exhibited specific activity in the range of six hundred to eight hundred nmol per minute per mg for furan turnover. The temperature for assays was twenty-three degrees Celsius, except in cases where a direct comparison with transient kinetic data was required. In these cases, the temperature was four degrees Celsius. The buffer for all experiments was one hundred mM MOPS, pH seven point seven.\nfj24 | Chemicals and Standard Procedures. All reagents were the highest grade available and were obtained from Sigma, Aldrich, or EM Scientific. Deuterated gases were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Labs or ICON, and each was shown to be a single isotopic homolog (greater than ninety-nine percent) by mass spectrometric analysis. Water was deionized and glass distilled. Anaerobic techniques have been described previously.\nuz3c | Stopped-Flow Absorption Spectroscopy Experiments. MMOH (sixty micromolar, one hundred twenty micromolar active sites) and methyl viologen (ten micromolar) were made anaerobic in one hundred mM MOPS, pH seven point seven. Sodium dithionite was added stoichiometrically (two mol of reducing equivalents per mol of active sites) to reduce MMOH. MMOB was added anaerobically to a final concentration of one hundred twenty micromolar. The enzyme solution was then loaded anaerobically into one stopped-flow syringe. The other stopped-flow syringe was loaded with oxygen-saturated buffer, with or without substrate. GC analysis of CH4- or CD4-saturated buffer or water at twenty-three degrees Celsius showed the same dissolved methane concentration in all cases within experimental error. The concentration of a saturated solution was one point five mM. Single-turnover reactions by MMOH (four degrees Celsius) were followed by using a single-wavelength stopped-flow apparatus at four hundred thirty nm.\nd5bi | Data Analysis and Simulation. The data were analyzed by using a nonlinear regression fitting program (KFIT, obtained from N. Millar, Kings College) to determine the formation and decay rates as previously described. The slope of a plot of the observed rate constant versus substrate concentration is the second-order rate constant for the reaction. The ratio of the second-order rate constants for the reaction conducted with protiated and deuterated substrates gives the KIE. The data were analyzed as a straight line because, for methane and six other substrates examined, the compound Q decay rate is best fit as a linear function of substrate concentration. Over a much wider concentration range, the data may conform to the usual hyperbolic function; however, low solubility of substrates, and the steady decrease in the maximum amount of compound Q that can be observed as the decay rate increases, prevents examination of the kinetics at such high concentra-\nba4l | tions. The data shown for compound Q kinetics with each of the five different isotopic homologs were obtained by measuring the rates of formation and decay of compound Q with at least five repetitions at each of four different methane concentrations. This entire procedure was repeated two to five times for each isotopic homolog.\nffx8 | The simulated curves shown in Figure three were calculated by assuming the rate of oxidation of a C-H bond in CH4 to be equal to three point nine per second, which is equal to twenty-five percent of the overall rate of reaction of CH4. The calculated rate for compound Q decay in the presence of intermediately deuterated methanes was determined by summing the contributions of the H-abstraction process and the D-abstraction process to give the overall rate using the following equation:\ns6su | observed rate equals three point nine x divided by S four minus x plus three point nine multiplied by four minus x divided by P S three minus x\ny219 | where x is the number of hydrogens of the isotopic homolog, P is the primary isotope effect, and S is the secondary isotope effect.\n06ht | Product Yield Experiments. Products were recovered from a single turnover of diferrous MMOH. The enzyme con- centration, reduction procedures, and reaction conditions were as described earlier for stopped-flow experiments. The enzyme solution and a mixture of substrate (CH4 and CD4, six hundred forty micromolar; other isotopic homologs, one point two eight mM) and oxygen (two hundred micromolar) were loaded into separate stopped-flow syringes. A mechanical ram was used to push the solutions through a mixer and into a collection vial. The temperature was maintained at four degrees Celsius.\nv3r2 | Methanol Derivatization. The alcohol products produced by MMOH were first derivatized by the Schotten-Baumann procedure. The reaction solution following the single turnover was added to CH2Cl2 (fifty mL) and then esterified using three point five-dinitrobenzoyl chloride (two mmol), N,N-dimethylaniline (two mmol), and NaOH (two mmol). The mixture was stirred for seventeen hours at room temperature. The organic layer was washed with three times one hundred mL of HCl (one point zero M) followed by three times one hundred mL of five percent NaHCO3- two M NaCl, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evaporated to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in two point zero mL of CH2Cl2. Thin- layer chromatography using silica gel plates and CHCl3 as the mobile phase allowed separation of the methyl ester product at an Rf of zero point five to zero point seven. The area containing the product was scraped off and eluted with CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 was evaporated to a minimal amount and the product was analyzed by mass spectrometry.",
