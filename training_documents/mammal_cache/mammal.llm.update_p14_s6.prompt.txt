You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

The chromatin states are learned based on epigenetic datasets profiling chromatin mark signals in different human cell and tissue types, resulting in a genome annotation shared across cell types (41). The common partially methylated domains (commonPMD), solo CpGs (WCGW), and highly methylated domain (HMD) annotations are from (42). PRC1 and PRC2 binding sites are obtained from the ChIP-seq datasets of PCR1 and PCR2 from ENCODE (45).

ap6l | We found that 30 of the resulting 55 mod- ules identified from an unsupervised machine learning method were readily associated with species traits (taxonomic order, maximum life span, and average adult weight) or individual traits (chronological age, tissue, and sex). We expect that many of the remaining 25 modules will be associated with biological characteristics about which we currently have no information. As a case in point, although the yellow module was not associated with any of our primary tested traits, it did show association with re- sponse to a murine circadian rhythm disrup- tion study (light pollution during the night; fig. S7B). The upstream regulator analysis of the EWAS of life span identified the pluripo- tency transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG. We showed that the transient over- expression of OSKM in murine tissues affects the methylation levels of CpGs near genes im- plicated by our EWAS of maximum life span (Fig. 5E). We speculate that the enhanced ac- tivity of the pluripotency network in long-lived species results in more efficient tissue repair and maintenance, ensuring a longer life span.
iest | Both the EWAS and eigengene-based analy- ses identified methylation signatures of max- imum life span presumably established at birth. Most of these were independent of aging and interventions that affect murine mortality risk. Several CpGs that are more highly methyl- ated in long-lived species are located near HOXL subclass homeoboxes and other genes that play a role in morphogenesis and development. Some of these life span-related CpGs are located next to genes that are also implicated in our analysis of upstream regulators (e.g., ASCL1 and SMAD6).
cox8 | CpGs with methylation levels that are in- versely related to life span are enriched in TSS1- and promoter flanking (PromF4 and PromF5)-associated chromatin states. Genes located in chromatin state TSS1 are constitu- tively active and enriched for nucleic acid metabolic processes (41). This could imply that long-lived species either evolved selective mechanisms to maintain low methylation levels near TSSs or may have adaptations that pro- mote the high expression of essential genes. This high expression may indirectly prompt more active DNA demethylation mechanisms.

awri | For unsupervised analysis, we formed WGCNA networks based on two sets of CpG probes in our data. The first network was generated from 14,705 conserved CpGs in 10,927 sam- ples of 167 eutherian species. The preservation of this network was evaluated in an indepen- dent dataset comprising 3692 samples from 29 tissues of 228 mammalian species (164 new species; 64 overlapped with the training set). The second network was a subset of 7956 con- served CpGs in 11,105 samples from 167 euthe- rian and nine marsupial species. In addition, we developed seven consensus comethylation networks to remove the confounding effects of species and tissue type. Consensus WGCNA can be interpreted as a meta-analysis across networks in different species and tissue types (33, 43).
bl28 | For the eutherian network (Net1), module eigengenes (MEs) were defined as singular vectors (corresponding to the highest singular value) from the singular value decomposition of the scaled CpGs that underlie the respective module. The eigengenes in the eutherian net- work (Net1) explained a range of 24 to 63% (average 43%) of the variance in the methyla- tion data in the training set, replication set, and all data in each module (table S3). For a given module, we defined the measure of mod- ule membership (kME) as the Pearson correla- tion between the module eigengene and the CpGs. The association of module eigengenes was examined for different traits using indi- vidual regression models.
