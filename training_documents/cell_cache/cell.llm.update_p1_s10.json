Introduction\nnvfy | Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) can be likened to logistics required for setting up a new cell-governing system that will\nmror | ABSTRACT\nzlxc | Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) denotes the initiation of gene expression after fertilization. It is part of the complex oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET) in which a highly specialized cell - the oocyte - is fertilized and transformed into a zygote that gives rise to an embryo that will develop into a newborn. From the perspective of gene expression, the OET reflects reprogramming of germ cell gene expression into the new developmental program of the zygote. This reprogramming occurs at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. This review will discuss selected aspects of mammalian ZGA, highlighting shared features and evolved differences observed in commonly investigated mammals and non-mammalian model animals.\nk0bw | ultimately give rise to a new organism while the exchange the cell-governing system has to occur without disturbing cell's regular business. The information for this logistical challenge is stored in approximately one hundred million to one billion nucleotides of nuclear DNA and the instructions contained therein must be executed in a zygote within a specific time frame. In highly complex human societies, changes in governing systems are accompanied with different degrees of chaos and anarchy before new governing systems establish their control. This anthropomorphic perspective highlights how effectively natural selection has optimized the oocyte-to-embryo-transition (OET) so that its logistics is executed in a timely and orderly fashion.\naq5a | The initiation of animal development varies. The egg size, yolk distribution, cleavage pattern, and gene activation are among the notably diversified features. Yet, at least three themes appear common across the animal kingdom: rapid cell cleavage, \"maturation\" of chromatin structures, and a delayed onset of zygotic transcription. This review will focus on mammalian ZGA and examine commonalities and differences among mammals and other animals.\nsc5y | There are over five thousand extant species of placental mammals representing clades, that radiated primarily after the Cretaceous-Paleogene event sixty-five to sixty-six million years ago. Two mammalian model systems have been studied the most: Homo sapiens and Mus musculus, the latter being the most experimentally manipulated mammalian species. However, extant mammals exhibit extreme diversity in size, habitat occupation, and locomotion adaptation. Mammalian radiation did not occur at the same pace in terms of speciation and genome evolution; Mus musculus belongs to a group that radiated extensively. The mouse genome evolved faster than that of larger mammals such as humans or bovine because it could produce more generation cycles per a given unit of time. This should be kept in mind when interpreting mouse model data because many traits observed in mice could represent recently evolved characteristics rather than common ancestral traits present in all mammals.\n0yab | Two. Early development in animals - the placenta\nw95z | Initiation of development in placental mammals differs from other animals such as Caenorhabditis, Drosophila, zebrafish, Xenopus or chicken where the fertilized egg will exclusively give rise to a gastrulating embryo. In non-mammalian models, the initial cleavage typically employs rapid cell cycles (sea urchin or Drosophila approximately ten minutes, zebrafish approximately fifteen minutes, Xenopus approximately thirty-five minutes) with little if any transcription of the genome. Different mechanisms may regulate the delayed onset of ZGA.\n0i1k | Zygotic cleavage in early mammalian development may not be a homologous process to cleavage in non-mammalian species. In mammals (mice, humans, bovine), the initial rate of cleavage is slow while extraembryonic and embryonic lineages are not yet separated. By the time the first cleavage of mouse zygotes is complete, the above-mentioned non-mammalian models have developed far beyond gastrulation. Accordingly, it was proposed that early mammalian development should be aligned with early development of other animals by gastrulation (and not fertilization) to account for the rapid cleavage non-mammalian metazoan zygotes, which appears rather homologous to the accelerated perigastryulation cycles in placental mammals. According to this model, fertilization in mammals occurs at a comparatively earlier stage in oocyte development with added cleavage steps before extraembryonic and embryonic lineages are separated. Thus, mammalian preimplantation development should be considered a derived characteristic that evolved in ancestors of placental mammals as an adaptation of terrestrial life.\ndqlg | Three. Early development in mammals and animals - the time issue\np6pq | Numerous experiments in different model systems indicate that zygotic gene products become essential for development only at specific stages that vary among the studied animals. For example, transcriptional inhibition in zebrafish or Xenopus embryos results in gastrulation defects, but does not prevent cleavage. In Drosophila, absence of transcription will prevent cellularization, but preceding cell cycles will occur. Consequently, analysis\nzse6 | of RNA synthesis showed that zygotic transcription appears with a species-specific delay after fertilization.\np2n3 | While the very first transcripts may be difficult to detect, the first major wave of RNA synthesis and transcript accumulation occurs at a specific stage of development. The first major surge in RNA synthesis is traditionally denoted the major ZGA wave and is characterized by a global change in gene expression that is essential for continued development. Importantly, some RNA synthesis, traditionally denoted minor ZGA, can be detected prior to major ZGA. However, this traditional distinction has been undermined by next generation sequencing (NGS) methods, which show that transcription at many loci expressed during major ZGA is also detectable at earlier time points.\nohh7 | ZGA timing was proposed to be controlled by nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio changes during cleavage where the geometric increase of genomic DNA titrates transcriptional repression, a notion supported by experimental data in zebrafish embryos. More recently, it has been proposed that the concentration of non-DNA bound core histones determines the time for the onset of transcription. The reduction in nuclear histone concentration that coincides with genome activation does not affect nucleosome density on DNA, but would allow transcription factors to compete successfully for DNA binding.\nvbni | Major ZGA in mouse embryos occurs at the two-cell stage while in other mammals it is delayed several divisions (four to sixteen-cell), although more sensitive NGS data suggest that transcription initiates earlier. In terms of major ZGA among mammals, mice are \"early genome activators\" while humans and bovine are \"later genome activators\". It is likely that the early genome activation in mice is a derived characteristic while humans and bovine represent a more ancestral state. However, the early or late distinction is relative. Mice undergo major ZGA after the first cleavage (approximately nineteen hours after fertilization) but at a much later time than major ZGA occurs in zebrafish (approximately four hours), Xenopus (approximately six hours), or Drosophila (approximately two point five hours).\n```",
