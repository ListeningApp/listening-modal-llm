You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

2gnm | 97 further explored the behavioural performance of ChatGPT with the following modifications of the 98 task presented in Figure 3:
emgw | 99 . We added <LATEX>3 \quad - \quad 6</LATEX> noise symbols to the input on every trial to examine the LLM's behaviour when to make it impossible to get the correct answer by simply doing string match between stimulus inputs.
xaqt | 102 · In human behavioural studies, a common strategy to improve participants' performance is to 103 provide feedback after each trial [35]. Here in the task, after the LLM provided a response 104 for the previous trial, we added feedback on whether its response was correct or wrong 105 alongside the stimulus input of the current trial.
5rcb | 106 · Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has proved helpful in eliciting reasoning in LLMs [40]. Here we instructed the LLM to think step by step when giving a response.
524j | 108 3.2 Spatial n-back experiments
xd3m | 109 Although in its very nature, LLMs are text-based, but at least one study has demonstrated that they 110 have spatial reasoning abilities [5]. To build on this promising trail and further examine the spatial working memory of ChatGPT. In the base version of the spatial n-back task, we constructed <LATEX>\mathrm { a } 3 \times 3</LATEX> 111

ftfg | 114 the letter <LATEX>\mathrm { X }</LATEX> here was arbitrarily chosen to represent an occupied spatial location textually and could 115 be substituted by any other letter or symbol. Each block contains 24 grids, including 8 match trials

q5eu | 124 on every trial. This is a first step to examine the LLM's spatial working memory when it 125 was not able to get the correct answer by simply doing string match.
a7ao | 126 . To further confirm that the LLM can really reason in a spatial way rather than trivially 127 performing some kind of string match under the hood, we further introduced two variants 128 that specifically require abstract spatial reasoning; an model that would otherwise simply 129 match strings would have failed. To achieve so, in these two tasks, a match is defined as 130 when the location of the letter <LATEX>\mathrm { X }</LATEX> is in the same row or column as the <LATEX>\mathrm { X }</LATEX> n trials ago. The 131 difference is whether identical locations also count as a match. We expect the version 132 excluding identical locations to be harder for the LLM to perform.
