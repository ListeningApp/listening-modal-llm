(D) Forest plots of the top modules associated with mortality risk in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort, and Women's Health Initiative study totaling four thousand six hundred fifty-one individuals (one thousand ninety-five, twenty-four percent death). N denotes the number of deaths per total number of individuals in each study. We report the meta-analysis P value in the title of the forest plot. (E) Module that correlates significantly P is less than one times ten to the negative three hundred with relative age (defined as ratio of age over maximum life span) across mammalian species using a multivariate regression model. Covariates were tissue, sex, and species differences. Each dot corresponds to a eutherian tissue sample N equals fourteen thousand five hundred forty-two. Dots are colored by taxonomic order as in Figure one. (F) Volcano plot of the repeated-measures correlation of all purple module genes in Genotype-Tissue Expression data.\ns0fl | The multivariate model analysis included sex, tissue type, and relative age as covariates to reveal additional modules that relate to life span in different tissues. The regression analysis found two modules with opposing correlations with maximum life span: the green module (life span R equals zero point four two, average weight R equals zero point three eight, P is less than one times ten to the negative three hundred) and the greenyellow module (life span R equals negative zero point four four, average weight R equals negative zero point three five, P is less than one times ten to the negative three hundred). The CpGs of the Lifespan Weight Rodentia (greenyellow) are located near genes that play a role in development P equals five times ten to the negative thirteen and in RNA metabolism.\n43ia | P equals six times ten to the negative twelve. Age-related consensus module in mammals\n3g2y | The purple module (denoted subsequently as RelativeAge+ module) exhibited the strongest positive correlation with relative age (relative age R equals zero point three five, P is less than one times ten to the negative three hundred).\ngc7v | To remove the confounding effects of species and/or tissue type, we also constructed seven consensus networks (denoted cNet three, cNet four, and cNet six; for a description, see the supplementary materials). The RelativeAge+ module was preserved in three different consensus networks (cNet three, cNet four, and cNet six), suggesting conservation in different species and tissues. The purple RelativeAge+ module is positively enriched for CpGs in regulatory regions (e.g., promoters and five-prime untranslated regions) and depleted in intron regions. Functional enrichment of this module highlighted embryonic stem cell regulation, axonal fasciculation, angiogenesis, and diabetes-related pathways. The CpGs in this module are adjacent to Polycomb repressor complex two targets, which are marked by H3K27me3.\nwqfv | Ingenuity pathway analysis implicated POU5F1 (alias OCT4), SHH, ASCL1, SOX2, and NEUROG2 proteins as putative upstream regulators of the RelativeAge+ module. We used Genotype-Tissue Expression project data to determine whether the mRNA levels of any of these upstream regulators are altered with age in several human tissues. OCT four [repeated-measures correlation equals zero point zero seven, P equals two times ten to the negative one, which is among the four known Yamanaka factors for cellular dedifferentiation, showed a positive increase with age in several, but not all, human tissues. Nine other genes (e.g., HOXD ten, repeated-measures correlation equals zero point one six, P equals four times ten to the negative fifty; SRXN one, repeated-measures correlation equals negative zero point one four, P equals four times ten to the negative fifty-two from the RelativeAge+ module also had a nominally significant repeated-measures correlation P is less than zero point zero zero five in Genotype-Tissue Expression data, although opposite aging patterns could be found in select tissues. These observations highlight the relevance of genes in the RelativeAge+ module to stem cell biology and aging in human tissues.\nj30a | Interventional studies in mice\n7bdk | We related our methylation modules to interventions that are known to modulate the\nfim0 | life span of mice. This included growth hormone receptor knockout (i.e., dwarf mice) and caloric restriction, which extended life, and a high-fat diet, which elicited the opposite effect. Six modules, including the purple module (RelativeAge+) showed a significant decrease P is less than zero point zero five of the module eigengene in dwarf mice and after caloric restriction and, conversely, a modest increase after a high-fat diet. Although the magenta, black, midnightblue, tan, and greenyellow modules have connections to the maximum life span in mammals, they did not present a clear relationship with interventions that modify murine life span. This suggests a mutual exclusivity between the modules related to the maximum mammalian life span and those affected by interventions modulating the murine life span.\nojro | Transient expression of Yamanaka factors",
