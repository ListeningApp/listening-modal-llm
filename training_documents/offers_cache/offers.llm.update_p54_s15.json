        "content": "ssph | One final point I want to drive home: if you offer a service where a customer must do something in order to achieve the result, or solve the problem you say you solve, they must be invested. The more invested they are, the more likely they are to achieve the positive result. Therefore, it follows that if you care about your customers, you should get them as invested as humanly possible. Ideally, this means pricing your services or product in such a way that it stings a little when they buy. That sting will force and focus their attention and their investment in your product or service. Those who pay the most, pay the most attention. And if your customers are more adherent and follow through, and if they achieve better results with your service than your competition, then you are in a very real way providing more value than anyone else. This is how you win.\ndves | But I know this isn't easy, and it shouldn't be. Your product must deliver. So many wish to shortcut the real work. Do that and you will fail. In the real world, to have the \"gonads\" to charge big ticket prices, you must outwork your self-doubt. You must be so confident in your delivery, because you have done it so many times, that you know that this person will succeed. Experience is what gives you the conviction to ask for someone's entire year's salary as payment. You must believe so deeply in your solution that when you look at yourself in the mirror at night, alone, your conviction remains unshakable. So let me bring this section home with my personal experience.\n3d6a | My Premium Price Experience\nli84 | In my first niche consulting business - Gym Launch - I teach gym owners a better business model. Before productizing my consulting services, I flew out to thirty-three gyms in eighteen months to do full turnarounds.\ny06n | We would fly out, fix everything in the gym, and relaunch it in twenty-one days. We would average an increase in forty-two thousand dollars in additional sales in twenty-one days. It was wild. My fee was one hundred percent of the revenue I would bring in.\nsipr | At our peak, we were turning around eight gyms a month. This quickly became a logistical nightmare. After the wear and tear of living in motels month after month after month, I thought to myself there has to be a better way to do this.\nyuxx | One month, there was a gym we were scheduled to go fly out to. But, I simply didn't want to do it. So I told them we were going to cancel the engagement. The gym owner practically threatened me to help him. So I said I would help him, but he would have to do all the work, but I would show him how.\ndbah | Within thirty days, this gym had made almost forty-four thousand dollars in new up front cash collected sales (four times their previous month). As soon as I saw that my process could be duplicated from afar, without me having to fly people in... our business exploded. I had found the missing link because my travel schedule was no longer a constraint. We went on to sell four thousand plus more gyms over the next few years (and counting) using a done-with-you rather than a done-for-you model. But... back to premium pricing.\n4byb | When I entered the space, low-price competitors offered full-service marketing for five hundred dollars per month, with a single high-price competitor charging five thousand dollars for his product.\nu64j | I wanted to be the premium price leader. I wanted to be so expensive that it created allure around what we were doing. So, we came in at three times the highest-priced player and thirty-two times more than the lower-priced players. A price of sixteen thousand dollars for a sixteen-week, done-with-you intensive. Then we upsold thirty-five percent of those people into a three-year, forty-two thousand dollars per year agreement for us to help them grow their gyms.\n4lha | For context: The average gym owner makes thirty-five thousand two hundred eighty dollars per year in take-home profits. If that's the average, it means half make even less than that. So for many of them, they were committing to half of their yearly pay or more to buy our program. And I was selling this to grown men as a kid in his twenties, telling them I was going to help them make more money. This was possible because my conviction was stronger than their skepticism. How?\nuj4l | Based a voluntary survey taken at our last full company event, with one hundred fifty-eight gyms responding, we found that a Gym Launch gym who has been in our program for eleven months will experience the following average improvements:\nojba | The survey just proved what I already knew. I had complete conviction in our product. I knew it worked. I had outworked my self-doubt.\nmwgi | Summary Points\ncjze | What should you take from this?\nrtvx | First and foremost, charge a premium. It will allow you to do things no one else can to make your clients successful. We were able to charge a premium because we provided more value than anyone else in the industry. In a real way, we were charging on a fraction of what our clients made using our system. This is important. Our clients still got a deal. The gap between what they paid (price) and what they got (value) was massive. As a result, the virtuous cycle continued to spin. We charged the most money. We provided the most value.\nh0y1 | Our gyms remained the most competitive, made the most money, always had the latest and best acquisition systems, and had the support to implement them at lightning speed.\nxxw0 | We made many mistakes along the way, but our pricing model was not one of them. It allowed me the room to make big bets without losing the farm. The truth is that ninety-nine percent of businesses need to raise their prices to grow, not lower them. Profit is oxygen. It fuels the fire of growth. You need it if you want to reach more people and make a bigger impact.\nfv2x | In order to charge so much, though, you must learn to create tremendous value. Let's head there next.\n663s | SECTION THREE: VALUE - CREATE YOUR OFFER\n385i | HOW TO MAKE OFFERS SO GOOD PEOPLE FEEL STUPID SAYING NO\nuhr9 | SECTION TWO: PRICING\n9w2j | SECTION ONE: HOW WE GOT HERE\nusxo | SECTION TWO: VALUE OFFER\n5fmi | PROBLEMS - SOLUTIONS -> BUNDLE\nh8p7 | \ngcbc | SECTION ONE: EXECUTION\nd9tz | SECTION FOUR: ENHANCING\ndusw | \npk82 | \nblll | VALUE OFFER: THE VALUE EQUATION\nocgf | I want to be abundantly clear: the goal should be to charge as much money for your products or services as humanly possible. I'm talking heinous amounts of money. That being said, anyone can raise their prices, but only a select few can charge these rates and get people to say yes.\ntybl | From this point forward, you must abandon any notion you have about \"what's fair.\" Every enormous company in the world charges you money for things that cost them nothing. It costs pennies for the phone company to add an additional user, except they don't mind charging you hundreds per month for access. It costs pennies to manufacture pharmaceutical drugs, but they don't mind charging hundreds of dollars a month for it. Media companies charge advertisers a king's ransom for your eyeballs, and it costs them next to nothing to get you to like kitten photos on social media. You need to have a big discrepancy between what something costs you and what you charge for it. It is the only way to be unreasonably successful.",
