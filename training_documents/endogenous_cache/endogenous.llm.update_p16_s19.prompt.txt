You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

79vs | 624 staining of sections from hTau-KI mice stereotactically injected with iBEp and contralaterally
9bfz | 625 injected with vehicle control. After stereotactic injections, animals were allowed to recover for
lrwo | 626 72 hours and then brains were perfused, sectioned, and stained for ThioS. We find a strong 627 increase in ThioS staining from the CA1 region of hippocampi exposed to iBEp relative to
vlfw | 628 vehicle controls (Fig 6D). ThioS+ inclusions appear as flame-like inclusions in both the CA1
fg41 | 629 pyramidal layer and the granule cell layer of the Dentate Gyrus (Fig 6D, E, S6F-J).
d033 | 630 Neuroproteasome inhibition-induced flame-like ThioS+ aggregates co-localize with both
wtvl | 631 phosphorylated Tau (AT8) and total Tau (DA9) (Fig 6F, G, S6K) in single Z-plane images from
u2qd | 632 neurons in the CA1 and DG of hippocampus. We conclude that some neuroproteasome-induced
4kpx | 633 aggregates we observe are indeed composed of Tau. In addition to these large ThioS+ inclusions, 634 we also observe some thread-like ThioS+ inclusions in the hippocampal neuropil as well as
2xnd | 635 widely distributed thin ThioS+ inclusions that appear dispersely throughout the iBEp-injected
8rp1 | 637 hippocampus (Fig 6G, S6L, M). The ThioS+ inclusions formed following neuroproteasome
0z93 | Six hundred thirty-six
we3s | 638 inhibition appear to resemble neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)-like and neuropil thread-like
vuhu | inclusions observed in various Tauopathies including AD (8, 17, 54, 120). While we find it
q679 | 639 highly surprising that ThioS+ Tau inclusions appear just 72 hours after neuroproteasome
tkda | 640 inhibition, these data support our overall conclusion that neuroproteasome inhibition induces the aggregation of endogenous Tau.

jb8d | 644
gj4l | 645 Neuroproteasomes are 20S complexes and do not have the machinery to recognize ubiquitin or 646 unfold substrates(3, 4). Instead, neuroproteasomes co- or peri-translationally degrade newly synthesized and unfolded substrates rather than substrates which are fully folded(4). We 648 therefore tested whether new protein synthesis was required for the neuroproteasome-dependent
x4ti | 647
sang | 649 formation of endogenous Tau aggregates. We incubated primary neuronal cultures with either
ocyy | 650 iBEp or Epoxomicin and then co-incubated these cultures with cycloheximide, which blocks
3vef | 651 translation elongation. Here, we reproduce iBEp-induced Tau aggregation and find that
9zxr | 652 cycloheximide blocks this iBEp-mediated increase in both WT primary neurons (Fig 7A) and in 653 hTau-KI primary neurons (Fig 7B). Cycloheximide also blocks the effect of SulfoMG on the 654 formation of endogenous insoluble Tau inclusions, consistent with our observations using iBEp
l47i | 655 (Fig 7C). Next, we tested whether inhibition of protein synthesis blocks the accumulation of
ml9u | 656 sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in vivo in hTau-KI mice. We stereotactically co-injected cycloheximide 657 and iBEp together contralateral to iBEp alone into the hippocampus. We find a dramatic
0ml0 | 658 decrease in sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in the hippocampus from mice co-injected with iBEp and
3f5x | 659 cycloheximide compared to those injected with iBEp alone (Fig 7D, S7A). Next, co-injection of
kh8s | 660 cycloheximide with iBEp completely eliminated AT8 staining compared to contralateral
plxa | 661 injection of iBEp alone (Fig 7E). Finally, similar to what we observed with sarkosyl-insoluble
6wac | 662 Tau and AT8 staining, we also observe a complete return to baseline of ThioS+ staining in
vil5 | 663 hippocampi co-injected with iBEp and cycloheximide relative to those injected with iBEp alone (Fig 7F).
2s5u | 664 665 666 There are many mechanisms which could explain our observation that new protein synthesis is required for the formation of neuroproteasome inhibition-induced endogenous Tau aggregates.
k9cc | 667
6t52 | 668 We interpret our data and argue that neuroproteasome inhibition induces the accumulation of
08mw | 669 newly synthesized protein(s) important for Tau accumulation. The most straightforward
6iat | 670 candidate protein would be Tau itself. To determine specifically if we observed more newly
pony | 671 synthesized Tau protein following neuroproteasome inhibition, we took advantage of proximity
spym | 672 ligation assays (PLA) coupled with puromycylation to visualize newly synthesized Tau
rms6 | 673 protein(121, 122). Briefly, we used specific monoclonal N-terminal antibodies against Tau and
dwg7 | 674 specific antibodies against puromycin. Each antibody is recognized by secondary antibodies
3o8c | 675 tethered to oligonucleotides that can ligate and amplify in situ. When antibodies against Tau and
vm29 | 676 Puromycin are proximal to each other, this permits the oligonucleotide ligation which can be
kwxl | 677 detected by a fluorescent signal under hybridizing conditions (Fig 7G). A positive PLA signal
kd8r | 678 therefore indicates the presence of newly synthesized Tau. We incubated Puromycin in primary
z2jh | 679 neuronal cultures for only 10 minutes, which allows us to visualize a defined short snapshot of
nvte | 680 newly synthesized Tau. We observe no signal in neurons either not treated with puromycin or in
994g | 681 neurons where we block protein synthesis using cycloheximide or anisomycin during
p39w | 682 puromycylation, validating our approach (Fig S7B, C). We observe a striking ~3.5-fold increase
g6k3 | 683 in Puro-PLA-Tau signal in iBEp-treated neurons relative to DMSO controls (Fig 7H). We then 684 analyzed the size distribution of diameters of the newly synthesized Tau puncta (Fig 7I). After 685 accounting for and normalizing against the increase in puncta number seen in iBEp-treated
xmvn | 686 neurons, we observe an increase in the size distribution of PLA puncta from iBEp treated
v2zu | 687 neurons. We find that iBEp treated neurons contain an over twofold increase in newly 688 synthesized Tau puncta greater than 24nm in diameter (Fig 7I). We interpret this to mean that 689 there are larger inclusions of newly synthesized Tau which form following neuroproteasome
z2nh | 690 inhibition, consistent with our observations that neuroproteasome inhibition induces Tau
yhx0 | 69 aggregation.

15ri | 693 Discussion
dfj2 | 694
e9bu | 695 We conclude that neuroproteasome localization is differentially regulated by ApoE isoforms, 696 which is critically important because reduced neuroproteasome function induces the aggregation of endogenous Tau. The relevance for neuroproteasomes in many aspects of the cell biology of
usfq | 697
4jnl | 698 neurons, as well as pathophysiology of neurodegeneration, will be critical to explore in the
ows8 | 699 future. The cell-impermeable neuroproteasome-specific inhibitors we have developed and the
qkak | 700 tools we have built to visualize and purify neuroproteasomes will enable the broad study of 701 neuroproteasomes in various aspects of neuronal physiology and pathophysiology.
39ur | 702
nlm3 | 703 The mechanisms by which ApoE interacts with and influences neuroproteasome localization 704 remain unexplored. ApoE is found as a lipoprotein and the classic role for ApoE is a cholesterol
muf5 | 705 carrier(123). While we demonstrate only lipidated ApoE can influence neuroproteasome
lqjf | 706 localization, we do not understand whether the lipids transported by ApoE are involved in
7z7b | 707 regulating neuroproteasomes or if the lipoproteins are more efficiently able to interact with the 708 neuroproteasome complex. Neuroproteasome levels change in ApoE3/3 AD carriers relative to
