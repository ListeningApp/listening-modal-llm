        "content": "hntf | To give a sense of the intellectual climate of those formative years in the education of many of us, I draw on three powerful scholarly statements in the chapters ahead: William McNeill's The Rise of the West, Carlton Coon's The Origin of Races, and Northrop Frye's The Educated Imagination. Even as the European empires were dissolving, these major scholars and educators bolstered the case for a unequaled culture and race, whatever civil rights and political independence might finally be achieved in the world. Taken with Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth, these works make for a fascinating intellectual moment in the legacy of a collapsing imperialism that was as important as the Beatles, dare one say, in the education of the postwar baby boom generation now assuming the reigns of power in the West. At the very least, we need to reconsider how a person coming of age in the West in those years, whether in grade school or graduate school, was raised in the aftermath of colonialism among imperial habits of mind that now need to be identified, as they might still contribute to the educated imagination.\n99fo | To establish the degree to which our current ideas of education may have been influenced by the global forces of imperialism, I lay out, in the following three historical chapters, the different ways in which imperialism was bent on taking a knowing possession of the world, on setting that world on public display for the edification of the West, and on developing the principal forms of schooling that might serve both colonial state and colonized native. Having secured education's historical place in imperialism, I then begin a detailed treatment of five of the academic disciplines that have become staples of the school curriculum: history, geography, science, language, and literature. Each of these subject areas is accorded its own chapter, which is devoted to identifying traces of the colonial imagination that form part of how we have learned to divide the world. Each chapter begins with the subject's historical formation within the age of empire, pauses over the form this legacy took during the early nineteen sixties, and then takes a close look at the lingering elements of this legacy in today's classrooms, whether in America, Britain, Canada, or elsewhere.\ny5r7 | Education remains a voyage of discovery, a journey in search of a larger world. So it is that the philosopher Ernst Cassirer insists, in his discussion of Rousseau, that the student \"understands the world only inasmuch as he acquires and conquers it step by step.\" That the age of exploration furnished the commonplace metaphors of educational rhetoric is obviously, for me, more than an imaginative borrowing. Imperialism was an educational venture that captured and captivated the imagination of the West. From its interests in tourism to interior design, the West still lives within the spell of the imperium, and what follows in this book is a disquisition on what it\nlrry | WHERE IS HERE?\nhvhm | might take to distance ourselves from that spell. When Toni Morrison opened her Massey lectures on American civilization at Harvard in the year of the Columbus quincentenary, she described her hope to \"draw a map, so to speak, of a critical geography and use that map to open as much space for discovery as the original charting of the New World-without the mandate for conquest.\" In this way, we need to grow curious about what we have made of the world, beginning with a critical geography of our own map-coloring and -labeling days in school that did so much to define our place in the world. We owe students today an account of the historical divisions out of which we have fashioned ourselves as educated people, even as we work together to move beyond our current understanding of an inexorably divided world.\n863b | ED",
