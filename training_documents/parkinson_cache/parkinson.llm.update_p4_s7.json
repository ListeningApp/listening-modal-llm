ILVs are enveloped inside multivesicular bodies, which mature into late endosomes. These late endosomes deliver their luminal contents either by forming tubular extensions or by fusing with pre-existing lysosomes to form endolysosomes. These may be considered the final compartment of the endocytic pathway, where hydrolases degrade endocytic cargo and the membranes of ILVs for reuse. In addition, there is retrograde transport of receptors such as M6P, Lamp2a, et cetera, from endosomes to the TGN for reuse through the retromer complex, comprised mainly of VPS thirty-five, VPS twenty-six and VPS twenty-nine. Proteins that are meant for secretion follow a secretory pathway from the TGN. Selective capture and elimination of a cell's damaged organelles and misfolded proteins happens through a process called macroautophagy, termed hereafter as autophagy, an integral part of the E-L system. Double membrane vesicles called autophagosomes encapsulate unwanted or toxic cytosolic constituents including aggregated proteins and deliver them to the lysosome for degradation. Non-selective autophagy also occurs during starvation, through which cells can recycle proteins and reuse amino acids for the synthesis of basic proteins essential for cell survival. Therefore, autophagy plays a pivotal role in housekeeping and maintenance of neuronal homeostasis.\nrs2m | Customization of the E-L system for neurons mainly happens in axons and synapses. At presynaptic terminals, vesicle precursors are delivered from the cell body and undergo vesicle cycling to form functional synaptic vesicles. However, delivery of new vesicle precursors cannot match the number of synaptic vesicles undergoing exocytosis to achieve neurotransmission at an active synapse. This deficit is solved by highly responsive CME, recapturing fused vesicular membranes from the presynaptic membrane to form CCVs, which are in turn converted back to synaptic vesicles through clathrin uncoating. Less understood clathrin-independent bulk endocytosis and the \"kiss and run\" mechanism are also parts of the synaptic endocytic repertoire. In addition, there are dense-core vesicles derived from the TGN that are transported down the axons. Unlike synaptic vesicles, dense-core vesicles do not participate in synaptic vesicle recycling and are primarily used to secrete long-acting neuropeptides. While these processes are mostly confined to the presynaptic compartment, the E-L system's postsynaptic compartment contributes to membrane trafficking pathways primarily aimed at receptor, transporter, and ion-channel recycling.\nuz9y | Though this complex E-L system allows a neuron to function far away from its site of protein synthesis, the neuron is beholden to anterograde transport of proteins and membranes synthesized and modified in the soma for maintenance of axons and the synapses. Furthermore, constant synaptic activity, especially in continuously firing neurons like substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons may result in considerable build-up of damaged organelles, membranes, and misfolded proteins. These need to undergo encapsulation by an autophagosome or endosome and retrograde transport to the\n8ov0 | Two. E-L system dysfunction: the holy grail of Parkinson's disease pathophysiology?\nmj9m | soma for lysosomal degradation. Here, long-distance axonal microtubule networks provide significant support to the neuronal E-L system. These spatial challenges to address a unique structural geometry, high metabolic demand, enhanced responsiveness to chemical or electrical stimulation, and the requirement for longevity due to their postmitotic nature, place a tremendous burden on the E-L system. Nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons have an additional burden in terms of long and highly branched axons, larger surface area, selective transporters for external toxins, large fluctuations in free calcium ions, less buffering capacity, and higher oxidative stress, reducing their threshold for degeneration. These vulnerabilities are further exacerbated with aging. Faced with environmental and genetic risk factors, disease pathogenesis abounds.\n```",
