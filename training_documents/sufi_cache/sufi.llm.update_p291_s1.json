        "content": "3kye | playing games, you are playing: so do not deceive yourself that it is acting on a more effective part of you just because it is not a disc of wood, and because the game delights or depresses you.\nou3n | There is hardly a derivative book on metaphysics in currency in which the author has succeeded in avoiding this tendency: and fewer still which are not distorted in meaning by their readers.\nd3bu | There is small wonder that more conventional people laugh at metaphysicians, and that most of the latter succeed mainly in teaching themselves and others to play diversionary games with what can be, in fact, vital materials.\numpv | There is a need to repeat this in different forms because of the fact that people are surrounded, all the time, by 'game' tendencies, within and without themselves, which can be counteracted only by an appropriate quantity and quality of the other type of material and descriptions of its uses.\n1sha | Remember, the mere study and absorption of such admonitions as this give you a guard and a means of maintaining a sense of truth far greater than you would imagine.\nbw9p | Internal dimensions, properly conveyed, are the most useful of the materials which we have. Incorrectly and shallowly used, they are the least useful.\nwuha | BURNING THE KAABA\neei5 | It is to draw attention to the essential that Sufis appear to attack the derivative or secondary. Attar tells how Shibli carried a flaming coal through the streets, saying that he was going to set fire to Kaaba, the holiest place of Islam, so that people would concern themselves not with it but with the Lord of the Kaaba.\ntzc8 | Explanation\nb6at | Q: From your remarks and writings, I have observed people's behaviour relating to 'higher knowledge', and found it to be as you describe. People imagine that just because others have spoken of it, they are themselves candidates for this knowledge without really listening to the people who tell them how to approach it. They also study selectively, expecting that the bits and pieces which appeal to them will give them what they want, not regarding the whole learning as necessary. They vie with each other for 'experiences', emotional stimuli and even for personal credit and minor, social advantages, while at the same time claiming that they seek 'higher things'. What is your explanation, if you have one, for this absurd behaviour?\ntak4 | A: You don't need 'my explanation', because you only have to ask yourself what this kind of behaviour means to normal people, and where it is to be found.\nkish | You only have to ask an anthropologist or an historian of education or science for him to tell you that this is behaviour characteristic of less advanced people, disadvantaged or barbaric ones, in the face of the introduction of something 'new' to them.\n6i4k | This analysis is impossible only to those who have not looked at the structure and who are misled by the superficialities, such as what the cult calls itself.\nwenx | If the people you describe were seeking, say, scientific knowledge or money, you would yourself be able to say at once that they are either savages or neurotics at worst; at best people who have virtually no basic information or training enabling them to approach what they imagine they need so much. It is an important task to make this basic information available, so that people can get their feet on the starting-line, as it were, rather than sprawling all over the place.\ndzhw | Western culture prides itself on being able to tell one thing from another. This is an opportunity for its people to display this\ng50k | wholly desirable talent, training and ability. When they do so in sufficient quantity and quality, real study can begin and cannot be stopped.\n260v | In the East, of course, there is a convention whereby a teacher points out characteristic human behaviour by adopting it himself, and this shocks or reminds others so that they learn without the defensiveness of their being tackled head-on being produced.\n3v9q | This behaviour keeps alive the sense that learners should not flatter themselves that they are important because they are engaged on a spiritual task - rather that they need due humility.\nb3q6 | When I was a small boy and went into my father's study one day and left the door open, he did not tell me to close it. Instead he said:\nf7n0 | 'Oh, I seem to have left the door open. Would you kindly close it?\nqb6z | That memory has stayed with me for over forty years.\nwt9j | HIRI AND THE ASHES\nl4y1 | Abu Osman al-Hiri did much the same thing when someone tipped a quantity of ashes over him from a window. The people with him wanted to reproach the person who did it But al-Hiri only said: 'We should be a thousand times grateful that only ashes fell on one who deserves hot coals!'\nrdhl | Q: Why do you not speak more of God in your public utterances?\nlgqb | A: The more usual complaint (which shows that you cannot please everyone) is that I dwell too much on matters of religion. But the reason that I speak less than others do about God is to be answered very much as Ibn Arabi is reported to have done. He said: 'It is not worthy to deal with cleanliness when one is clearing up rubbish; cleanliness is the result of necessary preliminaries.' I admit, of course, that Arabi was brought before an inquisition for his 'love poetry' now recognised as great mystical literature ...\nm5n9 | It is also reported that Rabia said: 'To accuse someone who is preparing an apple from being concerned with its peel is sheer\n94av | ignorance, though it may seem to describe the situation.'\nzfsc | A Sufi teacher of my acquaintance said in my hearing when someone asked him to talk about God: It would be an insult to God to speak of him to you; and it would be valuing me too highly to assume that I dared to talk of God.'\ntd4d | Most people's 'God' is their vanity, their own self-conceit, their epithet, used for emotional and intellectual purposes. It is important to speak of a thing, let alone God, with reserve unless it be warranted.\n8etc | The using of the word 'God' must depend upon the state of understanding of the person who uses the term and the person or people hearing or reading it. As Shabistari said in his Sufi manual The Secret Garden, in the fourteenth century:\nj4fi | 'If the Moslem knew what an idol was, he would know that there is religion in idolatry. If the idolater knew what religion was, he would know where he has gone astray. He sees in the idol nothing but the obvious creature. That is why, according to Islam, he is a heathen.'\n73ie | 'Man' says Rumi, in Fihi ma Fihi ('In it what is in it') has three spiritual states. In the first he pays no heed to God at all, but worships and pays service to everything, woman and man, wealth and children, stones and clods. God he does not worship. When he acquires a little knowledge and awareness, then he serves nothing but God. Again, when he progresses farther in this state he becomes silent; he does not say, \"I do not serve God,\" neither does he say, \"I serve God,\" for he has transcended these two degrees.'*\n7ml0 | * Rumi, Fihi ma Fihi, Professor Firuzanfar's edition, translated by A.
