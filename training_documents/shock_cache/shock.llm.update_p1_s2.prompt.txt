You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

8p6h | State of Shock: Contemporary Vasopressor and Inotrope Use in Cardiogenic Shock
pmgl | ABSTRACT: Cardiogenic shock is characterized by tissue hypoxia caused by circulatory failure arising from inadequate cardiac output. In addition to treating the pathologic process causing impaired cardiac function, prompt hemodynamic support is essential to reduce the risk of developing multiorgan dysfunction and to preserve cellular metabolism. Pharmacologic therapy with the use of vasopressors and inotropes is a key component of this treatment strategy, improving perfusion by increasing cardiac output, altering systemic vascular resistance, or both, while allowing time and hemodynamic stability to treat the un- derlying disease process implicated in the development of cardiogenic shock. Despite the use of mechanical circulatory sup- port recently garnering significant interest, pharmacologic hemodynamic support remains a cornerstone of cardiogenic shock management, with over 90% of patients receiving at least 1 vasoactive agent. This review aims to describe the pharmacology and hemodynamic effects of current pharmacotherapies and provide a practical approach to their use, while highlighting important future research directions.
90no | C ardiogenic shock (CS) is a clinical syndrome characterized by insufficient cardiac output to meet basal metabolic requirements, leading to life-threatening end-organ hypoperfusion.1 The devel- opment of CS has downstream effects on the entire circulation, causing tissue hypoxia and injury, inflam- mation, and vasoplegia as part of a systemic inflamma- tory response syndrome in many cases. Physiologic compensatory mechanisms include endogenous sympathetic stimulation which augments cardiac output by increasing heart rate and myocardial con- tractility.2 In addition to the direct cardiac effects pro- duced by these endogenous compounds, peripheral vasoconstriction serves to increase systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure (MAP). These compensatory responses occur at the expense of mal- adaptive increases in cardiac afterload, myocardial ox- ygen requirements, and filling pressures, with resulting reductions in coronary perfusion pressure.2 Therefore,
jt0y | prompt hemodynamic support is essential to restore cellular metabolism and prevent worsening systemic and myocardial ischemia, which drives the "shock spi- ral" that in many cases leads to circulatory collapse and death.1
qb7o | The initial goals of therapy for patients with CS can broadly be defined by 2 overarching principles: first, to rapidly identify and treat the underlying cause of shock (for example, urgent revascularization in acute myocar- dial infarction related cardiogenic shock [AMI-CS]) to enable cardiac recovery3; second, to improve tissue perfusion and oxygenation through obtaining a mini- mum acceptable cardiac output and blood pressure, achieved through hemodynamic support strategies that may include the use of vasoactive medications and in select cases temporary mechanical circulatory support (MCS). The current review focuses on the pharmacologic hemodynamic supports that can be offered in this clinical context.

gc7v | Defining CS has traditionally been challenging, owing to the various clinical, biochemical, and hemodynamic definitions used in the seminal outcome trials and societal guidelines.5 The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions has recently sought to harmonize these definitions through a pragmatic classification system that can be applied to a range of clinical setting and helps enable the diagnosis of CS across the full clinical spectrum of disease sever- ity, ranging from "at risk" to fulminant circulatory col- lapse.6,7 Importantly, the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions diagnostic and stag- ing system of CS has been validated across multiple clinical subgroups, including CS with and without AMI, patients admitted to intensive care, and those with CS complicating out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.7 The use of a uniform definition for CS and its severity will play a crucial role for future epidemiologic and clinical tri- als, allowing direct comparison between outcomes as- sociated with specific therapies, systems of care, and treatment protocols.7
wqfv | Despite the challenges with defining and diag- nosing CS, it is a common problem in clinical prac- tice with an estimated incidence of 408 per 100 000 hospitalizations based on the United States National Inpatient Sample.8 Acute coronary syndromes are the most common cause of CS, accounting for 70% of cases.9,10 The management of this cohort of patients is both costly and requires significant health care resource use. The average length of hospital stay ranges between 8.9 and 18.6 days with an associated cost of treating a patient with AMI-CS in the United States of $41 774±$45252.11,12 Despite significant im- provements over the past 2 decades in contemporary revascularization techniques and supportive care, 1- year mortality rates continue to range between 50% and 60%.13
j30a | Although the epidemiology and outcomes of in- hospital CS have been well described, there remains a paucity of data in relation to the incidence, treatment provision, and outcomes of CS in the prehospital en- vironment. A recent population-based cohort study of a large provincial emergency medical services registry demonstrated that the overall incidence of emergency medical services treated CS was 14.5 per 100000

fim0 | person-years, with an overall 30-day all-cause mor- tality of 43.9%.14,15 Despite large numbers of patients with CS receiving the initial phase of their treatment by emergency medical services, prehospital therapeu- tic interventions (eg, mechanical ventilation, and va- soactive medications), in addition to many in-hospital interventions, are yet to be proven effective through high-quality observational or randomized data.16
ojro | Current Use of Vasoactive Medications in Clinical Practice
l6t9 | The use of vasoactive medications in CS is common. In the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, ~25% of admit- ted patients receive at least 1 vasoactive medication, increasing to >90% in patients with CS.17,18 Although comparative studies assessing these agents are lim- ited, norepinephrine is increasingly administered for patients requiring hemodynamic support with CS.18,19 The requirement for vasoactive medications is inde- pendently associated with short-term mortality and a stepwise increase in risk of in-hospital mortality has been observed with increasing number of vasoac- tive agents administered.18,20-22 Furthermore, a dose- dependent relationship with higher required peak doses to achieve hemodynamic stability is also asso- ciated with an increased risk of death.18 Although the observed excess mortality risk associated with the use of this drug class is of concern, these findings are likely to be confounded by increased illness severity necessitating the use of multiple agents at high doses. Nonetheless, these data underscore the need for fur- ther evaluation of the utility of these commonly used medications, compared with alternate vasoactive spar- ing strategies such as MCS.
1ujy | CARDIOVASCULAR PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACODYNAMICS OF VASOACTIVE MEDICATIONS
qzor | The study of the physiologic properties of vasoactive medications dates back to 1893, when the English physician George Oliver assessed the effects of vari- ous glandular extracts derived from sheep on radial artery vasoreactivity in his son.23 Evolving from these early experiments, the contemporary conceptual framework for these agents was established and is broadly divided into 3 categories in accordance with their predominant hemodynamic effects: vasopres- sors, inotropes, and inodilators. Vasopressors improve perfusion to vital organs by increasing systemic vascu- lar resistance and therefore MAP.24 Inotropes augment cardiac output by increasing myocardial contractility and in many instances heart rate. Inodilators have the
