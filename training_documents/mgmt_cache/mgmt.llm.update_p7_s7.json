In two thousand five, Yang Mianmian, group president at the time, said, \"We are number three in the world for white goods, we want to be number one.\" Around that time, Zhang first used the word \"Rendanheyi,\" which was aimed at achieving (in Zhang's words) \"zero distance to the customer,\" whereby the entire corporate structure is\nd0ik | Management Innovation Made in China: Haier's Rendanheyi\n0x0s | dedicated to serving customers, giving them personalized products and services, by creating independent entrepreneurial units that operate as small quasi-independent firms (within the boundaries of the company) and have market relationships among themselves.\n4exe | Key to the development of Rendanheyi was the spirit of curiosity and experimentation that originated with Zhang Ruimin-the central change agent. Rendanheyi essentially includes a collection of organizational practices that have evolved over time. From two thousand five, Haier went through a ten-year period of intensive experimentation with organizational structure and performance management. During two thousand five to two thousand nine, Haier established strategic business units and implemented new IT solutions and performance measures to connect the organization to customers. In two thousand nine, Haier announced its strategic transformation from being exclusively a manufacturing company to becoming a service-oriented company, meaning that it considers manufacturing as only one means of satisfying customer needs.\n0myz | In two thousand ten, Haier established the first ZZJYT, which operated like a virtual team (i.e., its offices were not necessarily physically close) with typically ten to twenty employees from different functional and hierarchical levels, brought together for the project. ZZJYTs enjoyed operational autonomy, including recruiting employees for the team, setting compensation rules, and determining bonus payments. But Zhang was not satisfied with the performance of ZZJYTs, as he felt that they presented \"a closed mechanism\" without sufficient involvement of outsiders. He\nxh3i | also felt they hindered faster entrepreneurial development because employees were still paid a basic salary (even though bonuses were added to it) and lacked sufficient autonomy.\nsyiw | In two thousand fourteen, the entire corporate structure was re-organized, breaking the organization into a network of independent micro-enterprises called \"xiaowei\" to replace the ZZJYTs. The owner-CEO of a xiaowei (typically six to eight members, but it can be larger) has a small ownership stake (some xiaowei are majority Haier-owned, but some xiaowei are not, and Haier is currently requiring \"continuous dilution\" of its holdings). The owner-CEO operates as an entrepreneur with absolute autonomous decision making (including all contracting, budgeting, and recruitment decisions). The performance of a xiaowei is measured against a combination of financial key performance indicators and user value added. The remuneration of xiaowei members no longer depends on a salary and is entirely tied to performance. Going beyond the ZZJYT, the xiaowei leader has total autonomy, like a CEO of an independent company, and is not subject to headquarters approval of any decisions. A xiaowei is not forced to use internal suppliers. Furthermore, the xiaowei are actively encouraged to seek the involvement of external partners and partial external funding for projects.\nkg3t | The xiaowei naturally vary greatly in terms of their function. Around two hundred xiaowei are direct, user-facing micro-enterprises developing, for example, new white goods products, entirely new products such as water purification equipment, and financial products. They actively use numerous online platforms with millions of customers participating in the process of designing, producing, and using Haier products, while keeping the platforms open to external entrepreneurs to join as partners. Most of the other xiaowei are \"node micro-enterprises,\" which provide products and services to user-facing micro-enterprises (for example, xiaowei of road transport providers and supply chain xiaowei of factory workers).\nlvae | The corporate headquarters provides support for all of these xiaowei, allocates corporate resources, and sets the strategic direction for the entire organization. The corporate headquarters fulfills the conventional strategy-setting headquarters functions and provides corporate services such as HR and marketing through dedicated platforms. However, it is also partly organized as a xiaowei. For example, the corporate legal team operates as a xiaowei that can draw up standard contracts between other micro-enterprises for a fee, while a xiaowei of the communications department develops a cartoon series to help increase merchandise sales and generate additional revenues.\no9sc | The latest iteration of Haier's management practice has been labeled \"Rendanheyi 2.0\" and is close to Zhang's vision of Haier's organizational form in the twenty-first century. Rendanheyi is, therefore, a platform management innovation, that is, it contains a number of specific, interrelated practices. In a historical perspective, this is a logical third phase in Haier's development as a management innovator. In the first phase, prior to Rendanheyi, the company primarily copied management practices developed elsewhere (such as Business Process Engineering), with varying degrees of success. In the second phase, Rendanheyi\n121u | Management Innovation Made in China: Haier's Rendanheyi\nzh03 | one point zero, the company first created some of its own stand-alone management practices. Now, with Rendanheyi two point zero, Haier is successfully creating a number of inter-linked practices. Haier is likely to continue to create specific new practices under the Rendanheyi platform.\n1mvw | It may be somewhat premature to discuss the effectiveness of Rendanheyi, in particular, the effectiveness of xiaowei that have only been in existence since two thousand fourteen. However, the success of Rendanheyi can possibly be gleaned from Haier's growth in profit margins. When Rendanheyi was first introduced in two thousand five, Haier Group's profit margins were estimated at below three percent to four percent compared with six percent to eight percent for rivals such as Whirlpool. In two thousand fifteen, the net profit margin of Qingdao Haier Company Ltd. (one of two listed Haier Group companies) was five point seven percent compared with Whirlpool Corporation's three point nine percent. And with Rendanheyi two point zero, Haier Group's profits increased twelve point eight percent to twenty point three billion yuan (US dollar two point nine billion) between two thousand fifteen and two thousand sixteen, while the group's revenue rose six point eight percent to two hundred one point six billion yuan (US dollar twenty-nine point three billion). A key element of Rendanheyi two point zero has been the Internet platforms that connect Haier with its users-the volume of transactions on such platforms rose seventy-three percent to two hundred seventy-two point seven billion yuan (US dollar thirty-nine point six billion) between two thousand fifteen and two thousand sixteen.\n```",
