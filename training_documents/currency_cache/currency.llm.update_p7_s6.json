        "content": "21dc | Designed as a socially responsible public good, a local currency may be administered by a tax-exempt nonprofit organization. Operating as a recognized nonprofit organization is beneficial in terms of federal policy. For local fiat currency systems that are not pegged to the United States dollar, operating as a nonprofit allows the currency organization to be exempt from the Securities Act of nineteen thirty-three. Without this exemption, currency organizations would have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, abide by disclosure, privacy, and other administrative requirements, and pay related fees. For time banks and LETS, the IRS has provided private guidance that operating as a nonprofit is a condition which might help ensure a time bank is not considered a \"barter exchange,\" thus avoiding additional ten ninety-nine B reporting responsibilities under the United States.\nzw7x | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT\n8zk4 | Treasury regulations. Though nonprofits may gain trust and promote community values, without sufficient resources they may face difficulties in administering local currencies. In fact, nonprofit currency managers often rely on volunteer staffing and tend to use on word-of-mouth advertising rather than employing more professional marketing methods.\n8nk0 | Other federal laws apply to the look and denomination of complementary currencies. These restrictions are most applicable to proxy and fiat currency systems that print and distribute bills. The production of metal coins, money similar in look to United States national currency, or currencies with denominations of less than one dollar is banned. Notably, the Supreme Court has ruled that the prohibition of denominations of less than one dollar does not apply to currencies with \"only a neighborhood circulation.\" This suggests that local currencies may be able to issue denominations of less than one dollar, but the legislation remains in the United States Code with no modern ruling to clarify the meaning of neighborhood circulation. As a result of these laws, printed local currencies have unique design features that set them apart from United States national currency. If currency systems desire coins, they may use materials other than metal to make coins, but the prohibition of denominations less than one dollar could inhibit the currency's usefulness for small purchases.\n89e4 | There are at least two situations in which federal laws with administrative requirements may apply to local currency systems. LETS are considered barter exchanges in the United States and the reporting responsibilities for barter exchanges can be substantial. Specifically, the United States Treasury requires barter exchanges with over one hundred transactions per year to issue a ten ninety-nine Bs for each transaction in excess of one dollar made by a non-corporate\n9bon | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT\ngmw8 | member. LETS like the Green America Exchange, which have only business members, are able to issue ten ninety-nine Bs on an annual basis because their members are businesses, but LETS with individual members are required to provide the paperwork at the time of each individual exchange.\n6bja | The second potential set of administrative requirements comes from the Bank Secrecy Act of nineteen seventy which applies to money transmitters. It is possible that local currency systems with electronic exchanges may be subject to it. Businesses covered by the act must become licensed and provide reports to regulatory agencies. Though the regulation suggests that local currency systems might not fall under its reach, it states that whether or not a business is covered is \"a matter of facts and circumstances\" without a precise explanation of what the facts and circumstances entail. FinCEN, the branch of government that enforces the act, has not provided guidance on the applicability of the act to local currencies. If the act does apply, small local currency operations could find compliance with the act burdensome.\nsu5i | In addition to currency managers, participants are also affected by federal policy. For a currency system to be viable, it must attract and retain members who use the currency. One major disincentive to full use of local currency is that money earned in local currency is taxable income, yet the federal and state taxes must be paid in United States dollars. In fact, the United States Constitution prohibits states from accepting \"any Thing but gold and silver coin\" as payments. Even though payment by gold and silver coin is no longer customary, it does not follow that local currency can be accepted. This provision means that users of local currency must also acquire enough United States dollars to pay their tax liabilities, even when the liabilities are incurred in local currency. The ability to pay taxes in a particular\n15ws | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT\nss8f | currency is what validates it and without this characteristic, local currency may struggle. Consider some fiat systems in which currency accumulates with businesses who are unable to spend it in the same amount they receive it due to the lack of commercial vendors who will accept the currency. As a result, the businesses may limit the amount they accept or decline to participate in the system altogether. A healthy local currency system needs participating businesses. If participating businesses could pay taxes in local currency, this problem would be diminished.\n6pdd | State Law\ncof8 | With some notable exceptions, most states allow private local currency. Arkansas prohibits its issuance by individuals or corporations. Massachusetts bans the issuance and use of currency that is not created by a bank incorporated in the state. Lastly, Virginia prohibits issuance of local currency without specific authorization by law. Florida and Massachusetts have state laws that prohibit counterfeiting, but appropriately designed community currencies would not be considered counterfeits.\n2ppr | Supporting Local Currency through Policy\n5ljm | Widespread use of community currency is difficult to achieve without government support. After a massive review of complementary currency literature and publications, Schroeder and colleagues concluded the need for policy change to help local currencies prosper. Internationally, government support has been given to currency systems and may serve as a model for policy support in the United States. Examples of international as well as domestic policy support illustrate how government bodies can encourage local currencies.\neymg | Local Policy Supports\n3inv | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT",
