Following equation five, one finds G of D by taking the sum of the multiples of each x subscript I with all x subscript J s within D of all I as a proportion of the sum of all x subscript I x subscript J. Moran's I, on the other hand, is often used to measure the correlation of each x subscript I with all x subscript J s within D of I and, therefore,\nw2yn | G subscript min equals one seven zero divided by two four five zero equals zero point zero six nine four. variance of G subscript min equals zero point zero zero zero zero from equation seven.\nap6l | is based on the degree of covariance within D of all x subscript I.
