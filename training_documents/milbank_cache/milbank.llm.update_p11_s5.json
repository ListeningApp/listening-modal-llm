Based on the existing scholarship in the field and the conceptual model we have described, table one shows a typology of the principal forms of PHLR studies. In this section, we describe the major methodological approaches relevant to studying each of the paths described.\no56m | Policymaking Studies\nslz6 | Studies of policymaking processes are a mainstay of political science and sociology. They explore issues such as the determinants of legislative, administrative, and judicial lawmaking; lawmaking processes; and stakeholders' use of law to achieve their goals. Although in broad terms, the policy process does not vary by topic area, health policymaking has generated a substantial research literature focusing on how generic policymaking processes unfold in a health context. This literature treats policymaking processes as among the legal practices affecting the potential for law to promote health.\n90k5 | Advocacy groups have traditionally been crucial instigators of health law, and researchers of \"legal mobilization\" have studied how advocates have integrated legislation and litigation into their strategies. The relative advantages of litigation versus legislative approaches have been investigated empirically and debated in public health law scholarship, as have the factors influencing legislative outcomes.\n9m8s | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health\n893y | and the legislative process. Of particular interest to PHLR are studies examining how research evidence influences policymakers. Other work has looked at the behavior and strategies of policy actors, for example, how they use devices such as preemption and litigation to shift policy battles into forums where they have a greater chance of success, how community organizations may be brought more effectively into the lawmaking or law enforcement process, and how consulting can be used to more effectively translate research knowledge for policymakers. There has been growing interest in the question of how model laws are developed for public health purposes, and whether and under what circumstances model legislation is more likely than other proposals to be enacted.\nfavz | Both quantitative and qualitative methods may be appropriate for policymaking studies. Econometric analysis is useful for examining the extent to which various observable characteristics of a state or local government-such as the political party in control of the legislature and the health status of the population-predict the likelihood that a particular kind of law will pass. For example, researchers have used multivariate regression to examine predictors of state legislative action on childhood obesity. Such research may make important contributions by identifying \"friendly\" venues for experimentation with new public health law approaches and suggesting strategies for spreading successful policies to other jurisdictions.\n7szx | For obtaining a rich understanding of the policymaking process, qualitative methods are unmatched. Interview methods are commonly and effectively used to understand the factors that lead policymakers to take or fail to take particular actions. Researchers have, for instance, conducted interviews with state legislators and their staff to study those factors enabling and inhibiting the passage of obesity prevention laws. Content analysis is another useful method of exploring political deliberations that occur \"on the record,\" for example, legislative hearings and debate concerning particular public health issues or legislation, and the notice-and-comment process of administrative agency rule making. Researchers have used content analysis to explore, for example, the use of evidence and argumentation in debates\nhx9e | over workplace smoking legislation. Although it may be difficult to generalize the results of qualitative studies across jurisdictions, the high-resolution picture of the policymaking environment that they provide can have great value in formulating strategies for advancing evidence-based public health law.\nywn2 | Mapping Studies\na63r | PHLR includes studies that gather purely legal data for empirical purposes: information about the prevalence and distribution of specific laws, what levels of government have relevant authority, and variations in the characteristics of the law across jurisdictions and over time. Methods may include content analysis of legal texts (laws, regulations, court decisions, etc.), qualitative research designed to elicit information from officials and others who are knowledgeable about the state of the law, or a combination of the two approaches. Although no independent/dependent variable relationship is studied, these studies can be scientific-and therefore fall within the field of PHLR-if they involve the systematic collection and analysis of data using replicable methods.\ndqvj | Mapping studies often contribute information that is useful in its own right-state and local policymakers are keen to know what other jurisdictions are doing and what they might consider borrowing or learning from policy experiments in other jurisdictions. Mapping studies, however, are typically an early phase of larger projects designed to evaluate the magnitude and nature of the effects of laws on health. Properly conducted, they provide for the reliable and valid measurement of the key explanatory variable(s) in such studies. Thus, a rigorously conducted mapping study follows a systematic review protocol. It specifies a definition of the type of law being investigated, perhaps with explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria; a search methodology that acknowledges the strengths and weaknesses of extant databases; and a coding scheme identifying the main features of the laws, such as the population covered and enforcement mechanisms specified. They may also characterize laws according to some overall scale of stringency, scope, or strength through transparent and reproducible means. For example, a recent mapping study of state laws\nr17u | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health\n3c47 | regulating sales of sugar-sweetened beverages in schools coded laws according to seven substantive features and eight process features and then grouped the laws into \"strong,\" \"moderate,\" and \"weak\" categories. We stress that analysis of this kind, though essential to empirical legal research, does not exhaust legal scholarship on laws, eliminate the serious challenges often entailed in interpreting what the law \"is,\" or replace serious discussion of what the law ought to be.\ng345 | Implementation Studies\n```",
