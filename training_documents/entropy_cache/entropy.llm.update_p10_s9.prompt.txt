You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

b1vx | Given all this, we can derive a formula for the entropy S of some hydrogen gas as a function of its temperature T, the number N of molecules, the volume V, and a physical constant k called 'Boltzmann's constant'. This formula also involves a rather surprising constant which I'm calling y. We'll figure that out too. It's so weird I don't want to give it away!
4i6r | As a warmup, we will derive the formula for the entropy of an ideal 'monatomic' gas a gas made of individual atoms, like helium or neon or argon. Sackur and Tetrode worked this out in 1912. Their result, called the Sackur-Tetrode equation, is similar to the one for a diatomic gas.
a3i4 | But before doing a monatomic gas, we'll figure out the entropy of a single atom of gas in a box. That turns out to be a good start, since in an ideal monatomic gas the atoms don't interact, and the entropy of N atoms-as we'll see is just N times the entropy of a single atom.
heua | But before we can do any of this, we need to understand what entropy is, and how to compute it. It will take quite a bit of time to compute the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator! But from then on, the rest is surprisingly quick.
g2u7 | FIVE KINDS OF ENTROPY
5l9k | Entropy in thermodynamics: the change in entropy as we change a system's internal energy by an infinitesimal amount dE while keeping it in thermal equilibrium is dS = dE/T, where T is the temperature.
5zaz | Entropy in classical statistical mechanics: S = -k fx P(x) In(p(x))du(x) where p is a probability distribution on the measure space (X, u) of states and k is Boltzmann's constant.
pc7u | Entropy in quantum statistical mechanics: S = - ktr(pln p) where p is a density matrix.
5554 | Entropy in information theory: H = - Liex Pi log pi where p is a probability distribution on the set X.
bijr | Algorithmic entropy: the entropy of a string of symbols is the length of the shortest computer program that prints it out.
i2gp | Before I actually start explaining entropy, a warning: it can be hard at first to learn about entropy because there are many kinds-and people often don't say which kind they're talking about. Here are 5 kinds. Luckily, they are closely related!
xq5u | In thermodynamics we primarily have a formula for the change in entropy: if you change the internal energy of a system by an infinitesimal amount dE while keeping it in thermal equilibrium, the infinitesimal change in entropy is dS = dE/T where T is the temperature.
kbyk | Later, in classical statistical mechanics, Gibbs explained entropy in terms of a prob- ability distribution p on the space of states of a classical system. In this framework, entropy is the integral of -pln p times a constant k called Boltzmann's constant.
uulj | Later von Neumann generalized Gibbs' formula for entropy from classical to quantum statistical mechanics! He replaced the probability distribution p by a so-called density matrix p, and the integral by a trace.
e3k9 | Later Shannon invented information theory, and a formula for the entropy of a probability distribution on a set (often a finite set). This is often called 'Shannon entropy'. It's just a special case of Gibbs' formula for entropy in classical statistical mechanics, but without the Boltzmann's constant.
5biw | Later still, Kolmogorov invented a formula for the entropy of a specific string of symbols. It's just the length of the shortest program, written in bits, that prints out this string. It depends on the computer language, but not too much.
n108 | There's a network of results connecting all these 5 concepts of entropy. I will first explain Shannon entropy, then entropy in classical statistical mechanics, and then en- tropy in thermodynamics. While this is the reverse of the historical order, it's the easiest way to go.
nyac | I will not explain entropy in quantum statistical mechanics: for that I would feel compelled to teach you quantum mechanics first. Nor will I explain algorithmic entropy.
2cn1 | FROM PROBABILITY TO INFORMATION
c3m1 | How much information do you get when you learn an event of prob- ability <LATEX>p</LATEX> has happened? It's
