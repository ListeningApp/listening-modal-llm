        "content": "z8f7 | where C subscript c is the carbon dioxide concentration at the carboxylating sites of Rubisco, Gamma superscript star is the carbon dioxide compensation point in the absence of\n7w7j | Phi subscript two is the photochemical efficiency of photosystem two electron transport, rho subscript two is the fraction of the absorbed photons partitioned to photosystem two, and F subscript act is the factor accounting for fractions of alternative electron transport. So, the term left parenthesis Phi subscript two rho subscript two I subscript abs right parenthesis is the flux of photosystem two electron transport. Parameters F subscript act and O subscript two fied by the extended model as:\n51vd | F subscript act equals one minus the fraction f subscript pseudo divided by one minus f subscript cvc. rho subscript two equals the fraction one minus f subscript cyc divided by one minus f subscript cyc plus Phi subscript two divided by Phi subscript l. Equation two\nbaj1 | Equation three\nn1wo | where Phi subscript one is the photochemical efficiency of photosystem one electron transport, F subscript cyc is the fraction of the photosystem one electron flux that follows the cyclic electron transport around photosystem one, and F subscript pseudc is the fraction of the photosystem one electron flux that follows the pseudocyclic electron transport (defined as all noncyclic electron-consuming pathways other than the Calvin cycle or the photorespiratory cycle).\n5bq3 | Equation one suggests that changes not only in R subscript d (Figure two a), but also in Gamma superscript star over C subscript c, Phi subscript two, F subscript act and rho subscript two, with increasing I subscript abs, result in changes in the slope of A versus I subscript abs. Notably, Farquhar and Busch recently demonstrated that as a result of regulation of stomatal conductance left parenthesis g subscript s right parenthesis and mesophyll conductance left parenthesis g subscript m right parenthesis, C subscript c decreased (thus Gamma superscript star over C subscript c increased) sharply with increasing I subscript abs within the range of low irradiances, and that this phenomenon accounted for much of the observed Kok effect (Figure two b). A similar argument might be applied to Phi subscript two (Figure two c), as Phi subscript two is not constant but decreases with increasing I subscript abs, even within the range of low irradiances within which the Kok method is used to estimate R subscript four and Phi subscript carbon dioxide. Accounting for\nezla | the decrease of Phi subscript two with increasing irradiance has resulted in a modified method to estimate R subscript d. The analysis using the modified method, now known as the Yin method, indicates that the inhibition of R subscript d by light is less than the original Kok method suggests.",
