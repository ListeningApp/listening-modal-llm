You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

Computing the optimal value <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star }</LATEX> defined in (3.13) requires computing the second-order response, as discussed in Section 3.3. In particular, this is done by using the recursive expression (2.25), obtained from the Fokker-Planck equation via formal asymptotics. We reformulate (2.25) for Feynman- Kac systems to compute the second-order response, using that, in view of (A.3),
7s4b | <LATEX>\bar { \psi } _ { 2 , \alpha } = \left( - \mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } \right) ^ { \dagger } \left[ \left( \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } ^ { \dagger } + \alpha \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { e x t r a } } ^ { \dagger } \right) \bar { \psi } _ { 1 } - \bar { \lambda } _ { 2 , \alpha } \psi _ { 0 } \right] ,</LATEX> where the value of <LATEX>\bar { \lambda } _ { 2 , \alpha }</LATEX> is determined by (A.5). This procedure could be extended to arbitrary orders by identifying terms with the same orders in <LATEX>\eta</LATEX> in (A.1).
ehif | the density of the invariant probability measure for the systems at hand, namely over- damped Langevin dynamics in one and two dimensions, and Langevin dynamics in one dimension. This approach can be straightforwardly extended to solving Poisson equations with nontrivial right-hand sides such as (2.23) or the integrand in the as- ymptotic variance (2.43). We start each section by first discussing the discretizations associated with the equilibrium dynamics, after which we mention the modification needed when adding perturbations.
buv0 | For all systems, the spatial domain, namely the torus Td = [0, 1)d, is discretized into ma points with uniform step size hq = 1/mq in each direction. While Vn denotes the invariant measure at the continuous level, we use th to denote its discretized counterpart, namely the approximations of the values of Un at the grid points.
wqqa | B.1. Overdamped Langevin dynamics. For a continuous function u: T -> R, we denote by [u]¿ = u(Qi), where Qi = ihq are the mesh points. Similarly, for a continuous function u: T2 -> R, we denote by [u]i,j = u(Qi,j), where Qi,j = (ihq, jhq) are the mesh points. The Fokker-Planck equation to discretize for the overdamped Langevin dynamics (2.11) reads
www8 | (B.1) [ % = div (V /0) + =AV0 = VTV1/0 + AV 40 + -A40.
zhvt | Using centered finite differences, the discretization of (B.1) in dimension one is given by

8sqd | Periodic boundary conditions are imposed, i.e. [b]o = [40]ma. In two dimensions, applying centered finite differences to the Fokker-Planck (B.1) yields

9lvu | Periodic boundary conditions are imposed, i.e. [V]o,: = [V]mq; and [],0 = [4];mg.
uy7a | Discretization of perturbations. We now consider several classes of perturbation operators. One typical form is L = FTV, with F = (F1, F2) E R2 for two-dimensional dynamics. Its L2-adjoint acts as
lqs6 | (B.3) Etyo = - div(F)vo - FT Vyo.
ri4s | Perturbations of this form include the physical perturbations Lphys considered through- out this work, divergence-free vector fields (3.5), and the differential term in the Feynman-Kac forcing (3.9). In dimension one, the-right hand side of (B.3) is dis- cretized with a centered finite difference as
2j8o | - [F][ V] - [F] [b]i+1 -[b]i-1 2hg .

uvvk | In dimension two, perturbations of the form (B.3) are discretized with centered finite differences as

mwy0 | [V]i+1,1 - [V]i-1] + [2]
hg8q | - ([F]i, j
rcyg | 2hq
bj8l | Another example is the modified fluctuation-dissipation perturbation (3.8), pre- ceeded by a factor on as presented in this work. Since it corresponds to the gener- ator (2.12) of the dynamics at hand, its discretization corresponds in any dimension to rescaling the discretized Fokker-Planck by (1 + an).
cygk | We also consider zero order operators, such as the source term for the Feynman- Kac forcing (3.9), namely TVV. As terms of this form include no differential oper- ators acting on yo, their discretization is trivially done, in any dimension, by direct evaluation, e.g. [V] [V] in dimension one.
rtk7 | B.2. Langevin 1D. For the one-dimensional Langevin dynamics, we discretize the unbounded momentum space as follows: we first truncate it to [-Pmax, Pmax], then discretize it into mp interior points with uniform step size hp = 2pmax/(mp -1). For a continuous function u: Tx R -> R, we denote by [u]i,j = u(Qi, Pj), where Qi = ihq and Pj = jhp are the mesh points.
1wc3 | The numerical scheme for the Fokker-Planck equation (2.17) for Langevin dy- namics is obtained with centered finite differences, except for the transport term pr M-1Vqyo, where an upwind scheme is used (see below for details). In dimension one, (2.17) reads
