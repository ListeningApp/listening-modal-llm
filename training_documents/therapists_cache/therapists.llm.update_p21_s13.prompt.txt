You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

40ry | CASE EXAMPLE 4.7 The Problem-Solving Mode
d1j2 | Madam Bouchard is a 47-year-old woman with schizoaffective disorder. She was admitted to the inpatient unit after a police officer arrested her for driving on the wrong side of traffic on a highway at 5:00 in the morning. She was brought to the hospi- tal because she seemed lost and confused about the incident.
wstc | At the beginning of therapy, Madam Bouchard was hypersensitive about the sounds, expressions, and movements made by me and the other ther- apists on her care team. She would often misin- terpret the intentions behind very benign and meaningless body movements as being judgmental, menacing, or threatening. When participating in activities, she fixated on environmental stimuli and on my nonverbal reactions to her rather than con- centrating on the activity itself. She often expressed a fear that staff (including me) would keep her in the hospital indefinitely and that we intended to physically harm her. (I discovered that these fears stemmed from an abusive relationship with her hus- band, and I initiated a social work intervention to address the situation.)
ba1e | One of the many goals of individual therapy sessions with Madam Bouchard involved reducing her interpersonal anxiety, hypersensitivity, and misinterpretations of nonverbal behaviors during interactions. I arranged a series of structured craft activities with specific steps that would lead to rep- lication of a real-life object (e.g., weaving a basket, painting watercolor according to a model, making a drinking cup out of clay according to a model). These activities allowed Madam Bouchard to orient to reality and center her thinking in the present moment. To address her interpersonal anxieties, I also engaged in other types of craft activities along- side her. I selected my activities based on their po-

l3do | tential to force me to move and be physically active during our sessions.
u9bo | The fact we worked beside each other on a separate activity gave ample opportunity for Madam Bouchard to interpret my gestures and reactions. Once she was emotionally stable and centered in her activity, I would initiate a medium level of phys- ical activity in the room related to completing my craft. Then I would invite her to share her percep- tion of a specific recent situation in which I moved in her presence. If her perception was correct, I would affirm its accuracy.
7avo | If her perception was incorrect and not based in reality, I used strategic questions to inquire about the basic point of reference that prompted her to arrive at her conclusion. If my questioning did not lead her to recognize that the reality of our here-and-now interaction was different from her internal thoughts and worries, I invited Madam Bouchard to engage in hypothesis testing. I would introduce a set of alternative hypotheses for inter- preting my movements and nonverbal reactions during the session. Together, we analyzed each pos- sibility using a problem-solving approach. To make our analysis concrete, I wrote the options down on paper or on a dry-erase board. The objective of this problem-solving exercise was to introduce the possibility of doubt into her misperceptions and to broaden her viewpoint regarding the myriad possi- ble motives behind another person's actions.
uzo6 | This process allowed Madam Bouchard to verbally express and describe her perceptions with- out fear of judgment. It also allowed her to practice utilizing reasoning as a means of testing the accu- racy of her interpretations of other people's social behaviors. Over time, she naturally used problem- solving as a means of coping with her worries and fears concerning her relationships with others.
89b4 | for example, facilitate their clients to better manage and clarify their time, priorities, and plan for the future by listing plans and activities on a calendar and comparing them practically and ideologically. To resolve interper- sonal difficulties with clients, therapists functioning in the problem-solving mode are likely to structure the dialogue and outline guidelines for the negotiation of differences.
5f7e | Strengths of the Problem-Solving Mode
h83u | By asking questions, co-creating lists, and enabling clients to think differently about problems or obstacles, thera- pists interact with their clients on a more cognitive and intellectual level. Thus, this mode is most appropriate for clients (young or old) who are able to engage verbally, and in a reciprocally cerebral way, with the therapist. Clients uncomfortable with a more emotion-focused approach to the therapeutic relationship may feel more at ease with the structure, predictability, and intellectualism (in the case of more advanced dialogue) conveyed by therapists using the problem-solving mode (Fig. 4.9).
kjoa | Cautions of the Problem-Solving Mode
wb1c | As with other modes, it is impossible for the problem-solving mode to work with all clients in all situations. When thera- pists function in the problem-solving mode, some are vul- nerable to overutilize agenda-focused questioning without paying enough attention to other interpersonal needs that the client may bring to the relationship. Some may find a therapist's adoption of such questions reassuring or en- lightening, whereas others may interpret the therapist's behavior as too strategic or even manipulative. Therapists
ak13 | comfortable with approaches that require more emotion- ally intense levels of interaction and communication. Ad- ditionally, as stated earlier, not all clients will be able or inclined to engage in a reciprocal verbal exchange of this nature with their therapists.
s7el | Modes in Perspective
0lfu | The six therapeutic modes described in this chapter are based on frequently observed interpersonal behaviors that occur in occupational therapy. Although examples of how each of these modes is used in practice are provided, there is no single "typical" manner in which a therapist might enact a mode or a set of modes when working with a client. For example, as noted in Table 4.1, a mode may be delivered with a statement, a question, or, in some cases, nonverbally. It is important to remember that, with the exception of the advocating mode and the problem-solving mode, the four other modes may be delivered nonverbally or verbally. For example, the empathizing mode may be enacted by sitting with a client silently until the client feels ready to talk. The instructing mode may be conveyed by wearing a serious expression and extending a hand to greet a client rather than indulging the client's ongoing attempts to embrace.
cnjl | Similar to all forms of communication, the intensity with which each mode is enacted may (and should) change according to the client's interpersonal characteristics and the therapeutic context. For example, the encouraging mode may be communicated to a client in a quiet and sub- tle manner when a client smiles slightly and quietly states: "When I walked by your room this morning, I saw that you were sitting up. It looked like you were practicing your fin- ger exercises." It may be enacted with the same client in a more obvious manner when the therapist wears a big smile and, with an enthusiastic tone of voice, states more loudly: "You made that toilet transfer on your very first try!"
jr68 | Mode Shifting
axix | According to the IRM, mode shifting (i.e., shifting from one of the six modes to another of the six modes) is de- sirable. It is the central part of the interpersonal reason- ing process; blended and incongruent mode use, which will be covered in the next section, is not. Thus far, the modes have been discussed and illustrated in isolation of each other. However, there are countless possibilities for ways in which it is optimal for a therapist to switch modes in specific sequences. Modes may and should be used
