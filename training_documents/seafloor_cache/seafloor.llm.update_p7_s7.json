        "content": "pujl | The Tinakula SMS deposit consists of a series of over nine hundred chimneys and mound complexes distributed over a strike length of approximately one thousand fifty meters along the row of cinder cones and composite cones. The chimneys and mounds are located mainly at the tops and along the flanks of the cinder cones, as well as inside the summit craters. They also occur in the center of each of the maar-like craters in the north. West of the row of cinder cones, over a strike length of approximately four hundred meters, the chimneys and mounds are not spatially associated with observable volcanic features at the seafloor but instead appear to occur along two partially buried northeast-southwest and northwest-southeast structures.\n\n3rqe | The chimneys at Tinakula are less than one to fifteen meters high (typically two to eight meters) and include typical multispired sulfide structures with central vent orifices and, more commonly, chimneys with irregular morphologies (bulbous, drooping, with smooth or popcorn-textured outer surfaces). The\n\nnsi3 | bulbous chimneys lack central orifices and have a morphology similar to those of beehives or flange-type chimneys. The chimneys are commonly surrounded by sulfide talus and grow on top of low-relief hydrothermal mounds that typically rise approximately two to three meters from the seafloor. The extent of these mounds is largely unknown due to burial by volcaniclastic sediments, but they appear to make up the bulk of the mineralization at the seafloor, accounting for about two-thirds of the total amount of identified massive sulfide. Individual chimney mound complexes can be traced for up to seventy meters on the seafloor. Where exposed, the mound material is distinctly laminated with layers of barite and sulfide minerals up to zero point five meters thick, and they have unexpectedly smooth surfaces. The layered barite-sulfide mounds are most similar to features described from the East Diamante caldera in the Mariana arc. The sulfide deposits are mostly inactive, and the surrounding volcaniclastic sediment is widely indurated and locally mineralized. Active venting is limited to a few sites with shimmering water at the base of chimneys or along fractures in the indurated sediments, associated with bacterial mats. Venting of white to gray smoke from chimney spires is rare. Fe-Mn oxides are widespread along fractures in the seafloor, extending up to one hundred meters away from the chimney complexes and mounds. Abundant less than one-meter-tall Fe and Mn oxyhydroxide chimneys and silica-rich chimneys are associated with bacterial mats and occur along the fractures.\n\nnil3 | The surface expression of hydrothermal precipitates covers approximately seventy-seven thousand meters squared, including approximately thirteen thousand eight hundred meters squared of active chimneys and mounds, fifty-one thousand eight hundred meters squared of inactive chimneys and mounds, and nine thousand three hundred meters squared of partially buried chimneys and mounds. Areas of low-temperature venting, dominated by Fe and Mn oxides, occur over an additional one hundred thirty thousand meters squared (ninety-one thousand meters squared of Fe oxides and thirty-eight thousand meters squared of Mn oxides), although these areas commonly overlap those of the chimneys and mounds. The area of subseafloor sulfide mineralization is not completely known, so the full size of the deposit could be much larger. The areal extent of this deposit is significant compared to others discovered along mid-ocean ridges and along arcs and back-arc basins; fewer than ten percent have dimensions larger than five thousand meters squared. Modern sulfide deposits with comparable sizes (by area) include the Solwara One deposit in the Eastern Manus basin (ninety thousand meters squared) and the Mir zone, Ashadze-One, and Ashadze-Two deposits on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (fifty thousand meters squared each). It should be emphasized, however, that the large areal footprint of the Tinakula deposit may not necessarily correlate with a large tonnage of massive sulfide.\n\n68a1 | Methods",
