You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

o2kr | Alternative k = - 1 loop quantum cosmology
v6sk | An alternative quantization of the gravitational Hamiltonian constraint of the k = - 1 Friedmann-Robertson- Walker model is proposed by treating the Euclidean term and the Lorentzian term independently, mimicking the treatment of full loop quantum gravity. The resulting Hamiltonian constraint operator for the k = - 1 model with a massless scalar field is successfully constructed, and is shown to have the corrected classical limit. Compared to the former quantization schemes in the literature where only the Euclidean term is quantized, the new quantum dynamics of the k = - 1 model with a massless scalar field indicates that the classical big-bang singularity is replaced by an asymmetric quantum bounce.
1wj6 | I. INTRODUCTION
936l | How to quantize general relativity (GR) in a consistent manner is a great challenge to theoretical physics. One of the promising candidates is the so-called loop quantum grav- ity (LQG) which is a nonperturbative approach to quantum GR [1-4]. In the past three decades, LQG has made remark- able progress, such as making the natural predictions of the discretized geometries and providing the microscopic inter- pretation of BH entropy [5-12]. The nonperturbative quanti- zation procedure of LQG has been successfully applied to the metric f(R) theories [13, 14], scalar-tensor theories [15, 16], higher-dimensional gravity [17], and so on [18]. Despite these achievements, the dynamics of full LQG is still an unsolved issue. To gain a certain level of understanding of the dy- namics, the quantization ideas and technologies developed in LQG have also be applied to its symmetry-reduced mod- els, such as the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) models and the spherically symmetric black hole models, leading to loop quantum cosmology (LQC) and loop quantum black hole models [19, 20]. The most successful feature of LQC is that it can resolve the classical big bang singularity by a quan- tum bounce due to the quantum geometry effects. We refer to [19, 21-23] for more complete reviews on LQC.
06yq | In full LQG, the gravitational Hamiltonian constraint is a combination of the so-called Euclidean term and the Lorentzian term. In the spatially flat, k = 0 FRW model, the Lorentzian term and the Euclidean term are proportional to each other. Thus one often combines these two terms into one term proportional to the Euclidean term, and then quantizes the Euclidean term to obtain the well-defined gravitational Hamiltonian constraint operator [19, 22]. It turns out that in this quantization scheme the classical big-bang singularity is replaced by a symmetric quantum bounce for the k = 0 FRW model with a massless scalar field in the framework of LQC [22]. Note that in full LQG, the Lorentzian term is quantized independently by employing the Thiemann's trick [24]. Thus,
dpv6 | to mimic the full LQG quantization procedure in the k = 0 model of LQC, the Euclidean term and the Lorentzian term were treated independently [25-27]. This alternative quanti- zation scheme leads to an asymmetric quantum bounce, which relates the spatially flat FRW model with an asymptotic de Sit- ter universe, and thus an effective cosmological constant and an effective Newtonian constant can be obtained [28-30].
8r5j | As in the k = 0 model, the quantization technologies for the gravitational Hamiltonian constraint developed in LQG have been extended to the k = - 1, +1 models [31-38]. Compared to the k = 0 model where the spin connection vanishes and hence the Ashtekar connection equals to the extrinsic curva- ture multiplied by the Immirzi parameter, the Lorentzian term is not proportional to the total Euclidean term, but is propor- tional to the part of the Euclidean term involving the extrinsic curvature due to the nonvanishing spin connection for both the k = - 1 model and the k = +1 model. Hence in the literatures one often absorbs the Lorentzian term into a part of the Euclidean term, and then quantize the two parts of the Euclidean term, respectively. It turns out that, as the k = 0 model with the similar treatment, the resulting k = - 1 LQC model also predicts a vacuum repulsion in the high curvature regime that would lead to a symmetric bounce [31]. More- over, the k = - 1 model of LQC also possesses some new features that never appears in the k = 0 model, for example, due to a vacuum repulsion in the high curvature regime, the scale factor has the minimum value as amin = YVA [3]. It is natural to ask whether the treatment of the Lorentzian term independently, mimicking the treatment in the full the- ory, can be directly carried to the k = - 1 model, and whether an asymmetric bounce can still be held for the k = - 1 model. This is the main motivation of the present paper. In this paper, we consider an alternative quantization of the gravitational Hamiltonian constraint in the k = - 1 model by treating the Lorentzian term independently.
2taz | This paper is organized as follows. The canonical formula- tion of the k = - 1 model is briefly recalled in Sec. II. Then we propose an alternative gravitational Hamiltonian constraint operator by treating the Lorentzian term independently, and provide a new quantum dynamics for the k = - 1 model in Sec. III. The effective theory of the new quantum dynamics and its asymptotic behavior are studied in Sec. IV. Summary

r5il | II. CANONICAL FORMULATION OF THE <LATEX>k = - \quad 1</LATEX> MODEL
5gui | According to the cosmological principle, the line elements of the homogenous isotropic cosmological models take as
82qc | <LATEX>\mathrm { d } s ^ { 2 } = - \mathrm { d } t ^ { 2 } + a ^ { 2 } \left( t \right) \left[ \frac { 1 } { 1 - k r ^ { 2 } } \mathrm { d } r ^ { 2 } + r ^ { 2 } \left( \mathrm { d } \theta ^ { 2 } + \sin ^ { 2 } \theta \mathrm { d } \phi ^ { 2 } \right) \right] ,</LATEX> (2.1)
ls7d | where <LATEX>a \left( t \right)</LATEX> is the scale factor, and <LATEX>k = - \quad 1 , 0 , 1</LATEX> for the open, flat, and closed FRW models, respectively.
tzt3 | In what follows, we present the canonical formulation of the <LATEX>k = - 1 \mathrm { m o d e l }</LATEX> following Ref. [31]. For the spatially non- compact <LATEX>k =</LATEX> 0, -1 models with topology homeomorphic to <LATEX>\mathbb{R} ^ { 3 } ,</LATEX> one introduces an "elemental cell" <LATEX>\mathcal{V}</LATEX> on the homogeneous spatial manifold <LATEX>\mathbb{R} ^ { 3 }</LATEX> and restrict all integrals to this elemental cell. Then one chooses a fiducial metric <LATEX>{ } ^ { o } q _ { a b } = { } ^ { \circ } \omega _ { a } ^ { i } \omega _ { b } ^ { j } \delta _ { i j }</LATEX> on <LATEX>\mathbb{R} ^ { 3 }</LATEX> with <LATEX>{ } ^ { \circ } \omega _ { a } ^ { i }</LATEX> being the left- and right-invariant fiducial one- forms in the <LATEX>k = 0 \mathrm { m o d e l } ,</LATEX> and only the left-invariant fiducial one-forms in the <LATEX>k = - \quad 1</LATEX> model. Here <LATEX>a , b , \cdots .</LATEX> denote the spatial indices while <LATEX>i , j , \cdots = 1 , 2 , 3 .</LATEX> Denote <LATEX>V _ { a }</LATEX> the volume of V measured by the fiducial metric <LATEX>{ } ^ { o } q _ { a b } .</LATEX> The left-invariant one-forms <LATEX>{ } ^ { \circ } \omega _ { a } ^ { i }</LATEX> satisfy the Maurer-Cartan equation
t8vv | <LATEX>\mathrm { d } ^ { q } \omega ^ { i } + \frac { 1 } { 2 } C ^ { i } { } _ { j k } { } ^ { o } \omega ^ { j } { } ^ { o } \omega ^ { k } = 0 ,</LATEX> (2.2)
qvnu | where for the <LATEX>k = - \quad 1</LATEX> model the structure constants read
kggw | <LATEX>C _ { j k } ^ { i } = \delta _ { j } ^ { i } \delta _ { k 1 } - \delta _ { k } ^ { i } \delta _ { j 1 } ,</LATEX> (2.3)
xrd1 | while for the <LATEX>k = 0</LATEX> model they take zero. The correspond- ing left-invariant vector fields <LATEX>{ } ^ { o } e _ { i } ^ { a }</LATEX> are dual to <LATEX>{ } ^ { \circ } \omega _ { a } ^ { i } ,</LATEX> satisfying <LATEX>{ } ^ { o } e _ { i } ^ { a } { } ^ { o } \omega _ { a } ^ { j } = \delta _ { i } ^ { j } ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>{ } ^ { o } e _ { i } ^ { a } { } ^ { a } \omega _ { b } ^ { i } = \delta _ { b } ^ { a } .</LATEX> The commutators between the left-invariant vector fields read
5746 | <LATEX>\left[ { } ^ { o } e _ { i } , { } ^ { o } e _ { j } \right] = C ^ { k } { } _ { i j } { } ^ { o } e _ { k } .</LATEX> (2.4)
7toz | Classically, the dynamical variables of LQC are obtained by symmetrically reducing those of full LQG. In the full theory, the dynamical variables consist of the <LATEX>s u \left( 2 \right) - v a l u e d</LATEX> connec- tion <LATEX>A _ { a } ^ { i }</LATEX> and the densitized triad <LATEX>\widetilde { E } _ { j } ^ { b }</LATEX> with the nontrivial Poisson bracket
j346 | <LATEX>\left\{ A _ { a } ^ { i } \left( x \right) , \widetilde { E } _ { j } ^ { b } \left( y \right) \right\} = \kappa \gamma \delta _ { a } ^ { b } \delta _ { j } ^ { i } \delta \left( x , y \right) ,</LATEX> (2.5)
v8uq | where <LATEX>\kappa = 8 \pi G</LATEX> with <LATEX>G</LATEX> being the Newtonian constant, and <LATEX>\gamma</LATEX> is the Immirzi parameter [39, 40]. The connection <LATEX>A _ { a } ^ { \imath }</LATEX> is
x972 | related to the spin connection <LATEX>\Gamma _ { a } ^ { i }</LATEX> and the extrinsic curvature <LATEX>K _ { a } ^ { i }</LATEX> by <LATEX>A _ { a } ^ { i } = \Gamma _ { a } ^ { i } + \gamma K _ { a } ^ { i } .</LATEX> It turns out that the symmetry- reduced extrinsic curvature <LATEX>K _ { a } ^ { i }</LATEX> is diagonal in the basis of left- invariant one-forms for the <LATEX>k = 0 , - 1</LATEX> models. While, unlike the <LATEX>k = 0</LATEX> model where <LATEX>\Gamma _ { a } ^ { i }</LATEX> vanishes, the symmetry-reduced spin connection <LATEX>\Gamma _ { a } ^ { i }</LATEX> in the <LATEX>k = - \quad 1</LATEX> model takes the form [31]
cwrw | <LATEX>\Gamma _ { a } ^ { i } = - \epsilon ^ { 1 i j } { } ^ { o } \omega _ { a } ^ { j } ,</LATEX> (2.6)
4i0e | and thus it is nondiagonal. Hence the symmetry-reduced con- nection and densitized triad for the <LATEX>k = - \quad 1</LATEX> model read [31]
h2l3 | <LATEX>A _ { a } ^ { i } = - \epsilon ^ { 1 i j } { } ^ { o } \omega _ { a } ^ { j } + c V _ { o } ^ { - \frac { 1 } { 3 } } { } ^ { o } \omega _ { a } ^ { i } \equiv A _ { j } ^ { i } V _ { o } ^ { - \frac { 1 } { 3 } } { } ^ { o } \omega _ { a } ^ { j } ,</LATEX> (2.7)
dfzb | <LATEX>\widetilde { E } _ { i } ^ { a } = p V _ { o } ^ { - \frac { 2 } { 3 } } \sqrt { \det \left( { } ^ { o } q \right) } { } ^ { o } e _ { i } ^ { a } ,</LATEX> (2.8)

awvu | <LATEX>A _ { j } ^ { i } = \left( \begin{array}{} c & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & c & - V _ { o } ^ { \frac { 1 } { 3 } } \\ 0 & V _ { o } ^ { \frac { 1 } { 3 } } & c \end{array} \right) ,</LATEX> (2.9)
