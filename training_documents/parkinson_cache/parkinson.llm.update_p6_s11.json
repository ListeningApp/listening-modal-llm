Furthermore, loss of auxilin exacerbates alpha-synuclein overexpression and paraquat-mediated dopaminergic loss, thus aggravating previously established phenotypes in fly models of Parkinson's disease. Interestingly, the brains (deep\njrik | cerebellar nuclei) of adult homozygous auxilin knockout mice revealed an increased number of clathrin-coated vesicles and empty cages at the synapse. Similar defects were noted in primary cortical and hippocampal neurons accompanied by defective synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Also, impairment was not immediately detrimental to the neurons, which may explain the post-developmental onset of Parkinson's disease symptoms and slow disease progression. Evaluating whether similar disruptions occur in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and how it mediates pathogenesis will prove crucial in understanding the role of auxilin and the endolysosomal system in Parkinson's disease. An initial step towards this suggests that LRRK2 phosphorylates auxilin, attenuating auxilin's normal function in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons. The study further revealed that phosphorylation of auxilin by overexpressing LRRK2 leads to accumulation of oxidized dopamine and alpha-synuclein overexpression, pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease. Whether loss-of-function mutations in auxilin independently exert pathology through the same mechanisms is unknown. However, this newfound link between LRRK2 and auxilin points to the crucial and widespread involvement of the endolysosomal system in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.\nxv78 | GAK: GAK is another DNAJC family protein, homologous (approximately fifty percent) to auxilin but expressed throughout the body. In a meta-analysis of Parkinson's disease genome-wide association studies across thirteen thousand seven hundred eight patients and ninety-five thousand two hundred eighty-two controls, GAK was identified as a risk gene for Parkinson's disease which was confirmed in another recent large-scale study. However, GAK's role in Parkinson's disease is still contentious due to presence of mutations in TMEM175 in a nearby independent locus, which shares the same promoter as that of GAK. What adds credence is that, like auxilin, GAK functions in clathrin un-coating by recruiting Hsc seventy to clathrin-coated vesicles. Results show that GAK overexpression can partially compensate for loss of auxilin, which is also noted to upregulate naturally in auxilin-knockout mice. Another similarity between auxilin and GAK has been noted in their interaction with LRRK2. Brain-specific loss of GAK and ubiquitous knockout of GAK are both lethal (postnatal and embryonic, respectively). The inability of auxilin to compensate for GAK in these mice suggests another unique role for GAK in neurons, perhaps a significant one in dopaminergic neurons. Further TMEM175 deficiency is noted to cause Parkinson's disease-like alpha-synuclein aggregation, along with impairment of lysosomal and mitochondrial function. Clarity on the role of GAK will prove to be crucial not only in establishing its involvement in Parkinson's disease but also in consolidating clathrin-mediated endocytosis as the prime target in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.\nsdks | RME-eight: Receptor mediated endocytosis eight or DNAJC thirteen is another DNAJC family co-chaperone and principally functions in regulating retromer and clathrin un-coating dynamics on endosomes. RME-eight mutations in autosomal-dominant Parkinson's disease were noted first in a Dutch-German-Russian family of Mennonite origin, with multiple incidences. Post-mortem brains of Parkinson's disease patients with RME-eight mutations revealed strong immunoreactivity for Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra, along with brain areas implicated in non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Nigral Lewy bodies were also found to be co-localized with RME-eight. Unlike other DNAJC proteins\ny8fb | Three point two: Synaptojanin-one and endophilin A: Partners in crime?\n521q | implicated in Parkinson's disease, in vitro studies have revealed that, the RME-eight mutation confers toxic gain-of-function, leading to endolysosomal cargo trafficking deficits. The RME-eight mutation is also predicted to affect overall endosomal trafficking, even in the soma and postsynaptic compartment, unlike the synapse-specific dysfunction predicted for auxilin. Recently, the link between RME-eight and Parkinson's disease has been muddied by an independent analysis of the same Mennonite family which did not find RME-eight mutations. Instead, all the affected individuals were identified to carry mutations in TMEM230, which also functions in the endolysosomal system, perhaps at synapses. Hence, further studies are warranted to confirm the genetic link between RME-eight and Parkinson's disease. Still, evaluating the RME-eight mediated endolysosomal system dysfunction might provide valuable insights in understanding Parkinson's disease.\n```",
