You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

vbni | Health care administrators must support sustainable health care initiatives financially and socially through hospital policies. Governmental structures, including health care programs must be invested in sustainable health care through federal and state regulations, and local policies. Accreditation bodies that mange medical education, building safety, and health care professional licensure need to integrate sustainability into their ethos.
dgcw | 2. DISCOMFORT WITH WASTE
gvwz | Physicians and other health care providers are at the terminus of the production chain. As they provide care, they use and dispose of resources. When surveyed, a majority of surgeons and physicians were troubled by the amount of waste they generate.90 Obstetrician/ gynecologists91 and ophthalmologists exhibit similar concerns.92 The concept of moral distress has gener- ally been applied to end-of-life care,93 but it is also rel- evant for compulsory participation in unsustainable health care practices.94 Green initiatives may be an attempt to counteract environmental distress.
sk5m | IV. Towards Green Health Care Reform
qws8 | Effective health care reform will require compliance across the board. Health care administrators must support sustainable health care initiatives financially and socially through hospital policies. Governmental structures, including health care programs must be invested in sustainable health care through federal and state regulations, and local policies. Accredita- tion bodies that mange medical education, building safety, and health care professional licensure need to integrate sustainability into their ethos.95 These are, by and large, beyond the scope of this paper. Here, the focus will remain on developing areas of consensus for patient and physician participation in sustainability initiatives, since this at once provides a path to, and legitimizes, green health care reform.
877u | Among patients and physicians participating in green initiatives, there appears to be consensus
rzhj | around the themes of "health" and "ecology." Health - as an umbrella term for the wellbeing and harmony of the body and the planet - emerges as a focus of green initiatives. Both patients and physicians desire good physical health, which includes absence from pollu- tion and climate events. They also seek mental equi- librium by avoiding eco-anxiety and environmental moral distress. Many public health paradigms braid physical, mental, and environmental aspects of well-
bfax | being into one holistic model.96 These paradigms can be integrated into broader aspects of health care. Ecol- ogy is also an encompassing concept, which includes resource conservation, waste reduction, sustainable care, and carbon management. Both patients and physicians invested in green health care are working to lighten their carbon impact. It is likely that other forms of resource reduction would be considered in US health care as well.
f2y8 | Green health care reform will require sweeping implementation of sustainability initiatives. Patients and physicians can lobby health care plans and health care insurance companies by highlighting the values of health and ecology. The former can be developed through green health care plans for policyholders and the latter through green health care insurance companies.
o7qm | A. Health and the Green Health Care Plan
d52l | The most recent statistics on health care coverage in the US show that two thirds of Americans are privately insured.97 As part of the free market, the American health care system has the potential for great agility as it seeks to entice the individual patient-consumer. Sustainable health care plans can utilize existing frameworks of insurance coverage while respecting the environmental preferences of individual policyholders by, for instance, offering a "Green" tier of coverage in addition to Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum.98
qlbb | A Green tier health care plan would be a more sus- tainable choice than current health care insurance
nhsg | options. For instance, a Green tier health care plan may have a variety of low-carbon procedures to choose from. Preventative care initiatives, such as gym subsi- dies,99 would be more generously reimbursed, while extended medications, low-success treatments, or elective procedures may be limited. Green tier health care plans could be similar to the multi-level approach proposed by Tom Beauchamp and James Childress, whereby basic health care plans include "public health measures and preventive care, primary care, (and) acute care,"100 while minimizing financial burden to the policyholder. While there may be a concern that a Green tier health care plan would be the default offered by parsimonious employers, thus resulting in minimal coverage,101 sustainable health care plans may not be less expensive than other options.
hy0l | Indeed, the Green plan could cost more, and a percent of premiums could be put towards ensuring that the health care plan provider is offering the most sustainable option, similar to buying "carbon offsets" when one purchases an airline ticket102 or paying more for a health care plan with more coverage. In the for- mer scenario, the extra cost is voluntarily incurred for the environmental trade-off, or because it is required by law.103 In the latter, the extra cost is seen as value- added to a necessary service. As with other sustain- able, but more expensive options, the individual who chooses the green health care plan would likely feel satisfied knowing that she is making the better envi- ronmental choice.
4jmz | Since health care plan tiers are the voluntary choice of policyholders, the individual would enjoy the appar- ent "sacrifice" they are making in limiting certain high- carbon options, while still being assured of quality, value-driven care. An analogy might be choosing a veg- etarian meal at a restaurant. Not everyone will want to "give up" meat, but those attuned to health, carbon expenditure, and the moral claims of others will readily make a sustainable choice, and indeed, be distressed if there are not opportunities to express one's envi- ronmental values. And, like any health care plan, an individual could switch to a different tier during open enrolment if they wanted more resource intensive options, or pay out of pocket for non-covered services.
b7cq | Companies would be incentivized to offer Green tier health care plans to make themselves more appeal- ing for employee recruitment.104 Shrewd health care plans will find inexpensive ways to offer sustainable health care that maintain access to basic health needs in response to patient and doctor demands. Even if a Green tier plan is not offered as part of health care reform, best environmental practices should be incen- tivized; the green option should be the economical option.
0b39 | B. Ecology and the Green Insurance Company
qecd | Governmental regulations which would adopt a comprehensive, legally binding model of sustainable health care - such as the one utilized by the United Kingdom's National Health Service-would likely be rejected by US residents as overly restrictive. How- ever, the health care free market gives great lati- tude for health care plans (e.g., Blue Cross or United Health Care) to determine which medical treatments and services they will offer based on patient prefer- ences. Moreover, the free market and decentraliza- tion permit companies to become more sustainable independently.
1o7p | A green health care insurance company would be accountable for environmentally sound practices. From fair-exchange coffee, to "cruelty free" cosmetics, to locally grown food, more customers are willing to support companies that unite ethics with the product they supply. Each year, a handful of articles call on health care to divest from fossil fuel sources.105 Sustain- able energy and investment in renewable sources are two ways an insurance company can be green. Alter- natively, a green insurance company might choose to partner only with health care facilities that are mem- bers of organizations which actively participate in sus- tainability initiatives, such as Practice GreenHealth,106 Health Care Without Harm,107 the Healthier Hospitals Initiative,108 and the Catholic Health Association.109
cp13 | To be sure, insurance companies are dependent on many different supply chains. For instance, phar- maceuticals are known environmental menaces110 and consistently one of the largest carbon emitters in health care.111 Requiring environmental accountability from drug companies would be a significant first step for greening insurance companies, with ample data to support the move.112 Once sustainability measures are in place, insurance companies can brand themselves as green, thus rising as visible leaders in green health care reform.
