        "content": "vbni | The time of SL flash is very short, approximately ten to the negative ten seconds to the twenty-seventh power. Atoms and molecules can take part in ten to the third power collisions in this time. Consequently, the equilibrium can be achieved only for the translational degrees of freedom, partly for dissociation and electronic, rotational, and vibrational transitions. The ionization and ionic recombination processes are far from the equilibrium. Probably, more correctly, one should discuss the \"effective\" temperature inside the bubble. Hence, we shall mean the effective temperature inside the bubble in discussing the results obtained in this work.\ndgcw | The luminescent nature of SL has been repeatedly proved so the supposition that sonoluminescence has to be blackbody radiation needs additional argumentations. Probably, this conclusion has been made by the authors because they did not detect any lines or bands in the spectra. Actually, SL was obtained from the bubble, which contains air gases and water vapors. These spectra are broadened; the band from the excited hydroxyl radical is not prominent because of the luminescence of the products of the chemical reactions of nitrogen and oxygen atoms and molecules inside the cavitation bubble.\ngvwz | The results of recently published papers on the spectra of SL of organic liquids are in contradiction with the blackbody mechanism. Those spectra show a prominent emission from the excited carbon two radical. The SL spectra of dodecane were studied in the presence of helium, neon, and argon and in the mixture of helium and argon. The data showed that the ratio of the intensity of carbon two emission to the intensity of a continuum does not depend on the thermal conductivity of the dissolved gas. Besides, no bands or lines were detected in those spectra at wavelengths shorter than three hundred nanometers. Thus, one can conclude that the bands at less than two hundred seventy nanometers in the SL spectra of water saturated with noble gases are not the emission of the heated gas. Otherwise, they must be presented in the spectra of the reference. Thus, these bands originate from the emission of water molecules or some particles which contain a water molecule (or the product of its dissociation) with the atoms of noble gases. It is very difficult also to explain with the help of the blackbody mechanism of sonoluminescence the very short time of SL flash and the fact that it is over before the minimum size of a bubble is reached. Thus, the blackbody mechanism of SL is inconsistent with the experimental results.\nsk5m | Interpretation of Spectra. The compression of a cavitation bubble starts slowly, almost isothermally. Vapors are partly condensed, and the evolved heat of condensation is extracted by the thermal conductivity of a liquid. Next, the velocity of a bubble compression increases, and it shrinks almost adiabatically with the continuous growth of temperature and pressure. The kinetic energy of particles inside the bubble also increases. It can be converted into the energy of electronic excitation by means of inelastic collisions.\nqws8 | Water plus M goes to water excited plus M.\n877u | where M is the atom of a gas or a water molecule. As a result of reaction one, the singlet-excited water molecules are formed. The supposition on the formation of triplet-excited water molecules is doubtful as the singlet-triplet transi-\nrzhj | tions have a low probability; in addition, they usually need more time greater than ten to the negative third seconds as compared with the singlet-singlet transitions.\nbfax | equal ten to the negative twelfth to ten to the negative eighth seconds. A small energy of excitation approximately seven point five electron volts can lead to the first singlet-excited state of water molecule, A to the first power B one. This state is repulsive, and the water molecule dissociates into hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl radicals in a quiescent electronic state.\nf2y8 | Water excited goes to hydrogen plus hydroxyl X.\no7qm | At energies of excitation greater than eight point three electron volts, one less than one hundred and fifty nanometers, the B tilde to the first power A one excited state of water molecules is reached. This state is less repulsive, and the dissociation gives the electronic excited radicals.\nd52l | Hydroxyl excited to two sigma plus: water excited A goes to hydrogen plus hydroxyl X.\nqlbb | Water excited B. Hydrogen plus hydroxyl.\nnhsg | Water X goes to hydrogen plus hydroxyl X.\nhy0l | The yield of water B molecules is less than ten percent, and ninety percent of them dissociate by processes three A, three B, and three C. If the energy transmitted by the collision one is as high as nine point nine electron volts, then water molecules excite on the stable singlet C tilde to the first power B one state. The formed water molecule H two O C tilde can lose the excess energy either through the H two O B tilde state followed by reactions three A to three C or by the light emission at C tilde to A tilde transition.",
