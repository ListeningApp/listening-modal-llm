Provide the client with hope, positive feedback, and generally show a positive attitude or emotions (e.g., point out the client's strengths, highlighting all of his good progress thus far; remind him that as his functioning improves, he will begin to build increasing confidence about returning home and eventually getting back to work).\n8g7g | b. Assume a clear leadership role by providing the client with information, structure, guidance, or constructive feedback (e.g., educate the client about the course of rehabilitation, emphasizing that he will not be discharged from the hospital to outpatient and work rehabilitation until he feels confident about his abilities and is assessed by the treatment team to be ready and safe for such).\n5j4f | c.

You are working with a fifty-year-old retired cook who is a mother and a grandmother. She experienced a traumatic brain injury approximately three years ago, and for the past year she has been attending a day center in her community that serves individuals with brain injuries. The client typically loves participating in and sometimes leading a range of activities, including a cooking group that she sometimes leads because of her expertise in this area. Recently, she has not been participating in most of the activities and has had to be encouraged to come into the dining room during mealtimes. Today, she refuses to eat or participate in the cooking group. She states that she believes that the kitchen is not clean enough for eating and cooking. You know that the kitchen is particularly clean. Please rank-order each response according to the following scale:\nb0d0 | a.

You are working with a seventy-two-year-old farmer who has been working on his family's large acreage since he was very young. He is currently in the middle of a severe gout flare-up. You can see that he is becoming increasingly upset about the situation. The harvest is approaching, and if he misses it, his business will lose a significant amount of money. He is particularly worried about whether he will be able to drive the tractor for as long as the harvest requires. His son and daughter, who would normally be available to help him, are both out of town. He cannot take the type of pain medications that would provide him with rapid relief because of the side effects they have caused, and the gout medication that he takes is effective only if taken during a period of several days. Please rank-order each response according to the following scale:\n4d67 | a. Provide the client with hope or positive feedback and generally show a positive attitude or emotions (e.g., based on your knowledge of the usual length of his gout flare-ups, remind the client that the attack is very likely to end soon, as it has every other time; encourage him not to lose hope that he will bring the harvest in on time).\ne7j2 | b.

You are working with a three-and-a-half-year-old boy with speech and fine motor delays and behavioral problems. The child's tantrums are becoming more frequent during therapy, so you decide to address them, involving the child's mother in your plan. The child's approach today, however, the child's mother interrupts therapy and reports that she has been feeling uncomfortable with the approach. Please rank-order each response according to the following scale:\n5cl9 | a. Witness, listen to, and show full acceptance of the parent's thoughts, feelings, or behavior (e.g., ask the child's mother to tell you more about her concerns, taking the time to validate her feelings of discomfort).\nu7a3 | b.

Normalize the parent's experience or connect the parent with social or physical resources that will enable her to have equal access and opportunities (e.g., let the child's mother know that she is not alone and that many parents are uncomfortable with this approach; provide her with contact information for a parent empowerment group that critically evaluates this method and many other different methods for addressing behavioral problems).\nm04y | d. Give the parent total and complete control over the situation (e.g., inform the child's mother that she is in control of what happens during her son's therapy; ask her if she can think of a way to modify the approach so that she feels more comfortable with it, or if there is another strategy she wants to try instead of this one).\n23jk | Nine. You are working with a ten-year-old girl who loves and excels at many sports. She has academic difficulties related to dyslexia and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. You have noticed that when anyone gives her an assignment that is slightly more challenging than what she is used to, she reacts immediately by not even looking at it, and instead says she doesn't get it. At the same time, if she discovers an even more challenging assignment on her own, she often completes it without errors. It is clear to you that the client is capable of doing the slightly upgraded assignments that you are recommending, but she gives up before even attempting them. Today is not different than any other day. When you present the client with a slightly more advanced assignment that you know she is capable of completing, she quickly claims she does not understand it.
