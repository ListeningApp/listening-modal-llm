        "content": "u15r | Fortunately, these kinds of questions are tackled in another collection: Entrepreneurship in the Creative Industries, edited by Colette Henry. There is less agonizing here over definitions, the editors and most of the chapters simply accept the United Kingdom's Department of Culture, Media and Sport, which defined the creative industries as the following thirteen sectors in its nineteen ninety-eight mapping exercise: advertising, architecture, art and antiques, computer games, crafts, design, designer fashion, film and video, music, performing arts, publishing, software and television and radio. This remains a popular categorization, albeit associated with the New Labour government of Tony Blair. Chapter four of this book, by David Rae discusses the influence of this period in a United Kingdom perspective, pointing out some of the problematic effects of identifying the creative economy as different and non-mainstream. For example, Rae refers to the relatively poor standing of the United Kingdom in R and D expenditure and some other indicators of innovation, which stand in contrast to the high energy of the creative sectors in recent years, and calls for \"cultural diffusion\" to occur. This argument resonates with recent work by NESTA and the Queensland school on spillovers from the creative industries to the rest of the economy.\nlq35 | The \"special\" nature of creative people is discussed in the chapter by O Cinneide and Henry, which argues that creative people have many qualities associated with entrepreneurship,\n3g9w | such as risk-taking, tolerance for ambiguity, perseverance and autonomy. The chapter raises the case of Irish music and dance, such as Riverdance, which was launched from Eurovision Song Contest success to a new genre of live and recorded entertainment. However, the chapter stresses the barriers to entrepreneurship and the fact that even with the Irish success story, much of the economic success is not captured within the country. Again, these themes deserve a longer treatment and particularly in drawing out the lessons for entrepreneurship from the Irish case.\nd09o | The following chapter on New Zealand's film industry has a similar structure with a brief page at the end on Peter Jackson, of Lord of the Rings fame. This chapter characterizes national and regional policy as \"state entrepreneurship\", while Jackson is an individual entrepreneur. There is excellent data and analysis of how policy in New Zealand has influenced the industry but it seems to me there is a problem with calling government activity entrepreneurship: governments are usually doing something and it cannot all be entrepreneurship. One would then need to take a tautological position of calling it entrepreneurship if it appears to have led to success. How about activity that turns out to be unsuccessful or does not add value? And the success story of Jackson the individual does not seem to have followed from the policies-rather referring to more traditional notions of entrepreneurship, like establishing businesses and high-quality resources to support his work.\nylhz | Chapter two by Desmond Hui reviews East and Southeast Asian government policies and economic statistics where available for creative and cultural industries as they are variously defined with sections on Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong-some of the statistics are projection. Understandably these deal with differences of definition, which are helpful to bear in mind with comparison. The review gives a sense of how countries like South Korea and Singapore have had a succession of policies aimed at CCIs since the nineteen eighties, while others like Japan only really embraced targeted policies in the twenty-first century. It concludes that Korea's sustained policy attention seems to have paid off in terms of market success in TV, music and animation industries. However, this reader is left with a desire for more analysis of the impact of policy, with such a brief impression in the conclusion after a chapter presenting raw facts. Assembling the facts is important, of course, but there is still much to understand about development of CCIs in Asia.\na3td | The following chapter by Maria Aggestam on music entrepreneurs in Scandinavia again shows a refreshing perspective. While we know the importance of institutions like the Eurovision Song Contest for several Scandinavian musicians and bands; not only the most famous, Abba, I had not realized that the tango and its music was such a strong part of Finnish culture. According to Aggestam there is a lack of professional marketing skills holding back the international growth of Finnish tango, but most importantly its language. Lyrics are crucial and singers' and songwriters' insistence on the Finnish language ensure it remains a local phenomenon. Sweden, by contrast, has continued export success, notably with songwriting for American artists such as the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez. The chapter contains data and narrative on important institutions.\nex5k | The second part of the book focuses on supporting the creative industries, including a chapter by Tom Fleming reviewing the investment and funding issues associated with creative firms; Ralph Brown on promoting entrepreneurship in arts education and the dilemmas and paradoxes of increased throughput of graduates, yet with a talent shortfall perceived by industry. These themes are returned to in a chapter by Calvin Taylor, while Linda Moss provides a transition economy perspective with a chapter on the support of creative enterprise in Russia. There is another\n9d4o | chapter on human language technologies by Kenny and Meaton, which is interesting but seems somewhat out of place in this volume. A concluding chapter by Colette Henry summarizes the themes and insights of the book.\ncjq2 | In summary, this collection whets the appetite by shifting attention to countries that are less well researched in the creative industries field. They are fascinating vignettes that hint at a richer research landscape. I recommend both these books for scholars and students interested in these sectors. There is also much to interest the general reader. As a pair they complement each other and when read together they leave a more complete picture of the range and reach of the creative and cultural industries.",
