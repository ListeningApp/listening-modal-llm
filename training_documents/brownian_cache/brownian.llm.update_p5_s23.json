It is usually more useful however to rescale the PDF like so: P(x,t) equals e to the power of negative V over big upsilon P(x,t). This leads to the F-P equation taking the form:\nm4jl | partial differential of P(x,t) with respect to t equals\n59hi | big upsilon divided by two partial squared differential of P(x,t) with respect to x squared plus big upsilon P(x,t)\nua3p | (thirty-five)\n0a2t | which resembles a Euclidean Schrödinger equation with big upsilon over two playing the role of h in controlling the fluctuation amplitude, as one might expect.\nabow | Equation (thirty-four) can be solved in terms of a spectral expansion. Writing\nqx6n | P(x,t) equals the sum from n equals zero to infinity of c sub n P sub n of x e to the power of negative E sub n t\np2bm | (thirty-six)\ncxyx | we find that P sub n satisfy the corresponding, time independent Euclidean Schrödinger equation\nw0aw | one half V comma z squared big upsilon V comma x x P sub n equals E sub n P sub n\nw41b | (thirty-seven)\nvokd | The lowest eigenfunction with E zero equals zero is P sub zero of x equals Ne to the power of negative V of x over T\nefir | (thirty-eight) corresponding to the equilibrium distribution P_eq(x) equals P sub zero of x squared. The P sub n of x eigenfunctions are complete and orthonormal\nvjhs | integral [dx p sub n of x P sub m of x equals delta sub m n\nrcio | (thirty-nine)\n7qi5 | greater than P sub n of x P sub n of x sub zero equals delta of x minus x sub zero for n equals one to infinity \n9f5r | (forty)\nj3tt | The conditional probability, a quantity akin to the evolution operator or propagator in quantum mechanics, can be expressed in terms of the spectral expansion as\nzoz0 | P tilde of x comma t given x sub zero at time zero equals the sum from n equals zero to infinity of P sub n of x P sub n of x sub zero e to the power of negative E sub n t. P of x comma t given x sub zero at time zero equals e to the power of negative V of x over big upsilon P tilde of x comma t given x sub zero at time zero e to the power of positive V of x sub zero over big upsilon\n3blu | Any correlation function can then be expressed by using this equation. An economic notation can be achieved by using Dirac bra-ket notation in terms of which for example\nxv2l | P tilde of t zero equals the sum from n equals zero to infinity of ket n e to the power of negative E sub n t bra n\nxt4k | Correlation functions can then be expressed in the spectral expansion as:\nti78 | bra f of x of t ket g of x of zero bra state zero of f state n e to the power of negative E sub n t n state g state i n ket\nk5pk | where, explicitly\nn093 | bra zero of f state n equals the integral from negative infinity to infinity of dx P sub zero of x f of x P sub n of x. Bra n of g ket i n equals the integral from negative infinity to infinity of dx P sub n of x g of x P tilde of x zero\n4khi | Note that the \"out state\" in the stochastic problem is always bra zero and the \"in state\" is defined in terms of\n7fh2 | P tilde of x t equals zero. We can also write the conditional probability\n5isn | P of x t given x sub zero at time zero equals bra x of e to the power of negative V of x over big upsilon P tilde of t zero e to the power of positive V of x sub zero over big upsilon ket x sub zero governed by the above Euclidean Schrödinger equation, as a path integral\n5vry | P of x t given x sub zero at time zero equals script N exp of epsilon over two D times the quantity V of x minus V of x sub zero times the integral from x at zero equals x sub zero to x at t equals x script D x of tau exp of negative integral d tau over two D m quantity one half m times partial differential of tau x squared minus U bar of x\n9w33 | where we have reinstated the dimensionful variables. We therefore recover the \"on mass-shell\" path integral obtained earlier. Note the importance of including the determinant in order to obtain the partial squared differential of x x V term in the Schrödinger potential\njohv | U bar. Before proceeding to the next sections we should add a comment regarding the above path integrals. Beyond being expressions that allow formal manipulations, they can also be understood as limits of large multivariate integrals arising from the discretization of time evolution into small discrete time intervals. In general, this\n2olp | discretization results in apparent ambiguities. In our case this can also be linked to the discretization of the Langevin equation the index i refers to the i-th time interval\nzb7x | x sub i equals x sub i minus one plus V prime of x sub i star delta t plus integral from t sub i minus one to t sub i of ds xi of s\n```",
