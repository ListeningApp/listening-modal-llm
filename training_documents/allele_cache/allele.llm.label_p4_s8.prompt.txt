You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

bd9h | We have developed a Bayesian changepoint identification algorithm, which (1) segments the genomic sequence into regions of the constant BAD using dynamic programming to maximize the marginal likelihood and then (2) assigns BAD with the maximal posterior to each segment (see "Methods"). An additional preprocessing employs distances between neighboring SNVs to exclude long deletions and centromeric regions from BAD estimation. The BAD caller in action is illustrated in Fig. 2a for two chromosomes using ENCODE K562 data (see the segmentation map of the complete genome with multiple deletions in Supplementary Fig. 2).
m047 | We performed the BAD calling for 2556 groups of variant calls, where each group consisted of calls obtained from ChIP-Seq alignments for a particular cell type and GEO series or ENCODE biosample ID (i.e., for K562 cells of different studies, the BAD calling was performed independently). In BAD calling, recurrent SNVs sharing dbSNP IDs and found in different data sets within the same group were considered as independent observations. To systematically assess the reliability of the resulting BAD maps, we compared the predicted BADs at all SNVs with the ground truth BADs estimated from COSMIC28 CNV data for 76 matched cell

y4mj | types, with K562 and MCF7 being the most represented. For K562 and multiple other cell types, the Kendall <LATEX>\tau _ { b }</LATEX> rank correlation was consistently better for joint data sets with higher numbers of SNVs (Fig. 2b), which justifies the usage of read counts at SNVs as point measurements of BAD.
vpgq | Genome structural variations are the most likely yet not the only reason for unbalanced allelic dosage in a particular genomic region. In our case, the agreement of BAD and COSMIC copy- number maps confirms the validity of BAD estimates. However, even suboptimal agreement between a BAD map and the copy- number profile is not a problem as soon as the allelic dosage is estimated correctly.
ousl | Particularly, we found that BAD maps of MCF7 agreed poorly with COSMIC independently from the number of SNVs in the data set. To clarify the issue, we processed external deep genomic sequencing data for MCF7 with the ADASTRA pipeline (see "Methods"). The resulting BAD map from these data was not dependent on the ChIP procedure but agreed reasonably well with the MCF7 BAD maps from ChIP-enriched data sets, thus validating the ChIP-Seq-based BAD maps for MCF7 cells (see Supplementary Fig. 2).
m4ju | Of note, the ChIP-independent BAD map for MCF7 still rather poorly agreed with the COSMIC copy numbers markup (SNP- level Kendall <LATEX>\tau _ { b }</LATEX> ~0.2), suggesting that for MCF7 the latter is likely an inadequate proxy for the actual BAD. We have no ultimate explanation for this observation but would like to remark that MCF7 was found among the most unstable cell types29, which probably leads to discrepancies between exact CNV profiles and BAD estimates for cells originating from different studies.
a0mb | Additionally, we have analyzed microarray-based CNV estimates for major cell types29, including 13 cell types matching across these data, COSMIC, and our study (Supplementary Fig. 3). Interestingly, when compared to COSMIC, those data showed a higher correlation for MCF7 rather than for K562 cells. To a varying degree, such discrepancies can be observed for other cell types. Thus, careless recruitment of copy-number profiles obtained with different methods from different data sources as estimates of BAD may reduce the reliability of called ASBs, the disadvantage that is avoided by using BAD estimates directly from ChIP-Seq data.
ki8m | As a separate test, we used the predicted BAD maps as multiple binary classifiers for different BAD values using SNP calls across all cell types. With the COSMIC data as the ground truth, we plotted a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and a precision- recall curve (PRC) for each BAD (Fig. 2c, d). For the most widespread BADs (1-3) covering more than 90% of candidate SNVs (Supplementary Fig. 3), we reached >0.83 area under curve for ROC and 0.66-85 for PRC (Supplementary Table 3), proving the reliability of the predicted BAD maps.
km8w | With BAD maps at hand, we segregated the variant calls from all data sets by BAD and by fixed read coverage either at reference or alternative alleles. Then, for each such set of SNVs, we fitted the background distribution as a mixture of two negative binomial distributions with BAD-determined p parameters (see "Methods"). ASBs were called independently for the reference (Ref-ASB) and the alternative (Alt-ASB) allele using separately fit background distributions for the fixed read counts at alternative and reference alleles, respectively, thus accounting for general read mapping bias.
wzno | Overview of the ADASTRA database. The results of the ASB calling are provided in the ADASTRA database (the database of ADASTRA factor binding sites). In ADASTRA, each dbSNP ID can have several ASB entries for different TFs or cell types. ADASTRA consists of two parts: the first part (TF-ASB, 233290

X-axis: chromosome position, bp. Y-axis: the allelic imbalance of individual SNVs. Horizontal green lines (ground level of the plots) indicate results of the initial stage of the algorithm: the detection of SNV-free regions including deletions, telomeric, and centromeric segments. Horizontal light-blue lines: predicted BAD. Orange dashes: "ground truth" BAD according to the COSMIC data (when available). b Y-axis: SNV-level Kendall Tb rank correlation between the predicted BAD and the "ground truth" BAD (COSMIC data). Each of 516 points denotes a particular group of related data sets of the same series (ENCODE biosample or GEO GSE ID) and the same cell type. X-axis: the number of SNV calls in a particular group of related data sets. Only SNVs falling into regions of known BAD (present in the COSMIC data) are considered, recurrent SNVs in several data sets are considered only once. c, d Receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curves for predicted BAD maps used as binary classifiers of individual SNVs according to BAD vs the "ground truth" COSMIC data. To plot each curve, the score S =L(BAD =x) - maxy#x L(BAD =y), where L denotes log-likelihood, was used as the prediction score for thresholding. Colored circles denote the values obtained with the final BAD maps where particular BAD values were assigned to each segment according to the maximum posterior.

The listed ASBs passed multiple testing correction (P <0.05 after Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment for the number of tested ASBs). P value estimation (see below), aggregation, and multiple testing correction were performed separately for ASBs with preferred binding to the reference (Ref-ASB) and alternative (Alt-ASB) alleles, and for each TF. The other part of the database (CT-ASB, 351967 ASBs at 252469 SNPs) contains a similar aggregation of individual ASBs over TFs for each cell type.
pxbq | TFs and cell types were unequally represented in the source data. Thus, the numbers of the resulting ASB calls were also biased toward most studied cell types and TFs (Fig. 3a, b), with the top contributions from CTCF for TFs and K562 for cell types. However, the top 8 TFs and top 5 cell types covered only half of ASB calls (for cell types) or less than a half of ASB calls (for TFs);

lq35 | thus, the produced data on ASB events is diverse across different samples.
3g9w | Next, we assessed how ASBs and candidate SNVs are distributed in different genomic regions (Fig. 3c). Compared to all SNVs and tested candidate ASB sites, the significant ASBs were enriched in enhancers (~4x more than expected from the number of SNVs for which there were candidate ASBs, Fisher's exact test P < 10-300) and promoters (~3x more than expected, P < 10-300). We consider this observation consistent with both the actual location of functional TF-binding sites and deeper coverage of the actual TF-binding regions with ChIP-Seq reads. In fact, ASBs are likely to cluster at the scale of the typical ChIP- Seq peak width, as revealed by the distribution of pairwise distances between SNVs with and without ASBs, which has a bimodal shape (Supplementary Fig. 4). This effect is likely caused by peak-scale clustering of ChIP-Seq reads allowing for higher

The top 8 TFs and top 5 cell types provide only nearly one third (TFs) or one half (cell types) of significant events. The bottom bars in each pair show the zoomed- in data for the top 8 TFs and top 5 cell types sorted by descending number of ASBs. c The complete bars correspond to the full set of SNPs (unique dbSNP IDs) with significant ASBs. The ASBs are more often found in promoters and enhancers as compared to either SNVs with candidate ASBs or all detected SNVs. The percentage of ASB-carrying SNPs falling into particular types of genomic regions is shown on bar labels. Top bar: significant ASBs (passing 5% FDR, 269,934 sites in total); middle bar: SNPs with candidate ASBs (passing the coverage thresholds and tested for significance, 2,024,836 sites in total); bottom bar: all SNPs detected in the variant calling (4,976,303 sites in total). d The fraction of BaalChIP-reported SNPs (X-axis) with allele-specific binding passing the filters at various stages of the ADASTRA pipeline (Y-axis). We considered data from 14 cell lines matching between BaalChIP ASB set and ADASTRA (with the ADASTRA ASBs reaggregated considering only 316 data sets shared between BaalChIP and ADASTRA out of a total of 548 BaalChIP ChIP-Seq data sets). The following checkpoints of the ADASTRA pipeline were considered: 1 Total set of SNP calls: SNPs found by GATK; 2 SNPs passing basic coverage filter: SNPs with ≥5 reads supporting each of alternative alleles; 3 SNPs passing complete ADASTRA filters for candidate ASB sites: heterozygous dbSNP common SNPs with total coverage of at least 20 reads in at least one experiment located in a chromosome eligible for BAD estimation, i.e., with ≥100 SNP calls at stage 2; 4 ASBs passing a fixed FDR: cell type level aggregated ASBs passing a given FDR threshold (Benjamini-Hochberg-corrected P value allowing for BAD). ASB P values were estimated by logit aggregation of the one-tail Negative Binomial P values across the experiments (see "Methods") and then the FDRs were estimated with Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.

We additionally assembled a reproducible ASB set consisting of 2039 SNPs with ASBs detected in any two of those four ASB sets and found that ADASTRA included 1573 (77%) of the respective SNPs. Of note, taking pairwise, these four existing ASB data sets also poorly overlap each other (see Supplementary Table 4), suggesting that the major fraction of

byu8 | ASBs is non-reproducible between studies and arise either from particular ChIP-Seq data sets or from unique procedures of different ASB calling pipelines.
76b0 | To study in detail why ADASTRA failed to capture ASBs found in other studies, we used the set of ASB SNPs identified by one of the most advanced methods for ASB calling, BaalChIP19. ASB event could be missed at the SNP calling stage, could fail to pass the read coverage thresholds, or fail to pass the significance threshold for FDR-corrected P value estimated against BAD. To assess the contribution of different stages of our pipeline to ASB calling sensitivity, we performed a stage-by-stage analysis of the underlying SNP set (see Fig. 3d). It turned out that the fraction of BaalChIP ASB SNPs recovered by ADASTRA was different for different cell types, with most of ASBs recovered for the cell types with the deepest sequencing coverage.
zxz6 | On the one hand, the basic coverage filters significantly reduced the number of SNPs under consideration resulting in a major loss in the fraction of recovered ASBs. On the other hand, we did not observe critical effects from any of the subsequent stages. For all cell types, the number of BaalChIP ASB SNPs recovered by ADASTRA decreased monotonously, suggesting that there was no particular bottleneck defining the sensitivity of the whole pipeline except the basic coverage filters. As more sites were recovered for cell types with better coverage, one can predict that the difference between different ASB calling pipelines would decrease as soon as more ChIP-Seq data would become available for analysis.
