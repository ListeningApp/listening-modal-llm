You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

y4mj | Statistical Analyses
vpgq | Latent Profile Analysis (LPA)
ousl | Psychopathology profiles at T1 were previously derived using the same procedures described below [13]. In earlier work, the Sleep Problems syndrome scale of the CBCL was not included in the analyses. Here, we applied LPA to define
m4ju | psychopathology subgroups at T1, T2 and T3, using CBCL T-scores of all available syndrome scales as indicators, includ- ing Sleep Problems. Consistent with earlier work within Gen- eration R, we used five criteria to determine the optimal num- ber of profiles [6, 13]. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the bootstrapped likelihood ratio test (BLRT) were used to evaluate the fit of each model. The BIC is a measure of model fit considering the rule of parsimony, with a lower BIC indicating a better fit. The BLRT is a likelihood ratio for k classes versus k - 1 classes, with a p-value greater than 0.05 indicating that k - 1 classes are sufficient. Entropy of the models was evaluated with values closer to 1 indicating better classification. Moreover, all profiles obtained should include a minimum of 1% of the participants. Lastly, all profiles were inspected visually to ensure each additional profile had a dis- tinct severity or shape pattern.
a0mb | Latent Transition Analysis (LTA)
ki8m | We applied LTA to calculate transition probabilities between psychopathology profiles over time. Due to the use of different CBCL versions (v1.5-5 at T1), we were unable to test a model where we held the profiles equal across all ages. Therefore, the quantitative change in profile patterns was taken into account in interpreting the transition probabilities. In our primary model we allowed profiles to be estimated freely. Addition- ally, a partial invariant model was tested in which the profiles were held equal between T2 and T3. Lastly, we tested a model in which demographic characteristics (biological sex, national origin and SES based on maternal education and household income) were included as covariates. The number of profiles included in the LTA at each age wave was based on the optimal number of profiles at each individual time point.
km8w | Both LPA and LTA were performed using Mplus version 8.6 [23]. Full information maximum likelihood (FIML) was used in both the LPA and the LTA analyses to account for missing data, which can be used to account for data con- sidered either missing at random (MAR) or missing com- pletely at random (MCAR). No missing data was imputed. A detailed overview showing in how many data collection waves each individual participated, split by demographic variables, is provided in Supplementary Table 1. Participants with a lower SES and participants from non-western national origin were more likely to have fewer measurements avail- able, pointing towards a pattern of MAR.

pxbq | participants in the smallest profile obtained. When two or more models fitted the data equally well, optimal fit was based on visual inspection. We were unable to discrimi- nate between models based on the BLRT, since the BLRT was < 0.001 across all waves and across all tested profiles, indicating that adding a profile would improve model fit, even when six profiles were fitted to the data. Likewise, the BIC decreased with an increasing number of profiles added to the model and could therefore not discriminate between the models at T1-T3. At T1, a four-profile fit was deter- mined the best fitting model, as the five-profile fit resulted in one profile with fewer than 1% of participants. At T2, the entropy varied between the models, indicating that the model with four, five or six profiles at T2 fit the data equally well. Visual inspection of the four and five profile fit showed that the fifth profile did not differ largely in both shape and severity from profiles that were already identified in the four- profile fit (Supplementary Fig. 1). Therefore, a four-profile fit was determined optimal at T2. At T3, the optimal fit was based on the entropy, which was highest for the four-profile fit. Model fit indices are provided in Supplementary Table 2.
jfsr | We describe these four profiles as: (1.) no problems (T1: 85.9%, T2: 79.0%, T3: 78.0%) with low scores on all syn- drome scales, (2.) internalizing (T1: 5.1%, T2: 9.2%, T3: 9.0%) with particularly high scores on Anxious/Depressed,

To remain con- sistent with our earlier work, we use the term DP with the understanding that the term is synonymous with the term 'comorbid group'.

a3td | Based on fit statistics, the freely estimated model and the partial invariant model fitted the data equally well (freely estimated: BIC=660,642.04, entropy =0.87; partial invari- ant: BIC=660,641.32, entropy=0.87). Transition probabili- ties, based on the freely estimated model, between T1-T3 are shown in Tables 3 and 4. Transition probabilities for the partial invariant model are presented in Supplementary Table 3 and 4.

76b0 | Heterotypic continuity was present for all profiles, with some children transitioning from the no problems subgroup to internalizing (T1-T2: 7.6%, T2-T3: 5.1%) and external- izing (T1-T2: 6.5%, T2-T3: 6.1%) subgroups, but very few to the DP (T1-T2: 1.4%, T2-T3: 0.7%). For the internalizing subgroup, most children transitioned to the no problems sub- group (T1-T2: 43.1%, T2-T3: 51.0%), with some transition- ing to the externalizing (T1-T2: 3.4%, T2-T3: 7.7%) and DP (T1-T2: 15.5%, T2-T3: 3.7%) subgroups. Those children in the externalizing subgroup were also likely to transition to the no problems subgroup (T1-T2: 35.6%, T2-T3: 33.4%), and to a lesser extent to the internalizing (T1-T2: 10.1%, T2-T3: 8.1%) and DP (T1-T2: 17.0%, T2-T3: 10.7%) sub- groups. Lastly, for those in the DP, the transition probability towards the no problems group decreased with age (T1-T2:

xnth | 21.9%, T2-T3: 8.6%), whereas the probability of transi- tioning towards the internalizing subgroup (T1-T2: 11.1%, T2-T3: 35.6%) increased with age and transitioning to the externalizing subgroup remained stable across age (T1-T2: 22.3%, T2-T3: 22.1%). Transition probabilities for the model including covariates were similar to those obtained in the model without covariates and are presented in Sup- plementary Table 5 and 6.
vafm | Discussion
2zmw | We utilized three time points of behavioral assessments in a large, population-based birth cohort to examine stability and change in symptoms of psychopathology from childhood into adolescence. Similar to earlier studies, subgroups of psychopathology included four profiles, namely; no prob- lems, internalizing, externalizing and DP [6, 7, 13]. In line with our hypotheses, we observed that externalizing behav- ior becomes more stable with age, but that the stability of children remaining within the DP subgroup decreases from late childhood into adolescence. Contrary to our hypothesis, internalizing problems did not become increasingly stable with age. Interestingly, the majority (51%) of the children classified in the internalizing subgroup in late childhood pro- gressed to the no problems group in adolescence. Our most notable finding is that, while there is considerable change in behavior for children classified in the DP in childhood, the vast majority (91% of the children) remain in one of the three psychopathology subgroups.
bf9k | Not surprising, the largest number of children was clas- sified as having no problems across childhood and adoles- cence. Further, the homotypic continuity observed in this subgroup was 85-88%, meaning that most individuals that do not exhibit psychopathology at an early age, will remain having no psychopathology in adolescence. How- ever, our results also indicate that 5-8% of the children that had no problems in either early or late childhood, transition towards the internalizing group in early childhood or early adolescence, and similarly about 6% transitioned towards the externalizing subgroup. Studying potential underlying mechanisms, including genetic, biological and environ- mental factors, could ultimately help study and implement prevention strategies targeted on those individuals at-risk.
otkr | Together with the work by Basten et al. we show that from late toddlerhood until late childhood the percentage of children included in the internalizing subgroup increases, whereas the rates of children classified in the internalizing subgroup remains stable from late childhood into adoles- cence [6]. Indeed, studies assessing the age of onset for internalizing disorders find that anxiety disorders, depend- ent of the subtype of disorder, can emerge at any time during life, whereas the incidence of mood disorders begins to rise

d6r4 | during adolescence [15]. However, the median age of onset for specific anxiety and mood disorders is either in early childhood or after early adolescence, with the exception of social phobia. The stable prevalence we observe between late childhood and early adolescence suggests a certain sta- bility in the rate of anxiety symptoms, with fewer children developing internalizing symptoms during this age range. More importantly, in late childhood and early adolescence we found that an increasing proportion of those who transi- tion to the internalizing symptoms subgroup, transitioned either from the externalizing or the DP subgroup at an earlier time point. Thus, these individuals represent a group of chil- dren who are already identifiably at-risk, as opposed to those who develop internalizing symptoms after initially having no problems. A future extension of our findings should assess whether intervening to reduce externalizing and DP symp- toms can help prevent the later development of internalizing symptoms in those individuals.
9mrz | We found an increase in the percentage of children with externalizing behavior as these children develop from early childhood into adolescence. This pattern has been observed in earlier work using LPA [7] and it is known that external- izing disorders, such as oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, can develop until late childhood [15, 24, 25]. However, studies have also found a decrease in con- tinuous externalizing symptoms using growth modelling in this age range [26]. While at first glance these results appear contradicting, LTA results obtained in our study as well as in earlier work [7] show that children transitioning to the externalizing subgroup are mainly those who were in the DP at earlier time points. As those in the DP have higher symptoms on all syndrome scales, this increase in individuals in the externalizing subgroup is in line with a decrease in continuous externalizing symptoms. Moreover, those children who transitioned out of the externalizing sub- group, transitioned primarily to the no problems subgroup, which also translates into an overall decrease in external- izing symptoms.
pk06 | Although a similar pattern for stability within the inter- nalizing and externalizing subgroups was observed earlier, the homotypic continuity we observe is lower than previ- ously reported [7]. Most notably, a larger number of chil- dren from the internalizing and externalizing subgroups in early or late childhood transitioned to the no problems group over time, suggesting that for many children symptoms of psychopathology during childhood are a transient phase of development. The differences in homotypic continuity might reflect actual differences between the samples used, but are also likely to be partially dependent on the differences in how psychopathology is reported on the CBCL used here and the Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA) used in earlier work [27]. Whereas the CBCL is a continuous measure of psychopathology, the DAWBA is a structured

wcd0 | clinical interview to diagnose psychopathology. Because of our use of continuous measures, the internalizing and externalizing subgroup consists of children with mostly subclinical symptoms. Possibly, homotypic continuity is higher for those with clinical diagnoses than for those with subclinical symptoms. It would thus be interesting to study whether the initial level of symptoms is predictive of the likelihood that children have persistent problems in a sample enriched for children with subclinical and clinical levels of psychopathology.
