You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

v6sk | The revised approaches to income inequality impact on production-based and consumption-based carbon dioxide emissions: literature review
1wj6 | Abstract
936l | In recent decades, many authors have investigated possibility of simultaneous reduction of income inequality and pollution related to climate change. However, none of the previous researches reviewed the empirical studies of relationship between inequality and CO2 emissions. The authors of the selected papers, published from 2001 to 2019, found a diverse impact of income inequality on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. It could depend on different trajectories of Kuznets curves. Furthermore, the majority of authors have provided theoretical analysis (even including human behaviour) of the influence of income inequality on CO2 emissions, considering only territorial (or production-based) emissions. However, this paper recommends to distinguish between the production-based and consumption-based emissions and suggests the revised approaches to the impact of income inequality on CO2 emissions with regard to the production-based and consumption-based emissions. Regarding the production- based emissions, the following approaches are proposed: (i) determination of environmental policies, which also could reveal and explain the leakage phenomenon, and the channels of EKC, i.e. (ii) scale, (iii) composition, (iv) technical and (v) globalization effects. The influence of income inequality on consumption-based emissions can be explained by applying two approaches, namely (i) inequality determined changes in working time (this approach is also related to "Veblen effect") and (ii) individual economic behaviours of households. Therefore, the present study provides a new insight into the subject of the relationship between income inequality and pollution related to climate change.

dpv6 | Introduction
8r5j | Climate change and economic inequality are faced as the big- gest challenges in recent decades (Jorgenson et al. 2016; Wolde-Rufael and Idowu 2017; Rao and Min 2018). The main consequences of climate change include polar ice shield melt- ing, sea level rising and more frequent extreme weather events as heavy rains, heat waves and droughts. Thus, the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is crucial for mitigation of
2taz | climate change consequences (Matsumoto et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2019). Unequal societies badly affect sustainability and well-being as well (Khan et al. 2018). The authors have iden- tified that inequality influences health and social problems (Wilkinson and Pickett 2009), impels poverty-driven migra- tion (Hübler 2017), decreases economic growth due to chang- es in fiscal policies (Persson and Tabellini 1994; Ostry et al. 2014) and undermines human capital (McGee and Greiner 2018; Chancel et al. 2018). Therefore, a large number of au- thors have investigated whether these two problems, i.e. in- equality and pollution related to climate change, could be solved simultaneously.
o3ya | A discussion concerning the impact of income inequality on CO2 emissions originated in the 1990s (Mader 2018; Baloch et al. 2018). A majority of studies theoretically and empirically analysed the relationship between inequality and environmental pollution (Torras and Boyce 1998; Liu et al.
r5il | Environ Sci Pollut Res (2020) 27:8980-8990
5gui | 2019a). However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them has reviewed the empirical studies of relationship between inequality and CO2 emissions. Thus, in this paper, by reviewing the selected papers published from 2001 to 2019, the impact of inequality on CO2 emissions in developing and developed countries is presented.
82qc | Empirical studies on inequality and environmental impact offer diverse results (Borghesi 2006; Berthe and Elie 2015; Jorgenson et al. 2017; Grunewald et al. 2017; Chancel et al. 2018). Grunewald et al. (2012) has stated that different links between inequality and environmental impact vary with the level of inequality. Chow and Li (2014) together with Ibrahim and Law (2014) have argued that the links between economic development and pollution are moderated by the income in- equality level. Moreover, the change in relationship between these variables is moderated by the level of economic devel- opment (Jorgenson et al. 2016; McGee and Greiner 2018). Therefore, in this paper, referring to Kuznets curve theory, which was applied to both inequality (Kuznets 1955) and environmental impact (Grossman and Krueger 1995), a par- ticular attention was paid to revealing three possible alterna- tives: (i) the countries trace the same Kuznets curve trajectory (Jun et al. 2011; Zhang and Zhao 2014; Baloch et al. 2018); (ii) the turn points are different, and in the case of inequality reduction, the environmental pollution increases (or vice versa) and (iii) Kuznets trajectories are different; for income inequality, a U-shape is observed, although for environmental impact, it has an inverted U-shape (or vice versa). To my best knowledge, this aspect has still not been considered in scien- tific literature. Furthermore, this article presents the differ- ences between the impact channels through which economic development affects inequality and CO2 emissions.
ls7d | Theoretical links of the relationship between environmen- tal degradation (as air pollution level) and the inequality level are still required for complete understanding of the reasons (Chancel et al. 2018). Authors analysing the inequality impact on CO2 emissions mostly used three approaches: (1) political economy explanation, (2) marginal propensity to emit (MPE) carbon dioxide and (3) individual economic behaviour (Liu et al. 2019a). However, these approaches are not suitable to explore the inequality impact on national CO2 emissions, which is production-based. The argument that a different con- sumer behaviour (particularly consumption level) influences national emissions (which are production-based) (Hao et al. 2016; Jorgenson et al. 2015, 2016; Liu et al., 2019, a and etc.) might be a misconception considering that the major share of goods which people consume is imported or exported and thus related to the environmental impact in foreign countries. Therefore, analysing approaches to the relationship between inequality and pollution, the type of emissions (consumption or production-based) should be considered. Therefore, in this paper, the revised approaches to the impact of income inequal- ity on production-based and consumption-based CO2
tzt3 | emissions were suggested. These aspects, presumably, have not been analysed yet, and the present paper provides the new insights into the subject.
t8vv | The impact of income inequality on CO2 emissions with regard to economic development level
qvnu | In order to thoroughly explore the influence of inequality on CO2 emissions at different economic development levels, the databases ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and Web of Science were exploited by applying a query "inequality AND green- house gas emissions (carbon dioxide)". All papers published from 2001 to 2019 were selected where authors empirically evaluated the links between inequality and CO2 emissions. In the presentation of the results, countries were classified as low-, middle- and high-income countries, and a wide range of developed and developing countries. The relationship be- tween income inequality and CO2 emissions was also distin- guished as positive, negative and neutral (or insignificant). Results in Table 1 revealed diverse results regarding the level of economic development. The impact of inequality on carbon emissions was different in developing and developed coun- tries. These different results highlight the versatile role of in- equality in CO2 emissions.
kggw | Authors as Hao et al. (2016) show different effects of in- equality on pollution related to different shapes of environ- mental Kuznets curve (inverted U-shape, U-shape, linearity). They proposed that when the EKC curve was depicted as an "inverted U", the redistribution from the rich individuals to the poor contributes to the emission rise in connection with the decrease of the income inequality level. Conversely, in the case of a "U" shape, the enlargement of income inequality would contribute to the growth of emissions. When EKC re- lationship is linear, inequality has insignificant effect on envi- ronmental pollution. However, economic development is con- nected not only to environmental quality but also to income inequality level. Kuznets curve was applied for both variables (Kuznets 1955; Grossman and Krueger 1995). Hence, if coun- tries trace the same trajectory of Kuznets curve, and the turn point is rather similar, then the positive relationship between inequality and CO2 emissions is observed (Fig. 1a). In this case, pollution related to climate change is compatible with income inequality, and a process of economic development can resolve these issues (reduction of inequality and pollution) at the same time.
xrd1 | Yet, in the case of economic growth, the environmental impact can decrease or, put in other words, match the right side of the EKC. Alternatively, when the economic develop- ment level stays the same, income inequality does not reach the turn point and remains on the left side of Kuznets curve (and vice versa) (Fig. 1b). In these circumstances, according to

cwrw | the proposed model, the negative correlation between inequal- ity level and CO2 emissions is observed. The negative rela- tionship between inequality and CO2 emissions can occur when a U-shaped trajectory of one variable (income inequality level (Barro, 2000) or CO2 emissions) is observed instead of the inverted U-shape (Fig. 1c). The relationship is insignifi- cant when pollution or inequality level of the countries corre- spond to the turn point. Therefore, different correlations be- tween the income inequality level and CO2 emissions with regard to the economic development level could be observed due to the different Kuznets curve trajectories. In addition, when analysing links between income inequality and environ- mental impact, the channels through which economic devel- opment affects inequality and environmental pollution should be considered.
4i0e | The channels through which the economic growth affects CO2 emissions and income inequality
h2l3 | A large number of authors have analysed the EKC and iden- tified that the relationship between air pollution (or other type environmental degradation) and economic level depends on three channels: (1) scale, (2) composition and (3) technique (Dinda 2004; Kaika and Zervas 2013; Farhani and Shahbaz, 2014; Liobikienė and Butkus 2018, 2019, etc.). Besides, the same channels pertain to the influence of economic develop- ment on income inequality level (Castells-Quintana et al. 2013; He and Feng 2019). However, the effects of these chan- nels are different.
dfzb | Factors that are assigned to the scale effect (as economic development level (GDP)) contribute to the increase of envi- ronmental impact. Neagu and Teodoru (2019) found that eco- nomic complexity (improved capabilities of a country in the production process) has a statistically significant impact on CO2 emissions. Meanwhile, Barro (2000) argued that income inequality decreases due to economic growth in early stage of development level. Labour market is also related to the eco- nomic growth. Economic development can lessen inequality by allowing workers, who earn the least, to move from the informal employment sector to the formal. He and Feng (2019) pointed out that employment could improve income distribution. Castells-Quintana et al. (2013) also noted that in the European Union, inequality is higher in regions with higher unemployment.
u6ty | Considering the composition effect or the changes in economic structure with regard to the EKC, the reduction of environmental impact is observed when sectors which are not very polluting (i.e. services sector) increase faster than the most polluting ones (i.e. manufacturing, industry) (Parith et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2013). Transfer from ag- riculture to manufacturing at first increases and then
awvu | Environ Sci Pollut Res (2020) 27:8980-8990
on9b | decreases income inequality. Moreover, Castells-Quintana et al. (2013) indicated that the inequality level is higher where the employment in agriculture or trade sectors is higher. A higher employment in the construction sector is also positively related to the higher-income inequality lev- el. He and Feng (2019) revealed that industrialization could improve income distribution, which is not very favourable for the environment. However, the impact that a shift to the service sector makes on income inequality has still not been analysed. In this paper, it is suggested that a faster growth of the service sector can also contrib- ute to the reduction of inequality level because the wage gap in this sector is not very big. Furthermore, the less qualified work can also be included in the service sector.
a8ge | The technique channel is related to the development of technologies and innovations in the countries (Turner and Hanley 2011; Böhriger and Rutherfod, 2013). With regard to the EKC, the development of technologies has led to the re- duction of environmental pollution (Dinda 2004; Turner and Hanley 2011; Kaika and Zervas 2013; Farhani and Shahbaz, 2014; Liobikienė and Butkus 2018, 2019, etc.). Meanwhile, regarding the income inequality, the development of the tech- nologies may benefit the relatively richer population and con- tribute to the increase of income inequality. If technological development benefits the qualified labour (or richer individ- uals) more than the unqualified labour, the skill premium will
h27a | increase, which should raise the income inequality level (Castells-Quintana et al. 2013).
pdjh | Globalization, via trade and foreign direct investments (FDI), can also be attributed to an additional channel through which economic development affects environmental impact and income inequality (Zhuang et al. 2014). When discussing CO2 emissions, the reviewed authors provide different results. Some authors found that FDI and trade contribute to economic growth and to the degradation of environment at the same time (Shahbaz et al. 2015; Kivyiro and Arminen 2015; Ertugrul et al., 2016; Azam and Khan 2016; Sarkodie and Strezov, 2019). Other authors showed that FDI and trade contribute to economic development due to technology development, productivity and efficiency gains, and promotion of new and more innovative processes and managerial skills (Shahbaz et al., 2015) resulting in the reduction of environmental impact in host countries (Sbia et al. 2014; Tang and Tan 2015; Zhang and Zhou 2016; Kang et al. 2016). As far as income inequality is concerned, the mechanisms of FDI and trade openness dif- fer, and the results of the estimations are different as well (Dreher and Gaston 2008; Celik and Basdas 2010; Ines 2011; He and Feng 2019).
