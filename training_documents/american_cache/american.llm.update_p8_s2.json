        "content": "baj1 | Webster resolved this dilemma by turning to the discourse of geography, in particular the spelling of place-names. He assured his readers that a geographical lexicon could overcome local differences. Commenting in the Grammatical Institute, Webster writes that \"the advantage of publishing, in a work of this kind, the names of the United States, the counties in each, etc. will not be disputed by any American.\" Thus, while the opacity surrounding the English language was fueling the regionally motivated debates over the proper wording of the Republic's basic document, Webster imagined that the \"undisputed\" pronunciation of geographical words could provide a sense of clarity and a practical code when imagining a unified community.\nn1wo | The assertion that the consensual pronunciation of geographic place-names was the nation's neutral linguistic ground provided Webster with a formula through which he simultaneously decolonized and nationalized his speller. Webster's self-assigned challenge was to displace the British schoolbook A New Guide to the English Language, by Thomas Dilworth, a speller that had dominated the classrooms and homes of British Americans since the seventeen forties. On first sight, Webster's book hardly differed from his imperial predecessor. Both were written in the English language; both endorsed the alphabetic pronouncing-form method. But by focusing on Dilworth's textbook, Webster chose to compete against one of the more popular spellers that promoted geographical literacy. Dilworth's speller emphasized place-names as the literary context through which his British reading subjects would facilitate communication in the British commonwealth as well as uphold its imperial economy on a global scale; or, as Dilworth put it, it is only \"by this means a Briton holds correspondence with his friend in America or Japan, and manages all his business.\" Webster targets this section, offering, instead of \"twelve or fifteen pages devoted to names of English, Scotch and Irish towns and boroughs,\" eight pages of \"the names of the United States, the counties in each, etc.\" Whereas Dilworth had been rehearsing primarily the place-names found in England, Webster now offered those of the new American nation-state.\nezla | Indeed, in transforming his speller into an agent of national unification, Webster incorporated a spelling exercise that anticipated the founders' signing ritual. As if projecting the visual form of the United States map of seventeen eighty-three, he introduced the students to the proper spelling of American toponyms by including district and city names of all thirteen states. In print the alphabetic assembly of the national map looked like this:\nrsbu | The United States of America\nmagd | States Capital Towns New Hampshire Portsmouth Massachusetts Boston\ntb74 | Rhode-Island Newport Connecticut Hartford New-York New-Jersey Trenton Pennsylvania Delaware Maryland Virginia North-Carolina New Bern\n8l69 | New-York\n1jyv | Philadelphia\nolce | Baltimore\nerx1 | Richmond\nb3bt | South-Carolina Georgia\n0w8m | Charleston\nvcu3 | The effect of this spelling table was to establish the geographical order of the national map as an alternative to the alphabetical order of English. Names of states and cities were organized according to their geographical coordinates from north to south rather than from A to Z.\nhjzj | Given the table's role in securing a \"standard of pronunciation,\" it meshed the textual structure of the national map with the practice of oral alphabet lessons. The pronunciation of American place-names imitated the typographic hyperextension of place-names on maps. Just as the written word \"Massachusetts\" implied a larger territorial unit by being stretched across the face of a map, so too did the pronunciation of \"Mas-sa-chu'-setts\" imitate the territorial form of the geographic referent. Being sounded aloud, the place-name now signaled spatial demands, invoking territorial rights and borderlines for both readers and listeners. Moreover, as the chorus of students rehearsed its lines of geographic location, its tonal scale subordinated regional differences to the largest common territorial denominator. In Webster's lineup, pupils voiced the words \"The United States of America\" before those of the states. For the duration of these pronunciation exercises, as place-names wafted through American classrooms or parlors, students learning to spell also learned how to noisily claim the national map as the soundscape encompassing a common linguistic identity.\nj79f | Having folded the pronunciation of the national map into his alphabetic spelling book, Webster uses geographical literacy as the touchstone of his language reform. Initially, his Grammatical Institute warned the reader that the American community was not so much threatened by the flexibility of the English language per se, but that the English variants and dialects were infinitely more debilitating to the project of unifying the national reader through one linguistic standard. Yet, toward the end of his introduction to the Grammatical Institute Webster concludes that spellers and grammars were not in need of improvement, but that language reformers needed better geographical primers. \"The accounts from several states, are yet imperfect,\" he writes, \"but care will be taken to collect, by the best means of information, such accurate accounts from\n6tbv | the several states, as to correct any errors and supply any defects, that the present imperfect and fluctuating state of geography in this country may unavoidably occasion.\"\nxb13 | Describing the state of geographic literacy becomes Webster's way of describing the state of literacy instruction in America. During the first three decades of nationhood, as his spelling books rapidly replaced those of a colonial make, lessons in geographic literacy seeped into spelling exercises. For example, new editions of former colonial classics such as George Fisher's handbook The Instructor; or, Young Man's Best Companion, seventeen ninety-four, appended their chapters on language instruction with a rehearsal of American place-names. For Enos Weed, the alphabetization of the map became the principal method of spelling instructions; his American Orthographer, part two, The Geographical Spelling-Book, seventeen ninety-eight, had students practice their alphabetic skills in tables containing lists of place-names that, broken down into their syllabic components, imitated the stress and pauses of speech and also used the hyperextended printing of letters to demarcate geopolitical and cultural spaces on the map. With the emergence of schoolbooks like these, Webster's mapping gambit had succeeded beyond merely instituting place-names as a methodology of language instruction. As a result of his spellers and reading books, an entire generation of American citizens studied the English language through the geographer's lexicon and the cartographer's mode of projection.\ncxqi | As much as the initial reading lessons of the early Republic revolved around Webster's oral approach, language instructions also depended on the visual pedagogy of the picture primer. In order to achieve an unmediated, transparent relationship between words and the material world, or between signifiers and their signifieds, proponents of English language reforms embraced and emphasized pictorial instruction schemes. In fact, after the Revolution the programmatic dissemination of dozens of newly conceived illustrated primers became the disciplinary site through which\nqfmx | the new citizens sought to train students into models of republican virtue and self-discipline. For such reformed primers, it was not only questionable orthography or slippery grammatical systems that rendered language inherently volatile and therefore open to factious appropriation, but the very nature of written language itself. Pictures, instead of serving as supplements to written text, became a second language. Authors repeatedly engaged a visual code to reimagine language and hoped to forge the new nation through this new language.",
