        "content": "57lp | Authentic samples of the products obtained by the MMO-catalyzed oxidation of substrates one and two were prepared in the following manner. trans-(two-Phenylcyclopropyl)methanol (one a) and its dideuterated analogue were obtained from the synthesis of one, and alcohol two a was available in the preparation of two, as indicated above. Monodeuterated one a was prepared by LiAID four reduction of trans-(two-phenylcyclopropyl)methanal which, in turn, was obtained from the acid by sequential treatment with H three BSMe two and pyridinium chlorochromate. One-Phenylbut-three-en-one-ol (one b) and one,one-diphenylbut-three-en-one-ol (two b) were prepared by reactions of allylmagnesium chloride with benzaldehyde and benzophenone, respectively.\nukth | An authentic sample of trans-two-(P-hydroxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane (one c) was prepared by the following sequence. Reaction of P-vinylanisole with ethyl diazoacetate gave a mixture of ethyl cis- and trans-two-(P-methoxyphenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylates, which was separated by column chromatography and crystallization. The trans isomer, identified\nkpvt | Hydrocarbon Hydroxylation by Methane Monooxygenase\njie2 | by NMR spectroscopy, was reduced with LiAlH four, and the resulting alcohol was converted to its mesylate, which was then reduced with LiEt three BH. The resulting trans-two-(P-methoxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane was demethylated with NaSEt in DMF to give the desired product, which was purified by preparative GC on a Carbowax twenty M column. Authentic samples of the possible aromatic hydroxylated products from two were not prepared; no components consistent with these products were observed by GC mass spectral analysis of the oxidation mixtures.\nd0ik | Full details of the above synthetic procedures are provided as sup-\n0x0s | trans-one, two-Dimethylcyclopropane left three, trans-left two-methylcyclopropyl right obtained from Wiley Organics. Bicyclo[two.one.zero]pentane four was synthesized according to a literature method.\n4exe | Enzymatic Reactions. Reactions with MMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) were carried out at forty-five degrees Celsius with the reconstituted enzyme system in the following manner. Solutions were prepared that contained one point two milligrams (ten micro molar) of hydroxylase, zero point two milligrams (twenty-four micro molar) of coupling protein, and zero point four milligrams (twenty micro molar) of reductase, all in twenty-five millimolar MOPS, pH seven point zero, in a final volume of zero point five milliliters. A zero point five-microliter portion of substrate was then added by means of a microsyringe to achieve a maximum concentration of approximately eight millimolar, most of the substrates not being completely soluble prior to conversion to products. The reaction mixture was placed in a ten-milliliter glass vial and sealed with a Suba-Seal septum. After addition of a twenty-five-microliter portion of a zero point one molar stock solution of ethanol-free NADH to initiate the hydroxylation reaction, the vial was placed in a shaker-incubator maintained at forty-five degrees Celsius. Control reactions were performed in an identical manner except that no NADH was added. Reactions were allowed to proceed for fifteen minutes, a time sufficient to afford at least thirty mol of product per mol of enzyme in those cases where authentic standards were available.\n0myz | Studies with the hydroxylase from M. trichosporium OB three b and substrate one were carried out at thirty degrees Celsius in one of two ways. Coupling protein and reductase from M. capsulatus (Bath) were incubated with the hydroxylase in the presence of NADH. The protein and NADH concentrations were the same as described in the preceding paragraph. Alternatively, reactions were performed by using ten millimolar hydrogen peroxide and M. trichosporium OB three b hydroxylase only, a known shunt for this enzyme. Substrate was added to the reaction mixture, which was then incubated as described above. Again, at least thirty turnovers were completed before the reaction was terminated.\nxh3i | Instrumentation. Products from enzyme oxidations were analyzed with a Hewlett-Packard (HP) Model five thousand eight hundred ninety gas chromatograph either equipped with an FID detector or interfaced to an HP Model five thousand nine hundred seventy-one A mass spectrometer (EI, seventy electron volts). For GC and GC/MS analysis, either a cross-linked methyl silicon (HP) capillary column was employed, depending on which column gave better resolution of the reaction components. The column dimensions were ten meters by zero point five millimeters by one point zero micrometers for GC analysis and twenty-five meters by zero point two millimeters by zero point three three micrometers for GC/MS analysis. Slightly different instrumental conditions were used to analyze the different reactions, as indicated in Table SI (supplementary material).\nsyiw | Product Identification and Quantitation. Products were isolated by thorough extraction of the reaction mixture with diethyl ether or ethyl acetate. The septum of the reaction vial was removed, five milliliters of extracting solvent was added, and the septum was immediately replaced. The mixture was incubated for at least ten minutes, the organic layer was then removed, and the entire procedure was repeated twice. The organic layers were combined, dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, and then concentrated by slow evaporation under argon to a volume of approximately one hundred microliters. After the addition of an appropriate internal standard, a zero point two to zero point five microliter sample of concentrated extract was injected into the gas chromatograph. The retention times and mass spectra of the products were compared to those of authentic standards.\nkg3t | Components of the hydroxylation reaction mixture for one through three were quantified by constructing standard curves in the following manner. Solutions containing known concentrations of a given component and a constant amount of an internal standard dissolved in ethyl acetate or diethyl ether were injected into the GC. The ratio of the peak area corresponding to the component with that of the standard was then plotted against the concentration of added component in the sample. A linear plot was obtained and subsequently used as a calibration curve to determine the concentration of the component in extracts obtained from reactions with the enzyme. Plots were constructed in this manner for alcohols one a through three a, rearranged alcohols one b through three b, and three c, two-(P-hydroxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane (one c), and substrates one through three. Since no one b was detected in reactions of MMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) with one",
