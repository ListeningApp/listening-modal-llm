You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

vz2f | A DOG HAS PRECEDENCE
wyu0 | Bayazid Bistami, walking through the streets with some of his followers, made an occasion to demonstrate the shortcomings of
s8xw | 61
afv1 | such superficial assessments, as reported in Attar's Musibat-Nama, 'The Book of Calamity'.
fwf1 | A dog was walking towards them, and Bayazid made way for it. One of the disciples thought to himself that this must be wrong: Bayazid was a great saint, accompanied by students, allotted a high status, and a dog was after all only a dog.
3wck | Bayazid perceived this man's feelings and explained.
jq2u | The dog had seen them coming and had projected the thought to Bayazid that he must be sinful to have been created a dog, while this great man must be saintly because he was able to appear in such a resplendent and honoured form.
9zf9 | Tt was because of this idea of that dog's,' said Bayazid, 'that I gave him precedence.'

aki1 | Secrecy
vf5h | Q: There seems to be no traditional psychology or similar study without a conception of secrets and secrecy. Why is this, and what is the nature of this secrecy?
l51p | A: Among the Sufis, the technical term 'secret' is applied to 'the innermost consciousness of man', and may be found authori- tatively rendered as such. It is common knowledge among people of traditional spiritual systems that there are differences in the significance and emphasis of the idea of the 'secret*, according to the condition of the person involved.
s9zz | Here are some examples:
x97k | STIMULATION
qwix | (1) People who are seen to be strongly influenced by the idea of secrecy, and stimulated by it, thus automatically reveal them- selves as curiosity-mongers, and the Sufi, for instance, will know how to deal with such a person. It may well be that he has ruled himself out while he remains a mere anticipator of secrets.
6lnq | ENERGISING
nxb1 | (2) The idea of a 'secret', for those who can adopt a correct attitude towards it, can sometimes have an energising effect, be- cause for them it constitutes the discovery or attainment of some- thing which is prized and valuable. This point has been specifically emphasised by Ibn el-Arabi among the Sufis.
kwpw | PRIVACY
usfa | (3) Secrecy has often been confused with privacy; privacy is needed to eliminate sources of interruption when people are con- centrating upon something.
dnjr | 63
qser | RELATIVITY
8gam | (4) Secrecy can be the word applied to the fact that something is not ready to be revealed, or that it is 'hidden' from someone at a particular time for a good reason: and this reason may not be any more than effectiveness of operation, to ensure progress.
z4db | Many things which are called 'secrets' are only things withheld from people until they can understand or effectively experience them.
lw7l | To clamour for 'secrets' or to do the equivalent (to want them unknowingly) is a characteristic of man, strongly marked in al- most all undertakings and stages of maturity, by no means con- fined to esoteric areas. If you narrow your conception of secrecy to a crude definition of something which is being kept from you, for instance, you do no more than show that you are unlikely to be flexible and sensitive enough to understand the 'secret' aspects of refined and subtle things. Many 'secrets' are best kept by the denial of any secret, or by people appearing, as Sufis often do, to be people of simplicity and ordinariness. The advantage of this to the Sufi is that it relieves him of the need to avoid or combat secret-seekers: they regard him as superficial or 'ordinary'.
2exi | PENETRATION OF MEANING
16py | One 'secret' of the Sufis is their method of making people aware of truths contained in experiences and also in literature, which are denied these people by the barriers which habit or subjective emotions raise up.
m4ov | Saadi says, in his Bostan: 'The door of illumination is open to those for whom other doors are closed.' These doors are often those of intellectuality, of believing that one's own ideas will open doors, and doors to purely scholastic or merely systematic ap- proaches, without the insight which enables one to clear the mind of rubbish.
9uqd | THE SECRET OF THE SECRET
8szx | The Sufi paradox: 'The secret of Sufism is that it has no secret at all' means that what is secret and hidden to those who are not
iwdc | 64
4vks | realised Sufis becomes understood and experienced to the Sufi, and therefore ceases to be termed a secret at all.
uyaf | The word Sirr, generally translated as 'secret', stands in ac- cepted Sufi terminology for 'the innermost consciousness'. So that, if the innermost consciousness is not known to its possessor, it remains for him 'secret'. And, on the verbal level, where by definition consciousness cannot be experienced, only referred to, it remains for that reason 'secret', 'hidden'.
d1qh | One of the abilities of Sufis is that they can see through the outward show and self-deception of others, and are thus able to teach these prisoners of the secondary self to attain to the real 'secret', innermost consciousness, within.
nyqt | THE TURKISH MAIDEN
7odd | Yusuf al-Razi illustrated this capacity to read minds, and also how others lack this and judge by appearances, in his famous story, found in Attar's Recital of the Friends.
0le2 | It is related that Hiri was once asked to look after a Turkish maiden by a Persian merchant who was going on a journey. Hiri became infatuated with this girl and decided that he must seek out his teacher, Abu-Hafs the Blacksmith. Abu-Hafs told him to travel to Raiyy, there to obtain the advice of the great Sufi Yusuf al-Razi.
5dw0 | When he arrived in Raiyy and asked people there where the sage's dwelling was, they told him to avoid such a heretic and free- thinker, and so he went back to Nishapur. Reporting to Abu-Hafs, he was told to ignore the people's opinions of al-Razi, and seek him out again.
i4yq | In spite of the almost unanimous urgings of the people of Raiyy, he made his way to where al-Razi sat. There he found the ancient, accompanied by a beautiful youth who was giving him a wine-cup.
fj3g | Scandalised, Hiri demanded an explanation of how such a reverend contemplative could behave in such a manner.
zuua | But al-Razi explained that the youth was his son and the wine- cup contained only water, and had been abandoned by someone
elwn | 65
jnqv | else. This was the reality of his state, which everyone imagined to be a life of dissolution.
unp3 | But Hiri now wanted to know why the Sufi behaved in such a manner that people interpreted it as heretical.
v8vk | Al-Razi said: I do these things so that people may not bur- den me with Turkish maidens.'
sr40 | 'You Cant Teach by Correspondence'
5zjj | I HAVE before me a packet of dehydrated onions.
f56l | Let these dried onions stand for something which has been written down. They are neither the original experience (the onion) nor are they nothing at all. They possess a virtuality.
ar2z | Add hot water, and this is absorbed by your dried material. After a few minutes, we have something which we know to have been dried onions, but which is not now the same. What we now have is 'reconstituted onion'.
yad0 | We do not have whole onions, it is true. Neither do we have fresh onions. But we have something which will enable us to recognise fresh onions when we see and taste them. This is an advance upon dried onions.
3g38 | The original experience was fresh onions. The water was the addition made by the right circumstances of study. The result is edible, and this is a suitable substitute for fresh onions. It contains some nutrition, too.
vtbo | Those who say: 'You cannot make anything out of dried onions' - the equivalent of 'You cannot get anything from a book' -are wrong. Those who say: 'I will wait (or search) until I find fresh onions' are wrong. They are wrong because they do not realise that they would not recognise 'fresh onions' if they saw them. This has to be said, though reluctantly, because such state- ments are usually taken as challenging, when they are more often intended only to be descriptive.
q8pa | Let us therefore postulate the statement: 'You can get some- thing from a book. That something may be so important as to lead you to the recognition of the real thing. It is therefore in many cases all-important.'
uc9x | INGREDIENTS
zy7o | But why should people imagine that there is nothing in a book of the same order as 'fresh' experience? Simply because they do
kcar | not know that specific circumstances (such as water added to the onion shreds) are needed before they can get anything. It is the Sufic purpose to help towards the provision of the water as well as the dried onion, so that in due time fresh onions may be presented.
00aw | HUMILITY
351p | One of the real reasons for the attempted inculcation of a really 'humble' attitude towards Ufe and learning in traditional teaching techniques is to try to enable people to adopt a point of view which will allow them to 'approach onions through whatever condition of onion is available'.
zzcb | Of course, such teachings in inept hands rapidly turn into moralistic ones. Instead of saying the above, people cast around for a logical prop to teach patience and humility. They soon find it: 'Humility is good for society. It makes people good, pure, etc' This, however, is the social level, not the metaphysical one. If you are 'humble', it may help you in ordinary life. If you are not, you will get nowhere in higher things.
mxnx | If people cannot adopt a 'humble' attitude towards something which they are being invited to study, they are not able to study it at all. Therefore there is no such issue as is frequently supposed, where people ask: 'Why should I obey something which I do not know?' The question is invalid because whoever is at that stage cannot obey or disobey: he can only remain a fairly querulous enquirer. He is not master of the option, so there is neither any validity in the question nor any need for an answer, other than a description of his state. The hope lies in the possibility that he may recognise his condition through a description of it, and adjust his attitude accordingly.
11k8 | People, however, more often than not adopt secondary indica- tions as primary, and Sufi teachers have to take into account this tendency. Sometimes they provide deliberately contrived shocks to display the limited nature of the would-be student's thinking, to help him (or her) to gain a deeper understanding of themselves and hence to liberate a wider perspective enabling them to learn.
twwy | Such a shock is contained in the tale told by Bayazid Bistami.
fyp8 | 68
z994 | IDOLATRY
vvqn | A man, he recounted, met him on the road and asked where he was going. Bayazid told him that as he had two hundred dinars, he was going on the Pilgrimage to Mecca.
p6xg | The man said: 'Circumambulate me seven times, and let that be your Pilgrimage, for I have dependents.'
bppc | So, continued Bayazid, he did what the man asked, and returned to his own house.
ilnw | More often than not, such an adjustment, because it involves admitting that previous thinking-patterns are inadequate, is not sufficiently welcome to him. He seeks something which will bolster the desire to feel that he is significant.
f3rc | He very easily finds such a creed, individual or institution: because almost all of the current ones specialise - whether they know it or not - in judicious flattery. Even if flattery is alternated with disapproval, it remains flattery.
d7bx | This is one reason why it is so important to understand one's personal motivation.
gx97 | An important aspect of this theme of the value of intermediary materials as catalytic elements is to note that there is a form of learning by direct and provoked perception. This is distinct from learning through rote methods or by selective study where that study is planned by the student or by someone else who does not have a full perception of the student's needs.
ppkp | APPEARANCE AND FUNCTION
8br6 | We speak here of function, not appearance. There is an interesting parallel in an event which I remember from a time when some literalists were questioning Sidi Abu-Yusuf on Sufi teachers. His answer both shows their mentality and how it fails to accord with reality:
de3k | The questions covered the claims made by or on behalf of Sufi exponents to be Supreme Chief of the Sufis.
2kb3 | Abu-Yusuf said: 'This is a metaphor only and does not imply any rivalry. It does not encompass, either, any idea of hierarchy in formal organisation. Furthermore, it does not mean that each
lqcx | 69
3h7w | claims (or has claimed for him) to be Chief of All the Sufis. It only means that, for those who are following their instructions, Sufi teachers must be regarded as the chief and only source of wisdom. This role is no greater than that of any teacher whose pupils must maintain their concentration and learning ability by not dividing their attention to other subjects, such as - in this case -a hierarchy of teachers. The real chiefs of the Sufis exist and operate in a generally non-perceived realm and are never known in their higher functions; though these personages may present themselves as mere Sufi masters from time to time-as they may assume any other guise - to carry on their functions.'
th5p | 70
b7nk | Background to 'Humility'
cbb5 | BEFORE the period generally regarded as historical time, there has been an operation of a form of cognition linked with human development which is outside the current methods of acquiring and utilising information. The result of this effort has often been called 'wisdom': although the word wisdom has also often been applied to other fields.
5qcf | RELICS ARE NOT THE THING ITSELF
8u2c | Many religious, mystical and other formulations are, up to a point, shrines for the relics of a completely or partially successful attempt to present and make available to various individuals and communities means for acquiring this knowledge. Like almost everything on earth, they are subject to deterioration or fossilisa- tion. They become both museums and exhibits, at one and the same time.
c1e3 | Because of the tendency to stress discipline and group-attention without contemporaneous adjustments of other factors, many such formulations (some of them called schools or cults) crystallised in the short or long term, and not infrequently they have claimed a monopoly of truth or effective ritual. This process, mirroring limited thinking-patterns, frequently goes so far as to lead to . virtual destruction of the dynamic of the formulation of the School. In practice, exclusivism and dogmatism, beyond a certain point, militate against certain necessities of flexibility. There is a continuing need for regeneration.
7pez | What appears to some people as the sum total of the human heritage of philosophy, metaphysics or even magical thinking can also be viewed, for the foregoing reasons, as heavily burdened with the wreckage or misinterpretation (through selective choice) of formulations previously operated by coherent Schools. The factor causing this state of affairs is endemic in the human community, and has often been unsuspected by large sections of whole rivilisa-
qs5t | 7i
en4s | tions; though made the subject of close attention and rectification by specialists outside of mechanical and confined thought. Such specialists are those who can grasp internal principles and dy- namics : not those who merely rearrange.
