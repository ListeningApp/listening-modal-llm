        "content": "yogo | The poor quality of intelligence collection on the CPVF deployment can account for the American surprise in the First Chinese Campaign. But it cannot explain the surprise of the Second Campaign of late November. As Appleman argued, \"It is obvious that the FEC was in possession of a great amount of intelligence concerning the Chinese and their relations to the Korean War.\" Haynes was even sharper, arguing, \"By the end of the first week of November nineteen fifty, the FEC G-Two had enough data to identify the Chinese order of battle in Korea and should have been able to determine that the Chinese Communists had fully committed to entering the Korean War.\" Indeed, the battles that took place during the First Campaign and the reports provided by POW interrogations sufficed to warrant a conclusion that the CPVF OB in Korea was far larger than Willoughby's estimates indicated.\n2285 | Some students of the subject tried to explain this failure as the consequence of a sophisticated deception effort by the Chinese to make the CPVF forces look smaller than what they actually were. The plan involved Sigint deception, false reports by POWs, and a hasty withdrawal to the north aimed at portraying the First Campaign as a solitary intervention in the war. But although one should not disregard the Chinese capacity for deception, it cannot count for the American estimation failure. Thus, for example, while Roe highlighted the objective difficulties involved in locating the CPVF crossing into Korea by aerial photography, a semi-official history of the air war emphasized that the air reconnaissance units involved \"might have done a better job if they had known what they were expected to discover.\" Nor was the mission considered as too important, since \"[I]ntelligence officers did not view reports of an enemy build-up in the mountains south of Huichon with much concern.\" In other words, ineffective tasking and lack of concern by intelligence officers contributed to this failure no less than the objective difficulties, including Chinese deception.\nys0g | By this stage, it is clear that neither disregard of a possible Chinese intervention nor insufficient information about it can account for the surprise of late November. The best and most accurate explanations, indeed, are to be found once again in the human factor.\n7zvp | Two. Decision-making\nww6u | The decision to allow MacArthur to renew his offensive was taken in an ambiguous atmosphere. Acheson noted in his memoirs: \"All the president's advisers in this matter, civilian and military, knew that something was badly wrong, though what it was, how to find out, and what to do about it they muffed.\" Ridgway described a similar atmosphere in the JCS:\nhpi6 | There was no joy in the Pentagon at seeing our forces dispersed in the manner that MacArthur has now dispersed them, especially when the threat of massive Chinese intervention looked now so probable and so imminent. But in the Pentagon as well as in the field there was an utmost superstitious awe of this larger-than-life military figure who had so often been right when everyone else had been wrong, who had never admitted a mistake in judgment, yet whose mistakes in judgment had been remarkably few. Then there were those who felt that it was useless to try to check a man who might react to criticism by pursuing his own way with increased stubbornness and fervor.\n4uhb | Consequently, as an official history of the war concluded, \"the most critical element in weighing the risks of Chinese intervention was the deference paid to the opinions of Gen. MacArthur.\" In addition, both civilian and military policymakers were dependent on information concerning the magnitude of the CPVF threat. The information came from MacArthur and his G-Two. In this sense, the center of gravity of decision-making in November nineteen fifty was not Washington but Tokyo, and the most relevant actors were MacArthur and his staff officers, primarily Willoughby.\nepyi | Decision-making in the Far East attracted insufficient attention, certainly in comparison to the volume of studies of the corresponding processes in Washington. This is peculiar not only because of MacArthur's mythological place in American military history and the critical role he personally played at this stage in the war, but also because of the impact of what can be termed the \"Bataan Gang mentality\" that dominated intelligence-making and operational planning in October and November nineteen fifty.\ny51p | The \"Bataan Gang\" (also known as \"Bataan Boys\") was the nickname of the group of staff officers that MacArthur had started to assemble around him in the late nineteen thirties. In July nineteen forty-one, when he was nominated to command the newly established Far Eastern Command, the nucleus of the group was made up of seven officers, including Willoughby. In March nineteen forty-two, when MacArthur escaped by torpedo boat from the Corregidor Island in the Philippines to Australia, he took fifteen officers with him, who made up what became known as the \"Bataan Gang.\" The group was divided into the upper-level faction made up of eight higher-rank and position officers, and the rest were personal staff.\nx95m | In addition to providing a cohesive body of staff work under MacArthur's leadership, the group dynamic was nourished by the three necessary conditions for the creation of charisma: a leader with charismatic qualities (a spark); followers who are open to his charisma (flammable material); and an environment favorable to charisma (oxygen). In this case, MacArthur's military skills combined with his personal charisma and his paranoia provided the spark. The group of personally devoted officers he cultivated during his many years of Army service and built up around him, first in the Philippines and later in Australia, made the flammable material. And the oxygen was made up of elements such as the risky travel by torpedo boats to Australia, the sense of being left behind by Washington when it came to allocation of the resources needed to win the war in the Pacific, MacArthur's subsequent battle victories in the face of opposition, and his personal paranoia that ascribed negative developments to personal persecution. Together they made the Bataan Boys \"an extension of his ego,\" leading them to give up their individuality. As one of them told John Gunther, \"I honestly can't tell you anything. He's too enormous, too unpredictable. I don't really understand him myself. No one could.\"\nyfum | Although some of the symptoms of this group dynamic-such as the illusion of invulnerability, rationalization, and the unshakable belief in the group's morality-bring to mind Janis's groupthink notion, this dynamics did not rule the Bataan Gang. Its members were hand-picked by MacArthur over the years first and foremost according to their degree of personal loyalty to him. Remaining in the group was primarily the function of the members' ability to please MacArthur, and the way to do it was through automatic (and motivated) agreement with him and consent to him. There were, furthermore, intergroup rivalries, and not all group members respected each other. Lastly, in many cases the interactions were between MacArthur and specific assistants rather than whole-group discussions, where groupthink dynamics would more likely arise. \"They catered,\" Manchester wrote, \"to his peacockery, genuflected to his viceregal whims, and shared his conviction that plotters were bent upon stabbing him in the back.\" This is not how groupthink works; it sounds far more like cult of personality.\nppx4 | Since arriving in Australia, the group members had built a barrier around MacArthur. Their utmost loyalty and devotion, which gained them his personal backing and support, defined as MacArthur's only \"blind spot,\" turned them into an exclusive and powerful group, to the extent that \"The mere mention that a particular staff officer was one of the Bataan Boys was often enough to quell opposition.\" Nevertheless, until recently, they did not receive the attention they deserved.",
