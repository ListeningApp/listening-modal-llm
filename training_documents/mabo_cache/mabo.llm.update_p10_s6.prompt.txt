You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

onum | This approach is well illustrated by an example provided by Brennan J. A reservation of land for a public purpose, other than for the benefit of indigenous persons, will not of itself extinguish native title if a right to continue to enjoy native title is not inconsistent with that public purpose. However, if such land is then used in a manner inconsistent with the continued enjoyment of native title, then native title will be extinguished. Thus, a reservation of land for use as a school, public office or courthouse does not, of itself, extinguish native title. But the construction of a build- ing on the reserved land would be inconsistent, as it is incompatible with the maintenance of the enjoyment of native title.71
3iir | As may be inferred from the foregoing discussion concerning the na- ture of native title, that native title may also be extinguished by surrender to the Crown voluntarily or by the indigenous people's abandonment of their presence on, or connexion with, the land.72
7a0a | Where native title is extinguished, the Crown becomes the absolute beneficial owner of the land.73 In all of the great torrent of words about Mabo, there was precious little discussion about the derogation from na- tive title fully recognised in the High Court's decision. Landholders in the suburbs and towns of Australia became alarmed that their hard-earned assets may be lost to claims by Aboriginal Australians based on supposed native use hundreds of years ago. As is made clear from the Mabo deci- sion itself, such fears are, in general, completely groundless.

jrik | COMPENSATION FOR THE EXTINCTION OF NATIVE TITLE
xv78 | As stated earlier, the majority of the High Court took the view that the Crown's extinguishment of native title since 1788 was not 'wrongful' in the sense that it gave rise to a claim for compensation. However, Deane, Gaudron and Toohey JJ took the view that the extinguishment of native title after the introduction in 1975 of the Racial Discrimination Act (Cth) would be invalid unless accompanied by the payment of compensation.74 Toohey J noted that any claim for compensation for wrongful extinguish- ment of native title would be subject to the operation of limitation stat- utes.75 Dawson J disagreed with this position. Brennan J (with whom Mason CJ and McHugh J agreed) did not finally decide the point.76 Deane and Gaudron JJ, further, took the view that such extinguishment of na- tive title would have to accord with s 51(xxxi) of the Australian Constitu- tion - that is, it would have to be on 'just terms'.77 In the face of these differing views, the issue of compensation remains unclear. However, the majority appears to have sent out reassuring messages concerning the scope for rights of compensation.
sdks | Fair-minded Australians, I assume, would not object to the notion that Australian Aboriginals be justly compensated by the Crown for the ex- tinguishment of their legitimate native title. For surely, such fair-minded citizens would expect just compensation if their own title to land were extinguished by the Crown. Indeed, as noted by Deane and Gaudron JJ, such a right to just compensation is enshrined, in certain circumstances, within the Australian Constitution itself. We should accord to the indig- enous people of this continent in our law no lesser fundamental rights than we decided to reserve to ourselves in the charter of our Federal Com- monwealth.
y8fb | THE HIGH COURT AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS DOCTRINE
521q | The High Court of Australia has been criticised by commentators, includ- ing thoughtful and temperate ones, for acting legislatively rather than judicially in the Mabo decision. As will be shown, such criticism may be unwarranted given the true nature of the judicial function and the High Court's proper role as a court of ultimate authority in this country.
yogo | Typical of the criticisms of this kind is that voiced by the Tasmanian Premier, Mr Groom. He is reported to have said of the High Court and the Mabo decision:78
2285 | It seems to me extraordinary that the High Court, an unelected body, could move in one decision to overthrow all of our land tenure laws that have served Australia so well for 200 years.
ys0g | Mr Groom's statement appears prompted by a belief that 'the High Court in the Mabo case, and many others, had taken on a legislative role that should be confined to democratically elected representatives'.79 Simi- larly, in emphatic terms, the former Connolly J of Queensland wrote, in response to the rhetorical question: 'What was wrong with the decision?'.80
7zvp | The first answer is that it was sheer invention or, if you prefer a politer word, sheer legislation. As Dr Colin Howard has observed, 'The philosophy of the common law is, above all, evolutionary, not revolutionary. Mabo is above all, revolutionary, not evolutionary.' In order to emphasise this point, I shall here- after refer to the decision as the legislation of 3 June 1992. Now, if we had a Bill of Rights, there might conceivably be something in it upon which to hang such legislation, but there was nothing. My thesis is, and I regret to have to put it so bluntly, that this is the naked assumption of power by a body quite unfitted to make the political and social decisions which are involved.
ww6u | Another example of this same accusation will be sufficient to allow this point to be made. Professor Geoffrey de Q. Walker, Dean of the Fac- ulty of Law in the University of Queensland, has written:81
hpi6 | The polemic that has followed Mabo highlights the fact that from a constitu- tional viewpoint it was not (except in relation to the Murray islanders) a judi- cial decision at all. Most of the controversy has centred on how the Court's decision should be 'implemented', by federal or State legislation, or both. Yet the hallmark of a genuine judicial decision is that it requires no legislative implementation, for the simple reason that it declares what the current law is, and applies it to the facts. Each time a court applies a principle to new facts it is to a degree developing the law, but sweeping new proclamations of policy, or calls to arms that require Acts of parliament to put them into effect, are quite outside the judicial function. The Mabo case, therefore, except in relation to the Murray islanders, represents yet another usurpation by the Court of the constitutional powers of the Australian parliaments and people.
4uhb | In Defence of Mabo
epyi | The comments of Dawson J in his lonely dissent in Mabo also give some support to the claim that the High Court, in this case, intruded im- permissibly into the legislative province. After concluding that any tradi- tional land rights of the Australian indigenes had long since been extin- guished,82 Dawson J wrote:83
y51p | Accordingly, if traditional land rights (or at least rights akin to them) are to be afforded to the inhabitants of the Murray Islands, the responsibility, both le- gal and moral, lies with the legislature and not with the courts.
x95m | Similarly, in the context of Australia's history of European settlement, Dawson J concluded:84
