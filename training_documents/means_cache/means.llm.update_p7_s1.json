        "content": "7zvf | accounted for only six point one percent. This additional information provides some insight into the substantive importance of puppy therapy. The next table is the ANOVA table, which is also divided into two sections. The top half represents the effect of the covariate alone, whereas the bottom half represents the whole model (i.e., covariate and puppy therapy included). Notice at the bottom of the ANOVA table (the bit for model two) that the entire model (love of puppies and the dummy variables) accounts for thirty-one point nine two units of variance S S sub M, there are one hundred ten point nine seven units in total S S sub T and the unexplained variance S S sub R is seventy-nine point zero five.\nmov9 | The interesting bit is the table of model coefficients (Output thirteen point two). The top half shows the effect when only the covariate is in the model, and the bottom half contains the whole model. The B values for the dummy variables represent the difference between the means of the fifteen-minute group and the control group (Dummy one) and the thirty-minute group and the control group (Dummy two - see Section twelve point two for an explanation of why). The means of the fifteen-and thirty-minute groups were four point eight eight and four point eight five respectively, and the mean of the control group was three point two two. Therefore, the B values for the two dummy variables should be roughly the same four point eight eight minus three point two two equals one point six six for Dummy one and four point eight five minus three point two two equals one point six three for Dummy two). The astute among you might notice that the B values in Output thirteen point two are not only very different from each other (which shouldn't be the case because the fifteen-and thirty-minute groups means are virtually the same), but also different from the values I've just calculated. Does this mean I've been lying to you for the past fifty pages about what the beta values represent? I'm evil, but I'm not that evil. The reason for this apparent anomaly is that with a covariate present, the B values represent the differences between the means of each group and the control adjusted for the covariate(s). In this case, they represent the difference in the means of the puppy therapy groups adjusted for the love of puppies. Output thirteen point one\nks7m | These adjusted means come directly from the model. If we replace the B values in equation thirteen point one with the values in Output thirteen point two, our model becomes: Happiness equals one point seven eight nine plus two point two two five Long plus one point seven eight six Short plus zero point four one six Puppy love (thirteen point two) Remember that Long and Short are dummy variables such that Long takes the value of one only for the thirty-minute group, and Short takes a value of one only for the fifteen-minute group; in all other situations they have a value of zero. To get the adjusted means, we use this equation, but rather than replacing the covariate with an individual's score, we replace it with the mean value of the covariate from Table thirteen point two (two point seven three) because we're interested in the predicted value for each group at the mean level of the covariate. For the control group, the dummy variables are both coded as zero, so we replace Long and Short in the model with zero. The adjusted mean will, therefore, be two point nine two five: Happiness Control equals one point seven eight nine plus (two point two two five times zero) plus (one point seven eight six times zero) plus (zero point four one six times X Puppy love) equals one point seven eight nine plus (zero point four one six times two point seven three) (thirteen point three) equals two point nine two five\nw1w1 | For the fifteen-minute group, the dummy variable Short is one and Long is zero, so the adjusted mean is four point seven one:\nh8gv | Happiness bar fifteen minutes equals one point seven eight nine plus (two point two two five times zero) plus (one point seven eight six times one) plus (zero point four one six times X bar Puppy love) equals one point seven eight nine plus one point seven eight six plus (zero point four one six times two point seven three) (thirteen point four)\nkwkp | equals four point seven one For the thirty-minute group, the dummy variable Short is zero and Long is one, so the adjusted mean is five point one five:\nyj0m | Happiness tilde thirty minutes equals one point seven eight nine plus (two point two two five times one) plus (one point seven eight six times zero) plus (zero point four one six times X bar Puppy love) equals one point seven eight nine plus two point two two five plus (zero point four one six times two point seven three) equals five point one five (thirteen point five)\newfp | We can now see that the B values for the two dummy variables represent the differences between these adjusted means four point seven one minus two point nine three equals one point seven eight for Dummy one and five point one five minus two point nine three equals two point two two for Dummy two). These adjusted means are the average amount of happiness for each group at the mean level of love of puppies. Some people think of this kind of model (i.e., ANCOVA) as 'controlling' for the covariate, because it compares the predicted group means at the average value of the covariate, so the groups are being compared at a level of the covariate that is the same for each group. However, as we shall see, the 'controlling for the covariate' analogy is not a good one.\noczy | Output thirteen point two\n2ttg | Thirteen point four Assumptions and issues in ANCOVA",
