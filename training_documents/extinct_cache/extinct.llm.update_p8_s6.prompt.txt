You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

5bq3 | Assuming that anthropogenic extinctions are morally problematic, how should they be avoided? What are morally permissible (or even demanded) means of doing so? One way of morally responding to extinctions is to turn our attention to species that have not yet gone extinct, but which are at risk of extinction (related to this, see arguments about the relevance of rarity [e.g. Gunn, 1980; James, 2024] and arguments that emphasise endangered species [e.g. Smith, 2016]).
ezla | This relates to the much broader body of work on the conservation of species in which new means and policies are being developed and discussed from a multidisciplinary perspective. To give one example (out of many) of philosophical discussion pertaining endangered species, consider 'assisted migration' or 'species translocation'. The discussion about such proposals originated in grassroot activism but was taken up by ecologists, and ethicists soon joined the debate (Sandler, 2010, 2012; Hällfors et al., 2014; Palmer and Larson, 2014; Siipi and Ahteensuu, 2016; Minteer, 2017; Preston, 2018; Palmer, 2021). The idea is to transfer populations to more suitable habitats where those species did not exist before to prevent them from going extinct. This is a conservation approach that is meant to be appro- priate because of climate change (Hällfors et al., 2014). There are different views on this matter. For example, there are discussions about how intentional translocation affects the value of the target species and its habitats (Siipi and Ahteensuu, 2016; Siipi, 2017). To Sandler, who focuses on the ethics of species, assisted colonisation is only justified in rare occasions in which 'the translocated species
rsbu | would be ecologically or instrumentally valuable in the recipient site (and this can be reliably predicted in advance), or the species has final value' (2012, 85) (see section "Involving loss of value due to the loss of species" regarding Sandler's understanding of such value). From an animal rights perspective, in turn, Angie Pepper argues that 'the permissibility of practices like assisted migration hinges on whether or not we can justify imposing risks on animals in order to prevent rights violations further down the line' (2019, 602).
magd | Risk of extinction
tb74 | For the purposes of moral theorising, 'risk' refers to the likelihood of a loss or harm taking place, which makes 'risk' a value concept referring to an unwanted outcome through human actions, in addition to an epistemological dimension where that outcome is likely to happen with a specific probability (Hansson, 2013). If that probability is unknown, it is referred to as 'uncertainty' rather than 'risk', which often motivates a precautionary approach. With respect to species extinction, there are two main ways of discussing risks and extinctions: the first focuses on the risk of a single species facing extinction, and the second pays attention to broader systemic and accumulative risks, either in terms of mass extinction or in terms of a collapse of the biospheric system as we know it.
8l69 | Regarding single species, risk is a premeditative concept that enables us to respond to near-extinction, such as when a species extinction is predicted to happen in the light of best ecological modelling, where the predicted quantity of extinctions has often been referred to as 'extinction debt' (Hanski and Ovaskainen, 2002; Kuus- saari et al., 2009). Against this background, deliberations on employ- ing concepts and ideas drawn from ecological sciences and (meta) population biology are taking place within environmental ethics and the philosophy of biology, which includes topics of ethical relevance such as decision-making under uncertainty and the applicability of the precautionary principle, land-use planning, protected area networking and prioritisation (Norton, 1987; Sarkar, 2005).
1jyv | Risks have value dimensions, and what value is justifiably ascribed to a species will play a part in how it is to be prioritised (see section "Why (or when) might anthropogenic extinctions be morally problematic?"). Most efforts to save near-extinct species require prioritising: global and national Red Lists of Threatened Species are examples of such a conservation policy, as is Bryan Norton's 'triage model' (1987, 258). Yet, prioritisations come with a range of philosophical problems. According to Norton, many of those challenges arise due to the difficulties of reducing the values of species to a single scale (1987, 255).
olce | A broader perspective to the risk landscape emerges when we consider what kinds of systemic risks each extinction gives rise to (which is related to some of the concerns introduced in section "Leading to the loss of valuable biological variety"). A common argument rests on an analogy between species extinctions and the loss of rivets on an airplane wing (Ehrlich and Ehrlich, 1981).6 It aims to show that the ethical significance of extinction is due to its potential effects on ecosystems (the loss of too many
erx1 | Cambridge Prisms: Extinction
b3bt | 'rivets'), which in turn are prerequisites for human and nonhuman survival. When conjunct with uncertainty regarding the number of rivets, or species, that an airplane wing, or ecosystem, can dispose of without collapsing, it becomes essential to preserve species and avoid their extinction (for a critical discussion of the analogy, see Sarkar, 2005).
0w8m | This expresses a form of precautionary principle, which has been discussed both critically and approvingly from different philosoph- ical perspectives (Sandin, 2004; Sarkar, 2005; Hourdequin, 2007; Newman et al., 2017; Tanswell, 2022). The precautionary principle is also a part of the preamble of the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD, 1993) where it is stated that lack of full knowledge ought not to justify inaction, and it is mentioned in the framework of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES n.d.). The complexity and uncer- tainty pertaining to how ecosystems work (Regan et al., 2002; Sarkar, 2005) provide support for a precautionary principle con- cerning environmental decision-making. Yet, some authors con- sider its policy implications problematic due to leading to logical contradictions by potentially recommending two opposing actions (e.g. recommending the development of and simultaneously the prevention of developing genetically modified organisms), failing to account for possible benefits, neglecting that precaution has costs and for lacking conceptual clarity (Newman et al., 2017; critiqued in turn in Baard, 2022).
vcu3 | De-extinction
hjzj | What should be done after extinctions have already occurred? Besides more conventional species conservation practices, there is a broader discussion on the ethics of developing and using biotech- nologies for conservation purposes and beyond (Ehrenfeld, 2006; Basl and Sandler, 2013; Kaebnick and Murray, 2013; Oksanen and Siipi, 2014; Preston, 2018). Setting these larger concerns aside, more technology-focused conservation approaches - if justifiable in cer- tain cases - should be seen as complementary rather than alterna- tives to conventional conservation practices (Sandler, 2021b). Accordingly, the subject of debate concerns whether there are certain cases where such technological means are appropriate and desirable at all.
