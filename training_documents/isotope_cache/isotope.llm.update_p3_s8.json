        "content": "68xu | Methanol Derivatization. The alcohol products produced by MMOH were first derivatized by the Schotten-Baumann procedure. The reaction solution following the single turnover was added to C H two C l two, fifty milliliters, and then esterified using three point five-dinitrobenzoyl chloride, two millimol, N,N-dimethylaniline, two millimol, and N a O H, two millimol. The mixture was stirred for seventeen hours at room temperature. The organic layer was washed with three times one hundred milliliters of H C L, one point zero molar, followed by three times one hundred milliliters of five percent N a H C O three-two molar N a C l, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evaporated to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in two point zero milliliters of C H two C l two. Thin-layer chromatography using silica gel plates and C H C l three as the mobile phase allowed separation of the methyl ester product at an R f of zero point five to zero point seven. The area containing the product was scraped off and eluted with C H two C l two. The C H two C l two was evaporated to a minimal amount and the product was analyzed by mass spectrometry.\nhd35 | Mass Spectrometric Analysis. G C-M S was performed by using a Carlo-Erba gas chromatograph with a capillary D B-five column, with direct injection into a Kratos M S-twenty-five spectrometer. The retention times were determined using authentic material. The mass spectrometer was set to an ionization potential of seventy electronvolts and selectively measured the molecular ion. Differential deuteration of the derivatized product resulted in partial separation of the two products on the G C column, necessitating the summing of multiple mass measurements, approximately fifteen, as the products eluted off the G C column. Each sample was analyzed in this way four times and the numbers were averaged. The isotope effect was calculated from the ratio of the products formed by H and D abstraction. Statistical factors were used when necessary to correct for different amounts of H and D of the substrate isotopic homologs.\n2zpk | Steady State Kinetic Experiments. The reaction rates were monitored by measuring the rates of oxygen consumption using a Clark-type oxygen electrode fitted to a reaction chamber sealed with a very small bore, less than zero point five millimeters, glass stopcock to minimize the flux into and out of the reaction chamber. In all cases, the initial oxygen concentration was two hundred fifty micromolar. The methane concentration was varied from ten micromolar to one point two millimolar by making appropriate additions of methane- saturated buffer to the reaction vessel. The total volume was held constant by the addition of nitrogen-saturated buffer. The concentrations of MMOH, MMOB, MMOR, and N A D H were three hundred seventy nanomolar, nine hundred twenty-five nanomolar, three hundred seventy-five nanomolar, and two hundred fifty micromolar, respectively. The reaction was initiated by the addition of one microliter of N A D H solution and repeated two to three times for each of ten different substrate concentrations. The buffer and temperature were the same as for the transient kinetic experiments, one hundred millimolar M O P S, p H seven point seven, at four degrees Celsius.\nepu7 | RESULTS\n7od1 | Rate of Compound Q Decay in the Presence of Deuterated Methanes. Compound Q formation and decay rates are easily determined by monitoring a single-turnover reaction at four hundred thirty nanometers using stopped-flow kinetic techniques and analyzing the data as described in Experimental Procedures. The rate of decay of compound Q is strongly dependent on the type and concentration of substrate present. Figure two shows the dependence of the compound Q decay rate constant on C H four and C D four concentrations. Each substrate caused a linear increase in the pseudo-first-order rate constant with increasing methane concentration. The slope of each line shown in Figure two gives the second-order rate constant for the reaction. Remarkably, the second-order rate constant for the C H four reaction is approximately one hundred times greater than that for the C D four reaction, indicative of an exceptionally large K I E. In contrast, no significant K I E or substrate concentration dependence was observed for the compound Q formation reaction.\n0bqy | The decay reactions were examined for artifacts that could lead to an apparent large isotope effect. Mixtures of C H four and C D four caused compound Q to decay in a single-exponential\nb780 | Isotope Effects in MMO Catalysis\nccmb | phase at the rate expected for the C H four concentration present. This demonstrates that the C D four samples used did not contain an inhibitor for the reaction and reinforces the observation that C D four is essentially unreactive compared to C H four. Also, it shows that the methane is in rapid equilibrium between the enzyme and the solvent, so that binding of the methane to, or collision with, the enzyme does not necessarily commit the reaction to completion.\nma93 | The same experiment was carried out with mono-, di-, and trideuterated methanes with the second-order decay rate constants shown in Figure three. The observed second-order rate constant decreases linearly with the extent of deuteration. Thus, the C-D bonds appear to be nearly inert to oxygen insertion in comparison with the C-H bonds.\nc6hh | Temperature Dependence of Compound Q Decay in the Presence of Methane. The activation energies and Arrhenius preexponential factors were measured for the reactions between compound Q and C H four and C D four. Since the reaction becomes very fast as the temperature is increased, the temperature range was limited from one point eight to seven degrees Celsius for C H four and from two point five to sixteen degrees Celsius for C D four, when each was present at three hundred micromolar. The H and D activation energies are twenty-two point four and twenty-four point five kilocalories per mole, respectively, giving a difference of two point one kilocalories per mole with an overall error of plus or minus ten percent. The apparent Arrhenius preexponential factor ratio, H to D, is approximately zero point ninety-six. The formation reactions showed the same activation energies, thirty-seven point three kilocalories per mole, and preexponential factors within experimental error.\ny7ea | Effect of Methane Deuteration on Product Ratio from Compound Q Decay. The methanol produced from a single turnover of diferrous MMOH was readily analyzed by G C-M S following derivatization as described in Experimental Procedures. Analysis of the results was simplified in some cases by the use of O eighteen O two in the oxygenation reaction, which served to shift the product mass by two units, so that it became distinct from the trace amounts of derivatized methanol originating from the extraction solvent. When C D four and O eighteen O two were used as the substrates the only product was C D three eighteen O H, showing that no exchange of oxygen or methyl hydrogens occurred. The results for the isotopic methane homologs\nnav4 | and mixtures of C H four and C D four are summarized in Table one. The product ratios clearly reveal a large deuterium isotope effect in all cases. However, the intramolecular deuterium isotope effect is in the range of four to thirteen rather than fifty to one hundred, as observed for compound Q decay rates. The largest value observed was nineteen point three for the intermolecular isotope effect for a one to one mixture of C H four and",
