        "content": "uz3c | AAV two-NRTN striatal delivery in monkeys led to its expression in both the striatum and substantia nigra, as well as increased levels of TH in the nigrostriatal system; though again this is not surprising but does demonstrate the ability of AAV two carrying NRTN to also transport to the substantia nigra after striatal injection. As in rats, AAV two-NRTN injected to both the striatum and substantia nigra has been shown to be neurorestorative in the monkey MPTP model, indicating its ability to be transported after the toxin damage and result in neuronal recovery. There is also evidence of recovery with another neurotrophic factor: CDNF, cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor, carried by AAV two. When AAV two-CDNF was injected before and after the six-OHDA to the striatum, it showed the recovery of striatal fibres as well as nigral neurons in addition to behavioural recovery, and CDNF protein was present in both structures.\nd5bi | In general, while the dopamine nerve terminals are destroyed in the striatum or putamen after toxin administration, transport of neurotrophic molecules to the substantia nigra may still be possible retrogradely, as described above, or anterogradely via medium spiny projection neurons, thus demonstrating that striatal injection of AAV carrying neurotrophic factors is a viable therapy for Parkinson's disease. Although, the anterograde transport of GDNF to the substantia nigra may not be as effective on functional restoration as compared with retrograde transport, it may be beneficial not to overexpress proteins in stressed substantia nigra dopamine neurons in patients.\nba4l | Three.
