You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

hd35 | Analyses
2zpk | To assess the amount of incremental variance explained by each type of antecedent, we analyzed data with hierarchical regression. First we entered the control variables (firm type, firm size, age, gender, ethnicity, education, group tenure, job status ). Consistent with the work on contextual analysis (e.g., Bedeian, Kemery, & Mossholder, 1989; Firebaugh, 1979; Moss- holder & Bedeian, 1983), we entered the individual-level pre- dictors ( satisfaction with the group and global self-esteem) prior to the group-level predictors (group size and style of manage- ment). Given the past emphasis on satisfaction as an antecedent of voice, we entered satisfaction prior to self-esteem. In the final step, we entered the product terms for each interaction. We assessed the significance of each step with the <LATEX>\Delta F</LATEX> and evaluated individual parameters at each step with t values. We plotted significant interactions using median splits.
epu7 | Results
7od1 | Descriptive statistics and intercorrelations are reported in Table 1, and results for the hierarchical regression anal- ysis are summarized in Table 2. Overall, our model ex- plained 17% (14% adjusted) of the variance in voice behavior assessed 6 months later,

Individuals in nonmanufacturing firms engaged in significantly more voice than individuals in manufacturing firms. Men, Whites, and those with at least some college experience engaged in more voice than women, non-Whites, and those with no college experience.
b780 | Satisfaction with the group explained an additional 3% of the variance in voice behavior 6 months later, <LATEX>\Delta F \left( 1 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. 4 3 1 \right) = 1 6 . 7 3 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>p < . 0 0 1 ,</LATEX> providing support for Hypothesis 1. As expected, group members who were more satisfied with the group engaged in more voice than group mem- bers who were less satisfied with their group.

Consistent with Hypothesis 4, individuals in self-managed groups exhibited more voice behavior than individuals in traditionally managed groups.
ncb0 | Finally, the block of interactions explained 3% of the variance in voice behavior 6 months later, AF (4, 424) = 3.56, p < . 01. Table 2 shows that both of the self-esteem- situation interactions reached significance. Figure 1 illus- trates the global self-esteem-group size interaction. Con- sistent with Hypothesis 5a, the negative relationship be- tween group size and voice was stronger for individuals with low self-esteem than for those with high self-esteem. Figure 2 shows the global self-esteem and style of man- agement interaction. As predicted by Hypothesis 5b, the positive relationship between self-management and voice was stronger for individuals with low self-esteem than for individuals with high self-esteem.
8mp0 | Although Table 2 shows that both of the satisfaction- situation interactions reached statistical significance, the plots illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 did not support Hypoth- eses 6a and 6b. Whereas we expected stronger relation- ships between the situational factors (group size and style of management) for individuals with low levels of satis-
xjyk | faction, the plots indicated stronger relationships for indi- viduals who were highly satisfied with their group. Spe-
mt0f | cifically, Figure 3 illustrates the stronger negative relation- ship between group size and voice for individuals who were more satisfied with the group and Figure 4 depicts the stronger positive relationship between self-manage- ment and voice for individuals who were more satisfied with their group.
awab | Discussion
ixcc | Given the increasing prevalence of work groups and the need for flexibility, adaptation, and innovation (Jelinek & Schoonhoven, 1993), voice behavior is an important con- cept that merits increased research attention. Although some studies have examined voice on the basis of Hirsch- man's (1970) model of exit, voice, and loyalty, past re- search had weak explanatory power. This difficulty stems
8p6h | from conceptual and methodological issues. In this study, we built on existing conceptual and empirical literatures to specify and test a predictive model of voice that in- cluded several of the possible person-centered and situa- tional antecedents of voice. Using a reliable measure of voice with initial construct validity support, our model explained 17% of the variance in peer ratings of employee voice behavior assessed 6 months later.
pmgl | Overview of Results
90no | The results of our study indicate support for the notion that voice is more than a function of satisfaction. Although

The variable self-esteem was also a marginally significant predictor of voice 6 months later. Individuals with high levels of global self-esteem were more likely to engage in voice than individuals with low levels of self-esteem. The situational variables also explained a significant amount of variance in peer-rated voice behavior. Consis-

Although the zero-order correlation was not significant, the regression analysis suggested that after several other variables were considered, there was a relationship be- tween style of management and voice such that those in self-managed groups engaged in more voice than those in traditional groups.

a0by | of considering interactions between person-centered and situational factors as predictors of voice. Consistent with Brockner's (1988) behavior plasticity theory, the relation- ship between the situational variables and voice was stronger for individuals with lower self-esteem. Low self- esteem individuals were more responsive to situational stimuli that foster voice. Extending the general idea of behavior plasticity theory to satisfaction, we proposed that the relationship between the situational variables and voice would be stronger for individuals with lower satis- faction. Instead, we found stronger situational relation- ships for those individuals with higher levels of satisfaction.
u1ky | Rethinking the Satisfaction-Contextual Factors Interactions
htm9 | Although we found significant interactions between sat- isfaction and contextual factors, the pattern of the relation- ships was the opposite of what we had predicted. Those with higher satisfaction were more responsive to the situa- tional factors than those with lower satisfaction. This un- expected finding suggests the need to review the assump- tions behind our hypotheses.
8hul | High satisfaction implies high plasticity. We had as- sumed that those with high satisfaction with the group were fulfilling their values, in part, through the group and that this would cause them to be more attached to the group. We expected that their attachment to and depen- dence on the group for continued satisfaction would cause them to engage in voice regardless of contextual factors. That is, we did not expect voice to vary significantly across situations for highly satisfied individuals. The pat- tern illustrated by the plots in Figures 3 and 4, however,
87vz | 863
ym66 | reveals that the favorability of group conditions (i.e., small or self-managed groups ) had a strong influence on the voice behavior of highly satisfied individuals. Highly satisfied individuals in large or traditionally-managed groups engaged in the same amount of voice as those who were less satisfied. However, when highly satisfied individuals were in small or self-managed groups, they engaged in more voice than those who were less satisfied. Kahn's (1990) research on "personal engagement" pro- vides one possible explanation for this finding.
