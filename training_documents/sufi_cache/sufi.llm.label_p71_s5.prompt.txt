You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

i096 | Because of the tendency to stress discipline and group-attention without contemporaneous adjustments of other factors, many such formulations (some of them called schools or cults) crystallised in the short or long term, and not infrequently they have claimed a monopoly of truth or effective ritual. This process, mirroring limited thinking-patterns, frequently goes so far as to lead to . virtual destruction of the dynamic of the formulation of the School. In practice, exclusivism and dogmatism, beyond a certain point, militate against certain necessities of flexibility. There is a continuing need for regeneration.
tlzt | What appears to some people as the sum total of the human heritage of philosophy, metaphysics or even magical thinking can also be viewed, for the foregoing reasons, as heavily burdened with the wreckage or misinterpretation (through selective choice) of formulations previously operated by coherent Schools. The factor causing this state of affairs is endemic in the human community, and has often been unsuspected by large sections of whole rivilisa-
6iyf | 7i
o1nk | tions; though made the subject of close attention and rectification by specialists outside of mechanical and confined thought. Such specialists are those who can grasp internal principles and dy- namics : not those who merely rearrange.
mnaf | THE TRADITION MAINTAINED BY COMPETENCE
0yxe | In contradistinction to the public and overt formulations familiar to all as stabilisations of many forms of religious, psychological and community action philosophies and other systems, there has always been a continuous, altruistic stream of guardianship of this comprehensive and adaptational knowledge, throughout history. This is based on capacity and knowledge, not on arbitrarily deciding to become a specialist.
erre | There are excellently sufficient reasons why the foregoing facts have never been more publicly known or accepted in any real depth. Among those more easily understandable by customary thinkers is the fact that 'to make an announcement such as this, to those who are basically selfish will serve mainly to increase their selfishness at the expense of their real, inner desire for truth'- thus further masking the potentialities of the Teaching from such people.
835g | Another, easily-understood, reason is that the existence of nar- row systems of thought (over-simplified to contain the aspirations without regard to potential, and to permit a wide-scale disciplin- ing of populations) has produced a type of 'expert' or concen- trator of this kind of bias who will automatically feel insecure if any attempt is made to widen his horizons. The result will be opposition, distrust and confusion.
x3l9 | From time to time, certain cosmological and human factors being in alignment, there is both a need for and a possibility to re- establish, by means of a special and skilled effort, formulations and activities which maximise the prospects of more rapid and thorough penetration of the teaching which leads to the develop- ment referred to as "knowing oneself or 'having wisdom'. Several such periods, cyclic in character, have occurred in recent times: none of them has been generally recognised for what it is. This,
d2fj | again, is not to say that because one believes this one is auto- matically able to find it. The correct approach is everything.
geyi | ROLE OF AN INTERVENTION
2181 | The first stage of this knowledge concerns answers to the questions generally phrased as involving the origin, nature, being and future of mankind itself, collectively as well as in the individual. The manner and order of procedure of approaching these questions themselves involves a capacity whose absence or ineffectiveness in the ordinary individual spells his incapacity to participate in his own development. He is in need of an organising intervention to break the vicious circle which results.
9ubl | KNOWLEDGE OF THE END CREATES THE MEANS
o8pj | The desire for an 'awakening', often used as a technical term, may or may not be accompanied by the information and ex- perience essential to precede this stage. The Teaching, for its part, is carried out-and is able to cross ideological boundaries-be- cause of a knowledge of the objective: an objective which is at worst postulated as an assumption that it exists; at best glimpsed: and thenceforward is the subject of repeated attempts to devise a means to recover this glimpse.
27b9 | The working hypothesis or traditional framework provides the structure by which the would-be illuminate attempts to approach this goal. In the case of the School, knowledge alone provides the basis upon which the structure can be devised.
09xa | 'Once you know the end, you can devise the means.' The end does not justify the means - it provides it The means, employed in this sense, is the structure referred to in some literature as 'The Work *.
yi97 | THE SCHOOL
4zj7 | One of the structures within which this knowledge is studied, collected, conserved and transmitted has often been termed a School. There are others, continuously at work, whose existence
3wgh | 73
uvo3 | and mode of operation is not of applied value, though frequently a matter of curiosity and inquisitiveness, occupying much time and giving rise to much effort, due to the faultily-based assump- tion that a lively interest in something once heard about may lead to familiarity with it, and hence usefulness to be gained from it. Since, however, its modus operandi is far from having an exactly operable analogy in current thought, it is in fact, if not in theory, 'completely concealed'.
yjbv | It is extremely common for encounters to take place between people who are interested in this area, and those working in it, without the former being in any way able to enter into it-or, most frequently, for them to have any conception or recognition of the role or method of operation of the other individuals.
l6it | The 'School Work' is a lower-level activity which nonetheless has to be passed through before a recognition of the higher level is possible. Acceptance of this principle is among the first require- ments leading to the necessary effective time-scale and order of events in which the Teaching may take effect. One of the chief barriers to accepting this fact-even as a working hypothesis- is the over-valuation of the role, potentiality and knowledge of the learner.
h8x1 | It is for this reason that such stress is placed, in so many traditional systems of which viable fragments subsist, upon the need for what is approximately rendered in familiar parlance as humility. Its distortion is self-abasement.
6qtq | WHAT HUMILITY IS NOT FOR
wm3n | As one of the great Sufis said: 'My humility is not there to impress you - it is there for its own reason.'
1anr | The person that you feel yourself to be, according to the Sufis, is a false person, which has no true reality. When humility is exercised, people begin to realise that they do not, as it were, exist at all. This perception of oneself as 'Adam (not-being) is stressed in Hujwiri's Revelation, in the second chapter dealing with the real meaning of poverty. When people take pride in their humility, they have merely adopted another concocted 'self as part of their not-being: and this is what produces hypocrites.
600w | 74
60w7 | The purpose of seeing through one's own nothingness is to see beyond into what is really there to which one's real self can relate. Humility is therefore directly concerned with the quest for Abso- lute Truth.
1a5g | NO VALUE IN MAKING A VIRTUE OF A FUNCTION
0oof | The coincidence of some similarity between the words 'Adam (not-being) and Aadam (man) has caused poets and others in Eastern languages to equate the two neatly in verse and prose. It is interesting to note, by the way, that even orientalists and re- viewers, discussing this point, sometimes observe so little of this play on words that they even charge Sufi writers with being ig- norant or adopting strange usages when they say such things as 'Man is 'adam'. I often feel that this uncharacteristic failure to register the contention is in such cases due to the fact that the subjectivity of the commentator is censoring his understanding: he is, after all, generally a man-as a man he does not want to think of himself as 'not-being'. This is all the more marked in people (who do of course include scholars) who actually identify themselves by means of the learnt patterns and information-stock which is, to the Sufi, part of the non-being, the personality and not the essence, of humankind.
p930 | In other words, as we all know, pride prevents humility. Pride is attached to a sense of oneself which may be wholly or partially created by secondary things like believing that one is learned.
xhc7 | It has truly been said that "Humility is not so much a virtue as a necessity, in order to learn.'
6a60 | RABIA AND THE DOOR
dfgj | The posture which is required in the Sufi was well illustrated by Rabia al-Adawiyya. She heard that Salih of Qazwin was teaching by the phrase: 'Knock at the Door and it will be opened to you.'
6ptp | Rabia said: * How long will you persist in saying this, O Salih - when that Door has never been shut?'
qjlj | The lack of humility is also something of a conspiracy: where
kva7 | 75
ssp0 | people not only ignore it when it is found in others, but cannot credit its reality. This is in addition to those who cannot even conceive how or when to exercise it.
108o | TALE OF THE PROFESSOR
d2za | Not long ago (pursuing the first remark) I was showing a visitor around the grounds of this house. As we passed a quiet and dili- gent man sitting on the ground mending a piece of wood, the visitor asked: "Who is that?'
r38m | I said: 'That is Professor So-and-So.'
qq0z | His brow creased into a frown, and he looked at him again. Then he looked at me. Now he said: 'Are you sure?'
rgva | And, pursuing the second remark, there is the incident involving Maaruf of Karkh.
mlcd | COLLECTING DATE STONES
2qe7 | Sari al-Saqati saw Maaruf picking up the stones of dates from the ground and asked him what he was doing.
lpzf | 'A child was crying,' he said, 'because, being a penniless orphan, he had no nuts like other children. So I am going to collect date-stones and sell them [to be ground into flour] so that he can have some nuts, and be happy.'

091m | How Serious is the Student?
sot6 | Q: I have heard you say that many of the people who imagine that they are serious about the study of Sufism are in fact not serious at all; and because of that cannot benefit from it. Can I have an example?
d6sf | A: One of the best examples is a matter of our daily experience. People read books or hear things about Sufism, and immediately proceed to 'beat a path to our door'. Now, at this juncture I have published sixteen books on Sufi ideas and action. One would infer, surely, that if I am publishing this material - and in such quan- tities and with such energy - that we regard its publication, and hence its study, as important.
7haq | But out of the average of 10,000 or so letters received each year, a significant proportion of all people are found to be 'serious* (as they claim) without bothering to read the material. If they were serious, they would give it serious attention. If, as they so often state, they don't want written materials, why do they apply to ME, since I am dealing partly in written materials? People come to see me, not having a sound grasp of what we are saying - because they have not studied our literature - and so I cannot help them.
ubwu | They come from all over the world, spending money and wast- ing time, but they won't spend money on books, won't give time to their study. Do you imagine that one can regard such people as 'serious'? Admittedly, they constitute only a minority of all our contacts, but the large total number of people contacting me means that this minority still adds up to a sizeable total number of in- dividuals. If you want to assess someone, look at what he does, and ignore his protestations of 'being serious' - at least for the moment. If he is acting seriously, you will be more inclined to accept his claim to be serious. If he is only saying it, no matter how strongly he may believe it, we can only conclude that he has little or no idea of what he is really doing, and hence I would
ucme | be the last person to be able to be of use to him, especially since he is first in need of elementary instruction in straight thinking.
qnl5 | KNOWLEDGE AS PERCEPTION
wdx9 | In these days, as in the past, what is generally called knowledge is a great Veil' to understanding. Gazur-i-Ilahi reminds his hearers that there is scholastic and observational learning. Inner knowledge - perception - is the real form of knowledge. The one is like knowing about honey by studying it, the other to know it by taste.
n1xr | One is knowing. The other is only knowing about knowing.
ohpj | What seems to be a lack of 'seriousness' is really better referred to by your second definition: that people cannot benefit The reason why is that they lack a desire to pay attention to what is said and done.
ry5f | CHEESE AND THE MOON
31wg | When we talk about the 'seriousness' of the student, we have to remember that many people have very little idea what serious study might mean. It often means, for them, compulsive study, whether there is any product or not. You may have noted that the British Association for the Advancement of Science (of which I admit to being a Life Member, by the way) held a meeting at which the discoveries announced included:
celk | That moon rock shares properties with Cheddar and Emmen- taler cheese; that in general fat people do not go to universities; that rats prefer listening to Mozart rather than Schoenberg. This wasn't in the Middle Ages, with angels dancing on pins, but in 1970 of the Christian Era ...
3mf9 | 78
z2rd | Social and Psychological Elements in Sufi Study
vqld | Q: Are you reducing metaphysical and spiritual studies to the level of sociology and psychology?
ljmz | A: No, I am, on the contrary, trying to show the contaminants and confusions from socializing and popular psychology in these studies. If people think that they are worshipping God when they are in reality seeking emotional excitement, this can hardly be to everyone's advantage. If the sensations aroused by transfer of emo- tions from one person, or one system, to another are thought to be 'special', when they are extensively described and illustrated as normal social actions and developments, what harm is there in affirming the truth?
en1l | Q: It is often said that it is better to leave people with their beliefs, rather than to disturb them.
45gx | A: If the belief is equivalent to believing that an appendix pain is the work of the devil, it is wrong to leave the patient with it, for he is likely to die.
xgur | THE MAN WHO FELL OFF A MOUNTAIN
iz66 | It may not be our role to do anything for him, but on the lower level, we can't be prevented from alluding to his state. People like this sometimes resemble the man who fell off a mountain. When he had reached half-way down, he said to himself: 'five thousand feet and nothing has happened yet - in fact it is quite pleasurable'.
dndq | We may have to leave such a man alone, but we can't help noting his real situation. Such people are often those who turn up and say: 'I am following the X Path, and I find it rewarding, but I would like to add a little of your wisdom ... '
xzce | 79
w4vd | WHAT RELIGION IS
cuh0 | The belief that something which is really, for instance, a selfish self-absorption in religious activity is anti-religion in effect. Sheikh Ibrahim Gazur-Ilahi truly says: 'That which takes you to God is religion/whatever stands between you and God is "the world" How many pious people realise that?
