You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

k0bw | 1. Introduction
aq5a | Geological and geochemical records of the Earth-Moon system seem to indicate a surge in the impact flux at ~3.9 billion years ago (Ga). Radiometric ages of multiple Apollo samples and lunar meteorites present a broad variation in ages with a peak at 3.9 Ga (e.g., Turner et al., 1973). Some studies interpret cratering ages of the large lunar basins as concentrated between ~4.0 Ga and 3.8 Ga
sc5y | ABSTRACT
0yab | The late heavy bombardment (LHB) hypothesis, wherein the terrestrial planets are thought to have suffered intense collisions ca. 3.9 billion years ago, is under debate. Coupled with new dynamical calculations, re-examination of geochronological data seem to support an earlier solar system instability and a smooth monotonic decline in impacts, as opposed to a "cataclysm." To better understand this collisional history, records from the asteroidal meteorites are required. Here, we report a uranium- lead (U-Pb) chronological dataset for eucrite meteorites thought to originate from the asteroid 4 Vesta; this dataset indicates to a continuous history of collisions prior to 4.15 Ga. Our <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> model ages of apatite <LATEX>\left[ C a _ { 5 } \left( P O _ { 4 } \right) _ { 3 } \left( F , C l , O H \right) \right.</LATEX> and merrillite <LATEX>\left[ C a _ { 9 } N a M g \left( P O _ { 4 } \right) _ { 7 } \right]</LATEX> from three brecciated basaltic eucrites-Juvinas <LATEX>\left( 4 1 5 0 . 3 \pm 1 1 . 6 \right.</LATEX> million years ago (Ma); merrillite only), Camel Donga (disturbed around 4570-4370 Ma), and Stannern <LATEX>\left( 4 1 4 3 . 0 \pm 1 2 . 5 \mathrm { M a } \right)</LATEX> Ma)-record multiple thermal metamorphic events during the period of ~4.4-4.15 Ga. We interpret this to mean that Vesta or the vestoid cluster underwent multiple impacts and moderate high-temperature reheating during this time. The ages of ~4.4-4.15 Ga are distinctly younger than the initial magmatic process on Vesta (>4.5 Ga) but are significantly older than a later "impact peak" based on some interpretations of 40Ar-39 Ar chronologies <LATEX>\left( \sim 3 . 9 - 3 . 5 \right.</LATEX> Ga). The intense collisions prior to 4.15 Ga on Vesta are at odds with the conventional LHB hypothesis but not inconsistent with the much earlier bombardment and monotonic decline scenario. Different radiometric chronologies of the asteroid likely represent the different stages of a continual collisional process. Conversely, the model 207 Pb*/206Pb* ages of apatite in the unbrecciated basaltic eucrite, Agoult, returned an age of <LATEX>4 5 2 4 . 8 \pm 9 . 6 M a .</LATEX> This may represent slow cooling from an earlier global reheating of the crust on Vesta at 4.55 Ga, as documented by other radiometric chronologies. The apatite in Juvinas recorded a coincident timing of 4516.9 ± 10.4 Ma, which could be due to either slow crustal cooling or impact. 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

w95z | (e.g., Stöffler and Ryder, 2001). The hate heavy bombardment (LHB) hypothesis arose from such findings. Orbital migrations of Jupiter and the other giant planets, triggered by a massive early cometary disk in the trans-Neptunian region, may have caused the intense impacts within the inner solar system (Nice model; Gomes et al., 2005). If such planetary migrations occurred at 3.9 Ga, results like those from the LHB model might be observed. Chronological data from various asteroidal meteorites, however, cast doubt on this interpretation (Mojzsis et al., 2019). The alternative early insta- bility scenario, where the earlier planetary migrations provoked inner solar system collisions that monotonically decreased over the
0i1k | next several hundreds of millions of years (Morbidelli et al., 2018; Clement et al., 2019), seems to better explain the present data. Re- cent geochronology-based re-examinations by Mojzsis et al. (2019) and Brasser et al. (2020) provide timing constraints showing that the terrestrial planets suffered the intense bombardments at or be- fore 4.48 Ga. Because most records on the terrestrial planets were overwritten by later internal and external processes, geochronolo- gies of asteroids are valuable hints for understanding the ancient collisional history.
