For instance, in Figure one, A is a component cause for both sufficient causes I and II, leading to correlation. If one sufficient cause is subject to natural selection, the force of selection extends to all component causes. Some of these component causes can be component causes also of sufficient causes for neutral traits, leading to selection of. In Figure one, selection on sufficient causes I and II leads to selection on component causes A E. Sufficient cause III is not selected for, it is in itself a neutral trait. Still, there is selection of sufficient cause III, because there exists selection on all its component causes B, C, E.\ny2qo | Example four. Trade-offs\n1piq | Correlated traits of particular interest are trade-offs. For instance, an organism could have to balance the risk of starvation against the risk of being eaten by a predator while foraging. The preferred choice under this trade-off obviously depends on the presence of food versus the presence of predators. To give an example at a molecular level, consider the case in which a higher metabolic rate leads to higher short-term survival, for instance by higher vigilance, but also leads to increased damage accumulation due to oxygen radicals. This trade-off depends on the presence of scavengers for\n7fqw | Causal Pies in Ecology and Evolution\nrhaz | oxygen radicals and on the vulnerability of the macromolecules to oxygen radicals.\nwak1 | A component cause has an effect only in the presence of its complementary set. This is true also for component causes that give rise to trade-offs. Therefore, trade-offs depend on the presence or absence of complementary sets. In the first example above, predators and food complementary component causes may be distributed probabilistically over the habitat or over time. As the causal pie model is also probabilistic, it fits the examples above well. The probability distribution of either outcome depends on the probability distributions of the complementary component causes, which determine the preferred behavior.\nwtfz | Trade-offs depend on the presence of complementary component causes. There is selection toward optimal outcomes given the complementary component causes that are present. Evolution will have the tendency to optimize within the limitations of the trade-off. For instance, in the molecular example in the first paragraph of this section, the trade-offs depend on the presence of scavengers for oxygen radicals and on the vulnerability of the macromolecules to oxygen radicals. Given the vulnerability of macromolecules to oxygen radicals, and given a certain concentration of scavengers, evolution will optimize metabolism. At the same time, there is selection on the complementary component causes. Evolution will have the tendency to push the boundaries of the trade-off, such that the trade-off becomes less restrictive. To stay with the example of oxidative damage, evolution will tend toward using less vulnerable macromolecules if possible, and toward increasing scavenging capacity, thus changing the trade-off that it faces.\nqy1i | Example five. The problem with age-specific genes\n1k9e | The evolutionary theory of aging is sometimes defined in terms of \"age-specific genes,\" genes that are active at a particular age or during a particular age range and not before or after. The idea is that natural selection acts less forcefully against detrimental genes the later they are expressed. However, age as such causes nothing and cannot activate or deactivate genes. At first sight, a way around this objection is to define a \"substance S,\" for senescence, deterioration with age, that is not in itself \"deleterious in any normal sense,\" in line with Williams's genes that \"act differently in a different somatic environment.\" Some independent somatic change would trigger the expression of deleterious genes at high ages, thus making them \"age-specific.\"\n5bjs | The causal pie model shows that it is not logically correct to say that substance S is not deleterious \"in any normal sense.\" The causal pie is made up of two component causes\nuodj | Causal Pies in Ecology and Evolution\nk16v | a certain concentration of substance S, and a substance S-sensitive gene which together form a sufficient cause for deterioration and death. Completing the causal pie, substance S is as causal to the detrimental effect as is the substance S-sensitive gene. Without substance S, there would be no senescence, just like without the substance S-sensitive gene, there would be no senescence. As a result, the force of natural selection on deterioration that results from the expression of the deleterious gene extends to both the gene and substance S. Theories about age-specific genes are in fact theories about state-specific genes and some state variable, in this case, the concentration of substance S. Both are part of the evolutionary analysis.\nb2lm | Partitioning of outcomes\nti7f | Generally speaking, partitions are useful only when they are based on qualities that are mutually exclusive. If this is not the case, something could belong to more than one partition. Because the whole point of partitioning is to divide things up, making partitions based on qualities that are not mutually exclusive should not be attempted, because it will fail.\noksu | In the causal pie model, multiple component causes need to interact for an outcome to occur. It is not useful to partition outcomes as caused by one versus the other component cause, as an outcome could be caused by both component causes at the same time. It can be useful, however, to make a partition between outcomes in which a particular component cause plays a role, versus outcomes in which it does not.\nwtow | Example. Extrinsic mortality\no22k | Although they acknowledge a role for vulnerability of an organism to extrinsic threats, Carnes et al. set out to partition mortality \"based on whether the primary cause of death does or does not originate from within the organism.\" Extrinsic mortality has been invoked at many points in evolution.\nnwfz | Mortality, however, is a prime example in biology of interacting component causes, some extrinsic, some intrinsic to the organism. Therefore, it is not possible to characterize mortality either extrinsic or intrinsic. A typical example is predation, where the presence of a predator component cause one interacts with a state of vulnerability of the prey component cause two and an environment that co-determines if prey and predator effectively meet, for instance a quality of vegetation component cause three. These three component causes could be partitioned in more detailed component causes if required, such as the cardiopulmonary capacity or fur color of predator and prey.\n```",
