        "content": "vkyq | Twenty. If you are lazy, count yourself lucky if someone points this out, giving you a chance to improve. Laziness is always your fault. It is the sign that a man has persevered in uselessness for too long.\nka4r | These points are in fact exercises in outwitting the false self, which thrives on smaller satisfactions. The Sufi aims at Tana (passing away-of the False Self) and Baga (remaining - of the Real). Behind the supposed 'I', which is impermanent, lies the real one, which is characterised by the awareness of truth, of reality.\nar1t | And listen to the words of Junaid of Baghdad, when he said: 'A good-natured sensualist is better than a bad-tempered so-called Sufi.'\nnopx | Things of the World\n93e7 | An Eastern Sage and the Newspapers\nko9u | LETTER TO A SAGE\nb56g | A WESTERN student of the spiritual wrote a fierce and reproving letter to a certain Eastern sage, when he saw his name in a newspaper. \"You should be completely unconcerned with the things of this world!' he said - and much else.\ni59k | When I visited the sage, I asked him what he had thought of the letter, as I wanted to report his reaction to the writer of it\nj690 | 'I do get letters, it is true,' he murmured, 'but I am afraid I do not read them, because, you see, they are things of this world, and I am not concerned with them.'\nfm81 | 'Things of this world' include, according to the Sufis, anything other than Truth.\nlspi | CONDUCT OF THE SUFIS\nxaoc | The conduct of Sufis does not necessarily show their degree of detachment. It more often shows what the observer imagines it to show. Shaikh Yahia Munir, in common with many authorities, states that the behaviour of the realised Sufis (the Auliyya) are not all the same in appearance. Some eat well and sleep; others fast and stay awake at night; some are clothed in rags, others in excellent clothes. Some accept gifts, others do not. Those who judge others by such appearances are called, by the Sufis, 'people of externals'.\n7383 | Such judgments are made by people whose emotional life has expanded at the expense of their humanity, their logical capacities and certainly their spiritual perceptions.\nwqqd | TAKING THE NAME OF GOD ...\nfjn8 | The dilemma of people who only use words, and not full understanding, for their religious conceptions, is well illustrated in this story - the one of the fruit - from Rumi's Fihi ma Fihi:\nhfnl | Someone took some fruit from a tree and ate it. The lord of the property said to him: 'Why do you do such an unlawful thing? Do you not fear God?'\npndl | The fruit-eater replied: \"Why should I? the tree is God's, and I am God's servant, eating from God's tree.'\njd7k | The owner said: * Wait, and I will give you your answer.'\nm8zb | He had the other man tied to the tree and beaten.\n3il6 | The man cried out: 'Do you not fear God that you do this to me?'\n5nx9 | The landlord said: 'Why should I fear? You are the servant of God, and this, this stick which is God's is being used to strike God's servant!'\npx96 | Just as intellectual and systematised religious argument fails when brought into a broader context, so do even wider religious concepts fail when compared with the extradimensional perception of Truth which the Sufis bring to human experience. That is the message of all the Sufi sages.\n3glu | Basis for Peoples Interest\nlpib | SOMEONE wants to know how it is that it is difficult to get to see me. He also wants to publicise my 'spiritual attainments'.\ny912 | I'll tell you, about both.\ni5sa | It is not either easy or difficult, it is more likely to be a matter of figures. Just as it would be with anyone.\nrvhq | Taking an eight-hour day and seven-day week, we find that in a year if one sees one person each hour; in daily session and doing nothing else, giving one-hour interviews, I could see just under three thousand people a year, and each one only once.\n8kyr | But something between three and ten times that number of people express a desire to 'see me'. And, if every year you saw each person only twice, you would only be able to see around one and a half thousand people.\n95fm | Although the subject is always supposed to be important, I note that the urgency drops off, mysteriously, on holidays and during Summer vacations ...\ni5qs | Mind you, if I were doing nothing else but seeing all comers for an hour a day, the procedure would carry the makings of its own solution. This is because I would become so boring, so worn out, so useless, that people would want to see me less and less, and so I would eventually retrieve my freedom.\n26wo | So, rather than have to go through this, why should I not carry on and remain at the position where I am anyway?\nwl61 | Especially since there are adequate supplies of other people who are delighted to be surrounded by troops and groups of people imbibing their wisdom from morning to night.\nzjvs | I have been criticised for saying this. It is said that such people always create dissatisfaction among the majority of their followers, who soon switch to the next guru. Exactly what I mean: if I were to behave in this way, I would also create dissatisfaction, when people had had enough of my ritual of sitting about being the great guru.\nifv4 | I have neither the inclination nor the training to enrol myself in the guru circuit.\n9uf2 | The foregoing, of course, looks upon the 'seeing people' activity as a socio-psychological activity, already adequately observed by sociologists but entirely ignored by the occult-minded: except when they confuse it with a 'spiritual activity', which it most certainly is not.\nneut | In my own experience, amply confirming that of the traditional Sufi authors, this clustering around will have to be justified by the clusterers as a 'spiritual activity'. The onus is on them to do so; or else to seek out their natural affinities: the seekers of adulation whose main other characteristic so often seems to be that they cannot bear to be alone for very long.\n1mfk | In my youth a teacher said to me: 'If collecting together were the way to greater enlightenment, grains of sand would all have become saints, flocks of birds would break up and each one would become a spiritual teacher, sheep would exercise the functions of the enlightened. Similarly, the characteristic which we see in the least enlightened to crowd around things and people deemed to be strange, valuable or exciting would not be gatherings of gapers but, rather, assemblies of the elect. . . '\ng6ns | SHEIKH ABU-ISHAQ'S FRIENDS\n3jab | As to 'spiritual attainments', I am reminded of the words which Sheikh Abu-Ishaq of the Green Island, near Algeciras in Spain, spoke to Ibn Arabi and reported in his twelfth-century Durrat al-Fakhira:\nozht | 'I regard people as of two types. First there is the friend who has a good opinion of me and speaks well of me. He is a friend. Then there is the person who speaks badly of me, who tells of my \"spiritual condition\".'\nwalw | Thinking in Terms of Supply-and-Demand\n243h | Q: If people interested in spiritual things are asking what are in fact 'commercial' questions, is that the fault of the people or of the systems? How does your range of questioners compare with those received by others working in the spiritual field?\nyup5 | A: This is several questions in one. First, people have been trained to think in crude supply-and-demand terms about almost everything. This is due to the culture and social outlook, so it is hard to call it the fault of the people or of the systems which they are approaching with questions.",
