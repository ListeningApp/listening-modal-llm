You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

82qc | ABSTRACT
ls7d | The late heavy bombardment (LHB) hypothesis, wherein the terrestrial planets are thought to have suffered intense collisions ca. 3.9 billion years ago, is under debate. Coupled with new dynamical calculations, re-examination of geochronological data seem to support an earlier solar system instability and a smooth monotonic decline in impacts, as opposed to a "cataclysm." To better understand this collisional history, records from the asteroidal meteorites are required. Here, we report a uranium- lead (U-Pb) chronological dataset for eucrite meteorites thought to originate from the asteroid 4 Vesta; this dataset indicates to a continuous history of collisions prior to 4.15 Ga. Our <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> model ages of apatite <LATEX>\left[ C a _ { 5 } \left( P O _ { 4 } \right) _ { 3 } \left( F , C l , O H \right) \right.</LATEX> and merrillite <LATEX>\left[ C a _ { 9 } N a M g \left( P O _ { 4 } \right) _ { 7 } \right]</LATEX> from three brecciated basaltic eucrites-Juvinas <LATEX>\left( 4 1 5 0 . 3 \pm 1 1 . 6 \right.</LATEX> million years ago (Ma); merrillite only), Camel Donga (disturbed around 4570-4370 Ma), and Stannern <LATEX>\left( 4 1 4 3 . 0 \pm 1 2 . 5 \mathrm { M a } \right)</LATEX> Ma)-record multiple thermal metamorphic events during the period of ~4.4-4.15 Ga. We interpret this to mean that Vesta or the vestoid cluster underwent multiple impacts and moderate high-temperature reheating during this time. The ages of ~4.4-4.15 Ga are distinctly younger than the initial magmatic process on Vesta (>4.5 Ga) but are significantly older than a later "impact peak" based on some interpretations of 40Ar-39 Ar chronologies <LATEX>\left( \sim 3 . 9 - 3 . 5 \right.</LATEX> Ga). The intense collisions prior to 4.15 Ga on Vesta are at odds with the conventional LHB hypothesis but not inconsistent with the much earlier bombardment and monotonic decline scenario. Different radiometric chronologies of the asteroid likely represent the different stages of a continual collisional process. Conversely, the model 207 Pb*/206Pb* ages of apatite in the unbrecciated basaltic eucrite, Agoult, returned an age of <LATEX>4 5 2 4 . 8 \pm 9 . 6 M a .</LATEX> This may represent slow cooling from an earlier global reheating of the crust on Vesta at 4.55 Ga, as documented by other radiometric chronologies. The apatite in Juvinas recorded a coincident timing of 4516.9 ± 10.4 Ma, which could be due to either slow crustal cooling or impact. 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

tzt3 | (e.g., Stöffler and Ryder, 2001). The hate heavy bombardment (LHB) hypothesis arose from such findings. Orbital migrations of Jupiter and the other giant planets, triggered by a massive early cometary disk in the trans-Neptunian region, may have caused the intense impacts within the inner solar system (Nice model; Gomes et al., 2005). If such planetary migrations occurred at 3.9 Ga, results like those from the LHB model might be observed. Chronological data from various asteroidal meteorites, however, cast doubt on this interpretation (Mojzsis et al., 2019). The alternative early insta- bility scenario, where the earlier planetary migrations provoked inner solar system collisions that monotonically decreased over the

qvnu | next several hundreds of millions of years (Morbidelli et al., 2018; Clement et al., 2019), seems to better explain the present data. Re- cent geochronology-based re-examinations by Mojzsis et al. (2019) and Brasser et al. (2020) provide timing constraints showing that the terrestrial planets suffered the intense bombardments at or be- fore 4.48 Ga. Because most records on the terrestrial planets were overwritten by later internal and external processes, geochronolo- gies of asteroids are valuable hints for understanding the ancient collisional history.
kggw | Asteroid 4 Vesta is one of the largest rocky bodies in the main asteroid belt. The genetic linkage between Vesta (and its spectral resemblances, V-type asteroids) and howardite-eucrite-diogenite (HED) meteorites has been advocated based on petrographic stud- ies of meteorites and telescopic observations of the asteroid since the 1960-1970s (McCord et al., 1970). Direct observations by the NASA Dawn Mission in 2012 further support the Vesta-HED rela- tionship (Russell et al., 2012; McSween et al., 2013). As members of the HED clan, eucrites are basaltic or gabbroic crustal rocks primarily composed of low-Ca pyroxene, plagioclase, and minor amounts of silica minerals, sulfides, oxides, Ca phosphates, and rare zircons (e.g., Palme et al., 1988; Takeda and Graham, 1991; Metzler et al., 1995; and Yamaguchi et al., 1996, 2009). Based on short-lived radiometric chronometers, previous studies have shown that the initial crystallization of basaltic eucrites occurred within a few million years after the formation of the solar system (e.g., Lugmair and Shukolyukov, 1998; Touboul et al., 2015; Hublet et al., 2017). Most of the basaltic eucrites experienced high-temperature (~900℃) annealing <LATEX>\left( H a b a \quad e t \quad a l . , 2 0 1 4 ; \right.</LATEX> lizuka et al., 2015; Liao and Hsu, 2017). The U-Pb and Hf-W ages of zircons in the basaltic eucrites vary from as old as ~4563-4565 million years ago (Ma) to 4530 Ma (Ireland and Bukovanská, 1992; Mis- awa et al., 2005; Srinivasan et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2013; Roszjar et al., 2016; Liao and Hsu, 2017; Liao et al., 2019), with a weighted mean U-Pb age of 4554 <LATEX>2 \quad M a</LATEX> (lizuka et al., 2015). The eucritic zircons are considered to have crystallized during the initial crust formation and/or the prolonged thermal processes on Vesta. An age of 4563 ± 15 Ma has also been reported <LATEX>i n \quad a \quad m e s o s i d e r i t e</LATEX> (Ireland and Wlotzka, 1992), another meteoriti- cal group that is expected to have a common origin with the HEDs (i.e., Vesta). After a suite of the early processes, most eucrites expe- rienced complicated geologic events including (multiple cycles of) impact brecciation, reheating, and partial remelting. The 40 Ar-39 Ar dating of various eucrites exhibits a large age variation from ~4.5 Ga to 3.5 Ga (review by Bogard, 2011). Recent re-assessments of the 40 Ar-39 Ar plateau ages indicate two groups: an earlier group <LATEX>w i t h \quad 4 0 A r - 3 9 \quad A r</LATEX> plateau ages <LATEX>a t \sim 4 . 5 0</LATEX> Ga and a later group with <LATEX>\mathrm { a g e s } \text { at } \sim 3 . 8 5</LATEX> Ga (Kennedy et al., 2013, 2019). The earlier group may be associated with a large impact on Vesta that resulted in the formation of an ancient basin (possibly Veneneia) (Kennedy et al., 2013, 2019). The timing of this basin-forming or related cat- aclysmic impact on Vesta has also been dated at 4.52-4.53 Ga by other chronological studies (Hopkins et al., 2015; Haba et al., 2019). The later Ar-plateau ages, conversely, are interpreted either as clustering impacts during ~3.85-3.47 Ga or as an "end-tail" of ancient continuous collisions (Kennedy et al., 2019).
xrd1 | The U-Pb chronology of Ca phosphates, such as apatite <LATEX>\left[ C a _ { 5 } \left( P O _ { 4 } \right) _ { 3 } \left( F , C l , O H \right) \right] ,</LATEX> is useful. Closure temperatures for radiomet- ric chronometers are known to be quite high for the U-Pb system in zircon, "moderately high" for the U-Pb in apatite, and con- siderably lower for the <LATEX>K - A r</LATEX> system in plagioclase (respectively ~900°C, <LATEX>\sim 4 5 0 ^ { \circ } C ,</LATEX> and ~300℃, assuming typical mineral sizes and slow cooling of 1-100°C/Myr; Cherniak and Watson, 2000; Cherniak et al., 1991; Cassata et al., 2009). Thus, the U-Pb sys- tem in apatite provides a record of "moderately high-temperature" events that were likely missed or overwritten in other radiometric systems. Another Ca phosphate, merrillite [CagNaMg(PO4)7 ], often
5746 | provides a similar U-Pb chronology, although its closure temper- ature remains to be experimentally determined. The U-Pb age of apatite in a brecciated basaltic eucrite, Béréba, was reported at 4.2 Ga (Zhou et al., 2011); this age was originally interpreted as the beginning of LHB on the asteroid. Liao and Hsu (2017) reported the similar U-Pb ages of 4.2-4.1 Ga from apatite and merrillite in a newly found eucritic impact-melt breccia, Northwest Africa (NWA) 8009. According to their mineralogical and geochemical study by Liao and Hsu (2017), NWA 8009 experienced an abnormally se- vere impact compared to other eucrites, with a peak pressure of ~50-60 GPa and a temperature of ~1160-1200°C. Conversely, the apatite U-Pb age of another unbrecciated eucrite, NWA 6594, recorded an earlier event at 4523 ± 2 Ma (Liao et al., 2019). Liao et al. (2019) attribute this age to a large cataclysmic impact on Vesta, as inferred from other chronologies (Kennedy et al., 2013, 2019; Hopkins et al., 2015; Haba et al., 2019). By extending this line of reasoning to multiple eucrites, the thermal and collisional history of Vesta can be determined and, by implication, that of the other asteroid belt bodies. Here, we present a new U-Pb dataset for several eucritic phosphates, which indicates that their parent bodies suffered complicated thermal/impact metamorphism at a very early stage.
