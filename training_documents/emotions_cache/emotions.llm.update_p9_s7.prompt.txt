You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

n1wo | Following the clip, subjects were presented with several pairs of statements about what the experimenter had said during the in- structions. The final pair of statements was "The experimenter that (a) we believe that people cannot feel happy and <LATEX>\begin{array}{} { \text { ent sal } } \\ { \text { sad at the } } \end{array}</LATEX> same time, or (b) we believe that people can feel happy and sad at the same time." We discarded the data from the two subjects who answered incorrectly, leaving 19 subjects in the bipolarity hypothesis-bittersweet clip condition.
5bq3 | To ensure that the question of mixed emotions would be com- parably salient for subjects in the no-hypothesis-control clip con- dition, the experimenter told these subjects that a peripheral aim of the study involved mixed emotions. The experimenter also indi- cated, however, that we were indifferent about the results:
ezla | Some evidence indicates that emotions can also affect language com- prehension, so we also need to keep track of how you're feeling during the film. We've also realized that the current study allows us to settle a debate that other psychologists have been having. Some researchers think that people can feel happy and sad at the same time; others think people cannot feel happy and sad at the same time. We really don't care one way or the other, but this study will allow us to find out.
rsbu | After the continuous ESG instructions, the experimenter said,
magd | As I mentioned a moment ago, some researchers think people can feel happy and sad at the same time, but others think that people cannot. We don't care either way, so we'll let the data decide. So if you ever feel both happy and sad at the same time during the movie, then move into the interior of the grid, the portion that indicates that you're feeling both happy and sad to some degree.
tb74 | These subjects then watched the control clip.
8l69 | Results and discussion. To assess whether the two groups reported different amounts of mixed emotions, we computed the minimum of each subject's happiness and sadness ratings during each moment of the clip. A Mann-Whitney test on the MIN data revealed that subjects in the bipolarity hypothesis-bittersweet clip condition reported more intense mixed emotions <LATEX>\left( M d n = 0 . 1 9 \right)</LATEX> than those in the no-hypothesis-control clip condition <LATEX>\left( M d n = \right.</LATEX> 0.06; <LATEX>U = 7 3 . 0 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>z = 2 . 6 4 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P S _ { e s t } = . 2 0 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. p = . 0 0 8 \right) .</LATEX> Thus, subjects who watched the bittersweet clip reported more intense mixed emotions even though we explicitly told them that we thought people could not feel happy and sad at the same time. In addition
1jyv | to providing additional evidence against the vacillation hypothesis, these results provide evidence against the notion that subjects in earlier studies reported mixed emotions only because they thought the researchers expected them to (Schimmack, 2005).
olce | Study 3: Lay Theories of Mixed Emotions
erx1 | Study 2 helped rule out the notion that prior evidence for mixed emotions is a result of subjects' beliefs about the experimenters' expectations, but no studies of mixed emotions have addressed the role of the expectations that subjects have before entering the laboratory. Most undergraduates think that people can feel happy and sad at the same time (J. T. Larsen & McGraw, 2000), but lay theories about emotion can be inaccurate (Robinson & Clore, 2002). For instance, most people think that women are more emotional than men, but experience sampling studies reveals little evidence for gender differences in emotional experience (Barrett, Robin, Pietromonaco, & Eyssell, 1998). In the case of mixed emotions, people's lay theories may lead them to think they are experiencing simultaneously mixed emotions even when they are not (E. Harmon-Jones, personal communication, April 2004). We investigated this possibility in Study 3 by conducting another test of the vacillation hypothesis and including a group of subjects who did not hold the lay theory that happiness and sadness can co- occur.
b3bt | Method. Two weeks before data collection began, 631 intro- ductory psychology students at Texas Tech University completed a mass survey. One questionnaire contained the question "Do you think people can feel happy and sad at the same time?" embedded among five similar questions (e.g., "Do you think dreams can provide insight into your unconscious mind?"). Subjects responded to each question by selecting "yes," "no," or "I don't know." Subjects who thought people could experience mixed emotions were classified as endorsers <LATEX>\left( n = 5 4 0 ; 8 6 \right) .</LATEX> Those who did not know <LATEX>\left( n = 6 5 ; \right.</LATEX> 10%) and who did not think so <LATEX>\left( n = 2 6 ; 4 \right)</LATEX> were classified as nonendorsers.
0w8m | A subset of endorsers and nonendorsers <LATEX>\left( n = 5 2 ; \right.</LATEX> 25 women; <LATEX>\left. 4 8 \right) w e r e</LATEX> invited to participate. Data from an additional endorser were removed because she did not know she could press both buttons.
vcu3 | The subject pool contained few nonendorsers, and we thought it unlikely that they would report mixed emotions after watching the control clip, so all nonendorsers <LATEX>\left( n = 2 8 \right)</LATEX> watched the bittersweet clip; all endorsers <LATEX>\left( n = 2 4 \right)</LATEX> watched the control clip. As in Study 2, this intentional confound provided a stronger test of mixed emotions. The procedure was otherwise identical to that of Study 1a, in which subjects completed the button press measures.
hjzj | Results and discussion. As in Study 1a, we quantified mixed emotions by measuring the total amount of time that subjects pressed both buttons after excluding those episodes that lasted less than 1 s. Though the median subject in both groups reported no mixed emotions, a Mann-Whitney test revealed that nonendorsers, all of whom watched the bittersweet clip, reported more mixed emotions <LATEX>\left( M _ { \mathrm { R a n k } } = 3 0 . 0 \right)</LATEX> than endorsers, all of whom watched the control clip <LATEX>\left( M _ { R a n k } = 2 2 . 6 \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>U = 2 4 1 . 5 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>z = 1 . 9 8 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P S _ { \text { est } } = . 3 6 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>p =</LATEX> .048).

The results do not imply that lay theories have no effect on self-reported emotions, but they do make it difficult to attribute available evidence for mixed emotions to the belief that people can experience mixed emotions.
