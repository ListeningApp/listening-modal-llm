Historically the Niche Concept was initiated and developed about one hundred years ago\nqrl1 | Grinnel: Geographical-spatial distributional unit of a species\nuvvk | Elton: Trophic-foraging positioning of a species in the ecosystems\nmdnj | Hutchinson: The first comprehensive n-dimensional hyper volume\nmwy0 | Begon-Krebs-Ricklefs: Further advancing of Hutchinson's Polechová and Storch: Duality - both position and role in ecosystems\nhg8q | Two. Species Niches are controlled by Dynamic Ecological Interactions:\nrcyg | Abiotic components: Climatic conditions, chemical-physical environment\nbj8l | Biotic components: Competitors, parasites, predators-prey, disease\ncygk | Summary of Lecture Three - The Basis of the Ecological Niche Concept\nrtk7 | Three. Three types defined within the Theory of the ecological Niche Concept:\n1wc3 | Eco or Biotic Potential: Absolute maximum potentiality - genotype determined\n333g | Fundamental: Actual uncontested, resource unlimited - phenotype determined\n6kja | Realized: Actual in the presence of other biotic interactors - resource limited\nfmi5 | Four. Three major Niche Dimensions: Trophic (food), Spatial (area), Temporal (time)\nbqn5 | Objectives of lecture Four - Theory and Concept of the Ecological Niche\n4lyq | One. An introduction to Niche Width - populations and individual morphs:\njzqz | What is the effect of phenotypic traits on niche width and shape?\n0uje | Two. An Overview of interspecies niche relationship and positioning:\napx3 | Included niches: Which are inferior and which are superior?\nkcrm | Abutting niches: How limited is competition such as in Contiguous Allopatry?\nmbsp | Overlapping niches: How much can niches overlap before exclusion results?\nzynb | Three. A Comparison of Niche Overlap and Competition:\n8h0u | Interspecific: The relationship between species density and niche width.\nb09f | Four. An Account of the rules for Niche Width, Overlap and Limiting Similarity:\nzutp | Diffuse Competition: Additive competitors may drive exclusion from Niche.\nqgmy | Niche Theory - Niche Width and Overlap (One)\n40wi | Natural populations have variability in both resource use and diversity of morphs\na418 | (b) Between Phenotype Component: morphological diversity of a population.\ne9lu | Niche width (W) equals Within Phenotype Component plus Between Phenotype Component\na278 | If Within Phenotype Component is high then the population consists of mono or oligo-morph generalists (a)\nffto | If Between Phenotype Component is high then the population consists of poly-morph specialists (b)\nak21 | (a) Intraspecific: Increased population density (Low to High) increases competition among individuals for limited resources (food and space), forcing individuals to search for and adapt to other opportunities equals increasing niche width.\ni7n1 | (b) Interspecific: Increased competition between species force these to reduce niche overlap or segregate niches by virtue of specialisation equals decreasing niche width (narrow niches allow more dense packing of species in communities).\nm9yn | Niche Theory - Niche Width and Overlap (Three)\ncg8u | Possible niche relationships of two species (Species One, Species Two and Species Three; one niche dimension):\n2hsv | (A) Included, (B) Overlapping, (C) Abutting, (D) Disjunct niches.\n7s7l | Niche Theory - Niche Width and Overlap (Four)\nuwdf | Realized Niche (G) equals\njjgp | G equals brackets (A plus B plus C plus D plus E plus F) divided by G close brackets\ndf4g | Diffuse competition of several species on a single species.\nqc2j | The fundamental niche of species G is greatly reduced by subtracting the overlapping fundamental niches of species A through F.\nx3oh | This illustrates how several species may squeeze out another species by this cumulative or diffuse competition.\nfqvx | No competition (disjunct): D divided by W greater than three, Invasion of adjacent species:\nviae | Objectives - Differential Niche overlap and Complementarity\np8u9 | One. An Introduction to the concept of niche overlap and interspecific competition:\n49ky | How does spatio-temporal variation on food availability affect trophic niche?\np5wo | Which mechanisms separate species to limit similarity and segregate niches?\n74rp | Two.

Food type and habitat - species showing overlap in habitat eat different foods, or vice versa\nqze0 | Two. Food type and time - species use the same food at different times or different foods at the same time\no3m2 | Three. Habitat and time - species uses the same habitat at different times or different habitats at the same time\nkro9 | Four. Habitat and habitat - species overlapping in horizontal habitat often differ in vertical habitat or vice versa\ni438 | Five. Food type and food type - species may eat similar-sized foods but different species or types, or vice versa\nyr7b | Differential Niche Overlap and Complementarity (Two)\n60hk | Seasonal (temporal) variation in habitat and dietary overlap among granivorous birds in an Arizonian grassland equals spatio-temporal dietary niche segregation:\n5djf | Rainy Season (food plenty): Birds specialize on a seed type across overlapping habitat types\nhem5 | Dry Season (food scarce): Birds specialize on separate habitats foraging on many seed types\nvfd9 | Differential Niche Overlap and Complementarity (Three)\njkgk | Differential Niche Overlap between Four hypothetical species (A, B, C, D)\n8nom | Horizontal niche dimension considered alone: Species C is apparently in trouble facing diffuse competition from both B and D - coexistence doubtful.\nvsjd | Vertical niche dimension considered alone: Species C subject to heavy niche overlap with A, and moderate overlap from B - coexistence doubtful.\ntucm | Both Niche dimensions considered simultaneously\nprly | Resulting Niche Space\n2epy | A, B, C versus D disjunct\nv55t | A versus B disjunct\n53fa | A and C abutting\nnnb3 | Only little overlap between species B and C\ns943 | Differential Niche Overlap and Complementarity (Four)\no7zd | Foraging Techniques of Five sympatric Bird Species in Oak Forest\n```",
