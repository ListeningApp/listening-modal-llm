You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

8hul | The coastal Pacific hake stock is characterised by low recruitment punc- tuated by very strong year classes (Figure 9.5), leading to highly variable estimates of catch at FMsy. The fishery is managed to sustain the stock through these fluctuations in recruitment. The 40-10% rule, which decreases allowable catch from the FMsy rule when the spawning stock is below 40% of modeled average unfished biomass (catch goes to zero at 10% of unfished biomass), providing a precautionary mechanism to curtail harvest when the stock is low, had been used in the PFMC process for many years before being written into the Treaty. The JMC determines TAC by considering current stock status, uncertainties in the data and model projections and the potential effect on future stock status, while limited by the F40% default harvest rate and the 40-10% rule. The coast-wide fishery, on average, has attained 85% of the TAC in the most recent years (2008-2012), mostly due to unused tribal allocation and bycatch restrictions.
87vz | A final challenge to the management of Pacific hake is the potential over- lap of the coastal stock and its fishery with other smaller stocks. An overlap is unlikely to be a major risk biologically for the large coastal stock (although it could contaminate the compositional data used for assessment) but could be biologically risky to the other, smaller stocks, depending on the fishing mortal- ity experienced by those stocks.

The U.S. fishery observers began monitoring Pacific hake catch on foreign vessels in 1977, more than two decades before most other U.S. west coast fisheries carried observers. Domestic catcher-processors and at-sea processing vessels (motherships) vol- untarily began carrying observers in 1991, in what was essentially an outgrowth of the observing conducted on many of these same vessels in the Alaska walleye pollock fishery. From 2004 to 2010, vessels delivering Pacific hake to shore- side plants operated under an electronic monitoring program that required no at-sea discarding of catch, at-sea monitoring using cameras and catch mon- itors at the shoreside processing facilities to record catch and bycatch. Since 2011, comprehensive observer coverage in the U.S. Pacific hake fishery has been mandatory, with human observers onboard catcher-processors, mother- ships, catcher vessels delivering to motherships and catcher vessels delivering to shoreside plants; there are also port samplers that monitor the catch delivered to shoreside plants.
78r8 | Canada first deployed fishery observers on foreign vessels targeting Pacific hake in 1987. Since 1996, on-board observers have monitored and sampled the catch of all domestic groundfish vessels, and all landed catch from trawlers is subject to a dockside monitoring program. Currently, surveillance and mon- itoring measures include a combination of at-sea observers (10-100% cover- age) on vessels fishing for Pacific hake in Canadian waters (for headed-gutted freezer vessels, 100% at-sea observer coverage is required); electronic mon- itoring (e.g. deck cameras) and full retention of all fish brought on board; and 100% dockside (offload) monitoring. This monitoring program is sup- plemented by coast-wide surveillance via over-flights by fishery enforcement officers and patrol vessels (Devitt, 2009).
320g | 9.5.2 Fishery-independent surveys
tp8g | The adult stock of coastal Pacific hake has been surveyed acoustically starting in (for more details cf. review by Ressler et al., 2007), although earlier surveys covered only part of the coastal stock's range. The stock was surveyed on a triennial basis from 1977 through 2001 with a switch to a biennial schedule from 2003 to 2011. A supplemental survey was conducted in 2012, followed by the regular biennial survey in 2013. Surveys between 1977 and 1992 were con- ducted entirely by the NOAA's Alaska Fisheries Science Center. In 1995, the operation became a joint United States-Canada survey with the addition of the DFO Canada, Pacific Biological Station, and in 2003, NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center took over the U.S. portion of the survey.
gxfd | The acoustic survey is conducted in the summer months, from mid-June through early September, typically moving south to north from Monterey, California, to Dixon Entrance, Alaska, using a design that covers waters from about 50 to 1500 m deep along parallel transects at 10-nm spacing. The parallel transect design was developed when computing power and

jkp9 | analytical techniques designed to minimise or remove spatial and/or temporal autocorrelation in data were limited. Recent surveys have used geostatistical analysis techniques (i.e. kriging) to compute biomass and variance, and as a result, zigzag transects or other less-regular transect designs could be used in the future. In some years, the survey has had to extend farther south or north in response to observed hake aggregations to cover the entire extent of the stock. The survey was expanded in the 1990s to include northern and offshore areas of the hake distribution that had not been included in the original survey design (Dorn et al., 1993; Dorn, 1996), and a set of expansion factors were calculated in an attempt to calibrate the early survey data years so that they would be to be roughly comparable to the updated survey design. However, this proved an unresolvable task given the natural variation in northern migration between years.
z8tt | The survey relies on 38 kHz as the primary acoustic frequency to estimate Pacific hake biomass, although additional frequencies as available on the U.S. and Canadian survey vessels are also used to help distinguish hake from other acoustic targets. Acoustic backscatter attributed to Pacific hake is scaled to biomass or abundance using a length-based model of target strength (TS), the log-transformed acoustic backscatter expected from a single fish or unit biomass. In 1995, this model was changed from a weight-based TS of -35 dB/kg to a TS-length relation of <LATEX>T S = 2 0 \log L - 6 8</LATEX> (Traynor, 1996), where <LATEX>L</LATEX> is fork length in centimetres. Variability in Pacific hake TS has continued to be an active area of research (e.g. Henderson and Horne, 2007); data from the most recent field measurements (Fleischer et al., unpub- lished data) were generally consistent with mean and variation indicated in Traynor (1996).
