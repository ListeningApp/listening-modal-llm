You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

oq7c | Do not try to "project" your thought in any mysterious or occult way, with the idea of having it go out and do things for you. That is wasted effort and will weaken your power to think with sanity.
z4mi | The action of thought in getting rich is fully explained in the preceding chapters: Your faith and purpose positively impress your vision upon formless substance, which has the same desire for more life that you have, and this vision, received from you, sets all the creative forces at work in and through their regular channels of action, but directed toward you.
hkft | It is not your part to guide or supervise the creative process. All you have to do with that is to retain your vision, stick to your purpose, and maintain your faith and gratitude.
jai3 | But you must act in a certain way, so that you can appropriate what is yours when it comes to you and so that you can meet the things you have in your picture and put them in their proper places as they arrive.
p57i | You can really see the truth of this. When things reach you, they will be in the hands of others, who will ask an equivalent for them. And you can only get what is yours by giving the other person what is rightfully his.

i9k5 | The Science of Getting Rich
20z2 | Your pocketbook is not going to be transformed into a Fortunata's purse, which shall be always full of money without effort on your part.
4cgs | This is the crucial point in the science of getting rich - right here, where thought and personal action must be combined. There are very many people who, consciously or unconsciously, set the creative forces in action by the strength and persistence of their desires, but who remain poor because they do not provide for the reception of the thing they want when it comes.
htre | By thought, the thing you want is brought to you. By action, you receive it.
da3c | Whatever your action is to be, it is evident that you must act NOW. You cannot act in the past, and it is essential to the clearness of your mental vision that you dismiss the past from your mind. You cannot act in the future, for the future is not here yet. And you cannot tell how you will want to act in any future contingency until that contingency has arrived.
890q | Because you are not in the right business or the right environment now, do not think that you must postpone action until you get into the right business or environment. And do not spend time in the present taking thought as to the best course in possible future emergencies; have faith in your ability to meet any emergency when it arrives.
jomo | If you act in the present with your mind on the future, your present action will be with a divided mind, and will not be effective.
06fi | Put your whole mind into present action.
hb4s | Do not give your creative impulse to original substance, and then sit down and wait for results. If you do, you will never get them. Act now. There is never any time but now, and there never will be any time but now. If you are ever to begin to make ready for the reception of what you want, you must begin NOW.
cqq2 | And your action, whatever it is, must most likely be in your present business or employment, and must be upon the persons and things in your present environment.
1ews | You cannot act where you are not, you cannot act where you have been, and you cannot act where you are going to be. You can act only where you are.
afyn | Do not bother as to whether yesterday's work was well done or ill done; do today's work well. Do not try to do tomorrow's work now; there will be plenty of time to do that when you get to it.
8sye | Do not try, by occult or mystical means, to act on people or things that are out of your reach.
r04h | Do not wait for a change of environment, before you act; get a change of environment by action.
orpr | You can so act upon the environment in which you are now, as to cause yourself to be transferred to a better environment.
k36m | Hold with faith and purpose the vision of yourself in the better environment, but act upon your present environment with all your heart, and with all your strength, and with all your mind.
wnuz | Do not spend any time in day dreaming or castle building; hold to the one vision of what you want, and act NOW.
sy14 | Do not cast about, seeking some new thing to do or some strange, unusual, or remarkable action to perform as a first step toward getting rich. It is probable that your actions, at least for some time to come, will be the same ones you have been performing for some time past, but you are to begin now to perform these actions in the certain way, which will surely make you rich.
ghss | If you are engaged in some business, and feel that it is not the right one for you, do not wait until you get into the right business before you begin to act.
3s61 | www.scienceofgettingrich.net
s3rm | CHAPTER II: Acting in The Certain Way
pqxb | Do not feel discouraged or sit down and lament because you are misplaced. No one is so misplaced that he cannot find the right place, and no one is so involved in the wrong business that he cannot get into the right business.
08qc | Hold the vision of yourself in the right business, with the purpose to get into it and the faith that you will get into it and are getting into it, but ACT in your present business. Use your present business as the means of getting a better one, and use your present environment as the means of getting into a better one. Your vision of the right business, if held with faith and purpose, will cause the supreme power to move the right business toward you. And your action, if performed in the certain way, will cause you to move toward the business.
hdj2 | If you are an employee or wage earner and feel that you must change places in order to get what you want, do not "project" your thought into space and rely upon it to get you another job. It will probably fail to do so.
a57g | Hold the vision of yourself in the job you want while you ACT with faith and purpose on the job you have, and you will certainly get the job you want.
g8m3 | Your vision and faith will set the creative force in motion to bring it toward you, and your action will cause the forces in your own environment to move you toward the place you want. In closing this chapter, we will add another statement to our syllabus:
a9av | There is a thinking stuff from which all things are made, and which, in its original state, permeates, penetrates, and fills the interspaces of the universe.
73l3 | A thought in this substance produces the thing that is imaged by the thought.
ornm | A person can form things in his thought, and, by impressing his thought upon formless substance, can cause the thing he thinks about to be created.
u2z1 | In order to do this, a person must pass from the competitive to the creative mind; he must form a clear mental picture of the things he wants, and hold this picture in his thoughts with the fixed PURPOSE to get what he wants, and the unwavering FAITH that he does get what he wants, closing his mind to all that may tend to shake his purpose, dim his vision, or quench his faith.
atmh | So that he may receive what he wants when it comes, a person must act NOW upon the people and things in his present environment.

xwsv | CHAPTER 12
756b | Efficient Action
6bx7 | YOU MUST USE YOUR THOUGHT AS DIRECTED in previous chapters and begin to do what you can do where you are, and you must do ALL that you can do where you are.
spl6 | You can advance only by being larger than your present place, and no one is larger than his present place who leaves undone any of the work pertaining to that place.
7wzm | The world is advanced only by those who more than fill their present places.
e9xj | If no one quite filled his present place, you can see that there must be a going backward in every- thing. Those who do not quite fill their present places are dead weight upon society, government, commerce, and industry. They must be carried along by others at a great expense. The progress of the world is slowed only by those who do not fill the places they are holding. They belong to a former age and their tendency is toward degeneration. No society could advance if everyone was smaller than his place; social evolution is guided by the law of physical and mental evolution.
9vl6 | In the animal world, evolution is caused by excess of life. When an organism has more life than can be expressed in the functions of its own plane, it develops the organs of a higher plane, and a new species is originated.
c2fd | There never would have been new species had there not been organisms which more than filled their places. The law is exactly the same for you: Your getting rich depends upon your applying this principle to your own affairs.
jzvp | Every day is either a successful day or a day of failure, and it is the successful days which get you what you want. If every day is a failure you can never get rich, while if every day is a success, you cannot fail to get rich.
f71y | If there is something that may be done today and you do not do it, you have failed insofar as that thing is concerned - and the consequences may be more disastrous than you imagine.
31e1 | You cannot foresee the results of even the most trivial act. You do not know the workings of all the forces that have been set moving in your behalf. Much may be depending on your doing some simple act, and it may be the very thing which is to open the door of opportunity to very great possibilities. You can never know all the combinations which supreme intelligence is making for you in the world of things and of human affairs. Your neglect or failure to do some small thing may cause a long delay in getting what you want.
40ry | Do, every day, ALL that can be done that day.
d1j2 | There is, however, a limitation or qualification of the above that you must take into account.
wstc | You are not to overwork, nor to rush blindly into your business in the effort to do the greatest possible number of things in the shortest possible time.
ba1e | You are not to try to do tomorrow's work today, nor to do a week's work in a day. It is really not the number of things you do, but the EFFICIENCY of each separate action that counts.

l3do | The Science of Getting Rich
u9bo | Every act is, in itself, either a success or a failure.
7avo | Every act is, in itself, either effective and efficient or ineffective and inefficient.
uzo6 | Every inefficient act is a failure, and if you spend your life in doing inefficient acts, your whole life will be a failure. The more things you do, the worse for you - if all your acts are inefficient ones.
89b4 | On the other hand, every efficient act is a success in itself, and if every act of your life is an efficient one, your whole life must be a success.
5f7e | The cause of failure is doing too many things in an inefficient manner and not doing enough things in an efficient manner.
h83u | You will see that it is a self-evident proposition that if you do not do any inefficient acts and if you do a sufficient number of efficient acts, you will become rich. If, now, it is possible for you to make each act an efficient one, you see again that the getting of riches is reduced to an exact science, like math- ematics.
kjoa | The matter turns, then, on the question of whether you can make each separate act a success in itself. And this you can certainly do. You can make each act a success, because ALL power is working with you, and ALL power cannot fail.
wb1c | Power is at your service, and to make each act efficient you have only to put power into it.
ak13 | Every action is either strong or weak, and when every action is strong, you are acting in the certain way which will make you rich.
s7el | Every act can be made strong and efficient by holding your vision while you are doing it and putting the whole power of your FAITH and PURPOSE into it.
0lfu | It is at this point that the people who separate mental power from personal action fail. They use the power of mind in one place and at one time, and they act in another way in another place and at another time. So their acts are not successful in themselves; too many of them are inefficient. But if ALL power goes into every act, no matter how commonplace, every act will be a success in itself. And since it is the nature of things that every success opens the way to other successes, your progress toward what you want and the progress of what you want toward you, will become increasingly rapid.
cnjl | Remember that successful action is cumulative in its results. Since the desire for more life is inher- ent in all things, when a person begins to move toward larger life, more things attach themselves to him, and the influence of his desire is multiplied.
rtdl | Do, every day, all that you can do that day, and do each act in an efficient manner.
norp | In saying that you must hold your vision while you are doing each act, however trivial or common- place, I do not mean to say that it is necessary at all times to see the vision distinctly to its smallest details. It should be the work of your leisure hours to use your imagination on the details of your vision and to contemplate them until they are firmly fixed upon memory. If you wish speedy results, spend practically all your spare time in this practice.
chx3 | By continuous contemplation you will get the picture of what you want - even to the smallest details - so firmly fixed upon your mind and so completely transferred to the mind of formless sub- stance, that in your working hours you need only to mentally refer to the picture to stimulate your faith and purpose and cause your best effort to be put forth.
sfcf | Contemplate your picture in your leisure hours until your consciousness is so full of it that you can grasp it instantly. You will become so enthused with its bright promises that the mere thought of it will call forth the strongest energies of your whole being.

umx0 | Let us again repeat our syllabus, and by slightly changing the closing statements bring it to the point we have now reached.
o306 | There is a thinking stuff from which all things are made, and which, in its original state, permeates, penetrates, and fills the interspaces of the universe.
qm1b | A thought in this substance produces the thing that is imaged by the thought.
n9ms | A person can form things in his thought, and, by impressing his thought upon formless substance, can cause the thing he thinks about to be created.
icdp | In order to do this, a person must pass from the competitive to the creative mind. He must form a clear mental picture of the things he wants, and must do - with faith and purpose - all that can be done each day, doing each separate thing in an efficient manner.

jr68 | Getting Into The Right Business
axix | SUCCESS, IN ANY PARTICULAR BUSINESS, depends for one thing upon your possessing, in a well-devel- oped state, the faculties required in that business.
05y4 | Without good musical faculty no one can succeed as a teacher of music. Without well-developed mechanical faculties no one can achieve great success in any of the mechanical trades. Without tact and the commercial faculties no one can succeed in mercantile pursuits. But to possess in a well-developed state the faculties required in your particular vocation does not insure getting rich. There are musicians who have remarkable talent, and who yet remain poor. There are blacksmiths, carpenters, and so on who have excellent mechanical ability, but who do not get rich. And there are merchants with good faculties for dealing with people who nevertheless fail.
