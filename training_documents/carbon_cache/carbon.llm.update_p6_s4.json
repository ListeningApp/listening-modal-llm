        "content": "b780 | With regard to the second approach, Bowles and Park reveal that income inequality increases working hours and consequently contributes to the growth of energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. Furthermore, the latter approach in this paper contributed to the explication of the theories on the impact of income inequality on production-based carbon dioxide emissions. In addition, it separated the effects of scale, composition, technique and globalization. Therefore, the abovementioned channels of EKC, by the means of which economic growth affects environmental quality, could be applied when analysing the relationship between inequality and carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, the inequality determined changes in working time could be attributed to the scale effect, when income inequality contributes to an increase in working hours and, analogically, to economic growth.\nccmb | Inequality, via contribution to economic growth, influences the growth of environmental pollution.\nma93 | Referring to the composition effect, Gassebner et al. declared that in developed countries the increasing level of inequality is related to the industrial decline, which in turn reduces pollution. Meanwhile, in poorer countries, the rising industrial sector leads to the reduction of environmental regulations, when richer segments of population are related to the growing industrial sector. Consequently, these arguments reveal that in both poor and rich countries, different links between income inequality and carbon dioxide pollution could be observed.\nc6hh | In terms of the technique effect, the reviewed authors revealed that a high level of inequality negatively affects the diffusion of environmental technologies and innovations. Thus, a high level of inequality can influence the reduction of technologies, which determines the increase of carbon emissions.\ny7ea | Inequality level also influences trade and foreign direct investment transfers. With the high level of inequality investors are not inclined to invest, and in such countries, it is hard to develop international trade. Therefore, inequality via the globalization effect can contribute to either reduction or growth of carbon dioxide pollution. It depends on whether trade and foreign direct investment enhance or reduce environmental impact.\nnav4 | The approaches to the influence of income inequality on consumption-based carbon dioxide emissions\ngem8 | The influence of income inequality on consumption-based carbon emissions can be explained referring to the following two approaches: (i) inequality determined changes in working time (which is also suitable in the case of production-based emissions and is related to \"Veblen effect\") and (ii) individual economic behaviours of households (or individual\ne8nr | With regard to the changes in working hours, authors have stated that people work more in order to copy the lifestyle of individuals who have higher status. Thus, at the same time, the increase in working time contributes to economic growth and to the consumption increase as well, influencing the growth of pollution. In consumer society, people usually work more in order to buy more and to consequently support the self-image. It is particularly typical in unequal countries due to \"Veblen effect\". Veblen hypothesized that people from different social classes are more inclined to compare their lifestyle with other individuals from a higher social class and to mimic their consumption style. Particularly, it is observed in more unequal societies. Consequently, due to the Veblen status, consumption or, put in other words, the consumption competition, wealthier or higher-income groups are more inclined to consume large amounts of goods and services and thus determine the environmental pollution.\nk78w | With regard to the individual consumption level, the MPE indicates that at various levels of income and inequality distribution, individuals' propensities to consume more polluting goods differ due to the change in the patterns of consumption level. Hence, Jorgenson et al. declared that consumption level was the key factor influencing the MPE. However, there is not a single hypothesis analysing the inequality influence on consumption-based carbon dioxide emissions. The main condition of the changes in income inequality affecting the consumption-based carbon emissions depends",
