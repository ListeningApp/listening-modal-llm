You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0i1k | <LATEX>J < 0 .</LATEX> Beyond a critical system diameter of <LATEX>L \approx 8 a ,</LATEX> we find val- <LATEX>\mathrm { l e s } \mathrm { o f } D</LATEX> and <LATEX>B</LATEX> for which the ground state of the Hamiltonian <LATEX>\widehat { H }</LATEX> hosts skyrmion-like spin textures confined in the interior (bulk) of the lattice, which we display in Fig. 2. We checked that these skyrmion wave functions correspond to approxi- mate eigenstates of the Hamiltonian by computing the energy variance <LATEX>\mathcal{E}</LATEX> and performed a linear extrapolation toward results without numerical errors (see Appendix A for a discussion).
dqlg | We compute the components of the spin magnetization, which are local expectation values <LATEX>m _ { r } = \langle \widehat { S } _ { r } \rangle .</LATEX> Since <LATEX>m _ { z , r }</LATEX> is parallel to the external field, we call this magnetization com- ponent the polarization. For <LATEX>B \approx J = - D / 2 ,</LATEX> the local spin profiles yield magnetization textures similar to those obtained for classical skyrmion configurations of the Néel <LATEX>\left. \mathrm { h e d g e h o g } \right)</LATEX> type: the central spin is polarized opposite to the applied magnetic field, and the spins wind radially from the center toward the periphery. In Fig. 2, we depict the polarization along the field <LATEX>\left( m _ { z , r } \right)</LATEX> using a color scale and the in-plane magnetization <LATEX>\left( m _ { \chi / y , r } \right)</LATEX> by arrows. More detailed radial and an- gular distributions of panel Fig. 2(e) are depicted in Fig. 3. In Fig. 4, we show that the average polarization <LATEX>\bar { m } _ { z } = \frac { 1 } { N } \sum _ { r } m _ { z , r } ,</LATEX> as a function of the external field, yields three disconnected regions uniquely associated with the three phases of Eq. (1).
p6pq | We estimate the size of an individual quantum skyrmion as the number of lattice sites over which the polarization changes its orientation once and the components orthogonal to the external field vanish. The radius can then be read out from Figs. 2 and 3 and results in <LATEX>r _ { 0 } \approx 3 a</LATEX> for <LATEX>J = - \quad 0 . 5 D</LATEX> and <LATEX>K =</LATEX> 0. These quantum skyrmion (SK) ground states occur not only for the fine-tuned parameters presented in Fig. 2 but in a wide range of intermediate values of the magnetic field. Furthermore, the emergence of individual skyrmions for small lattices is largely independent of the lattice geometry. While the effect of boundaries cannot be neglected for the small systems considered here, we verified that the size of an individual skyrmion is neither affected by the boundary conditions (see Fig. 2) nor the system diameter (see Fig. 8).
zse6 | As we show in Fig. 2, for small magnetic fields, the sys- tem's ground state is a helical spin spiral (HS) state. This is characterized by a degenerate ground state, in which each pos- sible ground state features oscillations of the magnetization along a symmetry axis of the lattice. The large ground-state degeneracy makes the spin spiral phase notoriously difficult to simulate for tensor network states. In contrast, for large mag- netic fields, the system reaches a ferromagnetic state, where all spins are polarized parallel to the external magnetic field. The bulk of the field-polarized ferromagnet is devoid of entan-
p2n3 | glement and can thus be most efficiently approximated by an MPS. For parameters that result in SK ground states, DMRG reliably converges within a few dozen sweeps and yields ex- cellent MPS approximations with maximum truncation error <LATEX>\Delta \rho \approx 1 0 ^ { - 6 } ,</LATEX> even for small bond dimensions
ohh7 | <LATEX>M = 3 2 \left[ 2 6 \right] .</LATEX> We want to stress that the fine-tuned regime <LATEX>J = - \quad 0 . 5 D</LATEX> is not necessary to enter the skyrmion lattice phase. By in- creasing the ferromagnetic exchange coupling <LATEX>t o \quad a \quad v a l u e \quad J =</LATEX> <LATEX>- 2 D ,</LATEX> we obtain qualitatively similar results, which we present in Fig. 4. Note, however, that the corresponding system diameter for <LATEX>J = - \quad 2 D</LATEX> is dramatically increased compared to <LATEX>J = - \quad 0 . 5 D .</LATEX> We attribute this to the fact that the skyrmion radius is determined by the ratio
vbni | IV. ENTANGLEMENT
dgcw | To probe whether the spins of a skyrmion are entangled, a genuine quantum feature of many-body systems, we compute the entanglement entropy of a suitable bipartition of the sys- tem. The latter is defined as <LATEX>S _ { \mathrm { v N } } = - \mathrm { t r } \left( \rho _ { A } \ln \rho _ { A } \right) ,</LATEX> which can be understood as the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix <LATEX>\rho _ { A } = \mathrm { t r } _ { B } \left( \rho _ { A B } \right) ,</LATEX> obtained by splitting the set of lattice sites <LATEX>N</LATEX> into two disjoint sets <LATEX>A</LATEX> and <LATEX>B ,</LATEX> and performing the partial trace over subsystem <LATEX>B .</LATEX> For our purposes, it is sufficient to fix <LATEX>A</LATEX> and <LATEX>B</LATEX> as two patches that are symmetric about the central site (see Appendix B). We denote the entropy associated with this symmetric center-site partition choice as <LATEX>S ,</LATEX> which is plotted in color in Fig. 4 and Fig. 9, panels (c) and (d).
