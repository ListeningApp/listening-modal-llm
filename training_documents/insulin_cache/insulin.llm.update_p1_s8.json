Introduction\n2gnm | Insulin is a peptidergic hormone mainly produced by the beta cells of the pancreas and was initially thought to regulate blood glucose concentrations only by binding to its receptor and promoting glucose uptake into cells in the periphery. However, when insulin receptors were identified in multiple brain areas, the essential role of central insulin signalling in the regulation of whole-body glucose metabolism was recognized. Amongst other regions, insulin receptors are highly expressed in the dopaminergic midbrain, which encodes reward-seeking behaviour, so that a further role of central insulin signalling - the regulation of reward-related behaviour - has\nemgw | ABSTRACT\nxaqt | Type two diabetes and major depressive disorder are the leading causes of disability worldwide and have a high comorbidity rate with fatal outcomes. Despite the long-established association between these conditions, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown.\n5rcb | Since the discovery of insulin receptors in the brain and the brain's reward system, evidence has accumulated indicating that insulin modulates dopaminergic signalling and reward behaviour. Here, we review the evidence from rodent and human studies, that insulin resistance directly alters central dopamine pathways, which may result in motivational deficits and depressive symptoms. Specifically, we first elaborate on the differential effects of insulin on dopamine signalling in the ventral tegmental area - the primary dopamine source region in the midbrain - and the striatum as well as its effects on behaviour. We then focus on the alterations induced by insulin deficiency and resistance. Finally, we review the impact of insulin resistance in dopamine pathways in promoting depressive symptoms and anhedonia on a molecular and epidemiological level and discuss its relevance for stratified treatment strategies.\n524j | been progressively unravelled in recent years. Due to the alterations observed in dopamine-encoded reward-related behaviour, it has been proposed that impaired dopamine signalling in conditions of central insulin resistance might be causally related to depressive and anxious symptoms. In recent years, a wave of fundamental rodent studies has revived the old debate regarding the comorbidity, and causality, of diabetes and depression, offering new opportunities to investigate underlying mechanisms and use them to improve treatment efficacy.\nxd3m | In this review, we explore the role of insulin in regulating dopamine signalling in the midbrain - with a focus on the projections from the ventral tegmental area (see two point one) to the ventral striatum (see two point two) - and consequently in reward-related behaviour encoded by the mesolimbic\n8qb6 | pathways (two point three and two point four). Further, we review how central insulin resistance affects dopamine signalling (three point one and three point two) and reward-seeking behaviour in rodents (three point three) as well as humans (three point four) and as an outlook discuss the clinical importance of impaired insulin signalling in depression and its therapeutical implications (three point five).\nwkbn | One point one. Encoding of reward-related behaviour in the dopamine midbrain\nftfg | The dopamine midbrain including the ventral tegmental area and the substantia nigra is the major source of dopamine neurons in the brain. Dopamine neurons are organized in subpopulations, which are heterogeneous in their anatomical location, projection site, electrophysiological properties, and function. While dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra (pars compacta) mainly project to the dorsal striatum (nigrostriatal pathway) and are involved in movement control, different subpopulations of dopamine neurons projecting from the ventral tegmental area to the prefrontal cortex (mesocortical pathway) and the ventral striatum (mesolimbic pathway), in particular the nucleus accumbens, encode multiple aspects of reward-seeking behaviour, such as reward-driven (reinforcement) learning and motivation to work for reward. Palatable food, sex, and social contact are considered as primary rewards that are strongly encoded in this system. According to the currently dominant theory of reward learning, reward-driven learning is guided by reward prediction errors, which reflect the discrepancy between an expected reward and the actual level of the obtained reward. These prediction errors function as learning signals and are encoded by dopamine cell spiking in the ventral tegmental area causing phasic dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in case of a bigger reward obtained than expected (positive prediction error) and by a decrease of dopamine spiking if a smaller than expected reward is gained (negative prediction error). As learning progresses, phasic dopamine release shifts from responding to the obtained rewards to responding to the perception of a learned cue predicting an upcoming reward. Both the cue and reward-associated dopamine signals are essential for consolidating learned associations so that inhibition of either cue- or reward-related\n7xi5 | the beta cells of the pancreas the AP two-bound inceptor mediates the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of insulin receptor and promotes its degradation. The inceptor has also been identified in the brain, but its role is still unclear. Created with BioRender dot com.\nw8r5 | dopamine signals impairs the expression of learned associative behaviour. The reward prediction error theory has currently been challenged by Jeong et al., who developed an algorithm for retrospective causal learning and found that mesolimbic dopamine release conveys retrospective causal associations but not prospective reward prediction error. While these theories diverge conceptually and propose different biological frameworks of dopamine action, they both consolidate the relevance of dopamine signals in association learning, which guides adaptive behaviour.\nybik | Additionally, dopamine not only encodes learning signals but also motivates action initiation to obtain a reward. As such, dopamine release ramps up when we approach a reward, reflecting reward expectancy. The amount of dopamine released during this phase is locally controlled in the nucleus accumbens without corresponding changes in ventral tegmental area dopamine cell spiking and provides information about the value of the anticipated reward, motivating the initiation of action to obtain it. In this constant feedback circle, the actions initiated upon the perception of a potential reward shape future reward behaviour, as nucleus accumbens dopamine release is attenuated unless a correct action to obtain the reward is initiated.\ngii5 | One point two.
