You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7um8 | Effect of Noble Gas Properties. Since the time when it was first discovered by Prudhomme and Guilmart,19 a number of papers were devoted to the studies of the noble gas properties on the yield of hydrogen peroxide and sonoluminescence. A principal conclusion has been made by Hickling39 and was confirmed by others researchers,20 that the major reason of the increase of SL and the yield of H2O2 is the decrease of thermal conductivity of a gas in the order of noble gases He > Ne > Ar > Kr > Xe. As a result of this, the temperature inside almost adiabatically collapsing cavitation bubble increases in the same order.
uow2 | The solubility of a gas can also have an influence on SL and on the yield of hydrogen peroxide. Actually, the increase of a gas solubility in the order from He to Xe is accompanied by the growth of the number of emitting light bubbles and, thus, by the increase of SL and the yield of H2O2.
iat7 | However, this cannot explain the changes in SL spectra and in the OH*/OH ratio in the order of noble gases. Following the scheme of eq 15, these changes can be the result of SL quenching as a consequence of different vapor/gas ratio inside the cavitation bubble filled by different noble gas. Actually, the increase of gas solubility from He to Xe promotes the process of a gas diffusion into the bubble as it expands, but the diffusivity of noble gases decreases in the same direction and seems to offset the growth of the bubble.39 Studying SL from a single nonlinearly pulsating cavitation bubble, the authors of ref 7b found the variation of the SL intensity with time. This can be due to the processes of the gas diffusion inside and outside the bubble. In a cavitation field the processes of rectified diffusion are complicated by the translational motion and coagulation of bubbles. Thus, the effects of a gas solubility on the vapor/gas ratio inside the cavitation bubble need more detailed experimental and theoretical examinations.
ywwr | The changes of thermal conductivity of gas can also change the vapor/gas ratio inside the bubble. In the stage of a bubble expansion the temperature of liquid-gas interface decreases because of the evaporation of water into the bubble. Thermal diffusivity of the gas contained inside the bubble corrects this deviation from the bulk solution temperature. So, the tempera- ture on the bubble wall adjacent to the gas phase and the vapor pressure inside the bubble will be higher in the case of the gas with higher thermal diffusivity; that is, it will grow in the order from Xe to He. However, the temperature drop on the bubble- liquid interface is small and becomes significant only at high enough temperatures48 of a bulk solution. Actually, thermal processes occur at the bubble growth in dynamics, when crispation appears on a bubble surface and the diffusion of a gas inside the bubble can influence the rate of evaporation. Thus,
0i6j | Didenko and Pugach
87cq | from this point of view we cannot make any definite conclusion about the vapor-gas ratio inside the bubble at the stage of its expansion.
0qs3 | Thermal conductivity of a gas plays a significant role in the vapor/gas ratio also at the time of the bubble collapse: the higher the thermal conductivity, the smaller the radius and the higher the pressure inside the bubble.49 Assume that the vapor pressure inside the bubble at the stage of its maximal size is equal for all noble gases, filling the bubble, then at the stage of the minimal bubble size the vapor pressure will increase in the order Xe < Kr < Ar < He-filled vapor-gas cavitation bubble.
z8f7 | Thus, the solubility and the thermal conductivity of noble gas can, in principle, influence the gas/vapor ratio inside the cavitation bubble. However, it is difficult to estimate the significance of these effects at this time.
7w7j | The results obtained in this work can be simply explained by assuming that the temperature inside cavitation bubbles increases in the order He < Ar < Kr < Xe following the decrease in thermal conductivity.39 Thus, the yields of SL and hydrogen peroxide also increase in the same order.
51vd | The temperature inside the He-containing bubble is not high enough to produce the large quantity of water molecules in the Č state, and the A and B states are generally formed. The dissociation of these states is accompanied basically by OH radical formation in a quiescent electronic state (reactions 2, 3a, and 3c). The number of water molecule in the B state is lower than in the A state so the ratio of OH*/OH is small, =0.26 (Table 1).
baj1 | The growth of temperature inside the bubble promotes the number of water molecules in B and Č states. As a result, the ratio of OH*/OH and the short-wave part of the spectra of A < 270 nm increase in the order He, Ar, Kr, Xe (Table 1 and Figure 1).
n1wo | Conclusions
5bq3 | Sonoluminescence originates from the thermal heating of the cavitation bubble content at the final stage of its compression. The unexpectedly high velocity of the SL decay cannot be explained by thermal losses.47 Besides that SL is over before the minimum size of a bubble is achieved, but following to thermal theory the temperature inside the bubble must be maximal at that moment. Thus, SL is not a blackbody radiation and is a form of luminescence. The concentration of excited particles inside the bubble is small, but the density of its content is high, so the processes of luminescence quenching can be very effective and they determine the SL (time) dependence.
ezla | The obtained experimental results can be easily explained by the decrease of thermal conductivity and, consequently, by the increase of temperature inside collapsing cavitation bubble in the order of noble gases from He to Xe. Correspondingly, the number of water molecules excited on higher electronic states also increases. Thus, the SL intensity, the yield of hydrogen peroxide, and the OH*/OH ratio increase in the same order.
rsbu | It is difficult to estimate quantitatively the processes inside the bubble as the temperature calculations at high amplitude of the bubble pulsations are complicated. In addition, the condi- tions inside the collapsing cavitation bubble are very peculiar to use directly the results from other fields of physics and chemistry. In this paper an attempt to describe the mechanism of SL was made, which could explain qualitatively the main points of the observed phenomena.
