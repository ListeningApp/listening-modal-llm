You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

tp8g | In German, the same result appeared when ERPs were recorded as listeners made decisions about correctly stressed versus mis-stressed words (Friedrich, 2002): KAnal instead of kaNAL produced a deviant electrophysiological response, while kaNU instead of KAnu did not.
gxfd | The suggestion from these cross-linguistic comparisons is that mis-stressing is more harmful in other stress languages than in English. In English, deviant stress sometimes seems to have no effect at all. Thus, Slowiaczek (1991) presented listeners with a sentence context and a stress pattern and asked them to judge a target word for acceptability; she found that the stress pattern information was often ignored, in that listeners responded "yes" to words which were semantic- ally acceptable in the context but did not have the target stress pattern.
s2v1 | A cross-splicing study by Fear, Cutler, and Butterfield (1995) suggested that listeners pay more attention to the distinction between full and reduced vowels than to stress distinctions among full syllables. Listeners in this study heard tokens of words such as audience, auditorium, audition, addition, in which the initial vowels had been exchanged between words; they rated cross-splicings among any of the first three of these as insignificantly different from the original, unspliced tokens. Lower ratings were received only by cross-splicings involving an exchange between the initial vowel of addition (which is reduced) and the initial vowel of any of the other three words. Especially the vowels in stressed syllables seem to be important to listeners. Bond (1981) compared the disruptive effects on word recognition of several types of segmental distortion; most disruptive was distortion of vowels in stressed syllables. The number of features involved in disruption of a stressed vowel is irrelevant; any replacement of such a vowel is harmful (Small & Squibb, 1989). Likewise, mispronunciations in stressed syllables inhibit phantom word recognitions resulting from the combination of dichotically presented input (Mattys & Samuel, 1997).
jkp9 | 11.4 Conclusion
z8tt | Unsurprisingly, given the distribution of psycholinguistic laboratories across the world, a majority of the research concerning the use of stress information in spoken-word recognition has been carried out in English. However, the role of lexical stress in word recognition may not be the same in English and in other free-stress languages. The evidence certainly suggests that stress cues play a role in the initial activation of lexical forms in those languages where it contributes significant information to word identification; Dutch, German, and Spanish all appear to be included in this category. English is less clearly a good member of the category; English listeners can use stress information in activation if given the opportunity, but the opportunity in fact arises less often in word discrimination in English than in the other languages studied. Furthermore, several experi- mental demonstrations of better use of English stress information by nonnative than by native speakers now exist. Thus the language in which most psycholin- guistic research (on any topic) is conducted unfortunately turns out to be rather unrepresentative in the role its word prosody plays in word recognition.
9g22 | Recommendations for future research are therefore obvious. More laboratory investigations of the role of stress in word recognition in other languages with
41fx | lexical stress are needed. The application of new techniques to study lexical processing on line is also recommended. But it is not only in spoken-word recog- nition that the predominance of research on English has skewed the picture of lexical stress perception. The fact that most early studies were carried out in a language with free stress, i.e., in which stress can fall at different positions in different words, also determined expectations in later research. Stress is certainly the same across all stress languages in that it always refers to a distinction be- tween those syllables which may express accentual prominence and those which may not; but its manifestations are different in free- versus fixed-stress languages. In English and similar languages, stressed syllables and unstressed syllables dif- fer acoustically, and much research effort focused on the perceptual consequences of this. But in fixed-stress languages, as Section 11.2 described, such intrinsic acoustic differences between stressed and unstressed syllables are not necessarily to be expected. There are at least as many fixed- as free-stress languages in the world (Goedemans, 2003). In fixed-stress languages, too, far more perceptual research is needed. In all cases, effects due to intrinsic characteristics of stressed versus unstressed syllables must be distinguished from effects which arise from differences in the applicability of intonational prominence.
