You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

epu7 | We typically start with random MPS initial states of bond dimensions up to <LATEX>M \leq 1 0 2 4 ,</LATEX> followed by sequential vari- ational optimizations ("sweeping") of two adjacent tensors (two-site DMRG). The two-site DMRG allows us to estimate the truncation error <LATEX>\Delta \rho = \sum _ { i = M + 1 } ^ { \infty } s _ { i } ^ { 2 } ,</LATEX> which we use in Fig. 10 to extrapolate toward results without numerical errors. To ensure that we display converged results only, we carefully monitor local spin expectation values and stop the simulation if changes in the observables become smaller than <LATEX>\delta = 1 0 ^ { - 1 0 } .</LATEX> Since we use DMRG in two spatial dimensions, convergence to a spin spiral state may require many sweeps, on the order of 100-1000. The quality of the approximate ground state with energy <LATEX>E \left( M \right) = \langle \psi \left( M \right) | \widehat { H } | \psi \left( \widetilde { M } \right) \rangle</LATEX> can be estimated by the energy variance
7od1 | <LATEX>\varepsilon \left( M \right) = \langle \psi \left( M \right) | \left( \widehat { H } - E \left( M \right) \right) ^ { 2 } | \psi \left( M \right) \rangle .</LATEX> (A2)
0bqy | By construction, <LATEX>\varepsilon = 0</LATEX> for exact eigenstates of the Hamilto- nian. Since MPS approximates the wave function with a finite bond dimension <LATEX>M ,</LATEX> we have <LATEX>\varepsilon \left( M \right) > 0</LATEX> and <LATEX>\lim _ { M \rightarrow \infty } \varepsilon \left( M \right) =</LATEX> 0 in general. Similarly, <LATEX>\lim _ { M \rightarrow \infty } E \left( M \right) = E _ { 0 }</LATEX> converges to the true eigenstate energy. To estimate the numerical error of our approximate wave functions, we perform linear extrapolations of the energy scaled against the truncation error [28] and the energy variance [43]. The outcomes of this extrapolation are presented in Fig. 10 and Table II. We want to stress that the MPS approximations corresponding to skyrmion and

(1) (spin spiral, skyrmion, field-polarized) obtained by two different <LATEX>2 \mathrm { D } \rightarrow 1 \mathrm { D }</LATEX> mapping strategies: zigzag (top row) vs. spiral (bottom row). The polarization is depicted by colors and arrows, and the von Neumann entropy is encoded by links in gray scale. Whereas the von Neumann entropy is rather small and homogeneously distributed for the zigzag order, it appears not only larger but also inhomogeneous for the spiral ordered 1D chain.

c6hh | field-polarized states easily reach convergence within a few dozen sweeps and follow the expected linear trend in the approximation errors <LATEX>\Delta \rho</LATEX> and <LATEX>\&</LATEX> [26].
y7ea | Changes in the local spin expectation values beyond <LATEX>M =</LATEX> 128 are invisible to the naked eye when displayed on the scales used in the main text such that a detailed error extrapolation is not needed. A word of caution is due in the case of helical spin spiral states: as we already explained in the main text, these states are difficult to simulate using MPS due to the large degeneracy of the ground-state manifold. This leads to some issues in reaching convergence (up to 1000 sweeps are needed) which for too small bond dimensions may even cause DMRG to get stuck in local energy minima corresponding to excited eigenstates. In the helical phase and for large lattices, MPS is thus not always reliably converging to approximations of the global ground state but converges under some circum- stances to low-lying excited states with less entanglement.
nav4 | APPENDIX B: MAPPING FROM 2D TO 1D
gem8 | Before we can apply DMRG to the system at hand, the 2D lattice must be mapped to a 1D chain. The map from a 2D lattice to a 1D chain can be performed by a sequential numbering of the lattice nodes with major ordering along an arbitrary axis (zigzag order). We choose the major axis to be <LATEX>a _ { 2 } .</LATEX> This can be achieved by <LATEX>f \left( r \left( n _ { 1 } , n _ { 2 } \right) \right) = n _ { 2 } + \sum _ { n < n _ { 1 } } l \left( n \right)</LATEX> where <LATEX>1 \left( n \right)</LATEX> is an auxiliary function that encodes the lattice open boundary conditions and
e8nr | <LATEX>r \left( n _ { 1 } , n _ { 2 } \right) = \sum _ { i } n _ { i } a _ { i } .</LATEX> As a result, the lattice Hamiltonian <LATEX>\stackrel { t } { \widehat { H } } = \sum _ { \langle r , r ^ { \prime } \rangle } \widehat { H } _ { r , r ^ { \prime } } +</LATEX> <LATEX>\sum _ { r } \widehat { H _ { r } }</LATEX> a chain Hamiltonian <LATEX>\widehat { H } =</LATEX> <LATEX>\begin{array}{} \sum _ { r } \widehat { H _ { r } } & \mathrm { m a p p e d } & \mathrm { I o } \\ \sum _ { \langle r , r ^ { \prime } \rangle } \widehat { H } _ { f \left( r \right) , f \left( r ^ { \prime } \right) } + \sum _ { r } \widehat { H } _ { f \left( r \right) } & \end{array} .</LATEX> To simplify the remaining discussion, we now assume square or rhomboid boundary conditions (see Fig. 12), and <LATEX>1 < n _ { i } < L _ { i } ,</LATEX> such that <LATEX>l \left( n \right) = L _ { 2 } .</LATEX> On-site contributions remain local, nearest-neighbor interactions along the major axis remain short ranged, but the interactions along the <LATEX>a _ { 1 }</LATEX> axis now have an extended range <LATEX>| f \left( r \right) - f \left( r \pm a _ { 1 } \right) | = L _ { 2 } .</LATEX> This results in a growth of the dimension of the Hamiltonian matrix product operator <LATEX>M _ { H } \propto L _ { 2 } .</LATEX> To obtain reasonable computation times for large

f682 | skyrmion lattice systems, one must therefore restrict the bond dimension M to significantly smaller values. For the largest quantum skyrmion lattice system we present in Fig. 8, we plot the converged results of M = 128. Note that the choice of our mapping preserves the locality of the interaction in one direction. In an attempt to remove this bias, we checked the resulting MPS quality for a different mapping, starting at the central spin-1/2 site and ordered radially outward (spiral ordering). Using the spiral ordering, we can confirm using the von Neumann entropy that the outer rim of the skyrmion is strongly entangled with its environment, a conclusion we had also reached based on the concurrence.
li1k | Compared to the other proposition, the spiral mapping results in higher variational energy, likely the result of the inhomogeneous entanglement distribution (see Fig. 11). Since entanglement can be created by nonlocal transformations, it is known that certain mappings from 2D to 1D are beneficial compared to others, which can be utilized to obtain a substan- tial improvement of the overall simulation quality [76]. For the results presented in the main text, we consistently use the zigzag order. The phase diagram presented in Fig. 9 is entirely unaffected by this choice.

To be sure that for small 61-spin flakes we obtain samples of a global minimum energy configuration, we performed the vari- ational optimization with 1000 different initial states where the azimuth and polar angles are sampled with a uniform distribution. The low energy results of the classical setup are obtained analogously to the quantum case: We analyze the lowest energy configurations as a response to a changing ex- ternal Zeeman field, for which we fix the norm of the classical spins to 1/2. We present a condensed version of the classical low energy results in Fig. 13.
wtfz | We find that the spectral energy and magnetization lines of the different configurations as a function of B/|D| are contin- uous over a wide range of parameters in the phase diagram. In particular, the spectral lines show crossings, which we identify with a phase transition: the first excited states become ground states and vice versa, causing the sudden jumps in the magnetization. This simple analysis suggests first-order Zeeman field induced phase transitions in this model, which are conjectured to be present in the quantum case as well.
