I really feel the people who inspired and came before us. I was thinking about our song \"Hashtag,\" which is at least partly about Guy Clark dying.\nkg3t | D.R.: I think about John Hartford, and what it was like when we spent time with him when we first got to town. Thinking, I just want to live up to these people, and their contributions, and how they were as human beings when they were around the age I am now.\nlvae | G.W.: There was a particular and beautiful kind of reciprocity to it, too. Let's take Guy, for instance, or Hartford. I felt this joy from them. We were almost like their musical children. They could see their music moving forward in us, and they were so happy. They were so relieved. They were so grateful!\no9sc | David, I remember reading an interview with you in Rolling Stone, where you were talking about how folk music picks up a little bit of the DNA of everybody who has ever performed it. And, because of that, playing those tunes, it feels\n121u | like there's a hundred people in the room-it makes a person feel less lonely. It's a pliable form, and you can always see the fingerprints.\nzh03 | G.W.: A pebble in the river that's just been rolled and tossed and turned.\n1mvw | D.R.: But also, because it's folk music, you're allowed to take a piece of slate and knock half of it out and go, \"Y'know, that rock's pretty nice as a triangle, too!\" If people like your triangle-\n6d4s | G.W.: They add! We've twisted every folk song that we sing.\nmqah | I wanted to come back to \"Hashtag\" for a moment. When I first saw the tracklist for \"Woodland,\" I was really surprised to see a song with that title. Somehow, the world of Gillian Welch and David Rawlings felt incompatible, to me, with the very idea of a hashtag. I love this line, though it's quite dark: \"You laughed and said the news would be bad / If I ever saw your name with a hashtag / Singers like you and I are only news when we die.\" That idea of reducing an entire life or an entire legacy to a hashtag. Brutal!\nxxr8 | G.W.: I remember feeling really jarred because, like us, Guy was just not one of those people who engaged with modern technology.\nrl4j | D.R.: He was so committed to word and craft.\nvz32 | G.W.: And so to get the news that way, and to know instantly, it was just, it was just, Oh... I gasped, and felt sick. And I knew. I remember how awful and darkly humorous that moment was. How strange.\nncb0 | D.R.: When I think about our relationship with art-getting a little older, having done this a little longer-I think about these gigs we did with him when we went to Texas for the first time. We were opening for him at a place called the Mucky Duck, a little club in Houston. We had played our set and we were watching Guy's set, and he got to the end of his show, left the stage, and got called back for\n8mp0 | an encore. Came back, did an encore. He had put on such a beautiful show, and he had such a beautiful self-possessed way about him. There was such gravity when Guy stood onstage. He played this song, and then he walked off again, and the crowd just wasn't havin' it. They were not going to leave. And I can't remember what he played-\"Let Him Roll\"? I don't remember what the last song was, but he just waved them off. He said, \"Go home!\"\nxjyk | G.W.: He just leaned out of the dressing room. He wouldn't even go back out. He kind of hung on the door trim, and leaned out: \"Go home!\"\nmt0f | D.R.: He knew his art better than they knew his art.\nawab | G.W.: He'd done it.\nixcc | D.R.: Yes. And he truly had.\n8p6h | G.W.: The show was done!\npmgl | D.R.: I learned something about understanding what you do, and also the value of not doing it. You're gonna do the best job you can, and when you have done it, stand firm. I thought, Wow, I don't know if I'll ever get to that place. We were young. It was long before our first record. It was the first we'd really seen of how musicians are on the road. I remember sitting in a Motel 6 in Guy's room. We had left the venue and we had taken this giant tinfoil pan of barbecue with us back to his room, and I just remember Guy and I standing there over the bed eating ribs and just laughing. I don't know what we were making, maybe a hundred dollars a night? Who knows. But he was willing to give of himself to us, to teach us. To tell us where the best pimento-cheese sandwich was.\n90no | G.W.: He'd tell us which exit between each town. He'd say, \"Now, when you're going between Houston and Dallas, you're gonna wanna stop here. If you're going between Dallas and Austin, you're gonna wanna stop here.\" This is way before cell phones and G.P.S. You needed this information! You've got a Rand McNally at\njt0y | that point. If we were in Texas, in kind of unknown territory, we would call Guy. I'd say, \"Guy, we're down around San Antonio and we need dinner.\" And he'd say, \"O.K.\" He'd think for a minute. \"All right, there's a barbecue place...\"\nqb7o | For each of you, do you have a clear sense of which version-performed or recorded-feels like the truest version of a song?\noae5 | G.W.: I'm really happy with some songs that we caught very early. Something like \"Elvis Presley Blues.\" We finished the song and recorded it the same night. Maybe we became more accomplished at performing it, but, in the recording, I hear that very short distance between the inspiration and the writing of it. I hear us still in our writers' brains. \"I Dream a Highway\"-same thing. The version on tape is the first time I sang it through. I can hear that in it. I'd never sung it stem to stern.\ns0fl | D.R.: When Gill is singing something for the very first time, there's more variation and melisma on even the simplest melodies. I want every bit of that. Because by the time she's sung it five times, they're gonna become more formalized. But the flip side of what you're saying is, sometimes being in front of people and feeling energy come back as you're singing something, you can take things to a place where they get emotionally re-amplified a little bit. Maybe it becomes a little bigger in a way that can be fun.\n43ia | G.W.: Some songs just are more suited to the quiet, interior space of the studio. Some are more suited to have their more perfect performance happen in public. \"Red Clay Halo,\" or something like that. We probably bested the studio recording any number of times.\n3g2y | D.R.: This makes me think of one time we played this song that ended up being called \"The Way It Will Be,\" but this was before it had a title. We were in a trailer at Bonnaroo for a radio thing. There were a couple of mikes and maybe twelve or fifteen people sitting in that trailer. We started it, and the guitars hit the note, and it just created a space in that room, and we sang our unison note, and it was just as\ngc7v | Performing for just a dozen people sounds terrifying.\nwqfv | D.R.: Especially when two of them are on their phones!\n```",
