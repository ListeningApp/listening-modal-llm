You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

jkmq | THOUGHTLESSNESS
i9dv | There is a parable about this, attributed to Jesus, but which does not appear in the approved gospels: though this does not make the analogy itself any less true. It is found in the putative Gospel of Thomas, which was found in Egypt in 1945.
59ph | In this story, reference is made to a, woman carrying a container
t5gu | of meal and walking a long distance. Unknown to her, the meal flows out behind her 'and she did not know how to work'. When she arrived at her house, she put down the container and found it to be empty. This parable refers to the 'Kingdom of the Father", and its applicability to our contention about the imperceptible loss of potentiality, through a form of thoughtlessness (called by the Sufis 'heedlessness') is very apposite to this subject
imx8 | SELLING HALF THE HOUSE
ac5x | About giving and getting, Nasrudin visited a house-agent one day: 'I want to sell one half of the house I live in' he said.
qicp | 'But Mulla, I know your house - you only own one-half of it'
54mw | That is exactly the point. I want to sell my half to buy the other half with the money I raise from the deal.'
ocir | The Giving of Charity
cc6v | Q: Have you any remarks to make on the giving of Charity among Sufis?
m8ic | A: One commanding principle of all Sufis, binding upon them, is secret charity. Charity takes many forms. As to monetary charity:
417c | If money is given with a sense of joy, that joy is 'payment' for the charity, and the good which comes to the giver is restricted to that emotion. Although this kind of giving is familiar to most people, it nevertheless remains the minor form of charity. The second part of the minor form of charity is to give in order that the person may help himself. Thus a person might buy a tool for a carpenter, so that he could earn his living. This may not be emo- tional, but could still be 'calculated' charity. Its limitations make it less than true charity.
575r | Money or valuables are given by Sufis, or those who desire to be counted among them, in accordance with the principle: 'Let your left hand not know what your right hand does.'
l3k3 | A Sufi will:
lg54 | Give before being asked; Give whatever he has, without counting it; Give when asked;
z6q4 | Give no emotional or calculated charity unless he can give true charity.
wbp4 | It is meritorious to give money to a Sufi for him to distribute it He will give it out, in large or small amounts, to those who are deserving; not necessarily in accordance with their outward need. A beggar or a poor man may get a thousand gold pieces, not just a copper coin.
24l6 | Charity does not always involve money, as you know. Charity is not only given, as you call it It is lived and performed, which means "being and doing.'
jgdb | As Saadi, the great dervish, says in his Gulistan:
3ypu | 'You who are unmoved by others' suffering are not entitled to the name of man'. Charity has been made into a great virtue only because of the low level of human decency.
p6xi | If you still think that charity is not a necessity but a high virtue, you do not even know what your contemporaries, in your own civilisation, have discovered, and which has been published in mass-circulation newspapers on the subject. Here is an example of the charity of animals:
nyuz | CHARITY OF THE RATS
jbh9 | Dr. J. T. Greene, of Georgia University* took ten white rats and trained them to obtain food pellets by pressing one of two levers in their cage. One lever produced fewer pellets and was hard to depress, and the rats soon found this out and ignored it, con- centrating on the other. Now the experimenter wired the levers so that when the one which yielded food was pressed, a rat in the next cage received an electric shock.
j6xs | What did the food-seeking rats do? First, they recognised that their actions were giving their neighbour pain; then no less than eight out of ten of them went over to the other lever, even though it was hard to work, and concentrated on it, saving their fellow from further harm.
euvy | The Number of Readings of a Book
gr44 | Q: I understand that the study of books is very important. Can you say something about how Sufis feel about reading, and the number of times a book is read?
unx6 | A: A Sufi book will have to be read in the ordinary way several times. If the mind of the reader is not correctly prepared, he will reject the book, read it selectively, or else indoctrinate himself with the contents. All these results are undesirable.
ztem | The above facts, however, account for the effects of literature upon the minds of various people. The human mind is an organ- ism in which what it absorbs will be to one man meat, another poison. This effect is inherent in the mind of the reader much more than in the book.
bw7k | And yet people persist in considering books, in their possible effect upon people, as always the same. This stupidity is one of the less attractive legacies of mechanical scholasticism, which, indeed, usually requires a standardised mind to approach each and every book.
swja | Many people are proud of how many times they have read a book. They point to well-thumbed copies as evidence of their diligence. In some circles, indeed, 'a tattered bible' is still taken as an evidence of piety.
fbei | And yet hardly anyone knows that the condition of the book, the treatment which it has received at the hands of the reader, will leave traces upon it, which will have an effect, just as will the typeset content, long after the impressions upon the book have been made. Borrowed books carry an imprint. Books which one has used too many times carry this imprint, this 'smell of infidelity' as it is called in Persian, from one reading to another.
y870 | It is for this reason that people are often asked to read many times several copies of the same book, even if it means buying new copies after each second reading. This is something which may not be well-known, but it is effective nevertheless. Today's refined
fkwk | barbarian could find in such a procedure only the suspicion that it is a device to sell him more copies of a book!
94g9 | It will be noticed from the foregoing material that our study methods are just as much concerned with matters of little-known fact as they are with psychological factors which people know but do not apply. This is why the curriculum of a School requires all- round attention to the needs of the teaching, the material taught, the students and the teacher.
9fvk | Rumi teaches of the use of books in a book (The Diwan of Shams-i-Tabriz) where he denounces books as a source of wisdom. They are, as in the case of the one which he is writing at that moment, instrumental:
rweo | The Man of God is a wise one by means of Truth:
zfci | The Man of God is no lawyer from a book ...
