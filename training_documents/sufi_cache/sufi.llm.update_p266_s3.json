        "content": "z5n9 | A: This is the easiest of all questions to answer. You could probably have seen that yourself if you had phrased it differently. For the benefit of those who cannot answer it:\n8a2y | The origin is in the observation of the initial austerities, etc., visibly practised by the devout. Because they have no information as to the purpose, stage of development or nature of procedure of such an individual, outward observers imagine that this must automatically represent the essential and invariable behaviour of the 'illuminate' (and his random spectators who are in a mimetic mood).\nd8cx | It is as if an unthinking person were to see the arm-waving of a railway signalman in training and extrapolate from that the belief that\nddro | *All railwaymen must at all times, or to become experts, wave their arms;\nv3lu | and\nogxy | *If the man at this level does this, the top man must do it, and perhaps if he does, twice as auspiciously.\n7i6d | Malobservation, facile assumptions, mechanical reproduction of activities based on incomplete data, in any area of human activity or learning spells failure, not success. If you doubt this, test it. Plenty of organisations bear these marks.\nw7sa | So, in order to correct basic mistakes we must be able to conceive that there might be mistakes. When this is done, further mistakes and useless procedures may be avoided.\ny91y | In place of becoming a consumer of emotional stimuli, while concurrently imagining that one is experiencing spirituality, the student must be prepared to attempt those things which are pre-\n53a1 | scribed for him. Both practice and test in the Sufi way are real ones. Those which centre upon appearance and fads are false ones. One such test, for those who have developed a taste for absurd- ities, is to adopt and maintain a normal life.\np032 | GOD WAS DEAD\n5ts2 | Among the Sufis there is a story, related by Attar, of a dervish who applied to enter a monastery wearing black. When he was asked by Ibn Khafif, who died about one thousand years ago, why he was in mourning, he answered that his 'God was dead'. The people there expelled him forty times before they absorbed the fact that his 'god' - that which he had worshipped - had been bis secondary self, the conditioned personality.\ngomt | Husain ibn Mansur, asked by someone 'Who is a Sufi?' answered: 'The one whose Essence is single'.\nni7z | Random Exercises\np68u | Q: Some groups of Sufis and others carry out frequent and regular exercises, 'dances', and all sorts of activities in which everyone takes part. Why do you say that one should not do the things which have brought others into high spiritual states?\nkxq9 | A: First, please note that there are always plenty of people who carry out automatic processes, and they are always glad to get others to join them. If you know of any, and you want to join them, you will be likely to do so. If you do, you can make your own test of whether this is the best way of going about things. In other words, why are you here if you can get these things elsewhere?\n6aag | Secondly, assuming that you are here because you want first to compare what we say with what other people say, I can only repeat that what suits one person at one time does not inevitably suit another.\nluhe | LANGUAGE OF BIRDS\nbhf8 | There is a story which preserves this by analogy. A worthy man once prayed that he might know the language of the birds. One day when he was sitting quietly under a certain tree with a birds' nest in it, he realised that he could follow the meaning of their chirruping. One bird was telling another that the king's son was ill, and that human beings were so stupid that nobody knew that by giving him lemon-water he would be saved. The man immediately went to the royal Court, where he found that the young prince was indeed ill, and his life was despaired of. He prescribed lemon-water, and the prince recovered. The king ordered that the 'doctor' be rewarded with as much gold as he wanted.\nue9y | Now this worthy man had a friend who was very unworthy indeed, and he confided to him the way in which he had become rich. So the unworthy man prayed that he might be able to\nu01l | understand the language of the birds, as he wanted to become rich like his friend. The faculty developed in him. Sitting under a tree, he heard the birds talking. They said: \"Under this tree is sitting an unworthy man, who wants our secrets. We shall let him have one of them. It is that at this very moment a ravenous tiger, whom we have called from the jungle to eat him up, is advancing upon him.'\n7fuj | As he stood up to run, the unworthy man was seized by the tiger and devoured.\n9j6k | Why should one not do the things which have brought others into high spiritual states, the questioner asks. If one were a machine, and if all people and situations were alike, if people were pieces of wood to be shaped: of course one should neglect all the manifold attendant circumstances and apply exercises randomly ...\nazkg | This question implies that everything is always the same. Reflection might well have told our questioner otherwise, if he had but turned the question around, so as to use his own thinking capacities. By turning the matter over in one's mind, the question might become:\ntkwl | 'Under what circumstances would it be true that random exercises should not be carried out, or mechanical imitation should be shunned?'\no4qt | One very good reason not to 'steal' exercises and apply them randomly (which means without insight and knowledge) is that this can have the same sort of effect, in its own sphere, as other, more familiar, forms of 'theft.' Sometimes this - as in the example I am now going to give you - carries its own penalty.\na0vw | Here is the parallel, and, humorous though it may be from one point of view (you should laugh at it and look for the additional dimension of instruction) it is a good equivalence of what can happen to people who adopt metaphysical things and then wonder what has happened to them: or why nothing has happened:\ny259 | WHAT HE STOLE\nxueh | A newspaper reports that a housebreaker stole a local councillor's cheque book and identification pass and used them in shops.\n9v46 | His intention was to get money and goods. What did he get?\nrqly | His defence lawyer explained in Court. In every single one of the nine shops which he visited, identifying himself as the councillor, he was assailed by complaints about the public services. 'At one stage, to get out of a shop, he even left his telephone number for a lady shop assistant to contact him about the transfer of a house.'\n73dx | He was found guilty of forgery and housebreaking: but the disparity between his expectation and the reality was due to the fact that he made assumptions about what would be likely to happen if he did certain things: and his ignorance was his undoing.\nnpd9 | If people know about the effects of these exercises, they do not need to ask such questions as we have here. If they do not, it cannot be explained to them better than through an allegory such as this, taken from real life.\nqn13 | I like the headline to the account. It is: 'The thief who stole another man's burden.'\nxpix | IF IN DOUBT, HAVE THEM OUT\nmye5 | Random exercises are more likely than not to have the effect which taking Mulla Nasrudin's advice would have had, in this example of his wisdom:\n50ll | 'Nasrudin, you are a man of experience,' said a philosopher; 'Have you heard of a cure for aching eyes? I read a lot, and mine are giving me trouble.'",
