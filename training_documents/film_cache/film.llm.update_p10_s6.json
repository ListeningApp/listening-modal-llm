        "content": "r8sm | Gendered film studies looks at the social purpose(s) of our stories and myths. Ideas and images of 'the masculine' or 'the feminine' are social constructions, and so we must attend to them as such, and ask who is creating these images. Whom do they benefit? Language is not a neutral medium of communication. Discourse/language is the medium through which social power relations between different groups are reinforced or re-negotiated. We need to ask what kind of world the film constructs and whose values and ideas are being expressed through it. Do the film's representations challenge or affirm our own experiences of the world? Do\ncuin | STUDYING FILMS\nn1i7 | they construct a world of appearances that does not reflect our experiences? What purpose do the film's representations serve? Whose interests are best served by it? The key here is to remember that films (and other media) do not merely record the world as it is. They construct an image of the world, a mediated version of the world.\n0r5m | Following theorists such as Sarah Gilligan, it should be fairly clear that women have historically functioned within mainstream cinema as the following:\nne2o | · Girlfriend.\nsqxn | · Damsel in distress.\n6pmo | · Angelic mother.\n195r | · Whore.\nkqmi | · Sexual object.\ng8rd | · Erotic distraction.\nnns9 | · Femme fatale/monster.\n9uwy | · Castrating mother.\nsrly | Looking at the list above, we see that the stereotypical role of the female in the traditional Hollywood film has not been that of an agent. She does not drive the narrative action, nor is she involved in changing the storyline. As Sarah Gilligan says, 'her role within the film is to look good and to make the male protagonist look even better. Women are rarely cast in positions of power, and when they are, they are punished for their power. . . Woman's traditional role is to be helpless, need rescuing or agree with the actions and decisions of the male protagonist'.\ndl6i | There should be a woman, but not much of one. A good horse is much more important.\n89ub | Feminist critics point out that these cinematic representations are mediated through the eyes and desires of the male director. The crucial point to remember is that woman exists as both a construction and a reality. 'Woman' is both a category, defined in opposition to men, and an individual physical person. We need only look around us at a few real women to understand that the image 'woman' does not always reflect the reality, and vice versa. Real individual women can, and do, perform 'womanhood' (as an image) but this image is not one that women have traditionally had a role in constructing. She is imitating an idealised and eroticised male construction of what women 'should' be. 'Woman' comes to represent not one person of the female sex, but a stereotype, a category defined by men and in\ndhle | STUDYING FEMINIST FILM THEORY\n2nib | opposition to men. Stereotyping is not always negative, but it tends to preserve and perpetuate power relations in society. It is in the interests of those in power to continue to stereotype those with lower status in a negative or expedient light, thus preserving the status quo.\nnaev | Even today, women have a relatively small role in constructing public images of 'womanhood'. A recent survey carried out by the UK Film Council and Skillset, the Sector Skills Council for the Audio Visual Industries, found that women in the British film industry are paid less than men even though they are better qualified. The survey found that women made up a third of the industry but thirty-five percent of women earn less than twenty-thousand pounds a year, compared with eighteen percent of men. At the same time, the number of men earning more than fifty-thousand pounds nearly doubles the female figure. Women in the film industry were more likely to be graduates than men (sixty percent compared with thirty-nine percent), and while seventeen percent of men have no qualifications, the same is true for just five percent of women. A June twenty fifteen report by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills showed that in twenty twelve only twenty-six percent of employees in the digital and creative industries were female, substantially lower than the national average of forty-seven percent, and down from thirty-three percent in two thousand two.\n7h0h | In her study of employment figures for behind-the-scenes women working on the top two hundred fifty domestic grossing films in two thousand four, Dr Martha M. Lauzen of San Diego State University found that twenty-one percent of the films employed no women directors, executive producers, producers, writers, cinematographers or editors. Yet not a single one of the top two hundred fifty domestic grossing films in two thousand four failed to employ a man in at least one of these roles. The study also found that women comprised only five percent of all directors working on the top two hundred fifty films of two thousand four. This represents a decline of six percentage points since two thousand when women accounted for eleven percent of all directors. Women accounted for only twelve percent of writers working on the top two hundred fifty films of two thousand four. In addition, female actors generally earn less than male actors.\na64c | The majority of directors in Hollywood are male and the majority of producers are male. This probably holds true in cinemas around the world. The movies that get the publicity budgets are made within male genres-blockbusters, war, science fiction or thrillers. These films seem to feature a central male character who is facing a male villain, and has a male best friend (who often gets killed by the villain in the penultimate reel, justifying the hero's killing of the villain). The female characters are there to titillate, to be in distress and rescued, and occasionally to guarantee the heterosexuality of the hero.\ngi7n | Lauzen's figures for twenty eleven were equally grim, with women comprising only eighteen percent of all directors, executive producers, producers, writers, cinematographers and editors working on the US top two hundred fifty domestic grossing films. This represents an increase of one percentage point from nineteen ninety-eight. Women accounted for five percent of directors, which is half as many as were directing films in nineteen ninety-eight. Ninety-four per cent of all the films\n3pn1 | STUDYING FILMS\nwjuz | in the study had no female directors. Of the one thousand two hundred top-grossing films from two thousand seven to two thousand eighteen, only four point three percent were directed by women, according to a study released by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.\n3yxv | In addition, female actors generally earn less than male actors for equivalent sized roles, with Angelina Jolie (the highest paid female actor) making thirty-three million dollars per film on average, roughly the same amount as the two lowest-ranked leading men Liam Neeson and Denzel Washington. Of the sixteen biggest paychecks earned by actors per film in twenty thirteen, not a single one was earned by a female actor. In twenty fifteen a hack of Sony Pictures emails revealed that Jennifer Lawrence was paid only seven percent of the profits of American Hustle's, whereas both of her male co-stars (Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper) were paid nine percent, as was director David O. Russell.\nd8zj | Like other ideological constructions, representations of a society or of gender are not stable; their political and cultural importance are such that they are sites of considerable competition. As Graeme Turner has noted, 'To gain control of the representational agenda for the nation is to gain considerable power over individuals' view of themselves and each other'.",
