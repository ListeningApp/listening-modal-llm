        "content": "6d4s | Regarding alternative numerical schemes, we have verified that our MPS results agree quantitatively with all available results from exact diagonalization. We have also compared our results to variational methods based on neural-network quantum states. However, we found significant deviations between the exact result and neural-network states even for small system sizes, and the error was already on the order of ten percent for the energy eigenvalues. This suggests that neural-network states may not provide an efficient variational ansatz for mesoscopic spin systems with DMI. We expect that quantum Monte-Carlo simulations might be useful to go to larger system sizes. However, the inclusion of DMI together with an external magnetic field brings about a sign problem that hinders convergence. Other promising tensor network states for two D spin systems with DMI are variational tree\nmqah | tensor network states and projected entangled pair states (PEPS). We expect finite PEPS to outperform MPS for larger spin-one half systems hosting skyrmion lattices, especially since recently a more efficient gradient-based optimization has been developed based on automatic differentiation techniques.\nxxr8 | APPENDIX A: MATRIX PRODUCT STATES\nrl4j | Tensor networks provide an important numerical toolbox in computational physics and have been applied successfully to countless interacting and strongly correlated systems. One of the most established algorithms, called DMRG, is understood as a sequential variational optimization of adjacent MPS tensors until convergence is reached. Our DMRG simulations are mainly based on the Julia package ITensors, and we made available a condensed version, reproducing Fig. two (e), on GitHub. Additionally, we cross-checked ITensor with TeNPy simulations, and upload the condensed version for the TeNPy framework alongside the julia implementation.\nvz32 | A generic state consisting of N spin-one half sites reads\nncb0 | W\n8mp0 | I T A (in) ) li one, i two, ... , I N) , (A one)\nxjyk | One four) =\nmt0f | where {li k)} forms a canonical basis of the Hilbert space at site k out of N sites in total. For a finite system with Dirichlet boundary conditions, the objects A(in) are matrices, except for the two boundary vectors A(one) and A N) N, such that the result of the product is a scalar. The dimension of the matrices M equals maxn dim (A(in)) is called the bond dimension. If M is fixed to an arbitrary integer, then the MPS representation of quantum states can be used as a variational ansatz to approximate the minimum energy eigenstate. The quality of this approximation is controlled by M. This is particularly transparent in the so-called Schmidt decomposition |$) equals Li minus one Si IVA,i) IVB,i) in which A and B denotes an arbitrary bipartition of the system and |Va,i) E Ha forms a complete basis in the Hilbert space of the part and {A, B}. The Schmidt values si are the roots of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix, and therefore related to the von Neumann entanglement entropy S equals minus X4 minus one |si squared ln(|si squared). Consider a truncation M is less than M, then states with a small weight in the reduced density matrix are neglected, and the overlap between the original state with bond dimension M is reduced.\nawab | Similarly to quantum states having an MPS representation, quantum operators have a matrix product operator (MPO) representation. Let ME be the bond dimension of the Hamiltonian MPO, then the standard DMRG algorithm bears a leading numerical complexity of O(M cubed MH) (assuming that MH is less than M squared).\nixcc | For generic many-body states rewritten as MPS, M is an extensive quantity in the number of sites and diverges in the thermodynamic limit. If the target state of a one-dimensional system obeys an area law of the quantum entanglement, then the von Neumann entropy is guaranteed to be a finite constant. Consequentially, M remains finite in the thermodynamic limit, and MPS becomes exact, which explains the success of DMRG applied to one-dimensional quantum systems. Despite its limitations in two dimensions, DMRG is frequently applied to ladder systems and can even yield reliable results for strongly correlated lattices, especially in the case of\n8p6h | QUANTUM SKYRMION LATTICES IN HEISENBERG ...\npmgl | quantum spin-one half Heisenberg models. We expect MPS to reliably capture the physics of the quantum skyrmion lattice phase because the external field polarizes the environment, and the resulting states carry no entanglement in the paramagnetic regions, but localized entanglement around the domain wall of the skyrmion.\n90no | We typically start with random MPS initial states of bond dimensions up to M less than or equal to one zero two four, followed by sequential variational optimizations (\"sweeping\") of two adjacent tensors (two-site DMRG). The two-site DMRG allows us to estimate the truncation error Delta rho equals summation from i equals M plus one to infinity s sub i squared, which we use in Fig. ten to extrapolate toward results without numerical errors. To ensure that we display converged results only, we carefully monitor local spin expectation values and stop the simulation if changes in the observables become smaller than delta equals one zero to the power of negative ten. Since we use DMRG in two spatial dimensions, convergence to a spin spiral state may require many sweeps, on the order of one hundred to one thousand. The quality of the approximate ground state with energy E (M) equals the inner product of psi (M) with H psi (M) can be estimated by the energy variance",
