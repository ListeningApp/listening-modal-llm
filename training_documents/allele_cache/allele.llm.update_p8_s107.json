        "content": "gc7v | For the first subtask, the performance at TF and cell type ASBs was zero point seven four and zero point seven three for the area under the receiver operating characteristic, and zero point four four and zero point five six for the area under the precision-recall curve, respectively. For the second subtask, we used the top ten TFs and top ten cell types with the highest numbers of ASBs, and a dedicated model was trained for each TF and each cell type. The quality of the models was different for different TFs and cell types, with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic of zero point seven two and zero point eight one for CTCF of TFs and HepG2 of cell types, and the highest area under the precision-recall curve of zero point three five and zero point six four for CTCF and A549. Of note, RAD21 ASBs were also predicted with\nwqfv | very high reliability, as they are often located at the same variants as CTCF ASB.\nj30a | Analysis of the feature importance showed that all models utilized signals from the final layer of the DeepSEA neural network that was specifically designed to distinguish regulatory SNVs. Of note, among multiple DeepSEA features, those for the matched cell types were automatically prioritized. The models also obtained useful information from the experimental DNase-Seq data, and the data on allelic imbalance were generally more important than the basic read coverage. In the case of ASBs of particular TFs, motif-based features further facilitated distinguishing ASBs from non-ASBs. We expect that the same framework can allow further improvement of ASB prediction when supplied with additional chromatin accessibility and allelic imbalance data from matched cell types and with improved models of TF-binding sites.\n7bdk | Disease-associated SNPs and eQTLs are enriched with ASBs. To assess if ASB facilitates the identification of functional regulatory sequence alterations, we annotated the ASB-carrying SNVs using data from several databases on phenotype-genotype associations. With these data, we counted the number of known associations per SNP, considering SNVs of several classes: low-covered SNVs not tested for ASB, candidate sites that exhibit or not exhibit ASB from the data sets of a single TF, candidate sites from the data sets for two or more TFs that, again, exhibit ASB or do not, and finally, regulator-switching ASBs, where different TFs prefer to bind alternative alleles, for example, in different cell types. All variants\nfim0 | were segregated into classes in regard to known associations: no known associations, with a single association, and with multiple associations.\nojro | We have found that the share of ASB variants with genetic associations was consistently higher than expected by chance, which apparently makes ASBs good candidates for prospection for causal SNVs. Specifically, the odds ratio between the observed and expected SNP numbers was specifically high for TF-switching ASBs, although only one point five percent of such ASBs were involved in two or more known GWAS associations. For many variants, there are no known associations with macro-phenotypes, as provided by GWAS studies, but there are data on molecular phenotypes like variations in mRNA levels. In fact, the effect of the so-called eQTLs can be explained by the alteration of TF-binding affinity that is revealed by ASB. Using the same classification of SNVs as above, we tested ASB and non-ASB SNVs for overlaps with GTEx eQTLs and observed the same pattern as for phenotype associations, with the strongest enrichment of ASBs for which different TFs preferably bind alternative alleles. The enrichment also grew stronger with the number of genes, mRNA levels of which were associated with the variant. The same effect holds for multi-cell type ASBs.\nl6t9 | More than eighty percent of ASB SNVs with alternative alleles preferably bound by different TFs overlap eQTLs in at least one cell type, whereas ten percent of such ASB SNVs overlap eQTLs targeting ten or more genes. A large fraction of genes of medical relevance from the ClinVar catalog was found among protein-coding genes associated with ASB eQTLs, twofold enrichment as compared to random expectation, Fisher's exact test P approximately ten to the negative forty-ninth power. Of note, as many as ninety percent of genes of medical relevance in ClinVar are eQTL targets of ASB SNVs, and this constitutes thirty percent of all target genes of ASB eQTLs.\n1ujy | It is not trivial to measure the reliability of ASB identification due to difficulty in assembling a highly reliable ground truth set of ASBs, that is necessary to compute standard performance measures based on true and false positives or negatives. For instance, only synthetic data were used for benchmarking purposes in the original BaalChIP paper. On the other hand, despite difficulties in the direct evaluation of ASB calling performance, it is possible to estimate implicitly the regulatory potential of particular SNPs from functionally related data. We performed a comparison of ASB calls between ADASTRA, BaalChIP, and Shi et al. data comparing ASBs with GTEx eQTLs. The level of eQTL support for ADASTRA ASBs turned out to be comparable to that of the BaalChIP ASB set, with Shi et al. data close behind.\nqzor | We also studied the association of GWAS-tested phenotypes with all candidate SNVs, not necessarily significant ASBs, found in TF-binding regions. To this end, we performed a general enrichment analysis for SNPs found in ChIP-Seq data of particular TFs within linkage disequilibrium blocks using Fisher's exact test. Thus we identified TFs for which phenotype-associated SNVs were enriched within TF-binding regions. For a number of TFs such association with phenotypes was reported in other studies. The examples include FOXA1 involved in prostate development and in our case, found associated with prostate cancer, IKZF1 for which the protein damaging mutations are associated with leukemia, STAT1 involved in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus, and others. Practically in all cases one or several of the associated SNVs also acted as ASBs of the respective TF, providing strong candidates for causality.\na0by | To illustrate how the functional role of regulatory SNPs can be highlighted with ASB data, we present several case studies. First, there is rs three seven six one three seven six G to A that serves as a reference ASB for ESR one, which was already confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. rs three seven six one three seven six is located in the TFF one gene promoter and was shown to reduce TFF one expression through altered ESR one binding, suggesting a molecular mechanism of the increased risk of gastric cancer.",
