Writing C equals negative L N T sub zero for some constant T sub zero, this gives S equals K L N open parenthesis T over T sub zero close parenthesis. Dimensional analysis implies T sub zero must have units of temperature!\nekj5 | But what is this temperature T sub zero? For that we must think harder.\n0heu | The formula S equals K open parenthesis L N T plus C close parenthesis is a bit scary from the viewpoint of dimensional analysis. We usually avoid working with the logarithm of a dimensionful quantity, like L N T, because it transforms in a funny way when we change our units. But if we write C equals negative L N T sub zero then we get S equals K L N open parenthesis T over T sub zero close parenthesis, and we see the solution to our problem! If T sub zero has units of temperature, then T over T sub zero is dimensionless, so L N open parenthesis T over T sub zero close parenthesis doesn't change at all when we change our units. In other words: now L N open parenthesis T over T sub zero close parenthesis is dimensionless, so S equals K L N open parenthesis T over T sub zero close parenthesis has units of entropy as it should.\nyh7j | So, the constant C must equal negative L N T sub zero for some temperature T sub zero that we can compute for any harmonic oscillator. What is it? We could just compute it. But it's more fun to use dimensional analysis.\n3ql4 | What could it depend on? Obviously the mass M, the spring constant K and Boltzmann's constant K. But there's no way to form a quantity with units of temperature from just M, K and K. So we need an extra ingredient.\n9rtl | And we've seen this already: to define the entropy of a probability distribution on the Q, P plane and get something with the right units, we need a quantity with units of action! The obvious candidate is Planck's constant H, and this is actually right. The entropy we're after is given by an integral with respect to D P D Q over H where H equals H over two pi. So the temperature T sub zero can depend on H as well as M, K and K.\nwjx6 | We can compute a quantity with units of temperature from M, K, K and H. The frequency of our oscillator is omega equals the square root of K over M, and it's a famous fact that H omega has units of energy. K has units of energy over temperature ... so H omega over K has units of temperature!\nt62c | Thus, our temperature T sub zero must be H omega over K times some dimensionless purely mathematical constant, which I'll call one over A. A must be something like seven or two, or if we're really unlucky, E six six six - though in practice we usually get numbers fairly close to one, not huge or tiny numbers.\n50qr | So, the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator must be\n2mku | S equals K L N open parenthesis A K T over H omega close parenthesis.\napbe | This is far as I can get without breaking down and doing some real work. Later we will compute Q.\n2wh5 | Entropy of the harmonic oscillator: three\ntjrm | We've seen a classical harmonic oscillator with frequency omega has entropy\nw9xo | S equals K L N open parenthesis A K T over H omega close parenthesis when it's in thermal equilibrium at temperature T.\nutyz | Here K is Boltzmann's constant, H is Planck's constant,\ntquj | and A is some dimensionless mathematical constant. We'll figure it out later.\noepx | Even though we don't know A, this formula is already very interesting! K T is known to be the typical energy scale of thermal fluctuations at temperature T. H omega is the spacing between energy levels of a quantum harmonic oscillator with frequency omega. The ratio K T over H omega is therefore roughly the number of energy eigenstates in which we may find a quantum harmonic oscillator with high probability when it's at temperature T.\nqt5u | Thus, S is roughly K times the logarithm of the number of states that we're likely to find a quantum harmonic oscillator in, when it's at temperature T. This may seem mysterious. After all, we weren't trying to do quantum mechanics, much less count quantum states. But there are other examples of this pattern, where the entropy of a classical system in thermal equilibrium at temperature T is roughly K times the logarithm of the number of quantum states that are accessible at temperature T.\na2kn | We'll learn a bit more about this later, when we relate entropy to something called the 'partition function', which can be understood as the 'number of accessible states'. This viewpoint will also explain the constant Q. But now let's calculate this constant.\n84li | Entropy of the harmonic oscillator: four\noh1c | A classical harmonic oscillator has energy\napax | P, Q equals two plus K G squared over two M\nzc7j | where P is its momentum, Q its position, M its mass and K its spring constant.\n96pn | At temperature T, the probability density of its momentum and position is the Boltzmann distribution:\ntxea | E to the negative B E open parenthesis P, Q close parenthesis P open parenthesis P, Q close parenthesis equals\n8oh3 | integral E to the negative B E open parenthesis P, Q close parenthesis D P D Q over H\nm27u | where B equals one over K T, K is Boltzmann's constant, and H equals two pi H is the original 'unreduced' Planck's constant.\ns0b6 | The oscillator's entropy at temperature T is thus\nihlu | integral P open parenthesis P, Q close parenthesis L N P open parenthesis P, Q close parenthesis D P D Q over H\nr3zr | S equals negative K integral L N open parenthesis P open parenthesis P, Q close parenthesis over zero close parenthesis.\nj6ku | Last time we found a formula for the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator ... which includes a mysterious purely mathematical dimensionless constant Q. Now let's figure out A.\nzt0d | We'll grit our teeth and actually do the integral needed to calculate the entropy-but only in one easy case! Combining this with our formula, we'll get A.\nej0q | First, recall the basics. The energy E open parenthesis P, Q close parenthesis of our harmonic oscillator at momentum P and position Q determines its Boltzmann distribution at temperature T, which I'll call P open parenthesis P, Q close parenthesis now since the letter P is already being used. Integrating negative P L N P using the measure D P D Q over H we get the Shannon entropy. In physics we multiply this by Boltzmann's constant K to get the Gibbs entropy.\ndg44 | Entropy of the harmonic oscillator: five\nlhtj | We can choose units of length, time, mass and temperature to make a classical harmonic oscillator's mass M, its spring constant K, Boltzmann's constant K and Planck's constant H all equal one.\nns07 | Then at T equals one the Boltzmann distribution of the oscillator is\nq8bx | E to the negative open parenthesis P squared plus Q squared close parenthesis over two\nlftq | P open parenthesis P, Q close parenthesis equals integral E to the negative open parenthesis P squared plus Q squared close parenthesis over two D P D Q equals E to the negative open parenthesis P squared plus Q squared close parenthesis over two\nhyaf | so its entropy is S equals negative integral E to the negative open parenthesis P squared plus Q squared close parenthesis over two L N open parenthesis E to the negative open parenthesis P squared plus Q squared close parenthesis over two close parenthesis D P D Q over zero .\n9etn | Let's do this integral!\n2bic | Let's compute the Boltzmann distribution P open parenthesis P, Q close parenthesis and the entropy S. To keep the formulas clean, we'll work in units where M equals K equals K equals H equals one, and compute everything at one special temperature: T equals one.\njras | In this setup H equals two pi, and\ndwvf | E to the negative B E open parenthesis P, Q close parenthesis equals E to the negative open parenthesis P squared plus Q squared close parenthesis over two\nic87 | is a beautiful Gaussian with integral\nbxpw | integral E to the negative open parenthesis P squared plus Q squared close parenthesis over two equals two pi.\n4g09 | These two factors of two pi cancel when we compute the denominator of the probability distribution P open parenthesis P, Q close parenthesis:\ntxr8 | D P D Q over two pi equals one.\nrsup | Thus, we get simply\nhk1c | P open parenthesis P, Q close parenthesis equals E to the negative open parenthesis P squared plus Q squared close parenthesis over two\nna8b | The entropy of the harmonic oscillator is thus\na4wk | D P D Q when K equals K equals H equals T equals one. Next let's do this integral.\nbi02 | S equals negative integral E to the negative open parenthesis P squared plus Q squared close parenthesis over two L N open parenthesis E to the negative open parenthesis P squared plus Q squared close parenthesis over two close parenthesis D P D Q over zero.\nyc23 | Entropy of the harmonic oscillator: six\nki0m | When M equals K equals K equals H equals T equals one the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator is\n6wrx | integral E to the negative open parenthesis P squared plus Q squared close parenthesis over two L N open parenthesis E to the negative open parenthesis P squared plus Q squared close parenthesis over two D P D Q.\nu4q7 | S equals.\n```",
