        "content": "5p1h | For a better approximation, we can use\n7ay7 | logarithm of N factorial is approximately equal to open parenthesis logarithm of N minus one close parenthesis times N plus one half times logarithm of two pi N where the error goes to zero as N approaches infinity. This gives a correction to the Sackur-Tetrode equation:\n2wa8 | entropy sub i is approximately equal to k times N times open parenthesis logarithm of V over N lambda cubed plus five halves close parenthesis minus one half times logarithm of two pi N. Here if we multiply both V and N by a constant c, we don't just multiply the entropy by c: we also have to subtract one half times logarithm of two pi c. So the entropy is not quite extensive but this effect is tiny when you've got a mole of gas.\nazez | THE ENTROPY OF AN IDEAL MONATOMIC GAS\nkn5c | In thermal equilibrium, an ideal gas of N indistinguishable classical particles in a three-dimensional box of volume V has entropy given approximately by the Sackur-Tetrode equation:\nmqu9 | EN (In MAS + NA3 h\ni0lj | But the thermal wavelength lambda is\nfdab | lambda equals\n07he | square root of two pi times m times k times T\nv1de | so we can rewrite this as\n7mej | three halves k T plus three over two m plus five\njw4n | S is approximately equal to k N times logarithm of V over N\n9qfg | We've done it: we've figured out the entropy of a gas of N indistinguishable classical free particles in a three-dimensional box of volume V. Above I've written it in two different ways. Let's mull over the meaning of each term in each formula.\nssph | The first formula says\ndves | S is approximately equal to N times k times logarithm of V over NA cubed plus five.\n3d6a | Like the entropy of the classical harmonic oscillator and the classical free particle in a box, this breaks up into two parts, thanks to the formula\nli84 | S equals open parenthesis E close parenthesis minus F T.\ny06n | But it does so a bit subtly. The two parts are not what you might naively think! They are:\nsipr | One. The free energy part:\nyuxx | T F is approximately equal to k N times logarithm of one over NA cubed times V plus one.\ndbah | Two. The expected energy part:\n4byb | open parenthesis E close parenthesis\nu64j | T equals k N.\n4lha | As usual, the free energy part of the entropy is k times the logarithm of the number of accessible states. The expected energy part of the entropy is approximately equal to N times k by the equipartition theorem, since there are N particles each of whose energy depends on three momentum degrees of freedom.\nuj4l | The expected energy part of the entropy is small compared to the free energy part when V over N is greater than A cubed: that is, when the volume available per particle greatly exceeds the cube of its thermal wavelength. This happens for a gas that is sufficiently warm and dilute, made of sufficiently massive particles. We will see that this is true for helium at standard temperature and pressure. It's even more true for the heavier monatomic gases: the noble gases like neon, argon, and krypton.\nojba | The surprise is the extra plus one in the first part of the entropy-the free energy part. It's telling us that the logarithm of the number of accessible states, divided by the number of particles, is\nmwgi | logarithm of NA cubed plus one divided by V.\ncjze | What's the physical origin of this mysterious extra nat?\nrtvx | Mathematically it comes from Stirling's formula, which showed up when we switched from a gas of distinguishable particles to a gas of indistinguishable particles. It may seem odd that indistinguishability would increase the entropy by one nat per particle, but don't be confused: as we've seen, it greatly reduces it. For a gas of distinguishable particles the log of the number of accessible states, divided by the number of particles, is logarithm of V over A cubed. When we switch to indistinguishable particles this drops to logarithm of V over NA cubed plus one.\nh0y1 | Here is a rough heuristic explanation of what's going on. For a single particle in a box of volume V, the number of accessible states is V over A cubed. In a gas of distinguishable free particles, each roams independently around the whole volume V. Thus, the log of the number of accessible states is logarithm of V over A cubed per particle.\nxxw0 | For a gas of indistinguishable particles, the story changes. For starters, we can crudely pretend each particle is trapped in its own tiny box of volume V over N. After all, if it leaves this tiny box by trading places with another particle in another tiny box, nothing really changes. In this approximation, the log of the number of accessible states is logarithm of V over NA cubed per particle.\nfv2x | But it's not really true that each particle can only leave its tiny box by trading places with another. We can have more than one particle in the same tiny box-or none. That is, our gas can have density fluctuations. An exact treatment of the problem gives, not logarithm of V over NA cubed nats per particle, but\n663s | logarithm of V over A cubed minus logarithm of N factorial.\n385i | Stirling's formula says this is approximately\nuhr9 | logarithm of V over A cubed minus open parenthesis logarithm of N minus one close parenthesis equals logarithm of V over NA cubed plus one.\n9w2j | This explains the mysterious extra nat. The extra nat of entropy per particle is due to density fluctuations!\nusxo | As we've seen, even this is an oversimplification. A still better approximation, again coming from Stirling's formula, says\n5fmi | logarithm of V over A cubed minus logarithm of N factorial is approximately equal to logarithm of V over NA cubed plus one minus two times logarithm of two pi N over N.\nh8p7 | But as we saw in Puzzle forty-seven, this further correction is negligible for a mole of gas. It only becomes interesting for microscopic systems.\ngcbc | Now let's look at our second formula for the entropy of a gas of N indistinguishable classical free particles:\nd9tz | S is approximately equal to k N times open parenthesis logarithm of plus plus logarithm of k T plus logarithm of two pi m h squared plus three close parenthesis.\ndusw | Not only is this harder to remember, it's generally less friendly to physical intuition. First of all, three of the terms involve the logarithm of dimensionful quantities. Thus, when we change units they change, not by rescaling in the usual way, but by addition or subtraction. Secondly, the important role of the thermal wavelength is concealed in this formula.\npk82 | The main advantage of this formula is that it separates out three contributors to the entropy per particle:\nblll | The volume available per particle, V over N. The bigger this is, the more entropy the gas has per particle.\nocgf | The temperature, T. The bigger this is, the more entropy per particle.\ntybl | The particle mass, m. The bigger this is, the more entropy per particle.\n80zt | The first two should be rather intuitive. But what about the third? We need to combine V over N and T with the particle mass m and some constants of nature to get a dimensionless quantity, which we can then take the logarithm of. This leads us straight to the thermal wavelength:\naxet | logarithm of V plus logarithm of k T plus minus logarithm of three times two pi m h squared.\ndrxk | equals logarithm of N A cubed V.\n08na | Thus, my best explanation of why a gas of heavier particles has more entropy per particle is that they have a shorter thermal wavelength, so we can specify their position more accurately, and it takes more information to do so.\nvijt | WHERE ARE WE NOW?\nj5ke | The mystery: why does each molecule of hydrogen have approximately twenty-three bits of entropy at standard temperature and pressure?\nxe0y | The goal: derive and understand the formula for the entropy of a classical ideal monatomic gas:\ngjl6 | N times open parenthesis logarithm of plus comma logarithm of k T plus gamma over two three\n81i9 | including the mysterious constant gamma:\nkgrb | two pi times m times the square root\n6g0d | gamma equals two over one over two plus two\nk9u1 | The subgoal: compute the entropy of a single classical particle in a one-dimensional box:\nldrv | S equals k times logarithm of L plus minus logarithm of k T plus one over twelve plus two times the square root",
