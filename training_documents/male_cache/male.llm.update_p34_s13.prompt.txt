You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

kwpw | i) Maturational Changes of Spermatozoa: As spermatozoa emerge from the testis and appear in the caput epididymis, they possess no progressive motility and have no in vivo fertilizing capacity. Sperm acquire these two properties gradually during transit through the epididymis. Maturation may involve deposition of specific glycoproteins on the sperm surface. Additional changes include a change in net sperm surface charge; alterations in sperm-lectin binding properties; changes in immunoreactivity and iodination characteristics; acquisition of an increased capacity for glycolysis; modification of adenylate cyclase activity; alterations in cellular phospholipid and phospholipid-like fatty acid content; formation of disulfide bonds within the nucleus and tail and oxidation of sperm membrane sulfhydryl groups; and an increased ability to adhere to the zona pellucida. Full fertilization capacity and motility of spermatozoa is probably not achieved until they reach the cauda epididymis. The motility and fertilization capacity of epididymal sperm is regulated by androgens.
usfa | d) Release of Spermatozoa: The release of spermatozoa during ejaculation is mediated by short, adrenergic contractions of the cauda epididymis and vas deferens. Spermatozoa are then mixed with the secretions of the accessory glands (see below).
dnjr | e) Elimination of Aged Spermatozoa: Although the epididymal environment is favorable for survival of sperm, they are not preserved indefinitely and gradually age and lose their viability:
qser | i) After prolonged sexual rest, the spermatozoa first lose their fertilizing ability, then motility, and finally disintegrate.
8gam | ii) Unejaculated spermatozoa may be eliminated by phagocytosis or spontaneous emissions or may be flushed from the urethra by urine.
z4db | iii) Unless older spermatozoa are eliminated at regular intervals, their incidence in the ejaculate increases with less frequent intercourse. After long periods of anejaculation, the first few ejaculates contain more aged spermatozoa, and fertility may be reduced.
lw7l | f) Summary of Epididymal Function
2exi | i) Sperm maturation
16py | ii) Stabilization of condensed chromatin
m4ov | iii) Changes in surface charge of the plasma membrane
9uqd | iv) New sperm surface proteins
8szx | v) Sperm storage
iwdc | vi) Sperm transport by peristalsis
4vks | 16) Vas Deferens: is located within the spermatic cord. The vas deferens is severed at the time of vasectomy, a simple surgical sterilization procedure.
uyaf | a) Lining epithelium: Pseudostratified columnar cells
d1qh | b) Muscular wall: Inner and outer layers of longitudinally oriented muscle separated by a middle circular layer.
nyqt | 17) Spermatic cord: contains not only the vas deferens, but also the cremaster muscle, spermatic artery and veins of the pampiniform plexus.
7odd | 18) Ampulla: the dilated portion of the ductus deferens leading to the ejaculatory duct, which passes through the prostate to empty into the prostatic urethra at the seminal colliculus.
0le2 | 19) Prostate: The largest accessory gland of the male urogential tract consisting of 30-50 branched tubuloalveolar glands that empty into the prostatic urethra. Prostatic fluid contributes 15%-30% or about 0.5 mL to the volume of the semen. The clear, slightly acidic fluid is characterized by a high citric acid content, as well as acid phosphatase and zinc. Citric acid may be important in maintaining the osmotic equilibrium in semen. Prostatic fluid contains the enzymes required for liquefaction of the ejaculate coagulum. (ii
5dw0 | a) Regions of the Prostate:
i4yq | i) Periurethral mucosal glands
fj3g | ii) Periurethral submucosal glands
zuua | iii) Peripheral compound glands (main glands)
elwn | b) Cell types: The glands are lined by simple or pseudostratified columnar epithelium. The lumen contains prostatic concretions (corpora amylacea) rich in glycoproteins and sometimes calcium deposits.
jnqv | c) Prostate Functions: Prostatic fluid contributes 15%-30% or about 0.5 mL to the volume of the semen. The clear, slightly acidic fluid is characterized by a high citric acid content, as well as acid phosphatase and zinc. Citric acid may be important in maintaining the osmotic equilibrium in semen. Prostatic fluid contains the enzymes required for liquefaction of the ejaculate coagulum. Secretions are acidic (pH 6.5). The prostate secretes prostate-specific acid phosphatase, prostate-specific antigen-amylase, and fibrinolysin
unp3 | 20) Seminal Vesicles: The epithelial cells have a large Golgi with secretory granules. The fluid from the seminal vesicles contributes 45%-80% (2.0-2.5 mL) of the ejaculate volume. The fluid is rich in fructose and prostaglandins. Fructose is the major source of glycolytic energy available to the spermatozoa. Fructose is often used as a marker for seminal vesicle presence function and ejaculatory duct obstruction in the azoospermic human. The seminal vesicles and the vas deferens are derived from the same embryonic origin. If the vas deferens is congenitally absent, the seminal vesicles will also be absent, and fructose will be absent in the ejaculate. Therefore, the absence of fructose in the ejaculate is indicative of congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens and/or seminal vesicles. The absence of fructose may also be indicative of obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts. Seminal prostaglandins may play a role in the urethral muscle contractions that occur during ejaculation or may aid sperm transport in the female reproductive tract. Fluids from the seminal vesicles also contain the enzymes required for the formation of the ejaculate coagulum. The seminal vesicle is an androgen-dependent organ that is characterized by the presence of:
v8vk | i) Outer connective tissue layer
sr40 | ii) Middle circular and longitudinal smooth muscle layer
5zjj | iii) Inner folded mucosa: Lined by simple cuboidal-to-pseudostratified columnar epithelium
f56l | b) Function of the Seminal Vesicles:
ar2z | i) Fructose
yad0 | ii) Fluid: Contributing about 50%-70% of the seminal fluid
3g38 | 21) Male Accessory Structures:
vtbo | a) The urethra in a human male is 20 cm long
q8pa | i) Prostatic urethra: Receives the ejaculatory duct and ducts of the prostate
uc9x | ii) Membranous urethra: The shortest segment
zy7o | iii) Penile urethra: Receives the ducts of the bulbourethral glands
kcar | iv) Cell Types:
00aw | (1) Transitional urothelium: changes from a pseudostratified-to- stratified columnar epithelium in membranous and penile urethra.
351p | (2) Muscle layer: in membranous urethra with smooth muscle sphincter (involuntary) and a striated muscle sphincter (voluntary) that controls the passage of urine or semen.
zzcb | b) Cowper and Littré Glands: The Cowper (bulbourethral) glands and glands of Littré (urethral glands) secrete the fluid forming the first part of the ejaculate. The combined secretions of these glands, equal to approximately 0.1-0.2 mL (about 5% of the total ejaculate), is a clear fluid rich in mucoproteins, which are thought to lubricate the distal urethra.
mxnx | i) Bulbourethral glands:
