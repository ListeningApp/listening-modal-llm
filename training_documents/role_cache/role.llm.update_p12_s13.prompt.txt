You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

me84 | Y1H assay
o56m | The CDS of MdERF3 and MdERF118 were ligated into the PJG4-5 vector in restriction enzyme sites EcoRI/XholI. MdPME2, MdPGLR3 and MdACO4 were ligated into the Placzi vector in restriction enzyme sites EcoRI/XholI, KpnI/XholI, and KpnI/XholI, respectively. The CDS of MdDof5.3 and MdRAVL1 were ligated into the PJG4- 5 vector using restriction enzyme sites EcoRI/XholI. MdERF3 and MdERF118 were ligated into the Placzi vector, using restriction enzyme sites EcoRI/XholI. All primers used are listed in Table S16.
slz6 | EMSA
90k5 | The proteins of MdDof5.3 and MdRAVL1 were induced at 37 ℃ for 6 h. Proteins were purified as described by Li (Li et al., 2016). Oligonucleotide probes were synthesized and labelled with biotin (Sangon Biotech.Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). The biotin end- labelled double-stranded DNA probes were prepared by anneal- ing complementary oligonucleotides as follows: the oligonu- cleotides were heated at 95 ℃ for 5 min, then <LATEX>7 2 ^ { \circ } C</LATEX> 20 min, and immediately left to cool to room temperature before use. The biotin-labelled MdERF3 promoter and MdERF118 primer sequences are shown in Table S16.
9m8s | Y2H assay
893y | The CDS region of MdERF3 was ligated into the pGADT7 vector using the EcoRI and XholI restriction sites as described previously (Jia et al., 2018). The full-length MdERF118 (1-344 amino acids) was ligated into the pGBKT7 (Clontech, Beijing, China) binding domain (BD) vector using the EcoRI and SalI sites. The primers used are shown in Table S16. BD and AD vectors were co- transformed into the Y2HGold yeast strain. The interactions between two proteins were detected using the Matchmaker Gold Y2H library screening system (catalog no. 630489; Clontech, Beijing, China).
favz | BiFC assay
7szx | The full-length CDS of MdERF3 or MdERF118 without stop codon was amplified and ligated into pSPYNE-35S and pSPYCE-35S vectors containing green fluorescent protein (GFP), using the one- step seamless cloning kit (Aidlab Biotechnologies); the constructs were checked by sequencing and then transformed into A. tumefaciens strain GV3101. Two plasmids were co-transformed into the abaxial side of 4- to 6-week-old N. benthamiana leaves to detect specific interactions as described previously (Zhang et al., 2013). After 48 h co-infiltration, the N. benthamiana leaves were observed using an LSM 510-Meta confocal laser microscope (Zeiss). GFP signals were imaged under 488 nm excitation wavelength.
hx9e | Kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) genotyping and GAP modelling
ywn2 | Three hundred hybrids were randomly selected from each F1 population of 'Zisai Pearl' x 'Red Fuji', 'Zisai Pearl' x 'Golden
a63r | Delicious', and 'Jonathan' x 'Golden Delicious'. All these hybrids were genotyped for the 56 markers (29 for flesh firmness retainability and 27 for flesh crispness retainability) using KASP assay. The 200-bp sequences flanking the interested SNPs were used for KASP primer design (Chen et al., 2011). The KASP primers are listed in Table S7. The KASP assay was performed using the LGC SNPline (Laboratory of the Government Chemist, UK) and the data were analysed using SNPviewer software. The DNA of parental cultivars, 'Jonathan', 'Golden Delicious', 'Zisai Pearl', and 'Red Fuji', were used as control in KASP assay, because the marker genotypes of these cultivars were already known by previous parental re-sequencing (Shen et al., 2019).
dqvj | Marker genotype effect was estimated by the deviation between the average OPV of the hybrids with the same genotype and overall mean phenotype value of the training populations. By using hybrids without missing marker genotype data, the GPV was calculated by sum up the genotype effects of all markers and population mean phenotype value. The prediction accuracy of GPV was evaluated by the Pearson's correlation coefficient between GPV and OPV of the hybrids (Kumar et al., 2012a). Fivefold cross- validation (run five times) was used to test the accuracy of the GAP models (Abed et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2012a).

Asterisks denoted significance: <LATEX>* P < 0 . 0 5 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>* * P < 0 . 0 1 .</LATEX> Error bars indicate standard deviation of three biological replicates, each containing at least three technical replicates.
