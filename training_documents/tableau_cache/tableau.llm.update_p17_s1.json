It may be a cliché, but it's true that we are drowning in data and yet, we are thirsting for knowledge. The ability to make sense of data and the skill of using data to tell a compelling story is becoming one of the most valued capabilities in almost every field, which includes business, journalism, retail, manufacturing, medicine, and public service. Tableau Public, which is Tableau Software's free Cloud-based data visualization client, is a powerfully transformative tool that can be used to create rich, interactive, and compelling data stories. It's a great platform if you wish to explore data through visualization. It enables your consumers to ask and answer questions that are interesting to them.\natn2 | This book is written for people who are new to Tableau Public and who would like to learn how to create rich, interactive data visualizations from publicly available data sources that they then can easily share with others. Once you publish visualizations and data to Tableau Public, they are accessible to, and can be viewed and downloaded by, everyone. A typical Tableau Public data visualization contains public data sets such as sports, politics, public works, crime, census, socioeconomic metrics, and social media sentiment data. You can also create and use your own data. Many of these data sets are either readily available on the Internet, or can be accessed via a public records request or search. If they are harder to find, they can be scraped from the Internet. You can now control who can download your visualizations and data sets, which is a feature that was previously available only to paid subscribers. Tableau Public currently has a maximum data set size of ten million rows and slash or ten gigabytes of data.\nubo6 | Getting Started with Tableau Public\nzue6 | In this chapter, we will walk through an introduction to Tableau, which includes the following topics:\nw027 | · A discussion on how you can use Tableau Public to tell your data story\ncibw | · Examples of organizations that use Tableau Public\n8lrx | · Downloading and installing the Tableau Public software\ne9ut | · Logging in to Tableau Public\ntbja | · Creating your own Tableau Public profile\n0m6e | · Discovering the Tableau Public features and resources\ncbgu | · Having a look at the author profiles and galleries section of the Tableau website so that we can browse other authors' data visualizations. This is a great way to learn and gather ideas on how to best present data.\nuzqg | A Tableau Public overview\nshuh | Tableau Public allows you to tell your data story and create compelling and interactive data visualizations that invite discovery and education. Tableau Public is sold at a great price-free. It allows you as a data storyteller to create and publish data visualizations without learning how to code or having special knowledge about web publishing. In fact, you can publish data sets of up to ten million rows or ten gigabytes to Tableau Public in a single workbook. Tableau Public is a data discovery tool. It should not be confused with enterprise-grade business intelligence tools, such as Tableau Desktop and Server, QlikView, and Cognos Insight. Those tools integrate with corporate networks and security protocols as well as server-based data warehouses. Data visualization software is not a new thing. Businesses have used software to generate dashboards and reports for decades. The new twist comes with data discovery tools, such as Tableau Public. Journalists and bloggers who would like to augment their reporting of static text and graphics can use these data discovery tools, such as Tableau Public, to create compelling, rich data visualizations, which may consist of one or more charts, graphs, tables, and other objects that can be controlled by readers to allow for discovery.\n5p1h | The people who are active members of the Tableau Public community have a few primary traits in common - they are curious, generous with their knowledge and time, and enjoy conversations that relate data to the world around us. Tableau Public maintains a list of blogs of data visualization experts who use Tableau Software.\n7ay7 | In the following screenshot, Tableau Zen Masters Anya A'hearn of Databrick and Allan Walker used data on San Francisco bike sharing to show the financial benefits of Bay Area Bike Share, a city-sponsored thirty-minute bike sharing program, as well as a map of both the proposed expansion of the program and how far a person can actually ride a bike in half an hour.\n2wa8 | Chapter One\nazez | This dashboard is featured in the Tableau Public gallery because it relates data to users clearly and concisely. It presents a great public interest story, commuting more efficiently in a notoriously congested city, and then grabs the viewer's attention with maps of current and future offerings. The second dashboard within the analysis is significant, as well. The authors described the Geographic Information Systems, the tools that they used to create innovative maps, as well as the methodology that went into the final product so that the users who are new to the tool can learn how to create a similar functionality for their own purposes:\nkn5c | Getting Started with Tableau Public",
