        "content": "z994 | During the short history of automatic pattern recognition, increasing the role of learning seems to have invariably improved the overall performance of recognition systems. The systems described in this paper are more evidence to this fact. Convolutional Neural Networks have been shown to eliminate the need for hand-crafted feature extractors. Graph Transformer Networks have been shown to reduce the need for hand-crafted heuristics, manual labeling, and manual parameter tuning in document recognition systems. As training data becomes plentiful, as computers get faster, and as our understanding of learning algorithms improves, recognition systems will rely more and more on learning and their performance will improve.",
