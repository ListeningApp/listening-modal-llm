You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

b7cq | 2. Students learn at the same rate. Thus, slope parameters do not depend on student. This is a simplifying assumption to reduce the number of parameters in equation 2. We chose this simplification, following Draney, Wilson and Pirolli [7], because we are focused on refining the cognitive model rather than evaluating student knowledge growth.

syiw | 4.2 Difficulty Factors
kg3t | A difficulty factor refers specifically to a property of the problem that causes student difficulties (e.g., first vs. second parameter in figure 3). By assessing the performance difference on pairs of problems that vary by one factor at a time, we can identify the hidden knowledge component(s) that can be used to improve a cognitive model [9]. Difficulty factors have been used to empirically evaluate a small number of alternative models [6, 10, 11].
lvae | In our study, subject experts identified four multi-valued factors for the Area Unit of the Geometry Tutor. Table 2 lists their names and values.
o9sc | "Embed" indicates whether a shape is embedded in another shape. Consider two tutor problems requiring the same production rule CIRCLE-AREA at some step in the problem. In one of the problems, the circle is embedded in a square; while in the other one, the circle is presented alone. Students may find it harder to find the area of circle when it is embedded in another figure because extra effort is necessary to find the circle and its radius. "Backward" means whether the production rule to be used is in its backward form of a taught formula, or its forward form. The forward form of Compose-by-addition is S = S1 + S2, and its backward forma is S1 = S - S2. "Repeat" indicates whether the production rule has been used previously in the same problem. "FigurePart" indicates the part of the figure in the geometry shape to be computed.
121u | 4.3 Combinatorial Search
zh03 | The goal of the combinatorial search is to do model selection within the logistic regression model space [8]. Difficulty factors are incorporated into an existing cognitive model through a model operator called Binary Split, which splits a skill a skill with a factor value, and a skill without the factor value. For example, splitting production Circle-area by factor Embed with value alone leads to two productions: Circle-area with the factor value alone (called Circle-area*alone), and Circle-area with the factor value embed (Circle-area*embed). Table 3 shows the data before and after a split with Embed.
1mvw | Table 3. The data before and after split. Factors are incorporated in column Skill (after split). The opportunities (after split) change accordingly.
6d4s | <LATEX>\mathrm { A } ^ { * }</LATEX> search is the combinatorial search algorithm [14] in LFA. It starts from an initial node, iteratively creates new adjoining nodes, explores them to reach a goal node. To limit the search space, it employs a heuristic to rank each node and visits the nodes in order of this heuristic estimate.
mqah | In our study, the initial node is the existing cognitive model. Its adjoining nodes are the new models created by splitting the model on the difficulty factors. We do not specify a model to be the goal state because the structure of the best model is unknown. We do specify the stopping criterion by setting the upper bound of the number of node expansions, for this paper to 50 node expansions per search.
xxr8 | The heuristic guiding the search is one of the two scoring functions for regression models - AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) Each search is run twice, guided by a different heuristic each time. A good model captures sufficient variation in the data but is not overly complicated by balancing between model fit and complexity minimizing prediction risk [17]. AIC and BIC are two estimators for prediction risk, and hence used as heuristics in the search.
rl4j | <LATEX>\mathrm { A I C } = - 2 ^ { * } \log \mathrm { - l i k e l i h o o d } + 2 ^ { * } \text { number of parameters } .</LATEX> <LATEX>B I C = - 2 ^ { * } l o g - l i k e l i h o o d + n u m b e r o f p a r a m e t e r s ^ { * } n u m b e r o f o b s e r v a t i o n s .</LATEX> (3) (4)
vz32 | where log-likelihood measures the fit, and the number of parameters, which is the number of covariates in equation 2, measures the complexity. Based on these two formulas, the lower the <LATEX>\mathrm { A I C }</LATEX> or BIC, the better the balance between model fit and complexity. BIC puts a more severe penalty for complexity, leading to a smaller model than other methods.
ncb0 | A more interpretable metric for fit is Mean Absolute Deviance (MAD) -- the average of the absolute values of the differences between observed values and predicted values. We do not use it as a heuristic because it leads to over fitting. <LATEX>\mathrm { W } e</LATEX> include it as a measure of the improvement in the model fit.
8mp0 | Figure 4 illustrates <LATEX>A ^ { * }</LATEX> search with AIC as the heuristic. The original model is evaluated and <LATEX>\mathrm { A I C }</LATEX> is computed. The model is then split into a few new models by incorporating the factors. AICs are computed from each of the new model. A* selects the best one (the shaded node with value 5301) for the next model generation. <LATEX>A ^ { * }</LATEX> does not always go down. It may go up to select a model (the shaded node with value 5312) to expand if all the new models have worse heuristic scores than a previous model has. After several expansions, it finds a best node with the lowest AIC value.
