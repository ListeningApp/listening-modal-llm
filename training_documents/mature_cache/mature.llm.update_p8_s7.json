One way to do this is to make an appeal to an inner realm of intentionality, dispositions or motives as a way to trump other interpretations. In the exchange below, Don, in his final turn, seems to play on motives in order to construct the moderator as misunderstanding them, which allows them to claim to be more mature than it would appear to the casual or na√Øve onlooker.\nuxhs | Excerpt one Participants: M: Moderator, D: Don, H: Hal\ned6e | One M: so is part of growing up not falling for good looks (.) is that (.)\n6qqm | Two what do you guys think of that\nonum | Three D: if you don't know em' (.) like if you are in the mall (.) then it's the 4 very first thing ya' gonna notice (one) you never gonna automatically 5 tell that they have a good personality\n3iir | Seven D: =ya' gonna ALWAYS go to looks first=\n7a0a | Eight M: =yeah yeah (.) okay =\no1qp | Nine H: =and if you know the person at school first (.) and like they're not\nxv78 | Ten totally pretty but not that ugly (.) but if they have a good 11 personality (.) then you go out with em'=\nsdks | \ny8fb | M: =yeah=\n521q | Thirteen D: =to see if it works out (.) ya know (.) you go out to see what happens\nyogo | Fourteen M: would you also say that that is part of maturing (.) and possibly=\n2285 | Fifteen D: =see (.) even though we just joke around with the girls and pretend to be all\nys0g | Sixteen like ((acts like he is eyeing someone up and down)) yah umm that's nice =\n7zvp | Seventeen you know (.) acting like we're not mature (.) but see (.) we just act like that\nww6u | Eighteen cause we wanna have fun (.) just for fun (.) that's just the way we are\nhpi6 | The moderator's opening characterization of 'not falling for good looks' as a straightforward index of 'maturing' is problematized by the boys. Don's initial position is that 'falling for good looks' can be seen as natural or inevitable. This position is normalized with the inclusive 'you' and through emphatic stress on certain extreme case formulations, such as 'very first', 'never', and 'automatically', and through the script fragment 'in the mall'. The full dispreferred response is heard in lines six to seven, where both Hal and Don emphatically point out that ya gonna ALWAYS go to looks first. As such, the boys initially claim that 'going to looks first' does not necessarily have anything to do with maturity, but rather is a normal and inevitable phenomenon.\n4uhb | Having built in the reasonableness of 'falling' in the context of first impressions, Hal and Don can then particularize another set of circumstances where looks don't matter as much, that is, when a girl has a good personality. In line fourteen, the moderator uses the vague indexical of 'that' to casually focus on their position of 'dating based on personality', and asks them to account for 'that' as a possible index of maturity. Interestingly, Don orients to the question less as a transparent request for information, and somewhat more as a hedged challenge. Don opens with a delay token 'see' that works to preface a bit of clarification ('even though we just joke around ... ') about a type of activity in which they engage. His final turn is organized in three relevant parts. It begins with an initial preface, followed by a mitigated rejection, and then is completed with an account.\nepyi | Preface =see (.) even though we just joke around with the girls and pretend to be all like ((acts like he is eyeing someone up and down)) yah umm that's nice = you know (.) acting like we're not mature (.) Mitigated rejection but see (.) we just act like that Account cause we wanna have fun (.) just for fun (.) that's just the way we are\ny51p | The initial preface implicates them in flirting activity that is hearable as potentially immature. But it does more than this. It simultaneously downplays the seriousness or 'literality' of their 'joking' behaviour by characterizing it as an 'act'. Don uses the case softener 'just' in the idiomatic 'just joking around' formulation, followed by 'pretend to be all like' to initially draw up a less than serious portrayal of their flirtation. He goes so far as to exaggerate the pretend behaviour of eyeing a girl up and down, and follows the exaggerated re-enactment with the intersubjective casual-looking token of 'you know' in a way that underscores that it is obviously not meant to be taken seriously, and that\nyfum | they are not literally to be seen as immature. This is an obvious 'act' of immaturity, as reinforced with the mitigated rejection of 'but see we just act like that'.\n```",
