Such an outcome would remit the common law of Australia to a condition of stagnancy, inhibiting the necessary correction of injustices by the courts in the daily performance of their charter.\n7um8 | Views may legitimately differ about whether, in the particular matter of native title in Australia, the judges of the High Court would have been wiser to stay their hands and leave reform to Parliament. But my own assessment is that history will treat the decision kindly. As it will the judges who made it.",
