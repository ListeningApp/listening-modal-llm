        "content": "l6t9 | There is a small body of research that has investigated the effects of creatine supplementation in younger females. For example, Vandenberghe et al. showed that creatine supplementation, twenty grams per day for four days followed by five grams per day thereafter during ten weeks of resistance training, significantly increased intramuscular concentrations, muscle mass, and strength compared to placebo in females nineteen to twenty-two years. In elite female soccer players, creatine supplementation, twenty grams per day for six days, improved sprint and agility performance compared to placebo. Hamilton et al. showed that creatine supplementation, twenty-five grams for seven days, augmented upper-body exercise capacity in strength-trained females twenty-one to thirty-three years compared to placebo, nineteen to twenty-nine years. Furthermore, in college-aged females, creatine supplementation, zero point five grams of fat-free mass for five days, improved knee extension muscle performance compared to placebo. In contrast, not all data show improved performance in females. Additionally, Smith-Ryan et al. reported no significant effects of creatine loading on neuromuscular properties of fatigue in young adult females. It is important to evaluate the benefit-to-risk ratio; as noted elsewhere in this document, there are minimal risks associated with creatine supplementation, particularly when it is evaluated against the potential benefits in females.\n1ujy | Accumulating research over the past decade in postmenopausal females demonstrates that creatine supplementation during a resistance training program can improve muscle mass, upper- and lower-body strength, and tasks of functionality, thirty-second chair stand, lying prone-to-stand test, arm curl test. Creatine supplementation appears to be a viable option for postmenopausal females to improve muscle quality and performance. In addition to its beneficial effects on aging muscle, creatine supplementation may also have favorable effects on bone in postmenopausal females, if combined with resistance training. For example, postmenopausal females who supplemented daily with zero point one gram per kilogram per day of creatine during fifty-two weeks of supervised whole-body resistance training experienced an attenuation in the rate of bone mineral loss at the femoral neck, compared to females on placebo during training. Furthermore, five grams per day of creatine supplementation during twelve weeks of resistance training in postmenopausal females resulted in a significant increase in muscle mass and upper- and lower-body strength, compared to placebo. However, even without the stimulus of resistance training, there is some evidence that creatine supplementation can still be beneficial. For example, in aging females, sixty-seven plus or minus six years, acute creatine supplementation, zero point three grams per kilogram per day\nqzor | for seven days, significantly improved lower-extremity physical performance, sit-to-stand test, and fat-free mass and upper- and lower-body strength compared to placebo.\na0by | In summary, there is accumulating evidence that creatine supplementation has the potential to be a multifactorial therapeutic intervention across the lifespan in females, with little to no side effects.\nu1ky | Are other forms of creatine similar or superior to monohydrate and is creatine stable in solutions or beverages?\nhtm9 | Creatine monohydrate powder has been the most extensively studied and commonly used form of creatine in dietary supplements since the early nineteen nineties. Creatine monohydrate was used in early studies to assess bioavailability, determine proper dosages, and assess the impact of oral ingestion of creatine on blood creatine and intramuscular creatine stores. These studies indicated that orally ingested creatine monohydrate, three to five grams per day, increases blood concentrations of creatine for three to four hours after ingestion, thereby facilitating the uptake of creatine into tissue through diffusion and creatine transporters. Additionally, it is well established that ninety-nine percent of orally ingested creatine monohydrate is either taken up by tissue or excreted in the urine as creatine through normal digestion. Short-term loading with creatine monohydrate, for example, consuming five grams four times daily for five to seven days, has been reported to increase intramuscular creatine stores by twenty to forty percent and exercise performance capacity by five to ten percent. Creatine monohydrate supplementation during training, for example, five to twenty-five grams per day for four to twelve weeks, has been reported to promote gains in muscle mass, strength, and exercise capacity. Despite the known efficacy, safety, and low cost of creatine monohydrate, a number of different forms of creatine have been marketed as more effective with fewer anecdotally reported adverse effects. These marketing efforts have fueled speculation that creatine monohydrate is not the most effective or safest form of creatine to consume. This notion is clearly refuted by understanding the well-known physicochemical properties of creatine monohydrate, as well as current creatine supplementation literature.\n8hul | A number of different forms of creatine, for example, creatine salts, creatine complexed with other nutrients, creatine dipeptides, etc., have been marketed as more effective sources of creatine than creatine monohydrate. However, there are no peer-reviewed published papers showing that the ingestion of equal amounts of creatine salts or other forms of creatine like effervescent creatine, creatine ethyl ester,\n87vz | buffered creatine, creatine nitrate, creatine dipeptides, or the micro amounts of creatine contained in creatine serum and beverages, for example, twenty-five to fifty milligrams, increases creatine storage in muscle to a greater degree than creatine monohydrate. In fact, most studies show that ingestion of these other forms has less physiological impact than creatine monohydrate on intramuscular creatine stores and or performance and that any performance differences were more related to other nutrients that creatine is bound to or co-ingested with in supplement formulations. This makes sense given that these other forms contain less creatine per gram than creatine monohydrate and that ninety-nine percent of ingested creatine monohydrate is absorbed into the blood, then taken up into muscle, or excreted in urine.",
