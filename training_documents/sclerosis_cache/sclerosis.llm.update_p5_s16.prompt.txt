You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

877u | Rituximab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that, based on early studies and real-world experience, seems equally effective against RMS and PPMS, although it has never received regulatory clearance [65,66]. Rituximab was approved in 1997 for the cure of lymphoma but is also used off-label for treating several neurological diseases, such as myasthenia gravis and MS. Various dosing regimens have been used. Patients receive 500 or 1000 mg of rituximab intravenously every 6 to 12 months, sometimes after two initial applications conducted two weeks apart [65,66].
rzhj | Natalizumab is an inhibitor of @401 integrin, an adhesion protein produced on the surface of lymphocytes and involved in transmigration via endothelial to the CNS. Compared with placebo or interferon 1a, natalizumab significantly reduces relapses and delays disease progression in patients with RMS advantages retained long-term in real-world investigations [67]. Once every one month, natalizumab is administered as an intravenous infusion [67,68] (Table 2).
bfax | Dimethyl fumarate is recommended for treating RMS, such as clinical syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and secondary progressive disease [7,84]. Dimethyl fumarate is generally well tolerated, but some risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [85]. Most of these individuals were lymphopenic; therefore, lymphopenia should be monitored every 6-12 months [84,86]. Fingolimod was the first oral treatment for RMS to be authorized. It prevents lymphocytes from leaving secondary lymphoid organs, thus preventing the infiltration of autoreactive lymphocytes into the CNS [87]. Fingolimod is well tolerated; however, regular laboratory tests have shown mild side effects. Patients having a baseline absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of 952/ml on the day following the initial dose were higher likely to develop lymphopenia following fingolimod therapy [87,88]. Also, heart block and bradycardia occur when medication is started; therefore, a six-hour observation period is recommended for all individuals receiving their first dose [87,88]. Ozanimod, a newly licensed selective S1P receptor modulator, demonstrated efficacy and safety

o7qm | Teriflunomide inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in pyrimidine production. Teriflunomide suppresses the proliferation of lymphocytes considered autoreactive that have been activated [102]. Teriflunomide can treat MS and prevent brain atrophy [102]. Boxed warnings include warnings of hepatotoxicity and teratogenicity. Headache, diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, and a rise in hepatic alanine transferase are typical side reactions. Cholestyramine may be used to quickly remove teriflunomide if necessary [102]. Glatiramer acetate is the acetate salt of a combination of four amino acid-based polypeptides. Its mode of action may include a favorable adjustment of the ratio of proinflammatory to regulatory cytokines [103]. Glatiramer acetate slightly reduces recurrence rates and some disease severity indicators and is considered an equally effective alternative to interferon in RMS [103,104]. Interferon-ß moderately decreases the rate of recurrence and MRI disease parameters and delays disability buildup [105]. Interferon-ß adverse effects include flu symptoms, subtle laboratory abnormalities, and injection site responses to subcutaneous treatment [105,106] (Table 4).
d52l | Conclusions
qlbb | MS is a disease of immune-mediated inflammation that attacks myelinated axons in the CNS, causing different degrees of damage. Lidwina of Schiedam recorded the first MS case. After that, Augustus d'Este spent years writing about how his MS symptoms progressed. Currently, its prevalence and incidents are on the rise across the world. Low levels of vitamin D in the blood, genetics, smoking, and infection have been linked to the development of MS. MS patients may be recognized at an earlier and earlier stage of the condition as diagnostic techniques and criteria advance. Furthermore, as a consequence of advances in our knowledge of the pathophysiology and course of MS, extraordinary progress has been made in its treatment. Introducing extremely effective medications has resulted in near-total control of recurring diseases and localized brain inflammation. However, effective progression treatment remains unfulfilled, as existing drugs provide limited protection against the neurodegenerative aspects of MS. MS is often treated with disease-modifying medications such as fingolimod, siponimod, interferon beta, rituximab, natalizumab, and dimethyl fumarate. These medications are effective but have some side effects. Although studies imply that the long-term course of the disease has improved dramatically with the therapy age, more clinical and real- world evaluations are required to obtain evidence of these medications' long-term effectiveness and safety.
