You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

nv42 | With regard to the individual consumption level, the MPE indicates that at various levels of income and inequality dis- tribution, individuals' propensities to consume more polluting goods differ due to the change in the patterns of consumption level (Ravallion et al. 2000; Borghesi 2006; Grunewald et al. 2012; Jorgenson et al. 2017). Hence, Jorgenson et al. (2017) declared that consumption level was the key factor influencing the MPE. However, there is not a single hypothesis analysing the inequality influence on consumption-based CO2 emis- sions. The main condition of the changes in income inequality affecting the consumption-based carbon emissions depends
xags | on the MPE ratio between materially wealthy and poor people. If poor people's MPE is bigger than that of the wealthy, an increase in inequality reduces CO2 emissions (Ravallion et al. 2000; Liu et al. 2019a; Heerink et al. 2001; Hübler 2017). Authors as Baloch et al. (2018), Hao et al. (2016), and Magnani (2000) assumed that due to higher prices resulting from environmentally friendly production, the poorest people cannot afford to buy any of these products. Furthermore, these people are not inclined to choose to use renewable electricity. Moreover, larger income distribution would decrease individ- uals' environmental concern (Baloch et al. 2018), and vice versa, the environmental quality is more important for rich people and they have higher environmental concern (Scruggs 1998; Heerink et al. 2001; Zhang and Zhao. 2014; Kashwan 2017; Wolde-Rufael and Idowu 2017). The assump- tion that the MPE is bigger if compared with richer countries corresponds to the Keynesian model when lower-income in- dividuals, rather than higher income, have a higher marginal tendency to consume, so the growth of inequality reduces the income of the poor and decreases the emissions (Jorgenson et al. 2017). A large number of authors identified that the MPE falls with the level of income (Grunewald et al. 2012, 2017; Jakob et al. 2014; Serino and Klasen 2015; Grunewald et al. 2017). Meanwhile, if low-income individuals have a lower level of MPE than the high income, the growth of income inequality raises CO2 emissions (Mader 2018). Islam (2015), Kasuga and Takaya (2017), Baloch et al. (2018) and Jorgenson et al. (2019) declared that due to different consump- tion levels, the rich people more negatively influence environ- mental impact than the poor individuals. Furthermore, accord- ing to Berthe and Elie (2015), the rich people are not neces- sarily pro-environmentally friendly, and they are not willing to assume the responsibility and the costs of environmental is- sues (Wolde-Rufael and Idowu 2017). Therefore, the reduc- tion of income inequality is shown to reduce consumption- based carbon pollution, which suggests that the reduction of income inequality and CO2 emissions can be achieved simul- taneously (Golley and Meng 2012). In other case, when the income inequality is more balanced, the consumption of more polluting goods increases due to the shift of poor people to the middle class (e.g. Heerink et al. 2001; Borghesi 2006; Grunewald et al. 2017; Charfeddine and Mrabet 2017; Liu et al. 2019). Hence, inequality can raise the middle social groups' willingness to achieve the superior (wealthy) social group's patterns of consumption ("Veblen effect"), causing greater environmental impact by increasing the consumption level (Berthe and Elie 2015).
jc47 | Insignificant relationship between inequality and pollution reveals that when income becomes more equally distributed, the individuals from the poor class will increase their con- sumption of energy and other polluting products as they trans- fer to the middle class. Thus, when the three classes of indi- viduals (poor, middle and rich) are considered, the relationship
ko3c | between inequality and environmental pollution may not be linear. The propensity to emit may rise and then descend, which causes the curvilinear link between inequality and en- vironmental pollution (Jorgenson et al. 2017). Furthermore, constant emission intensity across the income classes would reveal that any income redistribution would have an insignif- icant or no impact on consumption-based emissions (Golley and Meng 2012). In conclusion, the possible influence of in- equality on environmental pollution via individual behaviours depends on MPE and changes in the social norms (Berthe and Elie 2015).
xek3 | Conclusions
bbpr | In recent decades, the environmental research has paid much attention to the analysis whether the reduction of income in- equality and pollution related to climate change could be achieved simultaneously. By reviewing the selected papers published from 2001 to 2019, where these experts empirically evaluated the impact of inequality on carbon emissions, the author of the present article identified that the links between inequality and CO2 emissions were different in developing and developed countries. The different results reveal that the role of inequality on CO2 pollution is quite versatile. Referring to Kuznets curve, which was applied for both income inequal- ity and environmental quality, it was assumed that the afore- mentioned different results could derive from the different trajectories of Kuznets curve. Therefore, if countries trace the same trajectory of Kuznets curve, a positive impact of inequality on environmental impact is observed. If environ- mental impact matches the right side of the EKC but income inequality has not reached the turn point at the same economic development level and stays on the left side of Kuznets curve, a negative relationship between the level of inequality and pollution is recognized. The negative relationship between inequality and CO2 emissions is observed when the U- shaped trajectory of one variable occurs instead of the inverted U-shape. An insignificant relationship could be observed when the country's pollution or inequality level matches the turn point. These Kuznets curve trajectory differences depend on the differences of impact channels through which econom- ic development affects inequality and environmental pollu- tion. This paper presented the following four channels: (1) scale, (2) composition, (3) technique and (4) globalization, through which economic development affects both CO2 emis- sions and inequality level.
5zyf | The majority of authors have analysed theoretical links of inequality impact on CO2 emissions with regard to territorial (or production-based) emissions. This paper suggested to con- sider the production-based and consumption-based emissions separately when analysing the approaches to relationship be- tween inequality and pollution. Therefore, the proposed
9own | theories according to the origin of emissions were distin- guished and new approaches which could explain the influ- ence of income inequality on CO2 emissions were provided.
