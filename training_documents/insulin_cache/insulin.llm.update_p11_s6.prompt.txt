You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

qfmx | Kleinridders et al. (2015) reported that brain/neuron IR knockout (NIRKO) mice, show age-dependent depressive and anxious behaviour due to impaired mitochondrial function and increased DA turnover by MAO, which is normally suppressed by insulin. Insulin receptor knock-out in glial cells, in turn, reduces ATP exocytosis, resulting in decreased purinergic signalling on DA neurons and subsequently anxi- ety- and depressive-like behaviour (Cai et al., 2018a). Mechanistically, a subsequent hyperdopaminergic state within the amygdala is probably responsible for the increase in anxiety observed in insulin-resistant and diabetic rats (Rebolledo-Solleiro et al., 2016). Interestingly, down- regulation of the IR in the hypothalamus can also induce depressive-like behaviour in rodents (Grillo et al., 2014) indicating that insulin signal- ling in the hypothalamus might also affect DA signalling in the midbrain.
rut3 | 4.2. Therapeutic approaches targeting insulin pathways
m3cp | Based on the molecular evidence for the role of (impaired) insulin signalling in the development of depressive and anxious symptoms, these behavioural changes (see Section 3.3.) respond to treatments altering metabolic state and/or DA signalling: In NIRKO-mice depressive and anxious behaviour is reversed by MAO inhibitors (Kleinridders et al., 2015). In STZ-induced diabetes, depressive symptoms were reduced by insulin therapy, with some (but not all) studies indicating the same impact on anxiety (Gupta et al., 2014; Ho et al., 2012b). Furthermore, physical activity and food restriction, as well as the insulin sensitizers rosiglitazone or pioglitazone alleviated depressive-like behaviour in insulin-resistant rodents (Gilak-Dalasm et al., 2021; Para- shar et al., 2018; Shimomura et al., 1990). Despite these promising animal results, the therapeutic link between insulin, DA and depression has hardly been examined in humans. Mansur et al. (2019) demon- strated, that being overweight moderated the association between reduced effort spending (which is DA-dependent) and MDD. Moreover, a single intranasal insulin administration has been shown to improve mood in overweight/obese women <LATEX>\left( n = 1 7 \right)</LATEX> without psychiatric condi- tions (Schneider et al., 2022). Equally, repeated administration of intranasal insulin across eight weeks improved mood in obese <LATEX>\left( n = 1 5 \right)</LATEX> and normal-weight participants without depression <LATEX>\left( n = 1 9 \right)</LATEX> (Benedict et al., 2004; Hallschmid et al., 2008). Furthermore, diabetes and over- weight attenuate the responsiveness to classical antidepressants (Miyata et al., 2003; Rizvi et al., 2014) and adjunctive therapies that enhance insulin sensitivity including both lifestyle (exercise) and dietary inter- vention improve antidepressant treatment response, even if peripheral insulin resistance is not used for treatment stratification (Jeremiah et al., 2020). A similar effect has been reported for adjunctive therapy with
mq4s | insulin sensitizers (Colle et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2015; Rasgon et al., 2010). Moreover, in the state of insulin resistance, different classes of antidepressants show distinct treatment efficacy and suppressing or enhancing effects on blood glucose levels and body weight (Anderson et al., 2002; Srisurapanont et al., 2022) indicating that the choice of antidepressant therapy should be influenced by the metabolic state. However, clinical trials targeting this question are still lacking. Overall, current data regarding the association between antidepressant-specific mechanism-of-action and effects on metabolic state and depressive symptoms, remain inconclusive but imply that SSRIs might have the best anti-depressive effect in the state of insulin resistance and have a beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity (Markowitz et al., 2011; Silva et al., 2012).
95el | Notably, altered DA signalling is only one potential pathway that links insulin resistance and depression. There are several other factors, that contribute to this bidirectional link including impairments in serotonergic transmission, HPA-axis, neurogenesis, (neuro-)inflamma- tion, opioid-mediated pathways, gut microbiome and gut-brain signal- ling (Carr, 1994; Zou et al., 2020), which are important, but beyond the scope of this review. Nevertheless, these presented findings are collec- tively of high (pre)clinical relevance as they point toward a metabolic subtype of depression, in which increased insulin resistance might function as a state marker. Targeting insulin resistance in depression might serve as an important avenue toward a personalized medicine approach in psychiatry.
a0a5 | 5. Conclusions
gocl | Overall, DA signalling in the midbrain and consequently the DA encoded reward behaviour is modulated by insulin signalling. The effect of insulin on DA release, turn-over, and firing rate might seem contra- dictory at first glance, but this is due to the differential effects of insulin on the somato-dendritic spines in the midbrain and the axonal terminals in the striatum. Different rodent models of insulin resistance have pro- vided clear evidence that insulin resistance leads to altered DA signal- ling and impaired reward behaviour. This might represent one critical mechanism in the bidirectional link between insulin resistance and depression. Hence, a detailed molecular understanding of the regulation of DA signalling by insulin will lay the basis for therapeutic advances in the metabolic treatment of depressive disorders.
