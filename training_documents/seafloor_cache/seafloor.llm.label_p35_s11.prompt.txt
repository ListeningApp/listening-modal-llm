You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

n1i7 | NaCl equiv) and isotopic data on the sulfide, sulfate, and silicate minerals indicate seawater-dominated fluids, possi- bly with a component of condensed vapor-phase liquid, and abundant fluid mixing between hydrothermal fluids and ambi- ent seawater. The calculated temperatures of clay formation range from 124° to 256℃, lower than the calculated trapping temperatures of primary fluid inclusions in anhydrite and sphalerite, suggesting that the late sulfate-sulfide veins were likely transporting hotter fluids. The highest-temperature flu- ids likely boiled at a depth just below the deepest drill holes. Several lines of evidence indicate increasing temperature with depth: (1) the transition from barite near the surface to anhydrite at depth, (2) the progressive transition from smec- tite to mixed-layer illite/smectite (with increasing proportions of illite) to corrensite to chamosite (e.g., Fig. 11A, B), and (3) decreasing 818O and increasing òD values of monominer- alic clays. Calculated temperatures of formation increase by ~130℃ from nontronite -> chamosite -> corrensite -> recto- rite. Downhole temperature gradients are as high as 80℃ in just over 1 m (e.g., TKAD025 at site B). However, several drill holes show reverse temperature gradients. In particular, data for TKAD026 suggests decreasing temperatures from 256℃ at 2.9 m b.s.f. to 161℃ at 5.6 m b.s.f., reflecting the control of variable subseafloor permeability on lateral fluid flow and variable subsurface mixing with entrained seawater.
0r5m | The alteration mineralogy at Tinakula is similar to proximal footwall alteration associated with Kuroko-type VMS deposits (e.g., Shirozu, 1974; Date et al., 1983; Shikazono et al., 1995). In these deposits, the shallow subseafloor strata surround- ing the fossil upflow zones is dominated by low-temperature montmorillonite/nontronite, with higher-temperature illite/ smectite + pyrite present in the immediate footwall of the massive sulfide and illite/smectite + chamosite and chamosite + corrensite at depth, similar to sites A, C, and D at Tinakula.
ne2o | Sites A and D are interpreted to be at the center of the high- est-temperature upflow, where there is active venting, chal- copyrite-rich chimneys, and extensive formation of illite. The alteration mineralogy at sites B, C, E, and F reflects relatively lower temperatures, consistent with the dominant sphalerite- and barite-rich chimneys.
sqxn | The alteration assemblages are all associated with Si loss (Fig. 17; Table 5), which may be partially related to dilu- tion associated with anhydrite precipitation at depth, with net mass changes of as much as 49%. Similar loss of Si has been documented in association with phyllosilicate altera- tion at the PACMANUS hydrothermal system in the Manus back-arc basin (Giorgetti et al., 2006; Paulick and Bach, 2006; Monecke et al., 2007). In contrast, at Tinakula Si gains occur at the tops of drill holes TKAD015, TKAD032, and TKAD033 (App. Figs. A26, A27), representing local silicification near the seafloor in the form of opaline silica filling void spaces. Large gains in Ca near the bottom of drill holes TKAD015, TKAD012, and TKAD018 likely record the deposition of anhydrite at the higher subseafloor temperatures at depth, which could reflect incomplete removal of the anhydrite-rich matrix material during clast separations. Large mass gains in K2O (and LREEs) in the illite/smectite + pyrite assemblages are similar to the observed mass changes in the feeder zones of VMS deposits hosted by felsic volcaniclastic rocks (e.g., Mattabi-type alteration; Morton and Franklin, 1987). Altera- tion in the immediate upflow zone at Tinakula might also be enhanced by the pyrite precipitation, which generates acid. In the surrounding permeable rocks, drawdown of seawater has added MgO. Intuitively, this process should be associated with cooling, but the higher temperatures of chlorite forma- tion at depth in the Tinakula drill holes, based on 818O data (Fig. 22), may also have increased the drawdown, resulting in the observed Mg addition.
6pmo | MINERALIZATION AND ALTERATION OF THE TINAKULA SMS DEPOSIT
195r | In permeable volcaniclastic rocks, an important question is how the permeability becomes sealed enough to allow focusing of the hydrothermal fluids to the seafloor. Here, we propose that the pervasive alteration of the volcaniclastic units close to the seafloor coincided with a progressive downward increase in subseafloor temperatures, from initial low temperatures during precipitation of nontronite (136°-138℃), increasing to chamosite (124°-205℃), corrensite (207°-227℃), and eventually rectorite (256℃). At 150℃, the temperatures were high enough to form anhydrite at depths of only a few meters below the seafloor, sealing off some permeability and focusing the fluids into channelized pathways to the seafloor. Continued hydrothermal circulation resulted in overpressur- ing and fracturing of this relatively impermeable layer, precip- itating late sulfate veins with minor sulfide minerals (Fig. 3E), including sphalerite, at temperatures up to 298℃. A similar model has been proposed for the anhydrite-cemented brec- cias in the Pacmanus deposit in the Manus basin (Binns and Scott, 1993; Binns et al., 2007) and the Suiyo seamount and Iheya North Knoll field in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc (Ishi- bashi et al., 2013, 2015). This process has been investigated using numerical modeling (Kawada and Yoshida, 2010); in ancient deposits, anhydrite is rarely preserved because of its retrograde solubility; the only evidence remaining of an anhy- drite seal would be the presence of alteration minerals formed at temperatures that would have caused anhydrite deposition. Chlorite-rich alteration pipes in otherwise permeable volca- niclastic sequences may have been shielded from infiltrating seawater by anhydrite that is no longer present in the rocks. Although rarely preserved in ancient VMS deposits, anhydrite and gypsum are locally abundant in the Kuroko ores (e.g., Shikazono et al., 1983) and may have played an important role in the focusing of hydrothermal upflow in those deposits, as at Tinakula.
kqmi | Barite and silica, which form close to the seafloor at much lower temperatures than anhydrite, may also have been important in forming an initial cap on the permeable units, promoting lateral flow of fluids and allowing subseafloor temperatures to reach the point of anhydrite precipitation (>150℃; Bischoff and Seyfried, 1978). Early cooling of the fluids and mixing near the seafloor was likely, given the highly permeable volcaniclastic cover. The style of hydrothermal upflow also plays an important role in the nature of the sea- floor mineralization. Jamieson et al. (2016) showed a high proportion of seawater mixing in chimneys with predomi- nant dendritic barite; similar diffuse venting is likely respon- sible for the formation of porous beehive-like structures and unusual bulbous chimneys observed at Tinakula (cf. Koski et al., 1994). This style of venting, which has been inferred for the origin of layered barite-sulfide mounds in the East Dia- mante caldera (Hein et al., 2014) and at Clark seamount (de Ronde et al., 2014), may be common where seafloor venting occurs through permeable volcaniclastic substrates. Diffuse discharge over a large area is also consistent with the bottom- hugging plume signal originally detected at Tinakula (McCo- nachy et al., 2002).

Morphologies of the volcanic cones at Tinakula and the vol- caniclastic facies successions are consistent with extensive Strombolian-type eruptions, forming a row of cinder cones along a NS-trending fissure. The eruptions likely occurred over days to months (cf. Sigurdsson, 2000), while geother- mal activity at Tinakula may have lasted thousands of years. The massive sulfide mineralization may not be closely related temporally to formation of the cinder cones, but instead the hydrothermal systems most likely exploited the same struc- tural corridor. Lateral fluid flow and semiconformable altera- tion at Tinakula are similar to those described in a class of ancient VMS deposits hosted by volcaniclastic rocks (e.g., Franklin et al., 2005; Galley et al., 2007), such as the Sturgeon Lake VMS district (e.g., Morton and Franklin, 1987; Morton et al., 1991; Hudak et al., 2004; Mueller et al., 2004; Holk et al., 2008). In ancient VMS deposits of this type, semicon- formable alteration is commonly observed at depths of several hundred meters below the paleoseafloor, associated with sub- seafloor deposition of massive sulfide (e.g., Allen et al. 2002; Doyle and Allen, 2003). What is unusual at Tinakula is that hydrothermal fluids affected such a large area so close to the seafloor: ~ 150,000 m2 at the seafloor and possibly three times as large below the seafloor. The shallow alteration and anhy- drite likely acted as an insulating layer for hydrothermal cir- culation and mineralization at depth, as seen in ancient VMS deposits.
