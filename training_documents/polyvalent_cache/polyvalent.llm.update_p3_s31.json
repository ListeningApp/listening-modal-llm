This approach enables the comparison of a signal from total phage active sites and partially saturated phages. The ratio four refers to the ratio of the signal recorded for partially occupied phage's active sites in a mixture of T n T and phage (a) and the signal recorded in the absence of soluble T n T (a zero) which may be interpreted as a signal from all active sites. Experimental determination of the ratio is necessary to calculate the T n T K a ratio, which is crucial for further analysis.\naq5a | Theoretically, a correlation between the concentration of phage-exposed active sites and a measured signal may be approximated in at least two ways. According to the first\nsc5y | Calculation of the ratio T n T K a is possible analytically for one-to-one and one-to-two stoichiometry, but in the second case, expressions are very complicated, so numerical methods are recommended to solve them. For higher valences, the ratios have to be calculated numerically. K a\n0yab | T n T over K sub D equals one minus a over a zero over a over a zero. (eight)\nw95z | For determination of K sub D, calculated analytically or numerically, the T n T over K sub D value may be inserted into equation five or equation six after division by K sub D. Expressing sig T n T over K sub D as a function of the total T n T concentration enables calculation of K sub D for monovalent and non-monovalent phages, respectively, as regression of the slope\n0i1k | One minus a over a zero over a over a zero equals one over K sub D times c zero to the power of T n T minus c zero to the power of M thirteen times one minus a over a zero over K sub D. T n T over K sub D equals one over K sub D times c zero to the power of T n T minus c zero to the power of M thirteen times the sum from l to S of Tr r over K sub D to the power of i over one plus the sum from l equals one to S of T n T over K sub D to the power of i over K sub D. nine ten\ndqlg | During an E L I S A experiment, as proposed by Friguet, a constant concentration of phages is incubated with different concentrations of T n T. Saturation of phages in solution by soluble T n T limits the ability of phages to bind to immobilized T n T, and therefore, increasing concentration of T n T causes a decrease in signal from the phages, in our case, the M thirteen. Theoretically, two options have to be discussed: one a signal (a) is generated for each phage with at least one unoccupied active site and two a signal (a) is generated to the total concentration of unoccupied active\np6pq | sites. A equals f c zero to the power of M thirteen times one minus T n T over K sub D to the power of five over one plus the sum from one to five of T n T over K sub D to the power of i. A equals f c zero to the power of M thirteen times the sum from i equals zero to n of n minus i times T n T over K sub D to the power of i over n times the sum from i equals zero to five of T n T over K sub D to the power of i. eleven twelve\nzse6 | The first variant would be more probable for high T n T surface density significantly higher capability than phages present in solution where phages are mostly bound to the layer. According to the second variant, it is also possible that the recognition and binding process is slow enough to make the reaction kinetically limited. In this case, phages with a higher number of free active sites are more likely to be bound than more saturated ones. Nevertheless, the incubation times\np2n3 | during E L I S A and preincubation are comparable, and an equilibrium state can achieve equilibrium in both stages. More accurate assumptions should be proved empirically for each experimental system.\nohh7 | EXPERIMENTAL SECTION",
