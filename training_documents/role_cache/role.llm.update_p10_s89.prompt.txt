You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

tb74 | The majority of consumers prefer crisp apples to firm ones (Bonany et al., 2014; Hoehn et al., 2008; Hong et al., 2018; Yue et al., 2013). Apple cultivars with relatively high flesh crispness but low firmness, such as 'Honeycrisp', are currently commer- cially successful and are expected to remain so in the future (Mckay et al., 2011). The apple expansin genes, MdEXPDCA1, MdEXPA2, MdEXPA3 and MdEXPA8 were considered markers for flesh crispness retention during cold storage (Costa et al., 2005b; Trujillo et al., 2012). We observed that the expression of ß-Gal genes, MdBGLs and MdBGLU, was significantly high in flesh firmness and crispness unretainable hybrids, which was consistent with the results of a previous report (Wei et al., 2012). These data indicated that flesh crispness retainability is a more crucial fruit quality attribute than flesh firmness retainability and that genomics-assisted selection for good flesh crispness retain- ability may also inadvertently select for good flesh firmness retainability.
8l69 | Unlike the QTLs on chromosomes 10 and 15 for fruit firmness at harvest, chromosomes 3 and 16 were 'QTL hotspots' for apple flesh firmness and crispness retainability (Figure S5a,b), which is consistent with the results of previous reports (Bink et al., 2014; Di Guardo et al., 2017). The markers SNP26684680 and SNP34732032 on chromosome 3, and SNP38573461, SNP3059129, and SNP9127269 on chromosome 16 accounted for relatively large effects for both flesh firmness and crispness retainability (Figure S4; Tables S9 and S11).
1jyv | RNA-seq enriched a large group of ethylene synthesis-related and cell wall degradation-related genes in DEGs between flesh firmness and crispness retainable and unretainable samples, which was consistent with previous reports (Dandekar et al.,
olce | 2004; Gwanpua et al., 2014; Longhi et al., 2013; Wakasa et al., 2006). In addition to these functional genes, many ethylene receptors and signalling genes were involved in regulating fruit firmness, such as MdEIN3, MdERF1, MdERF2 and MdERF4 (Lee et al., 2012; Li et al., 2017). Here, we observed that several ethylene-responsive genes were up-regulated in firmness and crispness retainable apples (Figure S6). As expected, the allelic variations on QTL-identified MdERF3 and MdERF118 were detected and were validated to affect flesh firmness and crispness retainability (Figure 6a). These two allelic variations were consid- ered diagnostic markers, which is consistent with QTL-derived ERF genes for apple fruit firmness retention (McClure et al., 2018). MdERF3 contains an ethylene-responsive element-binding factor- associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif, and thus may function as negative regulator of MdPGLR3, MdPME2 and MdACO4 expression (Kagale and Rozwadowsld, 2011). MdERF118 also inhibited MdPGLR3 and MdACO4 expression by directly binding to their promoters; however, MdERF118 does not contain an EAR motif, which is similar to SlERF6 in tomato. SlERF6 negatively regulates fruit maturity and does not contain the EAR motif (Lee et al., 2012). The protein-protein interaction between MdERF3 and MdERF118 rendered the genetic variation network more complex (Figure 6d).
erx1 | GAP models for apple flesh firmness and crispness retainability were developed and were efficiently used in simulative selection. Fivefold cross-validation showed the prediction accuracy was 0.5541 and 0.6018 for the retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively. The predictability of these models was not only better than that of the activator-depleted substrate model (van der Sman and Sanders, 2012), but also better than that of pure GS by ridge regression BLUP, the accuracy of which was more than 0.4 for apple firmness after storage and was 0.08-0.45 for changes in fruit firmness (McClure et al., 2018). The improvement in predictability of the GAP models may be attributed to the taking into account non-additive allelic effects. Additive, dominant, and even over-dominant non-allelic epistasis or interactions among
b3bt | QTLs or candidate genes for fruit firmness were detected in tomato (Causse et al., 2007; Chapman et al., 2012). Dominant or partially dominant allelic effects were common in this study for apple flesh firmness and crispness retainability.
