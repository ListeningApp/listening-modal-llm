You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1svs | THOUGHTLESSNESS
izqt | There is a parable about this, attributed to Jesus, but which does not appear in the approved gospels: though this does not make the analogy itself any less true. It is found in the putative Gospel of Thomas, which was found in Egypt in 1945.
vub1 | In this story, reference is made to a, woman carrying a container
zfhy | 243
p9bw | of meal and walking a long distance. Unknown to her, the meal flows out behind her 'and she did not know how to work'. When she arrived at her house, she put down the container and found it to be empty. This parable refers to the 'Kingdom of the Father", and its applicability to our contention about the imperceptible loss of potentiality, through a form of thoughtlessness (called by the Sufis 'heedlessness') is very apposite to this subject
2l8i | SELLING HALF THE HOUSE
locx | About giving and getting, Nasrudin visited a house-agent one day: 'I want to sell one half of the house I live in' he said.
z2dl | 'But Mulla, I know your house - you only own one-half of it'
vtxq | That is exactly the point. I want to sell my half to buy the other half with the money I raise from the deal.'
571b | 244
fg6a | The Giving of Charity
o873 | Q: Have you any remarks to make on the giving of Charity among Sufis?
tm0v | A: One commanding principle of all Sufis, binding upon them, is secret charity. Charity takes many forms. As to monetary charity:
yusn | If money is given with a sense of joy, that joy is 'payment' for the charity, and the good which comes to the giver is restricted to that emotion. Although this kind of giving is familiar to most people, it nevertheless remains the minor form of charity. The second part of the minor form of charity is to give in order that the person may help himself. Thus a person might buy a tool for a carpenter, so that he could earn his living. This may not be emo- tional, but could still be 'calculated' charity. Its limitations make it less than true charity.
5cww | Money or valuables are given by Sufis, or those who desire to be counted among them, in accordance with the principle: 'Let your left hand not know what your right hand does.'
vgpr | A Sufi will:
xrda | Give before being asked; Give whatever he has, without counting it; Give when asked;
u0fl | Give no emotional or calculated charity unless he can give true charity.
1qe2 | It is meritorious to give money to a Sufi for him to distribute it He will give it out, in large or small amounts, to those who are deserving; not necessarily in accordance with their outward need. A beggar or a poor man may get a thousand gold pieces, not just a copper coin.
of19 | Charity does not always involve money, as you know. Charity is not only given, as you call it It is lived and performed, which means "being and doing.'
l0xs | 245
yrtf | As Saadi, the great dervish, says in his Gulistan:
9foe | 'You who are unmoved by others' suffering are not entitled to the name of man'. Charity has been made into a great virtue only because of the low level of human decency.
mind | If you still think that charity is not a necessity but a high virtue, you do not even know what your contemporaries, in your own civilisation, have discovered, and which has been published in mass-circulation newspapers on the subject. Here is an example of the charity of animals:
zn89 | CHARITY OF THE RATS
b264 | Dr. J. T. Greene, of Georgia University* took ten white rats and trained them to obtain food pellets by pressing one of two levers in their cage. One lever produced fewer pellets and was hard to depress, and the rats soon found this out and ignored it, con- centrating on the other. Now the experimenter wired the levers so that when the one which yielded food was pressed, a rat in the next cage received an electric shock.
jv66 | What did the food-seeking rats do? First, they recognised that their actions were giving their neighbour pain; then no less than eight out of ten of them went over to the other lever, even though it was hard to work, and concentrated on it, saving their fellow from further harm.

exc2 | The Number of Readings of a Book
8y62 | Q: I understand that the study of books is very important. Can you say something about how Sufis feel about reading, and the number of times a book is read?
4fig | A: A Sufi book will have to be read in the ordinary way several times. If the mind of the reader is not correctly prepared, he will reject the book, read it selectively, or else indoctrinate himself with the contents. All these results are undesirable.
sksb | The above facts, however, account for the effects of literature upon the minds of various people. The human mind is an organ- ism in which what it absorbs will be to one man meat, another poison. This effect is inherent in the mind of the reader much more than in the book.
op72 | And yet people persist in considering books, in their possible effect upon people, as always the same. This stupidity is one of the less attractive legacies of mechanical scholasticism, which, indeed, usually requires a standardised mind to approach each and every book.
im7i | Many people are proud of how many times they have read a book. They point to well-thumbed copies as evidence of their diligence. In some circles, indeed, 'a tattered bible' is still taken as an evidence of piety.
rmuk | And yet hardly anyone knows that the condition of the book, the treatment which it has received at the hands of the reader, will leave traces upon it, which will have an effect, just as will the typeset content, long after the impressions upon the book have been made. Borrowed books carry an imprint. Books which one has used too many times carry this imprint, this 'smell of infidelity' as it is called in Persian, from one reading to another.
kadj | It is for this reason that people are often asked to read many times several copies of the same book, even if it means buying new copies after each second reading. This is something which may not be well-known, but it is effective nevertheless. Today's refined
5kvy | 247
8wop | barbarian could find in such a procedure only the suspicion that it is a device to sell him more copies of a book!
vcpg | It will be noticed from the foregoing material that our study methods are just as much concerned with matters of little-known fact as they are with psychological factors which people know but do not apply. This is why the curriculum of a School requires all- round attention to the needs of the teaching, the material taught, the students and the teacher.
ij2y | Rumi teaches of the use of books in a book (The Diwan of Shams-i-Tabriz) where he denounces books as a source of wisdom. They are, as in the case of the one which he is writing at that moment, instrumental:
w7j4 | The Man of God is a wise one by means of Truth:
q8xw | The Man of God is no lawyer from a book ...
1m55 | Literary passages, teaching instruments, may need much time and various experiences before they exercise their true potential effect upon the human being. In his Ruh al-Quds (Spirit of the Holy), Ibn Arabi tells how he was taught through a quotation from the Koran given him by Abu-Abdullah of Ronda, in Spain. This great Sufi, who had many extrasensory abilities, chose a passage and asked Ibn Arabi what it meant. The latter did not answer him, but when the meaning came to him he found Abu- Abdullah again and told him the answer. This was four years later. In conventional temporal terms, therefore, this one lesson had occupied four years. Since we have started publishing books of Sufi tales and encounters this kind of reaction has become more and more frequent from readers of the books: those, that is, who are not so impatient that they abandon the study as soon as it yields no immediate results of the kind which they demand of it.
2zaa | And, as Kalabadhi says in his Taaruf:
4iwf | Patience is to be patient with patience.
grmv | Q: Should we not familiarise ourselves with all Rumi's work, especially as so much of it is now translated into English and other Western languages?
mrk0 | 248
bash | A: You should note that Rumi is talking to a specific audience. How do you know which part of what he says refers to YOU? In case of the extracts from the Koran which he uses so exten- sively. you can see that he is using them as a 'given', as you would use say, mathematical formulae. That is to say, he is talking to a community which accepts these extracts as literally and figuratively
xseo | This enables him to stress certain points and to drive home others. Dealing with a contemporary audience which either rejects these passages, or challenges them, or wants to analyse them, we cannot use them as our 'givens'. We have, instead, to refer to psychological data accepted by our constituency, and this is what we do. Doing otherwise would vitiate the value of Rumi's work as a whole. He, in turn, did exactly the same thing with the materials which he built into his writings.

gvhw | Decline in Religious Influence
4ta1 | Q: Reading Sufi writings by the classical authors seems to show that there is a clear distinction drawn between religion and obsession. Is failure to observe this distinction the cause of current religious decline?
jokf | A: The decline in the influence of religion has been due, in the main, not to religion itself, but to the very shallowness of many practitioners. People who are indoctrinated and mistake im- planted obsession for faith, are themselves destroyers of the very thing which they imagine themselves called upon to try to protect.
x0bn | In fact, of course, they have no such call: and their capacity to protect something which is other than their imaginings makes for a comical situation.
049a | What many people call religion (which is heavily admixed with self-deception, until it discovers the difference between inculcated belief and something else which might be called real faith) remains at a primitive stage of existence, and cannot really expect any serious consideration from people who are accustomed to thinking in the terms of thought outside it: terms which have long ago purged themselves of the grosser elements. Remember, sophis- ticated arguments and the ability to play with words do not add up to an advanced form of thought, only a cunning one.
ebc8 | Dedicated religionists such as we commonly meet are, of course, no more religious than an atheist. They are crude emotionalists who happen to have adopted religion as the field of their opera- tions. Religion is their medium of action and expression: not the basis of their behaviour.
idjw | In this respect they resemble more than anything else the political, economic or other cult-enthusiasts who are a psychologi- cal and social phenomenon, not a religious one.
6561 | Anyone who knows more and discusses 'religion' with such people would be like an astronomer discussing astrology with a star-worshipper.
2hrf | 250
mpyx | For this reason the regeneration of religion would come from people whom we would not always readily associate with 'religion' as we know it.
qlzy | This principle is well known in other fields: where, for instance, great inventions come from the untechnical; since the main-line scientist and technologist has become obsessed with his field and its dogmas. Yesterday's dogmas are tomorrow's impossibilities.
sa6v | In traditional terms, this is the condition of looking at the chrysalis when one should look at the butterfly: and also at the whole range of development, from egg to grub to chrysalis to butterfly.
gneb | I fancy -1 certainly hope - that when people say, as so many do, that 'Christianity has not failed: it just has not ever been tried out' they mean that only the obsessionality or scholasticism have been tried. And if it has not been tried, might I enquire: When do we start?
1oqy | Remember, the first Persian book on Sufism-Hujwiri's, says:
opno | 'The worst man is the one who is imagined to be serving God, but in reality is not: the noblest is the one imagined not to be a devotee of God, who really is such.'
0ahx | The cause of religious decline is that so few people have the opportunity of the alternative to implanted obsession-a frail thing - represented by the faith which comes through experience. The Sufi Muhammad ibn Khafif said: 'Faith is believing in the heart in the knowledge which comes from the Unseen'. He did not say that it was believing in something said to one, or drilled into one, or admitted at moments of excitement and consequently becoming part of a fixation.
x5cc | WHY HE IS STILL NORMAL
c7cg | There is a wry joke in the East, aimed at stressing how the decline in religion is due to the ineptitude and sometimes worse of the practitioner, especially at the supposedly higher level of the activity. Like a cartoon, it is deliberately over-emphasised, to make the point:
fiyl | A spiritual teacher is saying:
yz7j | 'My first disciple was so weak that the exercises killed him. My
wsee | 251
ilgr | second drove himself mad by doing his meditations too concentratedly. My third pupil became dulled by contemplation. But the fourth is still completely normal.'
hrx3 | Someone asked: 'Why is that?'
na9n | 'It could be', said the guru, 'because he refuses to do the exercises ... '
8k3d | 252
agug | Why cant we have a British Karakul Lamb?
mkb4 | Karakul, sometimes known as Persian lamb, is the fur of a sheep which has for ages flourished in Central Asia, notably in Afghani- stan. More recently, attempts have been made to rear the Karakul sheep in South-West Africa, and their skins are marketed as 'South-West African Karakul'.
06qs | Because of nutritional and environmental factors, there is a difference.
cdth | Experts and others can tell the difference between the two kinds of skin.
evax | There are many reasons why we cannot grow a Karakul sheep- skin in Britain, in spite of the fact that there is a demand for them.
gen4 | But the fact that they are brought into this country from outside does not decrease the demand. On the contrary, it probably increases it. It certainly increases the price.
2wtm | If anyone were to say: 'Why can we not have a British Karakul skin?' the foregoing remarks would probably be what he would be told by an expert-
ib53 | Suppose we use this example to illustrate, however partially, my remarks that something which belongs to one culture should not-in the metaphysical sphere-be imported into another? Am I not importing something from another culture, or even series of cultures?
0kr1 | It must immediately be noted that the relevant factor here is whether the import belongs uniquely to the culture from which it was imported, or whether it does not.
58mo | If I import a habit, like wearing sandals, from Greece, where it is hot to Greenland where it is cold, I am doing the wrong sort of importing. If, on the other hand, I import something of use, like wool, from a place where it grows to a place where it can be used, I am probably doing something useful.
1ghh | 253
643d | It is a sad commentary on the primitive state of thinking upon this matter that people try to safeguard their existing ways by excluding things which are of use and including things which are useless.
58a9 | The difficulty on the part of the ordinary man to know what is useful and what is merely secondary, cultural material, is in part due to his impatience and greed - he wants anything that might be useful, (or is attractive) in part due to the fact that nobody has told him the elementary fact that certain things arc not only useful but essential imports, and partly due to the fear that something brought into his life or thinking from another source might not suit him.
