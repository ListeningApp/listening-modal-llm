        "content": "s0fl | A long-elusive path for the potential release of viral RNA products from DMV interiors was provided when cryo-EM tomography revealed a sixfold symmetrical pore that spans both DMV membranes and contains nsp3, the largest coronavirus RNA replication factor. This coronavirus channel or crown parallels the crowns previously recognized on spherule RCs in being a ringed complex of viral RNA replication factors that gates cytosolic release of viral RNA products and may assist in guiding their synthesis. Both the cytosolic and luminal portions of this coronavirus crown appear to interact with other viral and cellular factors. Potential luminal interactions with other viral RNA synthesis factors could help to coordinate synthesis and release of RNA replication and transcription products. On the crown's cytosolic side, nsp3's ubiquitin-like N terminus interacts with viral RNA and nucleocapsid protein, greatly enhancing RNA replication, likely by facilitating RNA delivery to the RC. As addressed below, in later infection these same nsp3/nucleocapsid interactions may guide encapsidation of progeny genomic RNA.\n43ia | Three point two. Picornaviruses, Hepaciviruses, and Noroviruses\n3g2y | Picornaviruses are a large family of human and animal viruses that include poliovirus; rhinoviruses A, B, and C; hepatitis A virus; and many others. Like flaviviruses, picornaviruses express a single polyprotein processed by virus-encoded proteases into structural and nonstructural proteins. The nonstructural RNA replication proteins include the two A protease and three C protease, two C NTPase, RNA synthesis primer three B V P g, and three D Pol Rd Rp. Domains conserved with two C NTPase, three B/V P g primer, three C protease, and three D Pol are shared by a superfamily of picornavirus-like viruses spanning vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant hosts. Within this superfamily, the\ngc7v | functions of these conserved domains and RNA replication generally have been studied best in poliovirus.\nwqfv | Membrane association of picornavirus RNA replication proteins is mediated through two B, two C, and three A, which are sufficient to induce DMVs. Picornavirus-infected cells undergo extensive reorganization of ER, Golgi, and lysosomal membranes to initially produce single-membrane-bounded tubules that are progressively converted into double-membrane or multi-lamellar structures by flattening, curving, and fusing single-membrane tubules. Viral RNA replication proteins, dsRNA, and, most importantly, Br-rUTP labeling of newly synthesized RNA were all associated with both single- and double-membrane structures, suggesting that the nature of active picornavirus RCs may be dynamic. A possible picornavirus connection to coronavirus crowns is suggested by features of viral protein two C: Like coronavirus crown constituent nsp3, picornavirus two C is a crucial, conserved RNA replication factor that binds membranes, helps to induce DMV formation, and forms hexamers.\nj30a | As noted above, HCV differs from most spherule RC-forming Flaviviridae in generating some closed single-membrane vesicles, particularly early in infection, and larger numbers of approximately one hundred fifty- to three hundred-nanometer DMVs later in infection. As with coronaviruses and picornaviruses, HCV DMVs appear linked with RNA replication because their emergence matches RNA replication kinetics, they label with antibodies to dsRNA, and they are induced by and contain HCV RNA replication factor NS5A. As considered further below, the ability of similar Flaviviridae genomes to give rise to either spherule RCs (dengue virus and other flaviviruses) or DMV RCs (HCV) has potential implications for the structural, functional, and potentially evolutionary relation of spherules and DMVs.\n7bdk | Finally, similar to picornaviruses and hepaciviruses, noroviruses induce a progression from ER-linked single-membrane to double-membrane and even multi-lamellar vesicles. Similar structures were induced by norovirus nonstructural protein NS4 and modulated by NS1-2 and NS3. Further work is needed to define the functions of these varied compartments in norovirus replication.\nfim0 | Four. FURTHER MECHANISTIC IMPLICATIONS\nojro | Four point one. Functional Parallels and Potential Evolutionary Links Across Viruses\nl6t9 | The RC findings summarized here reveal parallels among and beyond positive RNA viruses, suggesting or in some cases enriching potential underlying evolutionary connections. Spherule and DMV RCs were previously viewed as disparate structures, but the presence of crown-like rings of viral RNA replication proteins serving as product RNA release channels provides unifying links between them. As shown in Figure Four, the topological similarity or difference between these structures ultimately reduces to the detailed contacts of each crown with two membrane sheets: for spherules, the outer organellar membrane and inner vesicle membrane; for DMVs, the outer and inner vesicle membranes. While interpretive schematics such as Figure Four tend to emphasize continuity of the membranes interacting with nodaviral crowns on spherule RCs and separation of membranes interacting with coronavirus crowns on DMVs, these membranes may not be purely continuous or discontinuous in either structure. In particular, the spherule membranes interacting with nodavirus crowns are heavily disrupted by insertion of the crown's hydrophobic anchors, such that many lipids interact with crown proteins rather than other lipids. Similarly, for coronavirus crowns, as imaging resolution advances it will be of great interest to determine if interactions with crown proteins lead to any approach or contact between lipids in the inner and outer membranes.\n1ujy | Crown structures embodying such mixed lipid-lipid and lipid-protein interactions at crown-membrane interfaces might represent evolutionary intermediates linking positive RNA viruses employing spherule and DMV RCs. As noted earlier, one such evolutionary connection appears implicit within the Flaviviridae because flaviviruses and hepaciviruses use highly similar suites of RNA replication genes to generate spherules and DMVs, respectively. Further similar connections seem likely to emerge as phylogenetic gaps are filled by accelerating virus discovery.\nqzor | At a higher level, similarities have been noted between intracellular positive RNA virus RCs and certain types of virions. Most notably, positive RNA virus RCs parallel the cores of dsRNA virus and retrovirus virions: Through these structures, each virus replicates its genome through an mRNA intermediate that is sequestered with its polymerase in a virus-induced membrane or protein compartment for negative-strand synthesis.",
