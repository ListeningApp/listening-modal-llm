The open ball of radius R around X is denoted by B left parenthesis x comma R right parenthesis triangleq left brace z in R super d such that double vert z minus x double vert less than R right brace. The inequalities, greater than or equal to and less than or equal to, are often applied element-wise. Big-O complexity is denoted by script O with hidden log- arithmic factors indicated by tilde script C. Denote components of vectors by superscript and iteration counters as subscripts, e.g., x sub k super i is i super th component of the k super th iterate of x. As a natural extension, a set of indices in the superscript de- notes the subvector corresponding to those components, e.g., letting left bracket d right bracket equals left brace one comma ellipsis comma d right brace, if script I is subseteq left bracket d right bracket and v in R super d then v super script I equals left parenthesis v super i mid i in script I right parenthesis in R super absolute value script I absolute value. Let g left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals nabla f left parenthesis x right parenthesis and H left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals nabla super two f left parenthesis x right parenthesis denote the gradient and Hessian of f, respectively. Denote the dk-active and &k-inactive sets, respectively, by\nvwkw | script A left parenthesis x sub k comma delta sub k right parenthesis equals left brace i in left bracket d right bracket such that zero less than or equal to x sub k super i less than or equal to delta sub k right brace, (two a)\ntutj | script I left parenthesis x sub k comma delta sub k right parenthesis equals left brace i in left bracket d right bracket mid x sub k super i greater than delta sub k right brace. (two b)\nxclk | When the context is clear, we suppress the dependence on X sub k and delta sub k, e.g., g sub k and H sub k for g left parenthesis x sub k right parenthesis and H left parenthesis x sub k right parenthesis and x sub k super script I or x sub k super script I sub k instead of x sub k super script I left parenthesis x sub k comma delta sub k right parenthesis. We also denote\npah4 | H sub k super script I equals left brace left parenthesis H sub k right parenthesis sub i j mid i comma j in right. left. script I left parenthesis x sub k comma delta sub k right parenthesis right brace. Two. Background and Related Work\n2avs | We now briefly review related works for solving one and some essential background necessary for our presentation.\nd0nn | First-order Methods. The projected gradient method is among the simplest techniques for solving optimisation problems involving convex constraints. Indeed, the projected gradient iteration for minimisation over a convex set Omega is simply given by x sub k plus one equals script P sub Omega left parenthesis x sub k minus alpha sub k g sub k right parenthesis where script P sub Omega colon R super d right arrow R super d is the orthogonal projection onto Omega defined by script P sub Omega left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals arg min sub z in Omega double vert z minus x double vert. When alpha sub k is chosen appropriately, e.g., via line search, the projected gradient method is known to converge under essentially the same conditions and at the same rate as the unconstrained variant. Many variations of this method have also been considered, e.g., spectral projected gradient, proximal gradient, and accelerated proximal gradient with its extensions to non-convex settings.\n```",
