        "content": "uc9r | Gaq has also been found to play diverse roles in the immune system, where Gaq has been implicated to have a tumor suppressive role. Loss of GNAQ expression enhances both B and T cell proliferation in vivo and survival in vitro. Strikingly, alteration of the Gaq pathway by loss of Gaq expression or recurrent loss of function mutations at T ninety-six S or Y one hundred one, are found in roughly twenty-five percent of natural killer/T cell lymphoma, a malignant and highly aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Consistent with the impact of Gaq loss in other immune cells, NK-specific knockout of Gaq in mice imparted an intrinsic survival advantage of NK cells as compared to wild type NK cells. Moreover, expression of WT Gaq in Gaq-low NK cell lines promoted apoptosis, which could be ablated by concomitant expression of T ninety-six S Gaq suggesting T ninety-six S Gaq acts as a dominant negative mutant to promote NK cell tumorigenicity. The proclivity of R one hundred eighty-three and Q two hundred nine hotspot mutations in Gaq to solid tumors compared to the incidence of T ninety-six and Y one hundred one in hematopoietic malignancies suggests a complex relationship between the oncogenic or tumor suppressive function of these mutations and the cell context in which they originate, highlighting the complex molecular events underlying Gaq-driven oncogenic signalling.\nl0ap | Signalling through Gas in cancer- The GNAS oncogene\nx815 | GNAS, encoding the Gas protein, is among the most frequently mutated G proteins in human cancer. Mutation characterization across tumor types has revealed that GNAS is mutated in approximately five percent of sequenced tumors, enriched in appendix cancers (seventy percent), pituitary tumors (twenty-seven percent). Across TCGA, GNAS is most frequently mutated in endometrial carcinomas (seven point three percent), stomach adenocarcinomas (five point seven percent), adrenocortical carcinomas (five point five percent), pancreatic adenocarcinomas (five point six percent), esophageal carcinomas (four point nine percent) and colorectal cancers (four point seven percent). The majority of Gas mutations occur at a hotspot residue (R two hundred one), resulting in expression of a constitutively active, GTPase defective form of the Gas protein. A secondary hotspot can be found at Q two hundred twenty-seven but is less prevalent than R two hundred one mutants. The functional significance of the R two hundred one residue was first suggested from studies examining the mechanism of action of cholera toxin. It was revealed that cholera toxin ADP-ribosylates R two hundred one of Gas, irreversibly inhibiting its GTPase\nepbj | activity, and resulting in its activation. Crystallographic studies of Gas have since confirmed that the R two hundred one residue lies in its GTP-binding pocket and facilitates GTP hydrolysis.\nnmn2 | Activation of Gas, either by stimulation of Gas-coupled GPCRs or by activating mutations, stimulates adenylyl cyclases, which leads to the production of cAMP and activation of protein kinase A and subsequent signalling events. The tumorigenic effects of Gas were first demonstrated in a subset of growth hormone-secreting pituitary tumors harbouring R two hundred one C/H mutations. In these tumors, persistent signalling driven by mutant Gas bypassed the canonical requirement for stimulation by growth hormone, resulting in hormone-insensitive growth. Indeed, the Gas subfamily is mutated in nearly seven percent of adrenocortical carcinomas in TCGA. Activation of the Gas pathway has been shown to cause numerous other syndromes with involvement of endocrine dysfunction including McCune-Albright syndrome, which is also characterized by fibrous dysplasia of the bone, in addition to Cushing's syndrome, Carney complex, and micronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia.\ng3tm | Strikingly, our recent study found that there is widespread activation of the Gas pathway across a large proportion of cancer types in TCGA with a remarkable enrichment in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. Consistent with this, the Gas subfamily is mutated in five point two four percent of colorectal, five point zero three percent of pancreatic and five point nine six percent of stomach adenocarcinomas. Indeed, both GNAS and GNAL are significantly mutated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (MutSig2CV q-values equals nine point five six times ten raised to negative four, and one point seven seven times ten raised to negative two respectively). Remarkably, greater than fifty percent of colorectal cancer patients have aberrant activation of the Gs pathway, including activating mutation or gene amplification of GNAS, or in downstream effectors of Gas including protein kinase A, and adenylyl cyclases, as well as by the activation of prostaglandin E2 receptors, which are coupled to Gs, by inflammatory prostaglandins accumulating locally due to COX2 overexpression. These genetic alterations and autocrine activation play a central role in the deregulation and activation of the PKA, Wnt and MAPK pathways in the intestinal epithelium and are likely to contribute to tumorigenesis and colorectal cancer progression.\ntfra | Interestingly, many Gas mutant cancers have been found to be highly mucinous. Aligned with this, GNAS expression has been found to induce expression of mucin genes. In particular, GNAS mutations are highly prevalent in gastrointestinal mucinous neoplasms, including intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, an invasive pancreatic cystic neoplasm that can\n5lm9 | advance to pancreatic adenocarcinoma, as well as appendiceal mucinous tumors where signalling driven by Gas has been found to play a critical role.\nwp2c | Gas, and Gas-driven signalling also plays a critical role in stem cell populations, where it has been found to suppress self-renewal. In contrast to the pro-oncogenic effects of GOF mutations in Gas, in some stem-like cell states, Gas has a tumor suppressive role where LOF mutations, or Gas deletion has been found to drive tumor initiation and progression by de-repression of the Sonic Hedgehog and Hippo pathways. In particular, the loss of GNAS, or low Gas expression is tightly linked to poor overall survival in a subset of aggressive medulloblastomas with alterations and activation of SHH signalling, and in neuroblastoma. Strikingly, deletion of GNAS in neural stem/progenitor cells consistently leads to medulloblastoma-like tumors in mice by derepressing SHH signalling thus contributing to the development and malignancy of SHH-associated medulloblastoma tumors. In epidermal and hair follicle progenitor cell populations, conditional deletion of Gas leads to rapid formation of basal cell carcinoma by repressing PKA-mediated inhibition of SHH and YAP signalling. Of note, activation of Gas in epithelial stem cells leads to exhaustion of hair follicle stem cells and subsequent hair loss, demonstrating the cell-context specific impact of Gas signalling.\nus5v | Mutations in genes encoding Gai/o proteins in cancer\nrs2m | Pente",
