You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0bqy | 8 SUMMARY
b780 | In this paper, we have found the bounds on the parameters <LATEX>H _ { 0 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>q</LATEX> of the power-law cosmology. The numerical results are summarized in Table 1.
ccmb | Some key observations are as follows:
ma93 | (i) The constraints on the deceleration parameter <LATEX>q</LATEX> clearly indicate that the astronomical observations of <LATEX>H \left( z \right)</LATEX> and SNe Ia predict the cosmic acceleration within the framework of power-law cosmology. Thus, power-law cosmological models are viable for describing the observed accelerating nature of Universe.
c6hh | (ii) We see that the estimates of Hubble constant in power- law cosmology are in close agreement with independent in- vestigations of <LATEX>H _ { 0 }</LATEX> carried out in literature (Freedman et al. 2001; Suyu et al. 2010; Jarosik et al. 2010; Riess et al. 2011; Beutler et al. 2011) as discussed in Section 1.
y7ea | (iii) The derived best-fitting model fits well to the observa- tional data points from <LATEX>H \left( z \right)</LATEX> and SNe Ia observations (see Figs 4 and 5).
nav4 | (iv) The primordial nucleosynthesis demands a decelerat- ing expansion of the Universe with smaller values of Hubble constant.
gem8 | (v) The statefinder analysis shows that power-law cosmo- logical models approach the standard ACDM model in fu- ture (see Fig. 6) with varying values of q.
e8nr | We see that the power-law cosmology turns out viable in the description of the acceleration of present-day Universe when subjected to recent observations of H (z) and SNe Ia. Also the Hubble constant within the framework of power- law cosmology falls in the range of observations. However, the power-law cosmology fails to produce primordial nucle- osytheis with the values of q and H0 estimated from obser- vational data of H(z) and SNe Ia as discussed in Section 6. Moreover, because of the constant value of deceleration pa- rameter q in power-law cosmology, it fails to provide time or redshift based transition of the Universe from deceleration to acceleration. Thus, one has to use different values of q for the description of Universe at different epochs. Finally, despite having several useful features, the power-law cosmol- ogy is not a complete package for cosmological purposes.
