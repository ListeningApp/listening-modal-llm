You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

1o7p | Note that Chimera can be generalized to combine more than two pipelines (will be discussed in Section 3.6), which further reduces the bubbles and balances the activations memory consumption, but at a cost of higher communication overhead and weights memory consumption.
cp13 | 3.2 Communication Scheme
bgre | Chimera uses <LATEX>p 2 p</LATEX> (point-to-point) communication to transfer the intermediate activations and gradients (with respect to the inputs) between pipeline stages in the forward pass and the backward pass, respectively. Since Chimera combines bidirectional pipelines together, collective communication (i.e., allreduce) is used to syn- chronize the weight gradients across stage replicas before the next training iteration. Figure 4(a) presents a simple way for gradient synchronization, namely synchronizing the gradients for each stage maintained by the workers after all the local computation of the current iteration is finished. Note that the gradient synchronization for the middle stages is partially overlapped by the computation on the beginning and the end stages.
57lp | For a deeper communication overlap, we launch allreduce ea- gerly by utilizing the bubbles in the pipeline. Taking P0 and P3 in Figure 4(b) as an example, after these two workers finish the backward passes on micro-batch 3 and micro-batch 1, respectively, the calculation for the weight gradients of stage3 has been finished; therefore, P0 and P3 can launch an asynchronous allreduce using nonblocking collectives [23, 25] to synchronize the gradients of stage3 as soon as they are finished, and a wait operation is called after all the local computation to make sure the allreduce is finished. <LATEX>\begin{array}{} \text { In this way. } \\ \text { by the bubb } \end{array} ,</LATEX> the gradient synchronization for stage3 is overlapped and the following computation. However, unlike PO and P3, we choose not to conduct eager gradient synchronization for stage2 (a middle stage) on <LATEX>P 1</LATEX> and P2, since there is no bubble from the completion of stage2's gradients to the end of local com- putation. Although the asynchronous communication may proceed while the computation happens, it may cause additional overheads (initialization, threading etc. [24]), which could extend the critical path of the pipeline and jeopardize the overall performance. Perfor- mance modelling of the communication scheme will be presented in Section 3.4.
ukth | <LATEX>\left( W = 2 , D = 4 \right) .</LATEX> 3.3 Hybrid of Pipeline and Data Parallelism
kpvt | Chimera supports a hybrid of pipeline and data parallelism. The bidirectional pipelines of Chimera are replicated <LATEX>W</LATEX> times to scale to <LATEX>W \cdot D</LATEX> workers. Since we consider the large models which can be easily partitioned into balanced stages, all <LATEX>D</LATEX> stages are equally replicated <LATEX>W</LATEX> times in hybrid parallelism. When scaling to the par- allel machines equipped with high performance interconnected networks (such as Infiniband [50], Cray Aries [2] or Slingshot [48], and NVLink [18]), hybrid parallelism usually achieves better perfor- mance than the pure pipeline parallelism [16, 39]. This is because pure pipeline parallelism has <LATEX>W \cdot D</LATEX> stages in the pipeline, while hybrid parallelism has <LATEX>D</LATEX> stages (W times less) which helps to re- duce the <LATEX>p 2 p</LATEX> communication overhead between stages and increase the computation workload of each stage. Although hybrid paral- lelism leads to gradient synchronization between stage replicas, the overhead of it can be alleviated by the aforementioned high performance interconnected networks. However, as <LATEX>W</LATEX> increases (D decreases), pipeline stages become coarser, until at some point the increased gradient synchronization overhead cannot be amor- tized by the reduced <LATEX>p 2 p</LATEX> communication overhead. Therefore, it is important to find the sweet spot to achieve the best performance.
jie2 | synchronized does not change, but the number of processes partici- pating in the gradient synchronization increases by <LATEX>W</LATEX> times. Also, we use the same communication scheme as discussed in Section 3.2 to overlap the gradient synchronization overhead in hybrid par- allelism. In the next section we will discuss how to find the best configuration of <LATEX>W</LATEX> and <LATEX>D</LATEX> based on performance modelling.
d0ik | 3.4 Configuration Selection Based on Performance Modelling
0x0s | Given the mini-batch size <LATEX>\widehat { B }</LATEX> and the number of workers P, the configuration of <LATEX>B ,</LATEX> <LATEX>W ,</LATEX> and D largely affects the training throughput.
4exe | Larger micro-batch size (B) usually improves the computational efficiency of the accelerators. Since Chimera greatly alleviates the bubble problem, it greedily chooses to use the maximum micro- batch size fitting in the device memory. Compared with the exist- ing synchronous pipeline approaches which have to consider the trade-off between bubble and computational efficiency, the greedy strategy of Chimera significantly reduces the tuning space.
0myz | To select the best configuration of <LATEX>W</LATEX> and <LATEX>D ,</LATEX> we build a perfor- mance model to predict the runtime of a single training iteration (represented by <LATEX>\left. T \right)</LATEX> for each available configuration. For the compu-

We define the critical path as a series of pipeline stages with dependency that determine the overall computation overhead of a single training iteration. An example of critical path is shown in Figure 6. Let <LATEX>C _ { f }</LATEX> and <LATEX>C _ { b }</LATEX> denote the number of forward passes and backward passes on the critical path of the pipeline, respectively. For the example shown in Figure 6, <LATEX>C _ { f } = 6</LATEX> <LATEX>C _ { b } = 1 0 .</LATEX> The total computation overhead is
