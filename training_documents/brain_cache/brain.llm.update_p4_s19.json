Whole brain analysis\nwwdt | Exploratory analysis of the entire brain (paired T-test in SPM five) revealed four clusters with significantly greater gray matter concentration at the Post compared with the Pre time-point in the MBSR group. One cluster was located in the posterior\nmn1r | P-values are corrected for multiple comparisons for the whole brain.\n5vqw | cingulate cortex, one in the left temporoparietal junction, and two clusters were located in the cerebellum. One of the two clusters identified in the cerebellum was centered in the vermis and extended into the brainstem, encompassing several pontine nuclei in the brainstem. The second cerebellar cluster was located more laterally, including parts of the left lobule Ten and Eight, i.e., lateral parts of the posterior and flocculonodular lobe. No regions showed a significant decrease in gray matter concentration following the MBSR intervention.\nmeyw | For each of the four clusters, the averaged values were then extracted for each individual and each time-point using the Marsbar toolbox, and repeated measures ANOVAs (two groups by two time-points), with age and gender entered as nuisance variables, were performed in SPSS. Group by time interactions were significant for all four regions, indicating that increases in gray matter concentration were significantly greater in the MBSR than in the control group: PCC (F one, twenty-nine equals fifty point one two four; P is less than zero point zero zero one), TPJ (F one, twenty-nine equals eleven point four five six; P equals zero point zero zero two), cerebellar vermis/brainstem (F one, twenty-nine equals eleven point two nine two; P equals zero point zero zero two), lateral cerebellum\n2e62 | (F one, twenty-nine equals nine point eight zero six; P equals zero point zero zero four). Change in gray matter concentration in the control group was not significant for the clusters in the TPJ (t sixteen equals negative zero point eight seven; P equals zero point four zero), cerebellar vermis (t sixteen equals negative zero point one five; P equals zero point eight eight), or lateral cerebellum (t sixteen equals zero point two seven three; P equals zero point seven nine), but there was a decrease in the PCC cluster (t sixteen equals negative four point one two one; P equals zero point zero zero one). Independent sample t-tests (with equal variances) at the Pre time-point indicated that the groups did not differ in gray matter concentration in the PCC (t thirty-one equals zero point two four; P equals zero point eight one), TPJ (t thirty-one equals zero point eight five; P equals zero point four zero) and the lateral cerebellum (t thirty-one equals negative one point four one; P equals zero point one seven), but the control group had greater gray matter concentration in the cerebellar vermis cluster (t thirty-one equals two point eight four; P equals zero point zero zero eight). The amount of homework practice and the change in mindfulness scores (FFMQ) were not correlated with changes in the identified clusters. Furthermore, we performed a paired t-test within the control group in SPM five and applied the same thresholds. No significant clusters were identified to increase or decrease in gray matter concentration from Pre to Post in the control group. To summarize, exploratory analyses identified increases in gray matter\n75y3 | concentration in regions in the PCC, TPJ, and cerebellum in the MBSR, but not the control group over the eight-week period, suggesting that participation in an MBSR course causes structural changes in these brain regions.\ns2g2 | Four. Discussion\nq1q2 | This study demonstrates longitudinal changes in brain gray matter concentration following an eight-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction course compared with a control group. Hypothesized increases in gray matter concentration within the left hippocampus were confirmed. Exploratory whole brain analyses identified significant increases in gray matter concentration in the PCC, TPJ, and the cerebellum.\ncb7r | The hippocampus has been postulated to play a central role in mediating some of the benefits of meditation, due to its involvement in\n68xu | the modulation of cortical arousal and responsiveness, and morphological differences between meditators and non-meditators in the hippocampus have previously been reported. The hippocampus also contributes to the regulation of emotion, and the structural changes in this area following mindfulness practice may reflect improved function in regulating emotional responding. In contrast to these increases, several pathological conditions (e.g., major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder) are associated with decreased density or volume of the hippocampus. And while the precise mechanisms of hippocampal volume decrease are not known, a number of factors such as neuronal loss through chronic hypercortisolism, glial cell loss, stress-induced reduction in neurotrophic factors, or stress-induced reduction in neurogenesis may contribute to this. Furthermore, smaller hippocampi have also been",
