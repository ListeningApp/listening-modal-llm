You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

bf9k | With regard to the individual consumption level, the MPE indicates that at various levels of income and inequality dis- tribution, individuals' propensities to consume more polluting goods differ due to the change in the patterns of consumption level (Ravallion et al. 2000; Borghesi 2006; Grunewald et al. 2012; Jorgenson et al. 2017). Hence, Jorgenson et al. (2017) declared that consumption level was the key factor influencing the MPE. However, there is not a single hypothesis analysing the inequality influence on consumption-based CO2 emis- sions. The main condition of the changes in income inequality affecting the consumption-based carbon emissions depends

ibgs | on the MPE ratio between materially wealthy and poor people. If poor people's MPE is bigger than that of the wealthy, an increase in inequality reduces CO2 emissions (Ravallion et al. 2000; Liu et al. 2019a; Heerink et al. 2001; HÃ¼bler 2017). Authors as Baloch et al. (2018), Hao et al. (2016), and Magnani (2000) assumed that due to higher prices resulting from environmentally friendly production, the poorest people cannot afford to buy any of these products. Furthermore, these people are not inclined to choose to use renewable electricity. Moreover, larger income distribution would decrease individ- uals' environmental concern (Baloch et al. 2018), and vice versa, the environmental quality is more important for rich people and they have higher environmental concern (Scruggs 1998; Heerink et al. 2001; Zhang and Zhao. 2014; Kashwan 2017; Wolde-Rufael and Idowu 2017). The assump- tion that the MPE is bigger if compared with richer countries corresponds to the Keynesian model when lower-income in- dividuals, rather than higher income, have a higher marginal tendency to consume, so the growth of inequality reduces the income of the poor and decreases the emissions (Jorgenson et al. 2017). A large number of authors identified that the MPE falls with the level of income (Grunewald et al. 2012, 2017; Jakob et al. 2014; Serino and Klasen 2015; Grunewald et al. 2017). Meanwhile, if low-income individuals have a lower level of MPE than the high income, the growth of income inequality raises CO2 emissions (Mader 2018). Islam (2015), Kasuga and Takaya (2017), Baloch et al. (2018) and Jorgenson et al. (2019) declared that due to different consump- tion levels, the rich people more negatively influence environ- mental impact than the poor individuals. Furthermore, accord- ing to Berthe and Elie (2015), the rich people are not neces- sarily pro-environmentally friendly, and they are not willing to assume the responsibility and the costs of environmental is- sues (Wolde-Rufael and Idowu 2017). Therefore, the reduc- tion of income inequality is shown to reduce consumption- based carbon pollution, which suggests that the reduction of income inequality and CO2 emissions can be achieved simul- taneously (Golley and Meng 2012). In other case, when the income inequality is more balanced, the consumption of more polluting goods increases due to the shift of poor people to the middle class (e.g. Heerink et al. 2001; Borghesi 2006; Grunewald et al. 2017; Charfeddine and Mrabet 2017; Liu et al. 2019). Hence, inequality can raise the middle social groups' willingness to achieve the superior (wealthy) social group's patterns of consumption ("Veblen effect"), causing greater environmental impact by increasing the consumption level (Berthe and Elie 2015).
colo | Insignificant relationship between inequality and pollution reveals that when income becomes more equally distributed, the individuals from the poor class will increase their con- sumption of energy and other polluting products as they trans- fer to the middle class. Thus, when the three classes of indi- viduals (poor, middle and rich) are considered, the relationship

9mrz | between inequality and environmental pollution may not be linear. The propensity to emit may rise and then descend, which causes the curvilinear link between inequality and en- vironmental pollution (Jorgenson et al. 2017). Furthermore, constant emission intensity across the income classes would reveal that any income redistribution would have an insignif- icant or no impact on consumption-based emissions (Golley and Meng 2012). In conclusion, the possible influence of in- equality on environmental pollution via individual behaviours depends on MPE and changes in the social norms (Berthe and Elie 2015).
pk06 | Conclusions
7wn9 | In recent decades, the environmental research has paid much attention to the analysis whether the reduction of income in- equality and pollution related to climate change could be achieved simultaneously. By reviewing the selected papers published from 2001 to 2019, where these experts empirically evaluated the impact of inequality on carbon emissions, the author of the present article identified that the links between inequality and CO2 emissions were different in developing and developed countries. The different results reveal that the role of inequality on CO2 pollution is quite versatile. Referring to Kuznets curve, which was applied for both income inequal- ity and environmental quality, it was assumed that the afore- mentioned different results could derive from the different trajectories of Kuznets curve. Therefore, if countries trace the same trajectory of Kuznets curve, a positive impact of inequality on environmental impact is observed. If environ- mental impact matches the right side of the EKC but income inequality has not reached the turn point at the same economic development level and stays on the left side of Kuznets curve, a negative relationship between the level of inequality and pollution is recognized. The negative relationship between inequality and CO2 emissions is observed when the U- shaped trajectory of one variable occurs instead of the inverted U-shape. An insignificant relationship could be observed when the country's pollution or inequality level matches the turn point. These Kuznets curve trajectory differences depend on the differences of impact channels through which econom- ic development affects inequality and environmental pollu- tion. This paper presented the following four channels: (1) scale, (2) composition, (3) technique and (4) globalization, through which economic development affects both CO2 emis- sions and inequality level.
wcd0 | The majority of authors have analysed theoretical links of inequality impact on CO2 emissions with regard to territorial (or production-based) emissions. This paper suggested to con- sider the production-based and consumption-based emissions separately when analysing the approaches to relationship be- tween inequality and pollution. Therefore, the proposed
caos | theories according to the origin of emissions were distin- guished and new approaches which could explain the influ- ence of income inequality on CO2 emissions were provided.
qrvy | With respect to the production-based emissions, the following approaches were proposed: determination of environmental pol- icies, which could also reveal and explain the leakage phenom- enon, and the channels by the means of which the income in- equality affects CO2 emissions: the scale, composition, technique and globalization effects. Therefore, the income inequality deter- mined changes in working time could be attributed to the scale effect, when income inequality contributes to the increase in working hours and analogically to economic growth and CO2 pollution. The composition effect, conditioned by the growth of income inequality, is related to the industrial decline, which in turn reduces pollution in rich countries. In terms of the technique effect, the high level of inequality negatively affects the spread of innovations, consequently harming the environmental technolo- gies' development. Taking into account the globalization effect, inequality also influences trade and FDI transfers; besides, in- equality can contribute to the decrease or growth of CO2 emis- sions. It depends on whether the trade and FDI enhance or reduce the environmental impact.
pn9j | The following two approaches, namely (i) inequality deter- mined changes in working time (which is related to "Veblen effect") and (ii) individual economic behaviours of house- holds (or individual consumption level), which combine the MPE theory and "Veblen effect", contribute to the explanation of the influence of income inequality on consumption-based emissions. Furthermore, the working time increase does not only contribute to economic growth, but to the consumption increase as well, simultaneously influencing the increase of CO2 emissions. This approach is related to "Veblen effect" when in an unequal society, people from different social clas- ses are more inclined to compare themselves with individuals from a superior social class and mimic their consumption lev- el. With regard to the individual consumption level, it should be noted that the consumption demand is a key factor influencing the MPE. The main condition for the changes in income inequality to affect the consumption-based CO2 emis- sions depends on the MPE ratio of the poor and the wealthy, and changes in social norms. Furthermore, inequality can con- tribute to the growth of middle social groups' willingness to achieve the superior social group's consumption level ("Veblen effect") and, correspondingly, CO2 emissions.
1pmc | Therefore, this paper provides new (revised) approaches explaining the impact of inequality level on separate production-based and consumption-based CO2 emissions. Big hopes are held that in the nearest future, our theoretical considerations regarding these theories will be confirmed or corrected by other experts in the field. This study can also provide new insights for the policy makers concerned to seek the reduction of income inequality and pollution related to climate change.
