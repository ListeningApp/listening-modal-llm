Goodin, with each volume being edited by a distinguished international group of specialists in their respective fields:\n7toz | This series aspires to shape the discipline, not just to report on it.

In our view, political economy is the methodology of economics applied to the analysis of political behavior and institutions. As such, it is not a single, unified approach, but a family of approaches. Because institutions are no longer ignored, but instead are often the subject matter of the investigation, this approach incorporates many of the issues of concern to political sociologists.
