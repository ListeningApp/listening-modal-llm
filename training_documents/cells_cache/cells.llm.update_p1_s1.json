Interestingly, atherosclerosis preferentially develops in curved and branching arterial regions, where endothelial cells are exposed to disturbed blood flow with characteristic low-magnitude oscillatory shear stress. By contrast, straight arterial regions exposed to stable flow, which is associated with high-magnitude, unidirectional shear stress, are relatively well protected from the disease through shear-dependent, atheroprotective endothelial cell responses. Flow potently regulates structural, functional, transcriptomic, epigenomic and metabolic changes in endothelial cells through mechanosensors and mechanosignal transduction pathways. A study using single-cell RNA sequencing and chromatin accessibility analysis in a mouse model of flow-induced atherosclerosis demonstrated that disturbed flow reprogrammes arterial endothelial cells in situ from healthy phenotypes to diseased ones characterized by endothelial inflammation, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, endothelial-to-immune cell-like transition and metabolic changes. In this Review, we discuss this emerging concept of disturbed-flow-induced reprogramming of endothelial cells as a potential pro-atherogenic mechanism. Defining the flow-induced mechanisms through which endothelial cells are reprogrammed to promote atherosclerosis is a crucial area of research that could lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets to combat the high prevalence of atherosclerotic disease.\nsc5y | Review article\n0yab | Introduction\nw95z | Atherosclerosis is a multifactorial and chronic inflammatory disease of the arteries, in which fibrofatty plaques develop in the arterial wall. As advanced plaques develop, the arterial wall stiffens, the arterial lumen narrows and, occasionally, plaques rupture or are eroded, resulting in severe clinical consequences, including myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and peripheral artery disease, which are the leading causes of death worldwide.\n0i1k | Dysfunction and inflammation of endothelial cells have a crucial role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Endothelial cells lining the inner layer of the blood vessels are in direct contact with the blood and become dysfunctional and inflamed in response to various risk factors, such as hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking and ageing, especially at specific atherosclerosis-prone regions associated with disturbed blood flow. At these sites of endothelial inflammation, circulating monocytes bind to endothelial cells and transmigrate into the subendothelial space, differentiating into macrophages. These regions also show increased permeability to circulating LDL cholesterol, which becomes oxidized in the subendothelial space and is ingested by nearby macrophages, thereby promoting foam cell development and triggering a vicious cycle of inflammation and macrophage accumulation. In addition, vascular smooth muscle cells in these regions transdifferentiate into synthetic phenotypes and migrate to the subendothelial layer and proliferate, contributing to arterial wall thickening. In addition, some vascular smooth muscle cells transdifferentiate into foam cells, eventually leading to the formation of fatty streaks and fibrofatty plaques. As atherosclerotic plaques grow outwardly and inwardly, mature and progress, some plaques rupture, causing major cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke.\ndqlg | Although atherosclerotic risk factors such as hypercholesterolaemia, hyperglycemia and hypertension are systemic, plaques\np6pq | preferentially develop in a focal manner in curved and branching regions of the arteries associated with disturbed blood flow. Disturbed flow in these regions is characterized by the delivery of low-magnitude oscillatory shear stress to the endothelial cell surface. Endothelial cells detect various shear stress patterns and magnitudes through mechanosensing receptors, which translate these mechanical cues into cell signalling (mechanosignal transduction) and subsequent structural and functional responses. Advanced omics analyses have demonstrated that flow potently regulates nearly all facets of endothelial cell biology and pathobiology, from individual molecules and genes to structures and functions of the entire cell. Flow regulates endothelial cell transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes at a genome-wide scale in vivo and in vitro, altering endothelial cell function, proliferation, survival and differentiation. Whereas stable blood flow, with the characteristic high-magnitude, unidirectional laminar shear stress observed in straight, non-branching regions of the vasculature, promotes atheroprotective endothelial cell homeostasis, disturbed flow promotes pro-atherogenic endothelial cell responses, including endothelial dysfunction.\nzse6 | Although lipid-lowering drugs such as statins and PCSK ninth inhibitors are highly efficient in reducing blood cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease burden, atherosclerotic diseases continue to be leading causes of death worldwide, highlighting the need for novel anti-atherogenic drugs targeting non-lipid, pro-atherogenic pathways. In this context, the CANTOS trial demonstrated that inhibition of vascular inflammation using the I L one beta inhibitor canakinumab significantly reduced atherothrombotic events in patients with previous myocardial infarction compared with placebo, in a cholesterol-independent manner. Although canakinumab was not approved by the FDA owing to an increase in fatal infections with canakinumab treatment in the trial, the findings demonstrated that targeting an inflammatory pathway could be a novel and effective anti-atherogenic therapy. Similarly, genes, proteins and pathways regulated by flow that control pro-atherogenic endothelial cell dysfunction and inflammation could be promising novel therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis. To this end, in this Review, we discuss the current literature on flow-sensitive genes, proteins and pathways, including the emerging concept of disturbed-flow-induced reprogramming of endothelial cells, involved in endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis.\np2n3 | Atherosclerosis preferentially develops at sites of disturbed flow\nohh7 | Vascular haemodynamics\nvbni | The vascular endothelium is in direct contact with the blood in the arterial lumen and forms a protective barrier between the blood and the outer vascular wall. The vascular endothelium is constantly exposed to haemodynamic forces: normal (transmural) stress and circumferential stress in the arterial wall resulting from blood pressure, and tangential shear stress on the endothelial surface due to blood flow. Whereas transmural pressure and circumferential stress in the vessel wall mainly affect and regulate medial vascular smooth muscle cells, fluid shear stress mostly affects endothelial cells, potently regulating their function.\ndgcw | Shear stress on endothelial cells\ngvwz | Shear stress is the frictional force derived from blood viscosity and flow rate that acts tangentially on the endothelial surface. Due to complex vascular geometries and haemodynamic conditions, shear stress levels and directional patterns vary greatly in different regions\nsk5m | Review article",
