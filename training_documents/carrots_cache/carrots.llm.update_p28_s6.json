        "content": "7w85 | Across all fifty firms, the total cost of carrots (those given to executives plus those given to common shareholders) is about one point three three million dollars for the average sample firm. Across all companies, the average carrot is approximately four point three percent of the purchase price (or two point four percent on a dollar-weighted basis).\njfg8 | The use of carrots is greater in the forty-two firms in our sample where the VC investors did not convert to common stock, and thus where the conflict between the entrepreneurial team and VCs was likely to be the greatest. In this subsample of forty-two firms we find that the total cost of carrots is about one point five one million dollars for the average firm and that approximately five point zero percent of deal value (three point one percent on a dollar-weighted basis) was used to fund carrots.\ne5j2 | B. Sticks\nfwhe | As explained earlier, the two potential sticks available to VCs in dealing with recalcitrant executives are firing them and threatening to blacklist them, and the two sticks that can be used against common shareholders are cross-voting and vote buying. This section describes the use of such sticks in our sample.\n4o8h | One. Termination of CEO\nvmxy | Recall that twenty-nine of the fifty founders of our firms had been replaced before the sale. But these replacements typically occurred well before the sale, usually in connection with a later round of financing. After three years of operating, approximately thirty percent of the firms in our sample had replaced the founder-CEO. Of those firms still in operation after six years, approximately sixty-three percent of the firms had replaced the founder-CEO. Data on the timing of\n10cz | CARROTS AND STICKS\nwykv | CEO replacement in our sample are summarized in Table Four.\nh630 | In fact, none of the entrepreneurs providing us with data indicated that any founder (or other executive) was fired or threatened with being fired immediately in connection with a contemplated sale. Moreover, while the impetus for replacing the founder-CEO typically came from the VCs, there was little conflict over the replacement of the founder-CEO. None of the terminated founder-CEOs reported that the VCs had caused the firm to repurchase vested options or had fired the founder-CEO to strip him or her of unvested equity, a possibility raised by Michael Klausner and Kate Litvak.\nypft | Indeed, most of the replaced founders reported significant involvement with the firm after the CEO change. The founder-CEO remained on the board following the CEO replacement in almost sixty percent (seventeen out of twenty-nine) of our sample firms. Even when the founder does not keep a board seat, he or she generally has some position with the firm after replacement (often serving as the Chief Technology Officer or in some other executive capacity).\ns8yq | To be sure, even if we do not observe forcible termination, the possibility of such termination is always present. The possibility of termination limits the value of management bonuses that executives can extract from the VCs.\nxp7w | Two. Blacklisting\njzdr | In two firms, VCs explicitly threatened to prevent a founder from ever raising money again in Silicon Valley if he or she did not vote for the sale as a director. In each of these firms, the founder's support was not necessary as a matter of corporate law to conduct the sale-the VCs had control of the board-but the VCs wanted a unanimous board vote to reduce liability risk. And they got it in both situations.\nmvkk | Again, the fact that blacklisting was explicitly threatened in only two firms does not mean that founders or executives in other firms were not affected by the possibility of blacklisting. We have been told by VCs and venture capital lawyers that entrepreneurs are keenly aware, even if they have not been explicitly told, that if they behave \"unreasonably\" toward the VCs backing their firm, it will be very difficult for them to raise funds from other VCs in the future. Our results thus understate the importance of blacklisting\nogev | CARROTS AND STICKS\nxse5 | constraints on the entrepreneurial team.\n6fj0 | Three. Cross-Voting\nh20j | In one firm, VC investors engaged in cross-voting, the scheme used in Orban versus Fields. Firm twenty-nine, which was California-domiciled, received fifty million dollars over three rounds of VC financing and was sold in two thousand four for twenty million dollars. At the time of sale, the VCs already controlled the board of directors, the founder had already been replaced as CEO, and the VCs collectively had liquidation preferences exceeding one hundred million dollars (the third-round financing included a three times preference). The founder refused to vote his common stock in favor of the sale. Because the firm was incorporated in California, approval by a majority of the common shareholders was necessary to sell the firm, giving the founder some degree of blocking power. To eliminate this holdup, the VCs converted a fraction of their preferred stock into common shares. This maneuver did not cost the VCs anything because, as in Orban, the VCs were left postconversion with liquidation preferences far greater than the twenty million dollar sale price.\n9nb3 | Firm twenty-nine was the only company in our sample where this form of cross-voting was actually used. However, other founders, especially those of firms whose common stock was far underwater, reported that they were aware that VCs could engage in this tactic. Thus, demands for carve-outs to common shareholders are made in the shadow of possible cross-voting.\nozt1 | Four. Vote Buying\nzuxk | Vote buying reportedly occurred in one firm in our sample. The firm was California-domiciled, and there were no drag-along rights. The founder reported that the VC-controlled board paid the CEO and other employees to exercise underwater options to acquire and vote common stock in favor of a trade sale for about eighty million dollars. In addition to this stick, the VCs used a carrot: they provided a four million dollar carve-out to common shareholders. The founder sued the VCs, alleging vote buying and improprieties associated with a presale financing round. The case was settled for an undisclosed amount.\np19h | Of course, implicit and essentially undetectable vote buying might be occurring through management bonuses because of the considerable overlap between shareholders and executives. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that vote buying was occurring in other firms in our sample.\nh9do | CARROTS AND STICKS\nsqxb | CONCLUSION\nidnc | Trade sales by VCs are actually much more common than IPOs and, in the aggregate, are likely to be just as financially important to VCs. However, unlike IPOs, trade sales do not trigger the intense public-disclosure requirements of the securities laws. As a result, we know relatively little about them.\n3hhr | In this Article, we seek to shed light on how VCs arrange to sell startups in trade sales. In particular, we investigate how VCs induce the founder, other executives, and common shareholders to go along with a trade sale that they might otherwise have an incentive to resist.",
