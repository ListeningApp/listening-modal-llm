You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

seik | NaCl equiv) and isotopic data on the sulfide, sulfate, and silicate minerals indicate seawater-dominated fluids, possi- bly with a component of condensed vapor-phase liquid, and abundant fluid mixing between hydrothermal fluids and ambi- ent seawater. The calculated temperatures of clay formation range from 124° to 256℃, lower than the calculated trapping temperatures of primary fluid inclusions in anhydrite and sphalerite, suggesting that the late sulfate-sulfide veins were likely transporting hotter fluids. The highest-temperature flu- ids likely boiled at a depth just below the deepest drill holes. Several lines of evidence indicate increasing temperature with depth: (1) the transition from barite near the surface to anhydrite at depth, (2) the progressive transition from smec- tite to mixed-layer illite/smectite (with increasing proportions of illite) to corrensite to chamosite (e.g., Fig. 11A, B), and (3) decreasing 818O and increasing òD values of monominer- alic clays. Calculated temperatures of formation increase by ~130℃ from nontronite -> chamosite -> corrensite -> recto- rite. Downhole temperature gradients are as high as 80℃ in just over 1 m (e.g., TKAD025 at site B). However, several drill holes show reverse temperature gradients. In particular, data for TKAD026 suggests decreasing temperatures from 256℃ at 2.9 m b.s.f. to 161℃ at 5.6 m b.s.f., reflecting the control of variable subseafloor permeability on lateral fluid flow and variable subsurface mixing with entrained seawater.
oq7c | The alteration mineralogy at Tinakula is similar to proximal footwall alteration associated with Kuroko-type VMS deposits (e.g., Shirozu, 1974; Date et al., 1983; Shikazono et al., 1995). In these deposits, the shallow subseafloor strata surround- ing the fossil upflow zones is dominated by low-temperature montmorillonite/nontronite, with higher-temperature illite/ smectite + pyrite present in the immediate footwall of the massive sulfide and illite/smectite + chamosite and chamosite + corrensite at depth, similar to sites A, C, and D at Tinakula.
z4mi | Sites A and D are interpreted to be at the center of the high- est-temperature upflow, where there is active venting, chal- copyrite-rich chimneys, and extensive formation of illite. The alteration mineralogy at sites B, C, E, and F reflects relatively lower temperatures, consistent with the dominant sphalerite- and barite-rich chimneys.
hkft | The alteration assemblages are all associated with Si loss (Fig. 17; Table 5), which may be partially related to dilu- tion associated with anhydrite precipitation at depth, with net mass changes of as much as 49%. Similar loss of Si has been documented in association with phyllosilicate altera- tion at the PACMANUS hydrothermal system in the Manus back-arc basin (Giorgetti et al., 2006; Paulick and Bach, 2006; Monecke et al., 2007). In contrast, at Tinakula Si gains occur at the tops of drill holes TKAD015, TKAD032, and TKAD033 (App. Figs. A26, A27), representing local silicification near the seafloor in the form of opaline silica filling void spaces. Large gains in Ca near the bottom of drill holes TKAD015, TKAD012, and TKAD018 likely record the deposition of anhydrite at the higher subseafloor temperatures at depth, which could reflect incomplete removal of the anhydrite-rich matrix material during clast separations. Large mass gains in K2O (and LREEs) in the illite/smectite + pyrite assemblages are similar to the observed mass changes in the feeder zones of VMS deposits hosted by felsic volcaniclastic rocks (e.g., Mattabi-type alteration; Morton and Franklin, 1987). Altera- tion in the immediate upflow zone at Tinakula might also be enhanced by the pyrite precipitation, which generates acid. In the surrounding permeable rocks, drawdown of seawater has added MgO. Intuitively, this process should be associated with cooling, but the higher temperatures of chlorite forma- tion at depth in the Tinakula drill holes, based on 818O data (Fig. 22), may also have increased the drawdown, resulting in the observed Mg addition.
jai3 | MINERALIZATION AND ALTERATION OF THE TINAKULA SMS DEPOSIT
p57i | In permeable volcaniclastic rocks, an important question is how the permeability becomes sealed enough to allow focusing of the hydrothermal fluids to the seafloor. Here, we propose that the pervasive alteration of the volcaniclastic units close to the seafloor coincided with a progressive downward increase in subseafloor temperatures, from initial low temperatures during precipitation of nontronite (136°-138℃), increasing to chamosite (124°-205℃), corrensite (207°-227℃), and eventually rectorite (256℃). At 150℃, the temperatures were high enough to form anhydrite at depths of only a few meters below the seafloor, sealing off some permeability and focusing the fluids into channelized pathways to the seafloor. Continued hydrothermal circulation resulted in overpressur- ing and fracturing of this relatively impermeable layer, precip- itating late sulfate veins with minor sulfide minerals (Fig. 3E), including sphalerite, at temperatures up to 298℃. A similar model has been proposed for the anhydrite-cemented brec- cias in the Pacmanus deposit in the Manus basin (Binns and Scott, 1993; Binns et al., 2007) and the Suiyo seamount and Iheya North Knoll field in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc (Ishi- bashi et al., 2013, 2015). This process has been investigated using numerical modeling (Kawada and Yoshida, 2010); in ancient deposits, anhydrite is rarely preserved because of its retrograde solubility; the only evidence remaining of an anhy- drite seal would be the presence of alteration minerals formed at temperatures that would have caused anhydrite deposition. Chlorite-rich alteration pipes in otherwise permeable volca- niclastic sequences may have been shielded from infiltrating seawater by anhydrite that is no longer present in the rocks. Although rarely preserved in ancient VMS deposits, anhydrite and gypsum are locally abundant in the Kuroko ores (e.g., Shikazono et al., 1983) and may have played an important role in the focusing of hydrothermal upflow in those deposits, as at Tinakula.
