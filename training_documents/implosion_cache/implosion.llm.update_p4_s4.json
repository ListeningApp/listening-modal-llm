Our eyes are open, but we perceive only clich√©s, \"only what we are interested in perceiving.\" Even if we read newspapers, watch cable news, or follow and resend Facebook posts, the war-torn, poverty- and disease-stricken, unequal, unbearable world is tragic-but somehow tolerable. A problem shared, I would argue, by Haraway and Deleuze, is how to disrupt our own tolerance, how to see the intolerable in the everyday. \"If our sensory-motor schema jam or break, then a different type of image can appear.\" Deleuze detects in cinema a potential to shock thinking, beyond imagination. \"For it is not in the name of a better or truer world that thought captures the intolerable in this world, on the contrary, it is because this world is intolerable that it can no longer think a world or think itself.\" Deleuze points to another kind of thinking, another kind of politics to come, as something to be invented that does not already make sense.\nj30a | the seer, because reflection implies a self-presence, a comfortable sense of one's identities and stakes. Rather, it is diffracted. One only sees at all through eyes that are themselves devices with histories of their own. Haraway continues: \"These points also apply to testimony from the position of 'oneself.' We are not immediately present to ourselves. Self-knowledge requires a semiotic-material technology linking meanings and bodies. Self-identity is a bad visual system.\"\n7bdk | Non-innocence and complicity are necessary if one is to confront world histories as histories that one is a part of and accountable to. Without these stances, one easily falls into some incarnation of a god-trick, claiming to see the world from nowhere in particular. Situated knowledge as a method begins at this point of bloody eyes seeing a violent world and not turning away because that would only add to the violence: commitment. One will pursue connections like a bloodhound to try and make better stories, fuller world histories, stronger objectivity. One fights for one's own eyes as well as for those of others. \"Struggles over what will count as rational accounts of the world are struggles over how to see. . . . Objectivity cannot be about fixed vision when what counts as an object is precisely what world history turns out to be about.\"\nfim0 | This commitment to investigate is something we come to have to do. Deleuze described Franz Kafka's commitment similarly: \"The impossibility of not 'writing,' the impossibility of writing in the dominant language, the impossibility of writing differently.\" For Haraway, the stakes are always high, but they are also everywhere:\nojro | The relations of democracy and knowledge are up for materialized refiguring at every level of the onion of doing technoscience, not just after all the serious epistemological action is over. I believe that last statement is a fact; I know it is my hope and commitment. This position is not relativism; it is a principled refusal of the stacked deck that forces choice between loaded dualities such as realism and relativism.\n1ujy | When my students read Haraway, they are often struck by the density of descriptions that span centuries and cultures, corporations and identities, without ever being nonspecific. Her stories of the bomb, gene, brain, mouse, vampire, and the like are not generic stories of mice, for instance, but of OncoMouse and even of particular OncoMice at specific labs. Students complain sometimes\n```",
