Stool-based Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in children at a teaching and referral hospital in Southwest Ethiopia


## Abstract

Background

Diagnosis of tuberculosis in children is challenging mainly due to the difficulty of obtaining respiratory specimen and lack of sensitive diagnostic tests. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert hereafter, for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis from stool specimen in children.


## Methods

A cross-sectional study was conducted among consecutively recruited children, less than fifteen years old, with presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis at Jimma Medical Center, Ethiopia. One pulmonary specimen, expectorated sputum or gastric aspirate, was collected from each participant and tested for tuberculosis by Xpert and Lowenstein-Jensen culture. In addition, one stool specimen per child was collected and tested by Xpert after a single step, centrifuge-free stool processing method adapted from KNCV TB Foundation. Diagnostic performance of Xpert was calculated with reference to Lowenstein-Jensen culture and to a composite reference standards comprising of confirmed tuberculosis, positive by Xpert or culture, and unconfirmed tuberculosis, clinical diagnosis with improvement after anti-tuberculosis treatment.


## Results

A total of one hundred seventy-eight children were enrolled; one hundred fifty-two of whom had complete microbiological results. Overall, tuberculosis was diagnosed in thirteen point two percent of the children with presumptive tuberculosis. Of these, only ten had microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis, positive Xpert or culture, and the remaining ten were clinically diagnosed with positive response to anti-tuberculosis treatment and were classified as unconfirmed tuberculosis. Stool Xpert had sensitivity of one hundred percent and specificity of ninety-nine point three percent compared to culture; however, the sensitivity was

decreased to fifty percent when compared to composite reference standards. The Xpert on gastric aspirate had sensitivity of seventy-seven point eight percent compared to culture and forty percent compared to composite reference standards.


## Conclusions

The sensitivity of Xpert for stool sample is comparable to that for gastric aspirate. Stool sample is a potential alternative to pulmonary specimen in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in children using Xpert.


## Background

Tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death globally. Children account for eleven percent of the global disease burden with an estimated one point one million new childhood tuberculosis cases and two hundred five thousand pediatric tuberculosis deaths in twenty eighteen. Early detection of tuberculosis is critical for timely initiation of treatment but is challenging in children because of non-specific clinical presentations, difficulty of obtaining respiratory specimen and lack of sensitive diagnostic tests.

Sputum specimen remains being the most frequently used clinical sample to confirm the diagnosis of tuberculosis microbiologically. However, in most cases, children are unable to expectorate sputum specimen and when sputum is available; the yield is expected to be poor because of the paucibacillary nature of childhood tuberculosis. As a result, specimen obtained through different procedures such as induced sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, and gastric aspirate have been studied to improve the sensitivity of microbiological examinations. Though these procedures are well tolerated in adults, they are relatively uncomfortable for children, and the capability to carry out these procedures may be lacking in many tuberculosis endemic settings. Thus, there is a need for non-sputum based specimen to diagnose tuberculosis in children who are unable to expectorate sputum.

Stool is an alternative specimen for tuberculosis diagnosis, because Mycobacterium tuberculosis can be swallowed with the sputum and detected in stool. In particular, stool is easy to obtain from infants and young children who are unable to produce sputum. The introduction of Xpert has revolutionized the diagnosis of tuberculosis and the World Health Organization has endorsed Xpert for the diagnosis of tuberculosis from various types of specimen such as sputum, lymph node tissue and aspirate, cerebrospinal fluid, gastric lavage and aspirate. Recently, studies evaluating Xpert for detection of pulmonary tuberculosis from stool have been published with highly variable sensitivities, ranging from thirty-two percent to eighty-three point three percent. In Ethiopia, there is a paucity of data on the diagnostic performance of Xpert on stool specimen for children who are unable to expectorate sputum. Therefore, this study is aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Xpert for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis from stool specimen in children with presumptive tuberculosis.


## Materials and methods

Study design and setting

An institution-based cross-sectional study was carried out among consecutively recruited children, less than fifteen years old, with presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis at Jimma University Medical Center, Ethiopia between March and November twenty nineteen. The study area is located in Jimma Zone, Oromia Regional State in Southwest part of Ethiopia. Jimma town is located three hundred fifty-seven kilometers away from Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. Jimma University Medical Center, located in Jimma town, is one of

the oldest public hospitals in the country. Jimma University Medical Center is a teaching and referral hospital that provides services for about fifteen million people in its catchment area. Each year, Jimma University Medical Center reports serving approximately fifteen thousand inpatient hospital stays, one hundred sixty thousand outpatient visits, and eleven thousand emergency department visits. Most of the patients getting services at the center are from rural area. According to World Health Organization twenty twenty-one report, Ethiopia is among the thirty countries with high tuberculosis and tuberculosis or HIV burden, with an estimated annual incidence of one hundred fifty-one thousand cases and an estimated nineteen thousand tuberculosis-related deaths excluding HIV associated tuberculosis deaths.


## Study participants

Participants were children aged less than fifteen years presenting with a chronic cough of more than two weeks, weight loss, loss of appetite, persistent fever without an apparent cause, night sweats, or history of close contact with a tuberculosis patient within the preceding twelve months. They were classified as the presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis patients. Participants were excluded, if they had an already confirmed tuberculosis, had been on anti-tuberculosis treatment for more than seventy-two hours before enrollment and clinical symptoms or physical signs suggestive of extrapulmonary tuberculosis.


## Study procedures

Children up to fifteen years of age were screened for tuberculosis and those presumptive tuberculosis cases were enrolled into this study. Tuberculosis screening was done as per standard of care, which mainly relies on self-reporting of symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis, cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss and history of close contact with tuberculosis patients. Study subjects were diagnosed with confirmed tuberculosis based on positive microbiological test results, positive Lowenstein-Jensen culture and positive Xpert on gastric aspirate or sputum or with unconfirmed tuberculosis based on a clinical diagnosis and positive response to anti-tuberculosis treatment. Some of the patients with negative microbiologic results were given empirical treatment based on the evaluation by the treating clinicians and were evaluated for response to treatment, resolution of symptoms, weight gain, and radiographic improvement after two months. Demographic data and clinical information of the participants were collected through structured questionnaires. Clinical data such as radiologic findings, clinical improvement after anti-tuberculosis treatment, HIV status, nutritional status, and BCG vaccination status were obtained from the participants' medical records.


## Specimen collection and laboratory procedures

One respiratory specimen (a minimum of four milliliters) and one stool specimen (a minimum of three grams) were collected per child. Xpert was performed at JUMC Laboratory from respiratory specimens as part of the routine practice at the medical center, whereas tuberculosis culture and stool Xpert were performed at Jimma University Mycobacterium Research Center for the research purposes.

The respiratory samples were collected as per the standard of care. The treating physician collected single gastric aspirate or expectorated sputum. Gastric aspirate samples were collected early in the morning through nasogastric tube following an overnight fasting and tested by Xpert and LJ culture. Expectorated sputum instead of gastric aspirate was used in the patients who were able to produce sputum.

Respiratory specimens were divided into two parts; the first part was diluted two to one by volume with Xpert sample reagent, followed by vigorous shaking and incubation at room temperature for fifteen minutes. Then, two milliliters of liquefied specimen was aspirated using sterile pipette provided with Xpert kit and added to Xpert cartridge and loaded into the GeneXpert instrument to run the test. The results were reported to the treating physicians as soon as possible for participants' management.

The second part of respiratory specimen was neutralized with phosphate buffered solution immediately after collection and stored at four to eight degrees Celsius for two to three days until processing for culture. Equal volume of N-acetyl-L-Cysteine and four percent sodium hydroxide solution were added to the fifty milliliters specimen tube. After mixing on the vortex, the sample tube was left standing for twenty minutes at room temperature for liquefaction and decontamination. Then, sterile phosphate buffered solution (pH six point eight) was added up to forty-five milliliters to neutralize the alkaline solution, followed by centrifugation at three thousand g for fifteen minutes. After discarding the supernatant, the pellet was re-suspended in two milliliters phosphate buffered solution and two drops of the resulting diluted deposit was inoculated on the slants of LJ medium.

Stool specimen (approximately three to five grams) was collected in a wide-mouthed specimen collection jar on spot or submitted the following day and was stored at negative twenty degrees Celsius until processed as described previously. Stool Xpert was performed by single step, centrifuge-free stool processing protocol adapted from KNCV tuberculosis foundation. Briefly, one gram of thawed stool was transferred to fifty milliliters falcon tube using wooden applicator stick; eight milliliters of sample reagent was poured in the sample tube and mixed very well, and left undisturbed for twenty minutes at room temperature. The supernatant was carefully aspirated and added to Xpert cartridge using sterile pipette.


## Diagnostic classification for analysis

Children were classified into three categories based on their clinical, radiological, and laboratory results. (i) "Confirmed tuberculosis" :- child has symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis and tuberculosis disease is confirmed microbiologically (positive gastric aspirate Xpert and/or culture); (ii) "Unconfirmed tuberculosis" :- child has at least two of the following: symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis, chest radiograph consistent with tuberculosis, or documented exposure to MTB and positive response to ATT but tuberculosis disease is not confirmed microbiologically (negative gastric aspirate Xpert and/or culture); (iii) "Unlikely tuberculosis" :- no criteria for "Unconfirmed tuberculosis" was met and tuberculosis is not confirmed microbiologically (negative gastric aspirate Xpert and/or culture). CRS is defined as either confirmed tuberculosis or unconfirmed tuberculosis in the definition of tuberculosis and cases that met "unlikely tuberculosis" criteria were classified as not tuberculosis.


## Data analysis

Data were entered in Epidata version three point three and analyzed using SPSS software package version twenty. The Xpert sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values and their ninety-five percent confidence intervals were calculated using the following as one of the reference standards: i) LJ culture alone; ii) LJ culture and/or Xpert (confirmed tuberculosis); and iii) composite reference standard (CRS) (confirmed tuberculosis and unconfirmed tuberculosis). Differences and similarities between the two methods (stool Xpert versus gastric aspirate Xpert) was determined based on the ninety-five percent confidence intervals. Non-overlapping ninety-five percent confidence intervals indicated a difference between the two methods (stool Xpert versus gastric aspirate Xpert) and vice versa.


## Ethical consideration

Ethical approval was obtained from Institutional Review Board of Jimma University, Ethiopia. We obtained written informed consent from parents or legal guardians of children and assent from children above ten years old.


## Results Characteristics of study participants

A total of one hundred seventy-eight children with presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis were enrolled to the study. Out of these, twenty-six children were excluded from the final analysis: seventeen were unable to provide stool specimen and nine

had contaminated culture results. We included the remaining one hundred fifty-two participants for whom we analyzed seventeen expectorated sputum specimens, one hundred thirty-five gastric aspirates and one hundred fifty-two stool specimens. Seventy-eight of one hundred fifty-two participants were females and participants' ages ranged from seven months to fourteen years (median three years). Majority, ninety-eight of the participants were rural residents. Regarding the clinical manifestation of the participants, one hundred forty-one had cough for more than two weeks, one hundred twenty-two had loss of appetite, one hundred nine had fever, ninety had weight loss, ninety had weakness/fatigue, seventy had shortness of breath and thirty-five had TB contact history. The majority, one hundred forty-two, were vaccinated with BCG. Close to a third of the participants, fifty-four, were severely malnourished, whereas six of them were on anti-retroviral therapy.


## Diagnosis of TB

Out of the one hundred fifty-two pulmonary specimens analyzed, MTB was detected in nine by culture and in eight by Xpert. In one of the participants, gastric aspirate Xpert was positive whereas the culture from the same specimen was negative. On the other hand, in two of the participants, culture from the gastric aspirates were positive whereas Xpert results were negative. All the seventeen expectorated sputum specimens were negative by both Xpert and culture. Stool Xpert testing revealed ten MTB positive cases. Rifampicin resistance was not detected in any of the Xpert positive specimens. Table two shows results of gastric aspirate Xpert, stool Xpert and gastric aspirate culture amongst study subjects.

Overall, ten of the one hundred fifty-two study participants had microbiologically confirmed PTB, defined as a positive result on culture and/or Xpert on pulmonary specimen. We reviewed the medical records of the remaining one hundred forty-two of participants who were microbiologically negative. Of these, eight point five percent were clinically diagnosed as TB by the clinicians. Among the twelve clinically diagnosed TB cases, eighty-three point three percent showed clinical improvement after ATT. The remaining two cases died after two weeks of ATT initiation and were classified as unlikely TB cases. Out of the ten cases who have improved clinically, four had radiological findings suggestive of TB whereas six had no radiological evidences of TB documented on their medical records and hence were classified as "unconfirmed TB". However, none of the children with clinically-diagnosed TB had positive stool Xpert result. In the remaining ninety-one point five percent

of the cases, TB was ruled out and an alternative diagnosis was made and hence, they were classified as "unlikely TB".


## Diagnostic performance of stool Xpert

Error/invalid results were documented in four point six percent of Xpert tests performed on stool. Due to a shortage of Xpert cartridges, we didn't repeat the tests in these invalid cases. Of the one hundred forty-five stool specimens with valid Xpert results, six point nine percent were MTB positive. Stool Xpert detected all gastric aspirate culture confirmed TB cases and one positive case missed by gastric aspirate culture. Moreover, stool Xpert also detected two MTB positive cases which were found to be negative on gastric aspirate Xpert.

Using culture of the respiratory specimen (gastric aspirate and expectorated samples) as the reference standard, stool Xpert had sensitivity of one hundred percent and specificity of ninety-nine point three percent, whereas gastric aspirate Xpert had sensitivity of seventy-seven point eight percent and specificity of ninety-nine point three percent. Using gastric aspirate culture and/or Xpert positivity (microbiological confirmation) as one of the reference standards, stool Xpert had each one hundred percent sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV.

Moreover, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of stool and gastric aspirate Xpert were also calculated with reference to CRS. Accordingly, stool Xpert had a sensitivity of fifty percent, specificity of one hundred percent, PPV of one hundred percent and NPV of ninety-two point six percent against CRS. The corresponding sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for gastric aspirate Xpert were forty percent, one hundred percent, one hundred percent and ninety-one point seven percent respectively compared to CRS. Stool and gastric aspirate Xpert MTB detection rates compared to CRS is also shown in supporting information.


## Discussion

Ethiopia is among the thirty countries with high-burden of TB and TB/HIV in the world and there is a huge number of undiagnosed TB in children. The national guidelines for TB care in Ethiopia recommends Xpert for the diagnosis of childhood TB. However, obtaining appropriate respiratory specimens from children is difficult. Thus, a non-invasive sample for the diagnosis of TB in children would improve care for this population. In the current study, we have demonstrated that stool Xpert has comparable performance with gastric aspirate Xpert in consecutively recruited children with presumptive PTB. Other studies have also reported promising findings.


## Xpert MTB/RIF for the diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis

We found that Xpert was one hundred percent sensitive for MTB detection in stool among children with microbiological confirmation from a respiratory specimen and fifty percent sensitive in children with microbiologically and/or clinically diagnosed TB. Other studies conducted in Ethiopia, Kenya and Pakistan have also reported excellent sensitivity ranging from eighty-eight point nine percent to one hundred percent.

of stool Xpert compared to gastric aspirate culture. The lower sensitivity of stool Xpert compared to CRS, microbiological and/or clinically confirmed TB, is possibly due to the presence of paucibacillary disease in patients clinically diagnosed for TB.

The specificity of stool Xpert in our study when compared to culture was consistent with other previous studies conducted in Ethiopia, South Africa and Egypt which have demonstrated specificities ranging from ninety-nine point three to ninety-nine point seven percent. The specificity of stool Xpert in our study when compared to CRS was similar with another study conducted in Pakistan. One culture negative gastric aspirate specimen was found to be positive on both stool and gastric aspirate Xpert tests. This may be due to the presence of non-viable bacilli during decontamination process of gastric aspirate specimen.

In this study, stool Xpert identified all of the gastric aspirate Xpert positive cases, suggesting stool as a potential alternative for use to gastric aspirate in the routine diagnosis of PTB. Gastric aspiration may be used to retrieve pulmonary specimen from patients who cannot expectorate sputum but it is an invasive procedure and needs trained health workers. As a non-invasive sample, stool is considered to be safe, easy for collection and has the potential to be used for detection of MTB. Moreover, stool Xpert test is performed by simple stool testing protocol adapted from KNCV TB foundation, which omits some labor intensive steps such as homogenization, decontamination and centrifugation of stool specimen prior to Xpert testing done by other studies. This approach significantly reduces sample processing time, minimizes the workload on the laboratory personnel and also minimizes costs.

In our study, unfortunately, none of the clinically diagnosed TB cases were detected by stool Xpert. Poor performance of stool Xpert in the clinically diagnosed, microbiologically negative, children has also been reported in other studies. This could potentially indicate the limitation of the stool Xpert since patients with such clinically-diagnosed unconfirmed TB are more likely to have paucibacillary disease. Children with a high clinical probability of TB despite a negative stool Xpert should be started on ATT until better and more sensitive tools are available.

Older children are able to expectorate sputum and may produce more adult-type sputum. However, in our study, none of the expectorated sputum samples were positive for M. tuberculosis. This could be due to the poor sample quality in the expectorated sputum samples.

However, we did not assess the quality of the sputum sample in the current study which might be taken as a limitation.

Our study has some limitations. We used small sample size due to resource constraints. An additional limitation of our study is the fact that we collected only single respiratory and stool specimen rather than successive specimens which could have probably increased the yield of the tests done.


## Conclusion

The sensitivity of stool Xpert is comparable to that of gastric aspirate Xpert. Stool is a potential alternative to pulmonary specimen in the diagnosis of PTB in patients who cannot produce sputum. Moreover, stool collection is easier and relatively safe compared to pulmonary specimen and can be easily implemented at lowest level of health care system. However, the diagnostic yield of stool Xpert still requires further validation and optimization using larger sample size.
