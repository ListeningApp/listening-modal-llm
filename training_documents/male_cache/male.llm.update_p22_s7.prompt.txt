You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

uxhs | i) Spermatogonia proliferate to give rise to spermatocytes and simultaneously maintain their number by renewal.
ed6e | ii) Spermatocytes prepare for and undergo the complex maturation divisions of meiosis that reduce the chromosome number of the germ cells by half.
6qqm | iii) Spermatids, the product of the maturation divisions, undergo a remarkable metamorphosis, called spermiogenesis, which leads to the production of spermatozoa.
onum | a) Proliferative Phase: Unlike the situation in the female, in which a full complement of oocytes is present in the ovary at birth, the production of generation after generation of meiotic spermatocytes in the male requires a means to replace the spermatogonia or stem cells.
3iir | i) Several spermatogonial types have been described in man: Spermatogonial stem cells type Ad (dark) and type Ap (pale), and Type B spermatogonia. According to Clermont (1966), one member of a pair of type Ad spermatogonia divides to give rise to a pair of new type Ad cells, while the other member of the original pair of Ad divides to yield a pair of more differentiated type Ap spermatogonia. Thus, it is thought that the type Ad spermatogonia not only serve as a precursor for type Ap, but also eventually serve as the ancestor (i.e., stem cell) of a later generation of sperm.
7a0a | ii) The type Ap spermatogonia divides by mitosis to give rise to two type B spermatogonia, a subset of which further divide to produce the preleptotene spermatocytes that enter meiosis.
o1qp | b) Meiotic Phase (Summarized here)
jrik | i) The diploid type B spermatogonia, which are also diploid (i.e., 2N) in terms of DNA content and chromosome number, divide by mitosis to give rise to a new generation of cells: the primary spermatocytes.
xv78 | ii) The primary spermatocytes initially have double the amount of DNA (i.e., tetraploid or 4N) but remain diploid in terms of chromosome number (see Figure 11).
sdks | iii) The primary spermatocytes then go through the preleptotene, leptotene, zygotene, and pachytene steps of the long prophase of the first maturation division of meiosis.
y8fb | iv) Following a short diplotene phase, the primary spermatocytes complete the first maturation division through metaphase, anaphase, and telophase to give rise to secondary spermatocytes (which are haploid, but contain 2N amount of DNA since they are double-stranded chromosomes).
521q | v) The secondary spermatocytes then quickly proceed through the second maturation division of meiosis to yield haploid spermatids containing 1N amount of DNA.
yogo | 7) Spermiogenesis is the process of differentiation of the round spermatid to undergo morphological changes to develop an acrosome and flagella and to undergo nuclear condensation and extrusion of the cytoplasm.
2285 | a) Round Spermatids: As the spermatid matures it elongates, develops a tail or flagellum, and assumes a configuration similar to that of the mature spermatozoon. Very few spermatozoa are present in histological sections of the testis because as soon as they mature, the sperm are released into the seminiferous tubular lumen and rapidly flow out to the rete testis. The spermatid contains a prominent round nucleus, a Golgi apparatus, a set of centrioles, and numerous mitochondria (Figure 12). These organelles, with the aid of the Sertoli cell, will undergo architectural changes that will transform the spermatid into the mature spermatozoon
ys0g | i) During the first stage of spermiogenesis, large acrosomal vesicles are elaborated by the Golgi apparatus (Figure 12A). Other than the nucleus, the acrosomal vesicle soon becomes the most prominent cytoplasmic inclusion within the spermatid. The acrosomal vesicle migrates to one pole of the nucleus, and the centrioles move to the opposite end of the nucleus (Figure 12C). The acrosomal vesicle will eventually become the acrosomal cap of the sperm. The molecular controls of this process involve the proper functioning of a large number of different proteins at every stage of acrosome biosynthesis (Figure 13). When one of these proteins described
7zvp | in Figure 13 are dysfunctional, teratozoospermia occurs, specifically round-headed sperm/ globozoospermia due to the absence of the acrosome or acrosome atrophy or displacement.
ww6u | ii). Nuclear condensation: Surprisingly little research has been performed to fully understand the events required for the elongation and condensation of the spermatid nucleus. The acroplaxome, which consists of a bent plate and marginal ring encircling the spermatid nucleus, is key in this process. It serves to anchor the developing acrosome to the spermatid nucleus. The manchette also plays an important role in this process. The manchette surrounds the elongating spermatid head and is only present at the time of spermatid head shaping and tail formation. It is composed of a perinuclear ring and an attached fringe of microtubules. In humans it is proposed that the apical portion of the sperm head is driven by the actions of the acroplaxome and F-actin hoops located within the Sertoli cell, together with the transient manchette. The microtubules of the manchette are nucleated from the centrioles (located more caudally) and attached to the perinuclear ring to form a grass-like structure required for nuclear shaping. Proper sperm chromatin remodeling during spermiogenesis is of key importance. Herein the chromatin remodeling involves the replacement of histones by histone variants, hyperacetylation, by transient DNA strand breaks with associated DNA repair and replacement of the histones by the transition proteins, and finally by the highly basic protamines. The condensed chromatin of the elongating spermatid are transcriptionally inactive, as is the chromatin in the mature sperm (See Hao, Ni, & Yang, 2019, for a review of this process).
hpi6 | iii). Flagellar Formation: One of the centrioles begins to elongate to form the core of the flagellum (Figure 12A). As the centriole elongates, it begins to push the cytoplasm away from the nucleus. The centriole continues to extend out away from the nucleus to form the flagellum, and in the process, it constantly pulls most of the cytoplasmic inclusions away from the nucleus (Figure 12E). The inactive centriole (proximal centriole) remains intact and will be present in the neckpiece of the mature sperm. As the cytoplasm spreads away from the nucleus and acrosomal cap, the mitochondria are sequestered at the base of the flagellum (Figure 12F). The acrosomal region of the head will soon be devoid of any cytoplasmic inclusions. Excess cytoplasm, which now resides primarily in the area of the neckpiece, is cast off and phagocytized by the Sertoli cell. A remnant of the cytoplasm, the cytoplasmic droplet (Figure 12G), is sometimes seen on sperm during the semen analysis, and an excess of these droplets may indicate immature sperm in the ejaculate.
