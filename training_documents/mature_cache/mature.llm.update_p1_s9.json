We focus on and analyse moments when the boys negotiate implicit challenges, make evaluations and offer assessments concerning their physical and sexual attraction to girls' looks. These moments are highly important for negotiating their peer status, for working toward a distinction between 'childhood' and 'adolescence', and for marking a normatively heterosexual self within the burgeoning institution of adolescence. We will specifically show how 'heterosexual desire' is carefully managed in group discussions where the boys participate in normative heterosexuality, but in ways that are nevertheless designed to appear mature and knowing, rather than shallow, naïve or sexist. Three discursive methods of negotiation are identified and described in detail: one, underscoring the non-literality of actions by appealing to motives, two, denials with built-in concessions, and three, differentiation through caricature. Couched within the proposed discursive framework, we are reversing the traditional logic of developmental approaches to 'maturation'. Rather than viewing maturation as the effect of resolving developmental tasks, we argue that 'maturity' comes to existence in the way talk is accomplished; that is, as highly flexible and fragile projections of identity that involve a continuous refinement of 'finely tuned positioning skills'.\n0w8m | Developmental psychologists have conceptualized adolescence as a 'betwixt and between' time of development, when there is a constantly shifting and ambiguous experience of sexual identity. It is a time when adolescents are caught between childish and adult norms of sexuality, where they must negotiate what Eckert calls the 'developmental imperative' to appear 'mature', or 'the next step older'. Applied to the development of male adolescent sexuality, this typically involves a focus on clusters\nvcu3 | of problem-behaviours (e.g. dating, intercourse, contraception use) and their risks, with less emphasis on the developmental processes that characterize young men's negotiation of the 'developmental imperative'. As such, adolescent male sexuality is typically broached through a rather individualistic focus on the cognitive product of internalization (their 'attitudes') in studying young men's attempted resolution of problematic 'masculine norms' and 'ideologies'. This interest is at the service of explaining the different factors underlying or mediating the developmental internalization of masculine belief systems and masculine ideologies. In these orientations, 'maturation' is typically treated as an effect of psychological construction and is discussed in terms of the successful or unsuccessful resolution of 'tasks' associated with different developmental 'stages'.\nhjzj | For example, one of the more widely discussed psychosocial stages that adolescent boys are thought to begin to work their way through and sort out is 'non-relational sexuality', which refers to a constellation of hegemonic attitudes and behaviours characterized by an experience of sexuality as 'sport' or as lust, an obsession with physical attraction, an objectification of sexual partners, as well as tendencies toward trophyism, voyeurism and hypersexuality. According to Good and Sherrod, non-relational sexuality is a developmental life-stage that most men enter during adolescence and some successfully begin to resolve. The notion, however, of what it means to 'pass through' or 'successfully resolve' these forms of 'hetero-normative masculinity' remains an open and relatively unexplored (at least empirically) question. Much of the work on young men's negotiation of 'hetero-normative masculinity' is derived from clinical observation, theory and speculation. What is conspicuously absent are in-depth, contextually sensitive explorations that address developmental process, that is, how young men actually comply with and resist (or try to 'resolve') aspects of their sexualities over time and what that conformity and resistance looks like from their own perspectives and in their own words and actions.\nj79f | Exploring how adolescent males negotiate hetero-normative masculinity means appreciating that processes of gender-identity formation have a curious negotiability to them, in the sense that gender roles (and role transitions) are often contradictory and inconsistent. Connell has stressed that hegemonic forms of masculinity are 'historically mobile relations' with a formidable resourcefulness to them. In other words, the stability of 'hetero-normative masculinity' may very well lie in its flexibility to accommodate ostensibly incongruous values or norms. What this means is that in their everyday talk, young men may not embrace stereotypical masculine norms in the kind of straightforward way that they are asked about them on psychological scales and inventories. Over the course of adolescence, young men may increasingly learn to manage masculine norms, neither attending nor dis-attending to them in direct or obvious ways. While these processes of managing the norms of masculine sexuality have been intermittently examined by some psychologists, they have not been more generally discussed as relevant windows into the larger project of the 'developmental imperative' to appear 'mature' during adolescence.\n6tbv | As such, the aim of this article is to think of 'maturing' in a more local and socially discursive way. We are interested in examining 'maturity' as it is locally and discursively accomplished by young men as part of their everyday interactive social practices. In this\nxb13 | study, our aim is to detail several of the ways that adolescent boys (ages twelve to fifteen years) bring off and manage a 'mature' view of themselves. In other words, we are interested in what 'maturity' means to the boys themselves, and in investigating how they interactively position themselves and each other as 'mature'. To broach 'maturity' within the context of 'hetero-normative masculinity', we will focus on moments in group discussions where the boys negotiate implicit challenges, make evaluations, and offer assessments concerning their physical and sexual attraction to girls' looks. Their talk about such topics proved to be relevant discursive sites where appearing both 'mature' and 'heterosexually interested' become highly relevant and dilemmatic.\ncxqi | In examining the boys' talk about attraction and attractive girls, we will show how they position themselves vis-à-vis the adult moderator as 'misunderstood', 'aware' or 'knowing', and thus not as naïve, childish, desperate or shallow. They do this by orienting to the moderator's questions and to each other with subtly crafted, hedged responses and delayed or weak disagreements that preface strategically organized accounts or evaluations. What we will try to document is that these strategies are appropriated to avoid conversational trouble. In other words, these strategies reflect the interactive development of 'finely tuned positioning skills', which refers to the discursive dexterity of speakers in being able to constantly interpret and negotiate conversational possibilities. As such, the boys' discursive development does not necessarily reflect the progressive acquisition of internal dispositions, gender schemas or cognitive scripts.\n```",
