I think it is fair to say that what Edward Said wrote of the field of study known as orientalism is no less true of imperialism as a whole: \"It is ... a distribution of geopolitical awareness into aesthetic, scholarly, economic, sociological, historical, and philological texts.\" The educational itinerary of the extended and profoundly successful field trip of imperialism is rendered in Said's own exuberant cataloging of orientalism's scholarly project;\nb2lm | to dignify all knowledge collected during the colonial occupation with the title \"contribution to modern learning\" when the natives had neither been consulted nor treated as anything except as pretexts for a text whose usefulness was not to the natives; to feel oneself as a European in command, almost at will, of Oriental history, time, and geography; to institute new areas of specialization; to establish new disciplines; to divide, deploy, schematize, tabulate, index, and record everything in sight (and out of sight); to make out of every observable detail a generalization and out of every generalization an immutable law about the Oriental nature, temperament, mentality, custom, or type; and above all to transmute living reality into the stuff of texts, to possess (or think one possesses) actuality mainly because nothing in the Orient seems to resist one's powers.\nti7f | This book seeks, then, to extend Said's inspiring critique of orientalism to what I am framing as the educational legacy of imperialism, a legacy that has shaped many of our ideas about education, a legacy that continues to play a small but significant part in what the young learn of the world.\noksu | The problem today is not that schools are insensitive or unresponsive to the legacy of imperialism as it takes the form, for example, of a scientifically underwritten racism. I will examine how the textbooks used in biology, history, and English classes, which once could be expected to depict stereotypical racial types and national identities, now display a new multicultural sensitivity that teaches students about race as a form of culture in social studies, whereas the topic of race has been largely dropped from their biology classes.\nwtow | In English classes, students read works that movingly depict personal struggles against discrimination, without gaining any sense of how English literature was used to teach people their distance from the center of civilization. The textbooks of my own school days made it apparent that the academic disciplines were in the front lines when it came to fixing the distinctions between the natives and the Europeans; they made it clear that the educational project was about extending the gift of civilization. By ignoring how the arts and sciences have contributed to the significance of race, culture, and gender, the school leaves students to wonder how in the world these differences took on the considerable significance they still hold. This book speaks to the educated about their education in the ways of the world, and it does so on behalf of the yet-to-be-educated.\no22k | I do not imagine that such critical scrutiny will dry up the wells of racism or end the neocolonial forms of exploitation that remain imperialism's aftermath. But whatever its impact, I think that the young are owed an explanation of how such divisions have come to mean so much and of how the schooling of only a generation ago, during the final days of the colonial empires, was still teaching us to divide the world in very troubling ways. One may argue that dragging up this past can only spoil the chances that the young will start with a clean slate. Yet educators would seem obliged to consider their sources, to consider how the forces of good and evil have worked their way through education. I think we have to consider how this, too, forms part of the past that we have inherited, part of what has prevailed in our finest educational institutions. Schools have offered students little help in fathoming why this sense of difference in race, culture, and nation is so closely woven into the fabric of society. As a result, students have been relatively unaware of such government measures as the racial restriction of access to voting, immigration, and public services until not so long ago. They need to see that such divisions have long been part of the fabric and structure of the state, including the schools, and they need to appreciate that challenging the structuring of those differences requires equally public acts of refusing their original and intended meanings.\nnwfz | How these sometimes subtle imperial themes of difference and identity\nnvfy | continue to play themselves out in the lives of the young can be heard in the words of a group of students with whom I worked in a Vancouver high school on a study of electronic communications. Kathy Chin, for example, was preparing an introductory E-mail message for a student in Australia when she stopped to talk to her about the process, only to find her opening lines catching me off guard as they raised for me the issues of identity and location. \"First let me tell you about myself. My parents came here from Hong Kong (I'm Chinese) about twenty years ago and I was born here in Vancouver. I have never lived anywhere else but I have traveled a lot.\"\nmror | The point Kathy made about who she was struck me as both banal and extraordinary. This was who she was, yet what she said spoke to a history that was still present for all of us. To identify oneself as having been born in Canada while remaining parenthetically Chinese echoes a colonial history that determined whose home Canada was to be, even as imperialism engaged the Chinese of the diaspora in the business of empire; it speaks to the barriers that imperialism constructed between East and West out of a compound of race, ethnicity, and nationality, as well as gender in the West's feminized conception of the Oriental as other. This may be too much to make Kathy's comments bear, but she was not alone in this self-identification; others among her classmates recognized themselves as indelibly Chinese in Canada:\nzlxc | As to my appearance I'm chinese and very short five feet two inches, or five feet three inches actually. Obviously I have long black hair parted down the middle and brown eyes. (Anne Lee)\nk0bw | I have black eyes and hair. As you can tell from my last name you should know that I am Chinese. ... I was born in Taiwan and moved to Costa Rica when I was in grade two. Later when I was in grade four I moved to Canada. (Sarah Huang)\naq5a | You probably wouldn't know that I am Chinese. I have one of the strangest names in the world, but at least if someone asked, \"Where's Sterling?\" nobody would say, \"Sterling who?\" (Sterling Tan)\nsc5y | What lessons should the school be teaching, I wondered, about the historical depth and intricacy of the great divide that these students continue to live out? How might it help them understand the histories carried in these innocent acts of self-identification? It was not that the question of identity\n0yab | was missing from the school curriculum. Students have long had lessons on who is and who is not a member of this imagined community known as Canada. These lessons do their share to make each student, in effect, \"a pr√©cis of all the past,\" as Antonio Gramsci framed it: \"For each individual is the synthesis not only of existing relations, but the history of these relations.\" A strong source of light that the schools can throw on \"the history of these relations,\" I argue, is found in reviewing imperialism's educational project.\n```",
