The eighteen O value of the hydrothermal fluid in equilibrium with the analyzed\natmh | clay minerals could have been closer to five point zero percent, if we assume a temperature of formation of two hundred forty degrees Celsius, following Sheppard and Gilg. The large range of calculated eighteen OH two O values at the inferred temperatures of alteration is\n7hgg | consistent with boiling of the hydrothermal fluids.\nxwsv | Values of delta D V-SMOW range from negative ninety-two to negative eighty-six percent for nontron- ite, negative sixty-five to negative fifty-two percent for chamosite, negative eighty-five to negative eighty percent for corrensite,\n756b | and negative sixty-nine percent in the single sample of rectorite. There is a gen- eral increase in delta D V-SMOW with depth, consistent with the downhole increase in calculated temperature. Importantly, no accepted hydrogen isotope fractionation factors exist for two to one phyllosilicate minerals in order to calculate initial delta D water values. Gilg and Sheppard proposed approximating the fractionation factors of aluminum-rich and iron- and magnesium-free smectites using kaolinite factors; however, the smectites in this study are iron-rich nontronite. Initial delta D water values in equilibrium with chamosite, using a chlorite-water fractionation factor of alpha equals zero point nine five four from Marumo et al., are negative eighteen point seven to negative nine point eight percent. However, hydrogen isotope fractionation in chlorite is strongly dependent on mineral chemistry, thus adding uncertainty to the initial delta D water values.\n6bx7 | High delta eighteen O water values have been reported for Kuroko-type hydrothermal fluids (up to ten point eight percent; Ohmoto). The shifts in delta eighteen O water to lower values at higher temperatures (e.g., minimum of zero point eight percent in equilibrium with rectorite during chalcopyrite deposition) are typical of the stringer zones\nspl6 | of ancient VMS deposits. The eighteen O-rich fluids at Tinakula may be derived from isotopic exchange with eighteen O-rich rocks, boiling, or direct contributions from magmatic fluids. At high temperatures, water-rock interactions can shift delta eighteen O water but not delta D water. We interpret the combination of higher delta eighteen O water and lower delta D water at Tinakula as a result of subseafloor boiling, which is likely because of the shallow water depths there and the fluid inclusion trapping temperatures, which are close to the boiling curve. The lack of low-PH mineral assemblages and the seawater- dominated S isotope signature suggest that there was no magmatic contribution to the hydrothermal fluids or only a limited one.\n7wzm | Sulfur isotopes\ne9xj | The thirty-four S values of chalcopyrite range from negative zero point eight to two point zero percent and are, on average, slightly lower in the copper-rich chimneys than in the zinc-rich chimneys. Pyrite has thirty-four S values of negative zero point four to three point one percent, and sphalerite has delta thirty-four S of zero point three to three point four percent, both minerals having higher values in zinc-rich chimneys. Iron-poor light-colored sphalerite has slightly higher thirty-four S values than iron-rich dark-colored sphalerite from the same sample. However, there is no systematic spatial variation in thirty-four S of the sulfides along the main north-south-trending fissure at Tinakula, suggesting that the sulfur source was uni- form. Barite from chimney samples yielded delta thirty-four S of nineteen point three to twenty-two point five percent. Anhydrite from the altered volcaniclastic rocks has delta thirty-four S of twenty point six to twenty-two point two percent, whereas gypsum has thirty-four S of twenty-one point three to twenty-one point eight percent, all close to that of seawater sulfate, twenty-one point two four percent, with a slight decrease with depth.",
