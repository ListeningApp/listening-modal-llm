You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

2zmw | It is important to recognize two important assumptions that underlie the logic of this sort of research. First, as noted above, changing the task in small ways can alter the strategy that subjects use, in which case different structures and processes might be used, and hence different areas might be activated. Even a small shift in the location of an activated area could reflect differences in the precise process being used (see, for example, Wilson et al. 1993). Second, note that this logic assumes that the same piece of tissue implements the same structure or process when it is embedded in different combinations of other processes. It is possible that some neural tissue is not dedicated to implementing a single process, and that different neural regions can implement more than one process. If so, the precise locus of activation that reflects the use of a given structure or process can shift, depending on what other structures or processes are used at the same time (for a more detailed discussion of this point, see the epilogue of Kosslyn & Koenig (1995)). We shall return to this general issue shortly.
bf9k | (c) What operation is performed by a specific brain area?
otkr | One also can attempt to characterize the process or processes implemented in a single area. It is clear that any task at all, even one as simple as staring at a fixation point (Petit et al. 1995), involves a neural circuit that draws on multiple brain areas. Moreover, given our uncertainty about the precise relationship between manipulating a variable in a task and changes in under- lying processing, it is difficult to design true 'minimal difference' pairs of tasks, so that only a single process is taxed more by the experimental task than the control task. Instead, the most sensible course for answering such questions has been plotted by Price & Friston (1997), in their 'conjunction analysis' investigations. In these studies they administer multiple tasks (but as few as two) and examine areas of common activation (i.e. that are activated strongly enough to generalize across tasks in a location). For example, they have used this approach to study the shared processing when one names pictures, letters and colours, and reads words. Although their work so far has revealed not individual areas, but sets of areas,

colo | the same approach can in principle allow one to charac- terize in detail the function of individual areas.
d6r4 | However, one problem with all such research rests on the logic of 'affirming the null hypothesis'. One implicitly is assuming that a large host of untested stimuli would have no effect. That is, if one shows that area X responds when the subject is engaged in process Y, this does not mean that area X would not also respond when the subject was engaged in the as-yet-untested process Z. Thus, one's interpretation of what the area does depends on the questions that one puts to it; given only certain stimuli in certain tasks, one can be misled (e.g. into believing that the area has a more specialized function than in fact it does). As far as I can see, there is no way around this problem other than continuing to refine one's theories and one's tests, eventually eliminating possibili- ties and narrowing down the range of viable interpreta- tions of the function of the area in question. The best of all worlds, it seems to me, is to have a theory that makes a very specific prediction and to consider the alternative theories in advance, ensuring that they do not also make the same prediction.
9mrz | (d) Which are the properties of structures that underlie a particular ability?
pk06 | For present purposes, I restrict the term 'structure' to refer to a buffer. A buffer is a physical medium that can retain representations. A representation, in the simplest terms, is a physical pattern that stands for something else. For a physical pattern to count as a representation, it must occur within a system of processes that operate on the pattern. For example, the 'meaning' of patterns of magnetic flux in a computer's random-access memory (RAM) is determined by the way in which the patterns are 'read' by the central processing unit and the impact that such processing has on the production and modifica- tion of yet other patterns of magnetic flux. In this case, the RAM serves as a buffer, which supports physical patterns that represent data. (Note that a program, in this sense, is just data: it is a specification of a sequence that the central processing unit should perform.)
7wn9 | Neuroimaging can be used to ask questions about the nature of structures. For example, Fox et al. (1986) used PET to study the organization of Area 17 (primary visual cortex). In particular, they wanted to collect evidence that human Area 17 is topographically organized. In topographically organized areas, nearby points of space are represented by nearby neurons, and more distant points of space are represented by more distant neurons. (This is true within a given 'cortical magnification' factor; the scaling of input to cortex becomes more coarse towards the periphery, and this must be taken into account when interpreting the physical pattern.) Topogra- phically organized areas are 'picture-like,' but typically are not perfectly isomorphic maps; there are various distortions, such as greater tissue being devoted to the input from the high-resolution foveal parts of the eye. Fox et al. asked subjects to view alternating chessboards that just fell on the fovea, were larger but did not stimulate the fovea (these were doughnut-shaped patterns, with a hole in the middle), or were larger still and did not stimulate an even larger central area. They found that the larger the stimulus, the more anterior was the focus of activation

caos | in Area 17 (i.e. along the calcarine sulcus). This pattern of responses was just as expected if this area were retino- topically mapped, as it is in animals. However, unlike some animals (such as the macaque monkey, which has Area 17 on the lateral surface), in humans this area is medial and the cortex is folded in complex ways. Thus, the PET results were interesting because they revealed the expected functional correlates of what was known about the physical structure of the area (and what had been suggested by earlier studies of visual deficits after local damage to this area; reviewed by Kosslyn 1994).
qrvy | The study by Fox et al. (1986) suggested to me to ask the corresponding question about visual mental imagery. There has been a long debate about whether a picture- like representation underlies the experience of visual mental imagery (see, for example, Kosslyn 1980, 1994; Pylyshyn 1981; Tye 1991). Neuroimaging can be used to ask whether such a structure is evoked during visual imagery, as suggested in figure 1. For example, Kosslyn et al. (1995a) asked subjects to visualize line drawings of common objects under three different conditions. The conditions were the same, except that a different-sized box was shown to the subjects before each, and the subjects were asked to visualize each named drawing during that condition as if it were within the box. Thus, they visualized objects at a very small size (0.25° of visual angle, from their perspective), at a medium size (4º) or at a very large size (16°). After visualizing a drawing, subjects were asked to evaluate a subtle shape property (such as whether in that drawing the left side of the object had been higher than the right), which required them to use imagery (they did not know about the particular judgements to be asked at the time at which they studied the drawings). During scanning, the subjects had their eyes closed and all cues (names of objects to be visualized and shape probes) were delivered auditorily. In the 'listening baseline,' they heard the same kinds of stimuli used in the imagery conditions, but now simply responded when they heard a shape probe; this control was always conducted before the imagery conditions, so the subjects did not know the significance of the terms. In fact, there were four sets of recorded object-probe stimuli, which were rotated so that each occurred equally often in each of the three imagery conditions and in the listening baseline. The data from the imagery conditions were also compared with those from a 'resting' baseline condition, but this is not relevant for present purposes.
pn9j | The results were straightforward. When the imagery data were compared with those from the listening base- line, we found activation in Area 17. Moreover, the locus of maximal activation depended on the size at which the drawings were visualized. We found very posterior activa- tion with the small images, more anterior activation for the medium-sized images, and still more anterior activa- tion for the large images. These results parallel those found in studies of visual perception, and are as expected if this topographically organized structure (part of the visual buffer illustrated in figure 1) is in fact used in visual imagery.
1pmc | It is important to note that the simple finding that an area is activated, even an area with well-characterized properties, is not sufficient to infer that the properties of that area contribute to performance. As noted earlier, the
5z6q | choice of a baseline is crucial, and it is possible that a test condition can seem to produce activation because the baseline condition actually reduces activation (as might happen in visual cortex when one is concentrating on listening to cues). Thus, in the study just described it is important that the imagery results cannot be ascribed to hypometabolism during the baseline condition: this would not explain the selective effects of size in itself on the locus of activation. By varying the sizes of objects in images, we could show directly that the spatial properties of this structure are drawn upon during performance of the task. In addition, we have found that if repetitive trans- cranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is applied over Area 17, which has the effect of temporarily impairing the underlying tissue, subsequent imagery performance is impaired (Kosslyn et al. 1999); thus, in this kind of task, the activation in early visual cortex has a functional role. In short, this research reveals that a spatially organized buffer can in fact be used during visual mental imagery.
yeoh | In addition, this use of neuroimaging can reveal distinctions where none were previously apparent. In this example, other research results have failed to reveal the activation of Area 17 during visual imagery (for recent reviews, see Mellet et al. (1998) and Thompson & Kosslyn (1999)). Many laboratories have now found one or the other result, and thus neither the presence nor absence of the effect can be explained away. Rather, it seems clear that there is more than one type of imagery, and not all types rely on the kind of depictive representation that is associated with our introspections of imagery. This finding does not detract from the fact that a topographi- cally organized structure is used in some types of imagery.
b8hf | (e) Is there more than one way in which a function can be performed?
hntf | In the previous sections we considered how one can discover the processes and structures that give rise to a specific ability. We initially considered studies that provide a 'big picture' overview of the system that underlies a particular ability, and then narrowed our focus to increas- ingly small portions of such a system. One virtue of starting in this way is that it puts the more precise ques- tions in context; it leads one to ask questions about how processing occurs in a system. Each process depends on others for its inputs, and in turn sends its outputs to yet other processes (and structures). Thus, to begin to think about what an individual process or structure does, it is useful to think of it in context.
99fo | Armed with such information, it is straightforward to use neuroimaging to consider another type of question, that of whether there is more than one way to perform a particular function. That is, can different combinations of structures and processes underlie a particular type of performance? Each such combination of structures and processes corresponds to a different strategy. The key is to show that different strategies produce different patterns of activation. For example, Kosslyn et al. (1998) asked whether there is more than one way in which to rotate objects mentally in mental images, one that draws on motor processes (as would occur if one visualized what one would see if one twisted an object in a certain way) and one that does not (as would occur if one visualized what one would see if an external force twisted an object).

hvhm | In this study, subjects performed two types of mental rotation tasks. In one, the subjects performed the classic Shepard & Metzler (1971) task. They saw pairs of three- armed angular shapes, half of which were identical and half of which were mirror images. We administered two conditions. In the test condition, the shapes appeared at different relative orientations, and subjects decided whether the members of each pair were identical or mirror images. We compared brain activation in this condition to that in a baseline condition, which was identical to the test condition except that the shapes in each pair were always presented at the same orientation. In the second mental rotation task, the subjects saw pictures of pairs of hands, and had to decide whether both were the same hand (right or left) or one was right and one was left. In the test condition the hands appeared at different relative orientations, whereas in the baseline condition both members of the pair appeared at the same orientation. Each subject received the baseline and test conditions for one type of stimulus before the two condi- tions for the other type, and the order of presentation was counterbalanced.
863b | Kosslyn et al. (1998) reported that areas involved in motor processes were activated in the hands condition, but not with the Shepard & Metzler stimuli. This finding provided support for the idea that there are at least two distinct ways in which to imagine objects rotating, one that involves motor processes and one that does not. These findings are all the more compelling because prior data showed that some of the areas that were activated during rotation of hands are in fact used in motor control, and showed that other areas were not so involved. Thus, although the mere fact that there were distinct patterns of activation in the two tasks is evidence that they are performed in different ways, the ability to inter- pret the differences adds meat to these bones. A plausible interpretation allows one to eliminate the possibility that the differences were due to chance or due to some inci- dental difference in the experimental designs.
fj24 | A crucial aspect of this logic is that the patterns of acti- vation arising from the two strategies must actually be different. It is not enough to show that, relative to a base- line, in one task areas X-Y are activated, whereas in another task areas P-Q are activated. 'Activation' is a continuous variable, and sub-threshold activation is common. Thus, even though activation in an area might be significant in one task (relative to baseline), and not in another, there might be no difference between the two when they are directly compared. Thus, one must compare the tasks directly, not simply rely on visual comparisons of what was and was not over the threshold under separate conditions.
uz3c | 3. WHEN ARE SPECIFIC TYPES OF INFORMATION PROCESSING USED?
d5bi | One virtue of beginning by asking questions about how information processing is implemented in the brain is that the answers can later be used as a basis for asking and answering other types of questions. We can distinguish two broad classes of questions that can be asked about when specific processing is used. First, one can ask simply whether a given process or structure was drawn upon
