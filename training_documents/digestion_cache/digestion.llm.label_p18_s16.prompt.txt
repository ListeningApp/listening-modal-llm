You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

jt0y | Protease activity, in the tubules of the digestive gland and some parts of the intestine, is low at the start of digestion but builds up towards the end. These enzymes have an optimum pH of 5.5, as with lysosomal enzymes; this is associated with intracellular digestion. Given their location on the apical zones of microvilli, these enzymes appear to be membrane-bound (Boucaud-Camou et al., 1985).
qb7o | Data from Lebesnerais (1985). Lysosomal proteases (cathepsins) are also known as dipeptidyl peptidases (DPPs); they are classified according to letter or number (Agarwal, 1990). Most of the cathepsins become activated at the low pH found in lysosomes. Thus, the activity of this family lies almost entirely within these organelles.
oae5 | Similar distributions of enzymes within the digestive tract of other bivalve species have been identified: grooved carpet shell (Ruditapes decussatus) (Henry, 1987); blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) (Janssen, 1981) and king scallop (Pecten maximus) (Henry et al., 1993; Henry et al., 1991). The movement of food through the digestive tract of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and the sites of enzyme action and uptake of nutrients is shown in Fig. 19.
s0fl | Experiments performed on C. gigas have shown that when the animal is starved or has been out of the water for a long period, all of the cavities are empty (Boucaud-Camou et al., 1985; Lebesnerais, 1985). Whole algae have been observed in the stomach, the main ducts of the digestive gland, the intestine and the rectum. Without being subjected to enzyme action, this material begins to be expelled through the anus, surrounded by mucus. The duration of this stage is strongly influenced by temperature: 6 h at 10℃ and 3 h at 20℃. The animal continuously compensates for this loss by taking in new food. From the beginning of their entry into the ducts of the digestive gland (1-2h), the nutrient particles are exposed to enzymes, although living cells (algae) have been observed for around 6 h after food has reached the stomach and 8-16 h in the intestine.

wqfv | Due to the pronounced endocytotic nature of the digestive caeca, this gland is a major site for the uptake of metal and organic contaminants. A wide range of enzymes that degrade organic contaminants has been detected in the digestive gland of numerous bivalves (Livingstone et al., 2000; Livingstone & Pipe, 1992). Metallothioneins, antioxidant enzymes and oxyradical scavengers, such as glutathione have also been found in these glands (Lowe & Pipe, 1994; Moore, 1991).

7bdk | In molluscs, proteins are taken up by pinocytosis by the acinar epithelium of the digestive ceca/diverticula, following which they are hydrolyzed to amino acids. Experiments on marine bivalves have provided evidence of significant uptake of amino acids via the gills (this is discussed in more detail in a later lecture).
fim0 | 4. Energy storage
ojro | A significant proportion of the energy coming from food is used to cover the metabolic requirements, particularly those associated with reproduction. The reserves are stored either in tissues which are specific to this function or in tissues which have a different physiological function (muscle, digestive gland, haemocytes). In addition to its role in the digestion of food, the digestive gland serves as a site for the storage of metabolic reserves and the control of the distribution of assimilated energy utilised during gametogenesis and during periods of physiological stress (Thompson et al., 1974).
l6t9 | In the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) storage tissues are present in the mantle and in the visceral mass and are made up of two types of cell in juxtaposition: adipogranulous cells (ADG); vesiculous cells with glycogen (vesicular connective tissue (VCT) (Houtteville, 1974; Labet, 1959; Pipe, 1987). The ADG cells (6-20 um) are spherical and occupy the spaces between the VCT. Glycogen is very abundant and accumulates in a voluminous vacuole.
1ujy | The flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) possesses only vesiculous cells with glycogen. The vesicular connective tissue forms a bed which may be highly developed, adhering to the mantle by the external surface and enveloping the visceral mass (gonad and digestive gland).
qzor | A correlation between the activity of the reserve tissue and that of the gonad was established several years ago in the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis). Gabbott et al. (1976) showed that glycogen disappeared progressively during the maturation of the gonad; at the same time both the volume and number of cells of the reserve tissue regressed (Peek et al., 1989) (Fig. 20).
a0by | Studies of the ultrastructure and the cytochemistry revealed the existence of a complex processes of autophagy (a catabolic mechanism that involves degradation of unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular components by intracellular lysosomes) which destroy the ADG (Houtteville, 1974; Pipe, 1987). Metabolites are thus released and

87vz | these products of lysis become distributed around the tubules of the gonad and are absorbed by the young oocytes by pinocytosis. Most of the ADGs are destroyed. The VTCs also lose their glycogen through the action of lysosomes (cellular organelles that contain acid hydrolase enzymes that break down waste materials); this may also entail a total lysis of cells. The activity of glycogen phosphorylase is intense.

l0a3 | Regeneration of reserve tissue begins at the end of the annual period of reproduction (Houtteville, 1974) and is brought about by haemocytes which accumulate between the gonad tubules and then form a loose mesh tissue. The synthesis begins from spring onwards and lasts to the autumn in mussels in northern latitudes, which corresponds both to the annual cessation of spawning and the period when food is most abundant. There is a significant increase in somatic growth following the drop due to the emission of gametes; this appears as a marked increase in the rate of linear growth.
u8nw | The reproductive strategy of oysters is different from that of mussels. There is no relationship between the glycogen reserves and gonad maturation (Gabbott, 1976; Walne, 1970). In the European oyster (Ostrea edulis) gametogenesis and the accumulation of glycogen take place at the same time. The increase in the availability of food in spring meets the energy requirements of the oyster and the increase in temperature at this time accelerates gametogenesis. An identical pattern occurs in the Atlantic oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and the Pacific oyster (C. gigas). In all species, the highest level of glycogen occurs before the resumption of sexual activity, the period where growth in oysters is particularly fast. Glycogen levels drop dramatically after the emission of gametes in summer in species where fecundity is high, but this drop is less marked in the flat oyster ( Ostrea edulis) which has a lower fecundity.
