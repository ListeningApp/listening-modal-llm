You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

yogo | Rethinking the Satisfaction-Contextual Factors Interactions
2285 | Although we found significant interactions between sat- isfaction and contextual factors, the pattern of the relation- ships was the opposite of what we had predicted. Those with higher satisfaction were more responsive to the situa- tional factors than those with lower satisfaction. This un- expected finding suggests the need to review the assump- tions behind our hypotheses.
ys0g | High satisfaction implies high plasticity. We had as- sumed that those with high satisfaction with the group were fulfilling their values, in part, through the group and that this would cause them to be more attached to the group. We expected that their attachment to and depen- dence on the group for continued satisfaction would cause them to engage in voice regardless of contextual factors. That is, we did not expect voice to vary significantly across situations for highly satisfied individuals. The pat- tern illustrated by the plots in Figures 3 and 4, however,
7zvp | reveals that the favorability of group conditions (i.e., small or self-managed groups ) had a strong influence on the voice behavior of highly satisfied individuals. Highly satisfied individuals in large or traditionally-managed groups engaged in the same amount of voice as those who were less satisfied. However, when highly satisfied individuals were in small or self-managed groups, they engaged in more voice than those who were less satisfied. Kahn's (1990) research on "personal engagement" pro- vides one possible explanation for this finding.
ww6u | When individuals feel their work situation has meaning- fulness (perceiving a positive return on their physical, cognitive, or emotional energy), they tend to become per- sonally engaged in their work. That is, they more fully employ themselves in terms of harnessing their physical, cognitive, and emotional energy so that they are more mindful and cognitively vigilant during task performance. Perhaps, in contrast to our initial thinking, satisfied indi- viduals' attachment to the group increased their personal engagement. Perhaps their dependence on the group for continuing satisfaction made them particularly sensitive to contextual information that might bear on the group's well-being. In the context of the present study, favorable conditions based on group size and style of management may convey information to those strongly attached to the group regarding means of dealing with the group's issues. That is, relative to large or traditionally-managed groups, the ambient and discretionary stimuli in small or self- managed groups may signal that it is desirable, appro- priate, and/or at least acceptable to engage in challenging or controversial behavior for the benefit of the group.
hpi6 | Low satisfaction implies low plasticity. We had also expected that individuals with lower satisfaction with the group would be less attached and less dependent on the
4uhb | group for fulfilling their needs. Accordingly, we had ex- pected them to be less self-determined and more influ- enced by situational factors. Instead, our data demon- strated that the voice of those who were less satisfied varied less as a function of situational factors than the voice of those who were more satisfied. The lower respon- siveness of less satisfied individuals to the contextual fac- tors can also be explained in terms of Kahn's (1990) research.
epyi | When individuals do not perceive positive returns on their physical, cognitive, or emotional effort, they may withdraw from their work role. Such personal "disen- gagement" entails an absence of physical, cognitive, and emotional energies directed toward the task. Personal dis- engagement implies behavior that is automatic, detached, and effortless. Personally disengaged individuals are "cognitively unvigilant" and therefore, less responsive to situational stimuli. To the extent that individuals with low satisfaction do not perceive positive returns from their energies, they are likely to be personally disengaged and, thus, should be less responsive to situational factors such as group size and style of management.
y51p | The research on positive affectivity (e.g., Tellegen, 1985) provides a similar explanation for the lower situa- tional responsiveness of less satisfied individuals. Positive affectivity is the global tendency to experience positive emotions and moods. It indicates the extent to which indi- viduals are "positively engaged in the world around them" (George, 1996, p. 146). Perhaps those with low satisfaction (like those with low positive affectivity) are "disengaged" from their environment and, thus, less re- sponsive to situational characteristics. We note that al- though positive affectivity refers to a global personality trait, satisfaction with the group reflects an individual's general attitude toward an object (the group). Thus, whereas low positive affectivity relates to disengagement from the environment in general, low satisfaction with the group relates to disengagement within a particular group.
x95m | Overall, our results suggest that voice will be highest when personal factors (high self-esteem or high satisfac- tion) are combined with favorable situational factors (small group size or self-management). Although the above provides a plausible explanation for our unexpected findings, the logic is post hoc and accordingly should be examined in future research.
yfum | Significant Control Variables
ppx4 | In addition to the nature of the satisfaction-context interactions, we were also surprised by the relatively large amount of variance explained by the control variables (R2 = . 07). In retrospect, however, several of these relation- ships could have been predicted in advance and perhaps even included as a priori hypotheses. The sex differences
qf11 | literature, for example, suggests that males tend to partici- pate more in groups than females (Johnson & Schulman, 1989), especially in task-related as opposed to socio-emo- tional behaviors (Piliavian & Martin, 1978). This litera- ture also suggests that males tend to initiate communica- tions and provide their opinions, whereas females tend to be more reactive and strive for consensus (Strodtbeck & Mann, 1956). Finally, this literature suggests that females may have less influence than males in mixed-sex groups (Izraeli, 1985; Ridgeway, 1982); thus, females may have lower confidence that they will be "heard" above mem- bers of the traditional majority. We note that a similar argument could be made for a relationship between eth- nicity and voice. Overall, therefore, the literature suggests that males and Whites would tend to engage in more voice than females and non-Whites.
8oqt | The relationship between education and job status and voice could have also been predicted a priori. Education imparts general knowledge that translates into a greater ability to recognize problems or opportunities and to offer a greater number of possible solutions. Education may also increase an individual's confidence that he or she possesses the skills and knowledge necessary in order to make suggestions at work (Farr & Ford, 1990). Thus, it is probable that those who possess more knowledge and confidence will be more likely to engage in voice. Job status reflects access to information and the freedom one has regarding behavior on the job. The more status, the more information and latitude one has regarding accept- able job behaviors. Suggestions that "buck-the-system" or challenge the status-quo may require such latitude. In addition, higher job status may provide a sense of power as well as a sense of responsibility for outcomes that facilitate expression of voice. This is different for individ- uals in low-level jobs who may have less access to infor- mation, fewer degrees of freedom regarding their behavior at work, and who may feel less responsible for group outcomes.
