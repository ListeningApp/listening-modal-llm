You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

htre | Bulk compositions of the seafloor chimneys and mineralized volcanic breccias are listed in Table 1. The seafloor chimneys
da3c | contain abundant <LATEX>Z n</LATEX> up to 52.60 wt % (avg 19.20 wt %; <LATEX>\left. n = 3 6 \right)</LATEX> and Cu up to 30.00 wt % (avg 5.82 wt %; <LATEX>\left. n = 3 6 \right)</LATEX> but generally low Pb (<0.01-2.93 wt % Pb; avg 0.35 wt %; <LATEX>n = 3 6 ;</LATEX> Fig. 9) compared to other modern back-arc basin sulfide deposits (cf. Hannington et al., 2005; Monecke et al., 2016). Calcium concentrations are low in the chimneys (avg 0.06 wt %; <LATEX>\left. n = 3 6 \right) ,</LATEX> but <LATEX>B a</LATEX> (avg 6.49 wt %; <LATEX>\left. n = 3 6 \right)</LATEX> and Sr (avg 2,157 ppm; <LATEX>n = 3 6 ;</LATEX> up to 0.85 wt % in barite-rich samples) are high. The SiO2 contents average 11.67 wt % <LATEX>\left( n = 3 6 \right) ,</LATEX> but one chimney contains 75.09 wt % SiO2 together with 1.75 wt % Ba. The Cu-rich chimneys have high Mo (avg 343 ppm; n = 2) and In (avg 262 ppm; <LATEX>\left. n = 2 \right) ,</LATEX> with high Au (9,260 ppb) present in one sample. The Zn-rich samples contain very high Ga (up to 1,540 ppm), Ge (up to 99 ppm), Hg (up to 95 ppm), and Se (up to 20 ppm). Concentrations of Ag, Sb, As, and Au are also higher than in the Cu-rich chimneys, although high As is found in both Zn- and Cu-rich samples. Mercury concentra- tions are especially high in samples containing marcasite and late sphalerite + galena. The four sampled barite-rich chim- neys also have high Pb (avg 7,073 ppm), As (avg 299 ppm), Sb (avg 82 ppm), Au (avg 2,038 ppb), and <LATEX>\mathrm { A g }</LATEX> (avg 121 ppm). Statistical correlations between the different trace elements clearly reflect the higher (>250℃) and lower temperatures <LATEX>\left( < 2 5 0 ^ { \circ } C \right)</LATEX> of the Cu-rich and Zn-rich assemblages, respec- tively (App. Figs. A21, A22), as well as various lattice substitu- tions in the corresponding minerals (e.g., Cd in sphalerite, Sr in barite, As and Sb in Pb-rich sulfosalts, etc .; App. Table A2; cf. Hannington et al., 2005; Monecke et al., 2016). Gallium is incorporated mainly in galena in low-temperature assem- blages, whereas in higher-temperature assemblages it mainly resides in sphalerite with moderate to high Fe contents. Arse- nic is high in low-temperature assemblages, reflecting the presence of As in low-temperature minerals such as galena and sulfosalts. In a single sample containing secondary born- ite (chalcopyrite-rich chimney GMA13-010), Ag concentra- tions are 1,253 ppm. Contents of Co, Ni, Sn, W, Bi, and Te are generally below detection limits in all samples, unlike other arc-related hydrothermal systems that commonly contain dis- crete Bi and Te minerals, e.g., Monecke et al. (2016).
890q | Subseafloor mineralization consists of (1) unconsolidated and locally hydrothermally cemented chimney talus (Fig. 10A, B), (2) chimney talus, mixed with altered volcanic clasts, that is generally hydrothermally cemented (Fig. 10C), (3) chim- ney talus associated with oxidized intervals (Fig. 10D), (4) dis- seminated to patchy sulfides (chalcopyrite, pyrite, sphalerite) within altered volcaniclastic rocks (Fig. 10E, F), and (5) sul- fide minerals associated with late sulfate veins that extend to maximum depths of ~21 m b.s.l. (e.g., Figs. 3E, 4G, H; App. Fig. A2). Drilling shows that the majority of the mineraliza- tion at Tinakula comprises chimney talus that occurs directly beneath the unconsolidated volcaniclastic material (generally between 0.6 and 5.3 m b.s.f.). The oxidized intervals contain variable amounts of sulfide material (mostly chimney talus). Disseminated and vein-controlled sulfide (pyrite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite) occur in <LATEX>t h e \quad u p p e r \sim 0 . 5</LATEX> to 2.6 m of most drill holes (e.g., Fig. 4F, G). Seven samples of mineralized volcanic breccia down to 5.8 m b.s.f. contain mostly pyrite (9.7-30.1 wt % sulfide S) with minor anhydrite accounting for ~0.1 to 0.5 wt % sulfate S. Taking into account the dilution from wall rock, mineralized portions of the

hb4s | buried sulfide mineralization is estimated to have an area at least three times larger than that of the seafloor chimneys and mounds, although more drilling is required to establish the full extent and continuity.
cqq2 | The chimney talus and oxidized intervals appear continu- ous between drill holes at sites A, B, and D, but mineraliza- tion was not encountered in the two drill holes at site C (Figs. 11, 12). Since the drill platform required relatively flat slopes, drilling at this site was limited to the areas beside the known chimney mounds. Therefore, the occurrence of chimney talus below the mounds was not confirmed at the location. The
