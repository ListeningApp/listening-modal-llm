        "content": "vz32 | In summary, the descriptions of Kramer and Pollnow \"on a hyperkinetic disease of infancy\" meet all three main symptoms of ADHD and two additional DSM-four-TR criteria. In particular, their description of motor symptoms is\nncb0 | highly consistent with the current classification systems. The introductory remark of Kramer and Pollnow that the pathological manifestation of the disorder had been known previously, but had not been recognized as a distinct disorder which had to be differentiated from other disorders with similar symptoms, is consistent with the historical literature. In summary, Kramer and Pollnow established a concept of the hyperkinetic disease that closely resembles the current concept of ADHD.\n8mp0 | The first treatment of hyperactivity (Charles Bradley nineteen hundred-two to nineteen seventy-nine)\nxjyk | In nineteen thirty-seven, Charles Bradley reported a positive effect of stimulant medication in children with various behavior disorders. Bradley was medical director of the Emma Pendleton Bradley Home, today called Bradley Hospital, in East Providence, Rhode Island, which was founded by his great-uncle George Bradley to treat neurologically impaired children. Apart from children with definite neurological disorders or residual effects of encephalitis, there were children hospitalized with \"emotional problems\" and major difficulties in learning and behavior. Some of these children would possibly be diagnosed with ADHD today. Bradley's discovery of the improvement by stimulants of the behavior of children was based on a chance finding during his neurological examinations. Bradley performed pneumoencephalograms in order to examine structural brain abnormalities. This usually caused severe headaches, which were supposed to be the result of a significant loss of spinal fluid. Bradley attempted to treat the headaches by stimulating the choroid plexus with benzedrine which was \"the most potent stimulant available at the time.\" However, benzedrine had a negligible effect on the headaches, but caused a striking improvement in behavior and school performance in some of the children. Bradley subsequently started a systematic trial in thirty children of his hospital and observed remarkable alterations in behavior. \"The most spectacular change in behavior brought about by the use of benzedrine was the remarkably improved school performance of approximately half the children.\" The children \"were more interested in their work and performed it more quickly and accurately.\" In addition, some decrease in motor activity was usually noted in the children who also \"became emotionally subdued without, however, losing interest in their surroundings.\" Bradley was surprised at this effect. \"It appears paradoxical that a drug known to be a\nmt0f | The history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\nawab | stimulant should produce subdued behavior in half of the children. It should be borne in mind, however, that portions of the higher levels of the central nervous system have inhibition as their function, and that stimulation of these portions might indeed produce the clinical picture of reduced activity through increased voluntary control.\" He later identified children who were most likely to benefit from benzedrine treatment as \"characterized by short attention span, dyscalculia, mood lability, hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and poor memory.\" These features are nowadays associated with ADHD. Bradley's observations of stimulant effects in hyperactive children were revolutionary and are considered important discoveries in psychiatric treatment.\nixcc | Methylphenidate (Leandro Panizzon)\n8p6h | Although Bradley and his colleagues published their pioneering discovery in prominent journals, their reports had almost no influence on research and practice for at least twenty-five years. This was possibly due to the wide influence of psychoanalysis at that time and the assumption that behavioral disorders have no biological basis and require psychological interventions. However, further investigations into this issue, for example by Laufer et al., produced growing interest in stimulant treatment of hyperkinetic children. At present, stimulant medication is the most frequently used treatment of children with ADHD. Benzedrine was the first stimulant drug administered to hyperactive children and is no longer in use. Methylphenidate is nowadays considered as drug of first choice. The compound was first synthesized in nineteen forty-four by Leandro Panizzon and marketed as \"Ritalin\" by Ciba-Geigy Pharmaceutical Company in nineteen fifty-four. The name \"Ritalin\" derives from the first name of Panizzon's wife, i.e. Marguerite or \"Rita.\" Methylphenidate is \"a piperazine-substituted phenylisopropylamine that is traditionally related to amphetamine\" and was initially used in the treatment of \"a number of indications such as chronic fatigue, lethargy, depressive states, disturbed senile behavior, psychosis associated with depression and narcolepsy.\" \"However, its most impressive effect has been the reduction of symptoms seen in ADHD.\" Methylphenidate is regarded by now as the most effective psychostimulant and is the most frequently\npmgl | prescribed drug in the treatment of ADHD.\n90no | Minimal brain damage",
