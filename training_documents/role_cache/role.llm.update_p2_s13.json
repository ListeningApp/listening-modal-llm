        "content": "8uji | Pattern of flesh firmness and crispness at harvest and post-harvest\ndf3e | Regarding the changes in flesh firmness and crispness during cold storage, three extremity dynamics were distinctly observed. Type I: acceptable flesh firmness (seven point zero kilograms per square centimeter) or crispness (zero point seven kilograms per square centimeter) lost already at harvest. Type II: acceptable flesh firmness or crispness maintained until the sixth month after a rapid softening during the first month of cold storage. Type III: acceptable flesh firmness or crispness maintained after the sixth months of cold storage with constantly slow softening rate. Ethylene production in type I hybrids was higher than that in types II and III during cold storage, whereas type III hybrids produced lowest level of ethylene. These suggested that low ethylene emission was associated with flesh firmness and crispness retainability.\n53eu | QTL identification using BSA-seq\na5u1 | By the three segregant bulks from the three phenotype types of flesh firmness retainability, ten, five and seventeen significant QTLs for flesh firmness retainability were identified from bulk pairs of type III versus type I, type III versus type II, and type II versus type I, respectively. These QTLs were located on chromosomes three, eleven, twelve, fifteen, sixteen and seventeen. Of these QTLs, F-F zero three point two\nry7u | and F-H zero three point one overlapped at twenty-eight point five to twenty-nine point eight megabases of chromosome three, while F-Z sixteen point one, F-F sixteen point one, F-H sixteen point one and F-H sixteen point two overlapped at thirty-eight point four to thirty-nine point five megabases of chromosome sixteen. From the three bulks of flesh crispness retainability, eight, eleven, and eleven QTLs were mapped from bulk pairs of type III versus type I, type II versus type I, and type III versus type II, respectively. These QTLs were\n5mda | Months after harvest\ni4li | mapped on chromosomes two, three, six, ten, eleven, fourteen and sixteen. Of these QTLs, C-H zero three point one, C-F zero three point two and C-F zero three point three overlapped at twenty-eight point four to twenty-nine point seven megabases of chromosome three. Similarly, C-F sixteen point one, C-H sixteen point one and C-H sixteen point three overlapped at thirty-eight point four to thirty-nine point five megabases of chromosome sixteen. In addition, several QTLs for flesh firmness retainability on chromosome three and sixteen\nr8sm | overlapped with those for flesh crispness retainability, such as F-F zero three point two, F-H zero three point one, C-H zero three point one, C-F zero three point two, and C-F zero three point three at twenty-eight point four to twenty-nine point eight megabases of chromosome three. The overlap of these QTLs indicated the genetic linkage between flesh firmness and crispness retainability.\ncuin | Genomics-assisted prediction of apple storability one thousand twenty-five\nn1i7 | Prediction of candidate genes for flesh firmness and crispness retainability at post-harvest\n0r5m | By the RNA-seq analysis, forty-seven thousand two hundred twenty-two unigenes were identified, of which three thousand seven hundred fifty differentially expressed genes were detected\nne2o | two thousand twenty The Authors.

As expected, a clear transcriptomic signature of both the flesh firmness type I and the flesh crispness type I hybrids was the two point eighteen- to fifty-six point nineteen-fold high expression of cell wall degradation-related genes. These genes included MdBGL, MdBGAL, and MdBGLU. On the contrary, the expression of four cell wall-associated genes was significantly higher (two point twenty-six- to nine point ten-fold difference) in flesh crispness retainable type III and type II hybrids than in crispness unretainable type I hybrids, that is MdPGIP twelve, MdGLCAT fourteen B, MdGWD one and a cellulolyase gene.",
