You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

oksu | plaques; high-magnitude, stable flow within the casted region, with no plaque development; and disturbed flow in the region distal to the cast, which induces the development of stable plaques21,24. This mouse model demonstrates flow-dependent atherosclerosis development within a single carotid artery21,24 (Fig. 2b). Both animal models have been used in numerous laboratories worldwide and are extremely valuable tools to study flow-dependent endothelial cell function and athero- genic mechanisms in vivo. One major difference between the models is that in the PCL model, atherosclerotic plaques form throughout the entire length (~1 cm) of the LCA, whereas the contralateral RCA remains healthy and serves as a control. Therefore, this model provides sufficient endothelial samples from the LCA and RCA from the same animal to conduct omics studies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) or bulk RNA sequencing, unlike the cuff model, which provides relatively smaller amounts of endothelial samples15.
wtow | In addition to these mouse models of disturbed flow-induced ath- erosclerosis, the use of zebrafish has emerged as a genetically tractable model to examine early events of atherogenesis 25,26. Combined with genetic manipulation approaches to reduce blood flow, zebrafish mod- els provide further evidence that disturbed flow causes atherosclerosis under hypercholesterolaemic conditions27-31. An interesting question is whether disturbed flow-induced atherosclerosis occurs with other risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, independently of hypercholesterolaemia.
o22k | In vitro flow models
nwfz | Numerous in vitro models of shear stress, including the cone-and-plate viscometer, the parallel-plate flow chamber and the microfluidic chan- nel have been developed and have been reviewed previously14,32-34 These in vitro bioreactors expose endothelial cells to various shear con- ditions and can be used to determine the detailed mechanisms of shear stress-dependent endothelial function in a well-defined biomechanical environment (Fig. 2c,d).
nvfy | Blood flow regulates endothelial function
mror | Endothelial cells in vivo are constantly exposed to various haemo- dynamic factors, especially shear stress associated with blood flow, which potently regulates nearly all facets of endothelial cell function. Blood flow regulates vascular tone; endothelial barrier permeability; angiogenesis; endothelial cell proliferation, death, differentiation, senescence, metabolism, inflammation and morphology; and extra- cellular matrix remodelling13,14,16. Defining the mechanisms by which stable flow protects endothelial homeostatic function and disturbed flow induces endothelial dysfunction is crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of flow-dependent atherosclerosis and developing novel therapeutic approaches.
zlxc | Blood flow potently regulates endothelial barrier function. Stable flow protects endothelial barrier permeability, whereas disturbed flow promotes endothelial barrier dysfunction13,14,16. Stable flow regulates endothelial cell permeability by promoting tight junction stability via control of occludin expression and attachment to the actin cytoskeleton, as well as control of adherens junction integrity via phosphorylation and degradation of VE-cadherin35-37. Disturbed flow increases both endothe- lial cell proliferation and apoptosis via multiple mechanisms, including downregulation of the expression of the tumour suppressor protein p53 and inhibition of the anti-apoptotic kinase AKT38-41. Stable flow induces autophagy through a sirtuin 1-dependent and FOXO1-dependent pathway, providing a cytoprotective mechanism for endothelial cells42. Disturbed flow induces endothelial cell senescence through a
k0bw | p53-dependent and sirtuin 1-dependent mechanism, thereby reducing endothelial cell migration and disrupting arterial repair mechanisms43.
aq5a | Blood flow also regulates metabolism and redox reactions in endothelial cells. Whereas stable flow reduces endothelial glucose uptake and metabolic activity as well as the expression of genes encod- ing proteins involved in glycolysis, disturbed flow promotes glycolytic metabolism, causing a markedly different metabolomic profile and increased mitochondrial fission44-47. Disturbed flow also increases the endothelial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress48-51. This process is mediated by bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), which induces increased production of superoxide via NADPH oxidases and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling- dependent mechanisms48-53. Endothelial ROS generation in response to disturbed flow increases vascular oxidative stress and LDL oxidation in the context of atherosclerosis and hypertension 51,54-57
sc5y | Disturbed flow potently induces endothelial cell inflammation and transdifferentiation of endothelial cells, which have crucial roles in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Disturbed flow induces endothelial inflammation by increasing the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules (VCAM1, ICAM1 and E-selectin), which mediate monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells16. Activation of nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) signalling is crucial in disturbed flow-induced inflammation58. In addition, disturbed flow promotes the expression of cytokines and chemokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and CCL5 (refs. 58,59). Disturbed flow can induce the transdifferentiation of endothelial cells to mesenchymal cells (endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition; EndMT) and immune-like cells (endothelial-to-immune cell transition; EndIT)15. The pathophysiological importance of EndMT in disturbed flow- induced atherosclerosis has been demonstrated, but the validation and relevance of EndIT in atherosclerosis remain to be determined60. Increased endothelial cell turnover under disturbed flow condi- tions also coincides with increased transcription of genes encoding angiogenic factors and with increased neovascularization 61-63.
0yab | Morphologically, endothelial cells adopt an elongated, fusiform shape and align to the direction of flow under stable flow conditions 32,64. By contrast, endothelial cells under disturbed flow or no-flow static conditions adopt a polygonal, 'cobblestone' shape without uniform alignment65,66. These morphological changes are accompanied by actin cytoskeleton remodelling from a pattern of bands encircling the periphery of the cell to a pattern of thick, central stress fibres aligned in the direction of shear stress 67,68. These cytoskeletal changes alter intercellular stress and cellular traction forces, affecting subsequent cellular strain and status 69,70. In addition, shear stress induces subcellu- lar structural changes, such as changes in nuclear shape and relocation of the Golgi apparatus towards the upstream flow direction71,72.
w95z | Mechanosensors and mechanotransduction
0i1k | Endothelial cells transduce flow signals into intracellular changes through the processes of mechanosensing and mechanosignal transduction. Endothelial cells recognize fluid shear stress through mechanosensors located in the apical and basal surfaces of the cell, in cell-cell junctions and intracellularly73 (Fig. 3). On the apical surface, the mechanosensors include plasma membrane proteins, such as the cation channels PIEZO1 and P2X purinoreceptor 4, NOTCH1, protein kinases, G protein-coupled receptors and plexin D1, as well as membrane- associated structures, such as caveolae, the glycocalyx and primary cilia74-87. PIEZO1 is an inward-rectifying calcium channel present in many cell types that opens in response to mechanical force88. In endothelial cells, PIEZO1 mediates shear stress magnitude-dependent increases in
