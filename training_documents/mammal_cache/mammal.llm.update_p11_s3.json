        "content": "90no | Given the role of CTCF in regulating the three-dimensional organization of the genome, we conducted an enrichment analysis of topologically associating domain boundaries and loop boundaries identified in both human and mouse cell lines. We found that both TAD and loop boundaries demonstrated significant enrichment of negatively life span-related C P Gs, false discovery rate equals three times ten to the negative four for TAD boundaries and false discovery rate equals six point seven times ten to the negative four for loop boundaries in various cell lines such as olfactory receptor cells and the human fibroblasts IMR ninety and HFFc six.\njt0y | C P Gs linked to life span in various taxonomic orders and tissues\nqb7o | To pinpoint C P Gs associated with log maximum life span independently of phylogenetic order or tissue type, we conducted a meta-analysis of E W A S findings from twenty-five distinct strata comprising phylogenetic order and tissue type. Using a nonparametric meta-analysis approach, rank P value, we assessed the E W A S of life span, meta dot lifespan, in these strata to identify C P Gs unconfounded by tissue type or phylogenetic order. Our meta dot lifespan results demonstrated significant overlap with the previously mentioned E W A Ss of life",
