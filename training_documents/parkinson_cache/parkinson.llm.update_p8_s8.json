The RME-Eight mutation is also predicted to affect overall endosomal trafficking, even in the soma and postsynaptic compartment, unlike the synapse-specific dysfunction predicted for auxilin. Recently, the link between RME-Eight and Parkinson's disease has been muddied by an independent analysis of the same Mennonite family which did not find RME-Eight mutations. Instead, all the affected individuals were identified to carry mutations in TMEM two hundred thirty, which also functions in the endolysosomal system, perhaps at synapses. Hence, further studies are warranted to confirm the genetic link between RME-Eight and Parkinson's disease. Still, evaluating the RME-Eight mediated endolysosomal system dysfunction might provide valuable insights in understanding Parkinson's disease.\nc3lz | Two other major synaptic endocytic proteins besides the DNAJ family that are implicated in Parkinson's disease are synaptojanin-One (SYNJ1) and endophilin A family. SYNJ1 is a Sac domain-containing protein with two different phosphatase domains; Five-phosphatase and Sac One which target different phosphoinositide phosphates. Five-phosphatase regulates synaptic vesicle endocytosis by dephosphorylating PI Four Five P Two to facilitate uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles in cooperation with Hsc seventy and auxilin, whereas Sac One domain has gained importance due to its link to Parkinson's disease. The p.R two hundred fifty-eight Q missense mutations in the Sac domain were identified independently in two consanguineous families of Italian and Iranian origin. Homozygous missense mutations of SYNJ1 Sac domain are noted to cause autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease with extrapyramidal features identical to patients with auxilin mutations. Interestingly, they responded poorly to L-dopa treatment, indicating the need for preclinical studies to understand the exact pathomechanisms. Recent observations by Cao et al. suggest that the Sac domain plays a previously unappreciated role in clathrin uncoating. Mice with SYNJ1 Sac mutations, knock-in, developed Parkinson's disease-like characteristics and featured synaptic endocytosis defects, including accumulating of clathrin-coated vesicles. Furthermore, elevated auxilin and parkin levels were noted in these mice, suggesting the profound effect of Sac mutations on other proteins linked to Parkinson's disease. Studies on fibroblasts from patients with SYNJ1 mutations suggested defective endocytic trafficking. Other studies have shed light on the involvement of SYNJ1 in regulating synaptic autophagy. Mutations in the Sac One domain of SYNJ1 in both Drosophila neurons and PARK twenty patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells severely affected synaptic autophagosome formation but not endocytosis. This discrepancy and the precise relationship between synaptic vesicle endocytosis and synaptic autophagy remains to be clarified. However, the Drosophila model revealed loss of dopaminergic neurons, providing evidence for the contribution of synaptic autophagy defects in pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Considering its dual enzymatic activity, SYNJ1 is also believed to play a role in fast endophilin-mediated, clathrin-independent endocytosis which is an alternative to clathrin-mediated endocytosis and several other processes. Further studies are warranted to understand if SYNJ1 exerts its effects on Parkinson's disease pathogenesis through any of the alternative endocytic pathways.\n8bwk | Four. Autophagy in Parkinson's disease; cause and effect, hand in hand:\nez9s | Four point one PINK1 and Parkin:\nmqot | SYNJ1 recruitment to endocytic membrane is facilitated by endophilin A, a protein drawing attention in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis for a while, despite its locus variation being just identified as a risk factor. This is because of endophilin A's close association with SYNJ1 and its link to the most important proteins involved in Parkinson's disease. One of our earlier studies indicated that overexpression of alpha-synuclein decreases endophilin A levels, while deletion of synucleins had the opposite effect. As noted in SYNJ1 knock-ins, endophilin knockout also leads to synaptic vesicle endocytosis defects, accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles, elevation of parkin levels, and other parkinsonian features. Gain-of-function mutations in LRRK2 hyper-phosphorylate endophilin A, the fly homolog, leading to synaptic endocytosis dysfunction. LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of endophilin A is also noted to regulate synaptic autophagy. Owing to the relatively higher frequency of LRRK2 mutations and its involvement in sporadic Parkinson's disease, endophilin A may prove to be another crucial protein involved in Parkinson's disease.\noc99 | Neurons need to constantly maintain homeostasis by preserving healthy organelles and functional proteins, while selectively capturing and eliminating damaged organelles and misfolded proteins. Autophagy, an integral component of the endolysosomal system, is an intracellular proteostasis pathway that performs this house-cleaning function. It was initially identified in cell lines to function in maintaining energy homeostasis during critical periods of development and in response to nutrient depletion. Intriguingly, nutrient depletion does not induce autophagy in neurons, but a complete lack of autophagy can cause lethal neurodegeneration, emphasizing its important role in survival. Since neurons are postmitotic and long-lived, they are particularly vulnerable to accumulation of toxic proteins. In addition, greater dependency of neurons on mitochondria for energy instead of glycolytic pathways demands constant mitochondrial turnover, leading to many malfunctioning mitochondria. Both these factors play major roles in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.\n```",
