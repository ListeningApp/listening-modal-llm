We examine the safety, effectiveness, and acceptability of self-managed medication abortion provided using online telemedicine.\njc47 | Methods We retrospectively examined records of the outcomes of abortions provided by the sole online telemedicine service providing self-managed medication abortion in the U.S. We calculated the prevalence of successful medication abortion (the proportion who ended their pregnancy without surgical intervention); the prevalence of serious adverse events (the proportions who received intravenous antibiotics and blood transfusion); and assessed whether any deaths were reported to the service. We also examined the proportions who were satisfied and felt self-management was the right choice.\nko3c | Findings Between March twentieth twenty eighteen and March twentieth twenty nineteen, abortion medications were mailed to four thousand five hundred eighty-four people and three thousand one hundred eighty-six (seventy percent) provided follow-up information. Among these, two thousand seven hundred ninety-seven (eighty-eight percent) confirmed use of the medications and provided outcome information, while three hundred eighty-nine (twelve percent) confirmed non-use. Overall, ninety-six point four percent of those who used the medications reported successfully ending their pregnancy without surgical intervention and one percent reported treatment for any serious adverse event. Among these, zero point six percent reported receiving a blood transfusion, and zero point five percent reported receiving intravenous antibiotics. No deaths were reported to the service by family, friends, the authorities, or the media. Among two thousand two hundred sixty-eight who provided information about their experience, ninety-eight point four percent were satisfied and ninety-five point five percent felt self-management was the right choice.\nxek3 | Interpretation Self-managed medication abortion provided using online telemedicine can be highly effective with low rates of serious adverse events. In light of increasingly restricted access to in-clinic abortion in the U.S., it may offer a safe and effective option for those who cannot access clinical care.\nbbpr | Introduction\n5zyf | Abortion access is approaching cross-roads in the United States. The Supreme Court is currently considering an enacted Mississippi law that bans abortion at fifteen weeks' gestation and recently allowed a six-week ban in effect in Texas to stand. Although the right to choose established by Roe v. Wade in nineteen seventy-three still currently stands,\n9own | access to abortion in the clinic setting is moving further out of reach due to restrictive state legislation. One hundred and eight abortion restrictions were enacted in state legislatures in twenty twenty-one, more than any other year since Roe. These laws make clinical abortion harder to access by imposing waiting periods and medically unnecessary medical tests on patients and requiring clinics and providers to conform to unnecessary administrative regulations.\nbqfb | Research in context\nwwdt | Evidence before this study\nmn1r | In many U.S. states, access to abortion in the clinic setting is becoming increasingly restricted. In the face of dwindling access, there is evidence that people in the United States are self-managing their abortions (i.e. sourcing and conducting them outside of the formal healthcare setting). While self-managed abortions have been happening in North America for centuries using botanicals, and later misoprostol, one important contemporary method of self-management is the use of online telemedicine to provide the abortion medications mifepristone and misoprostol. No studies, however, have examined the safety, effectiveness, and acceptability of self-managed medication abortion using this model in the United States. We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE and PubMed using the MeSH terms 'Abortion', 'Self-managed', 'United States', 'Safety' and 'Effectiveness' with no language or date restrictions, and found no relevant reports as of September twenty twenty-one. Using data from the sole online telemedicine organization that provides self-managed medication abortion to people in the United States, we provide here an analysis of the reported outcomes of self-managed abortions provided between March twentieth twenty eighteen and March twentieth twenty nineteen. We report both the proportion that resulted in successful termination of pregnancy and the proportion that resulted in serious adverse events. We also describe the acceptability of these self-managed abortions based on user experience.\n5vqw | Added value of this study\nmeyw | This study presents the first evidence that self-managed medication abortion provided through online telemedicine in the United States is effective, acceptable to users, and has a very low rate of serious adverse outcomes. This evidence adds to a global body of data showing that self-managed medication abortion is safe and effective. In this study, seventy percent of those to whom medications were shipped provided follow-up information about their abortions, and among these two thousand seven hundred ninety-seven (eighty-eight percent) confirmed use of the medications and provided outcome information, while three hundred eighty-nine (twelve percent) confirmed non-use. Among those who used the medications, ninety-six percent were able to end their pregnancies without surgical intervention from a clinical provider, a rate comparable with the in-clinic setting. Treatment for serious adverse events was uncommon with one percent receiving a blood transfusion or intravenous antibiotics. No deaths were reported to the service by family, friends, the authorities, or the media. Among the two thousand two hundred sixty-eight people who provided information about their experience, ninety-eight percent expressed satisfaction with their abortion experience and ninety-six percent said it was the right choice.\n2e62 | Implications of all the available evidence\n75y3 | As restrictive abortion legislation continues to create substantial barriers to in-clinic abortion in many U.S. states, abortion self-managed outside of the formal healthcare setting is an important option for those who\ns2g2 | cannot or prefer not to access clinical care. This study provides key evidence for clinicians, policymakers, and the public that safe, effective, self-managed medication abortion is available in the United States. However, people who self-manage are still vulnerable to legal risks and in some states unjust prosecutions have occurred. Rather than being subject to criminalization, self-managed abortion should be a legitimate part of a spectrum of options for abortion care that must be made available in the United States.\nq1q2 | Recent research suggests that one possible consequence of increasing barriers to in-clinic abortion is that more people will self-manage. A self-managed abortion is one that takes place outside of the formal healthcare setting, and includes a spectrum of methods, such as the abortion pills mifepristone and/or misoprostol, menstrual extraction, botanicals, herbs, vitamins, beverages, and ingestion of toxic substances and physical injury. Self-managed abortion has been happening in North America for centuries and recent estimates suggest that approximately seven percent of U.S. women have attempted a self-managed abortion in their lifetime.\n```",
