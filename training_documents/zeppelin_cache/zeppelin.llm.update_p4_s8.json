Most rock musicians at some point have complained about industry or critical simplifications of their work, a protest which usually tends to enforce their reputations all the more. \"You cannot classify anything,\" Plant avowed to Chuck Klosterman. \"Classification is a killer.\" Most artists in any medium, indeed, will resist being slotted into some or other stereotype, saying that their work is only their self-expression and that any generalization will miss the personal subtleties they try to impart to it; yet the defense of artistic freedom on the part of the creator is about as predictable as the inclination to format and sort on the part of the spectator or listener. As Led Zeppelin's players sought to demonstrate that they had more to offer than the one-dimensional boogie of Grand Funk-Led Zeppelin Three was an early example of this-professional and\nb780 | Led Zeppelin FAQ\nccmb | amateur audiences strained to define their songs as something, and heavy metal was still the handiest option.\nma93 | The Zeppelin-as-heavy-metal controversy says more about the rapid evolution of rock 'n' roll aesthetics over twenty or thirty years than any objective parameters of what the music itself sounds like. Critic Chuck Eddy's Stairway to Hell compendium goes so far as to include Miles Davis's Live Evil as one of \"The Five Hundred Best Heavy Metal Albums in the Universe,\" in with records by Metallica, Guns N' Roses, and, inescapably, Led Zeppelin. The origins of the genre are usually traced back to the Steppenwolf song \"Born to Be Wild,\" with its celebration of \"heavy metal thunder,\" although other histories document the influences of Iron Butterfly, Vanilla Fudge, Cream, the Who, Jimi Hendrix, the Yardbirds, and the pioneering distorted guitar chords heard in the Kinks' \"You Really Got Me\" and \"All Day and All of the Night\" (both nineteen sixty-four). The very loud and sometimes deliberately primitive \"acid rock\" of the late nineteen sixties, including the work of Blue Cheer, the Stooges, and the MC Five (Motor City Five), is also factored into some accounts. Of all the names linked to heavy metal's inception, it's notable that session man Jimmy Page played for two (the Kinks and the Who), was an official member of one (the Yardbirds), and that Led Zeppelin shared bills with two more (Iron Butterfly and Vanilla Fudge). Categorizing any music as heavy metal was perhaps no more than a convenient shorthand for fans and writers facing an expansive range of young people's pop music from nineteen sixty-five onward-a way. to distinguish it from the sophisticated harmonies of the Beatles and the Beach Boys, the acoustic introspections of Bob Dylan and Donovan, the soulful grooves of James Brown and Marvin Gaye, the ebullient melodicism of the Supremes and the Four Tops, the country-flavored craft of Creedence Clearwater Revival and the Band, or the bubblegum confections of the Archies, the Monkees, or the Ohio Express.\nc6hh | The common denominators of heavy metal are distorted electric guitars, keening vocals, and a powerful rhythmic base, which would certainly encompass the typical Led Zeppelin tune. But the popular Zeppelin numbers \"Your Time Is Gonna Come,\" \"Going to California,\" and \"All My Love\" can't qualify by these standards. Conversely, the Rolling Stones' \"Gimme Shelter\" meets the metal criteria, as do David Bowie's \"Panic in Detroit\"; Stevie Ray Vaughan's \"Change It\"; Funkadelic's \"Mommy, What's a Funkadelic?\"; Michael Jackson's \"Beat It\"; the Ramones' \"Blitzkrieg Bop\"; and Pantera's \"Cemetery Gates.\" Heavy metal has changed over the decades, too: In nineteen seventy-one, it meant Alice Cooper and Mountain; in nineteen seventy-eight it meant Van Halen and UFO; by nineteen eighty-seven it was Exodus and Megadeth; in nineteen ninety-five it was Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson; by twenty ten it was Converge, Mastodon, and\ny7ea | But in the Long Run\nnav4 | BBC Sessions was a successful nineteen ninety-eight release of the band's live radio appearances.\ngem8 | Every Time I Die. Possibly the one constant in heavy metal is that most of its musicians are white males with very long hair.\ne8nr | Where Led Zeppelin fits in with any of these, let alone with Mot√∂rhead, Kiss, Godflesh, Venom, Judas Priest, or Iron Maiden, is the crucial question. Each successive generation of heavy metal artists seemed to take one element of a prior group's material and emphasize it, such that every few years someone emerged who looked and sounded like a cartoon version of someone else: louder, darker, faster, and more debased, but no less derivative. Who was Marilyn Manson if not Alice Cooper updated for the nineteen nineties? Who did Guns N' Roses resemble more than a souped-up Aerosmith? In a mid-seventies Rolling Stone essay, Lester Bangs reduced Black Sabbath to a \"sub-Zeppelin kozmic behemoth.\" The point is that, pace Page, Plant, and Jones, every heavy metal band from nineteen seventy onward was consciously or unconsciously inspired by the Led Zeppelin of nineteen sixty-nine to seventy-one. Rock author Charles\nk78w | Led Zeppelin FAQ\ng9du | Shaar Murray has written that Jimmy Page and Zeppelin \"professionalized\" the hard electric blues timbres explored more haphazardly by Cream or Jimi Hendrix, and if by this he means that Page patented the sonic formula for the group's loudest and most propulsive riffs (\"Communication Breakdown,\" \"How Many More Times,\" \"Whole Lotta Love,\" \"Heartbreaker,\" \"Immigrant Song,\" \"Black Dog,\" et al.), then there is no question that the patent was copied by a great many performers, among them the certifiably metallic.\nf682 | In today's digitized, atomized music universe, the heavy metal appellation is largely obsolete, even after being broken up into subunits like death metal, speed metal, grindcore, and nu-metal. As with the \"plagiarist\" slur, calling Led Zeppelin a metal group is as indicative of the listener as the listened. To someone raised on the bright, catchy rock songs of the early British Invasion, Led Zeppelin was heavy metal; to a Deadhead, a New Waver, or a spandex-clad headbanger, they were hard rock; to rappers and hip-hoppers they might be an oldies act. Most remaining music retailers today find Led Zeppelin CDs between Lenny Kravitz and John Lennon in the mainstream \"Rock / Pop\" shelves, while their immediate followers and rivals Black Sabbath go in with Biohazard and Cannibal Corpse in the narrower \"metal\" aisle. In the family tree of rock genealogy, Led Zeppelin is at the root of several branches. Ultimately, Zeppelin began to transcend their characterization as a mere metal band only a few years into their active career and to an even greater degree thereafter, when critics and fans were forced to admit that their legacy had forever pervaded the whole field of rock 'n' roll.\nli1k | Mama, Let Me Pump Your Gas: Led Zeppelin as Cock Rock",
