You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

2e62 | But of all the ancient musical writers, the name of no one is come down to us, of whose works I was in greater want than those of the younger Dionysius Halicarnassensis, who flourished, according to Suidas, under the emperor Adrian, and who wrote twenty-six books of the History of Musicians, in which he celebrated not only the great performers on the Flute and Cithara, but those who had risen to eminence by every species of poetry. He was, likewise, author of five books, written in defence of Music, and chiefly in refutation of what is alledged against it in Plato's Republic. Aristides Quintilianus (f) has, also, endeavoured to soften the severity of some animadversions against Music in the writings of Cicero (g) ; but though time has spared the defence of this author, yet it does not indemnify us for the loss of that which Dionysius junior left behind him ; as testimonies are still remaining of his having been a much more able writer than Arist. Quintilianus (h).
75y3 | But though all the musical histories of the ancients are lost, yet almost every country in Europe that has cultivated the polite arts, has, since the revival of learning, produced a history of Music, except our own. Italy can boast of two works under that title ;

68xu | one written in the latter end of the last century by Bontempi (i), and that of Padre Martini, in this (k). France has likewise two, one by Bonet (1), and one by M. de Blainville (m); and Germany has not only produced two histories of Music in its own language, by Gaspar Printz (z), and M. Marpurg (6) ; but one in Latin, lately published in two volumes, 4to. by the prince abbot of St. Blasius (p). Unluckily, those of P. Martini,* and M. Marpurg, are not yet finished ; and that of the learned abbot only concerns church music ; so that though much has been done, much is still left for diligence to do (@) ; and however I may respect the learning, and admire the industry and abilities of some of these writers, yet I saw the wants of English musical readers through such a different medium, that I have seldom imitated their arrangements, and never servilely copied their opinions. Printed materials lie open to us all ; and as I spared no expense or pains either in acquiring or consulting them, the merely citing the same passages from them, cannot convict me of plagiarism. With respect likewise to manuscript information, and inedited materials from foreign countries, few modern writers have perhaps expended more money and time, undergone greater fatigue, or more impaired their health in the search of them, than myself.
hd35 | And yet, though all will readily allow, in general, that perfection is not to be expected in the works of man; it is evident that, in particular cases, little tenderness is shewn to imperfection in the most difficult and laborious undertakings.
2zpk | If I might presume to hope, however, for any unusual indulgence from the public with respect to this work, it must be from the peculiarity of my circumstances during the time it was in hand; for it may with the utmost truth be said, that it was composed in moments stolen from sleep, from reflection, and from an occupa- tion which required all my attention, during more than twelve hours a day, for a great part of the year.

7od1 | A GENERAL HISTORY OF MUSIC
0bqy | If it be asked, why I entered on so arduous a task, knowing the disadvantages I must labour under, my answer is, that it was neither with a view to rival others, nor to expose the defects of former attempts, but merely to fill up, as well as I was able, a chasm in English literature. I knew that a history of Music was wanted by my countrymen, and was utterly ignorant that any one else had undertaken to supply it; yet, to confess the truth, I did, at first imagine, though I have been long convinced of my mistake, that, with many years practice and experience in musical matters, some reading, and the possession of a great number of books on the subject, I should have been able to compile such a history as was wanted, at my leisure hours, without great labour or expence.
b780 | But, after I had embarked, the further I sailed, the greater seemed my distance from the port: doubts of my own abilities, and respect for the public, abated my confidence; my ideas of what would be required at my hands were enlarged beyond my powers of fulfilling them, especially in the narrow limits of two volumes, and in the little time I had allowed myself, which was made still less by sickness.
ccmb | A work like this, in which it is necessary to give authorities for every fact that is asserted, advances infinitely slower, with all the diligence that can be bestowed upon it, than one of mere imagina- tion, or one consisting of recent circumstances, within the knowledge and memory of the writer. The difference in point of time and labour is as great as in building a house with scarce materials produced in remote regions of the world, or with bricks made upon the spot, and timber from a neighbouring wood; and I have frequently spent more time in ascertaining a date, or seeking a short, and, in itself, a trivial passage, than would have been requisite to fill many pages with conjecture and declamation.
ma93 | However, after reading, or at least consulting, an almost innumerable quantity of old and scarce books on the subject, of which the dulness and pedantry were almost petrific, and among which, where I hoped to find the most information, I found but little, and where I expected but little, I was seldom disappointed; at length, wearied and disgusted at the small success of my researches, I shut my books, and began to examine myself as to my musical principles; hoping that the good I had met with in the course of my reading was by this time digested, and incorporated in my own ideas; and that the many years I had spent in practice, theory, and meditation, might entitle me to some freedom of thought, unshackled by the trammels of authority.
c6hh | Concerning the music of the Greeks and Romans, about which the learned talk so much, it is impossible to speak with certainty; however, the chief part of what I have to say with respect to its theory and practice, is thrown into a Preliminary Dissertation, in order that the narrative might not be interrupted by discussions concerning dark and disputable points, which will be generally uninteresting even to musical readers; and in which it is very
y7ea | PREFACE
nav4 | doubtful, whether I shall be able either to amuse or satisfy the learned.
gem8 | It is, indeed, with great and almost hopeless difidence, that I enter upon this part of my work; as I can hardly animate myself with the expectation of succeeding in enquiries which have foiled the most learned men of the two or three last centuries. But it has been remarked by Tartini, in speaking of ancient music, that doubt, difficulty, and obscurity, should not be imputed to the author, but to the subject, since they are in its very essence: for what, besides conjecture, is now left us, concerning things so transient as sound, and so evanescent as taste?
e8nr | The land of conjecture, however, is so extensive and unappro- priated, that every new cultivator has a right to break up fresh ground, or to seize upon any spot that has long lain fallow, without the sanction of a grant from anyone who may arrogate to himself the sovereignty of the whole, or of any neglected part of it. But though no one has an exclusive right to these imaginary regions, yet the public has a just power of censuring the methods of improvement adopted by any new inhabitant, and of condemn- ing such productions as may be deemed unfit for use.
k78w | The opinions of mankind seldom agree, concerning the most common and obvious things; and consequently will be still less likely to coincide about others, that are reducible to no standard of truth or excellence, but are subject to the lawless controul of every individual who shall think fit to condemn them, either with, or without understanding them.
g9du | Dr. Johnson has well said, that " those who think they have done much, see but little to do;" and with respect to ancient music, I believe those who have taken the greatest pains to investigate the subject, are least satisfied with the success of their labours.
f682 | What the ancient music really was, it is not easy to determine; the whole is now become a matter of faith; but of this we are certain, that it was something with which mankind was extremely delighted: for not only the poets, but the historians and philosophers of the best ages of Greece and Rome, are as diffuse in its praises, as of those arts concerning which sufficient remains are come down to us, to evince the truth of their panegyrics. And so great was the sensibility of the ancient Greeks, and so accentuated and refined their language, that they seem to have been, in both respects, to the rest of the world, what the modern Italians are at present; for of these last, the language itself is music, and their ears are so polished and accustomed to sweet sounds, that they are rendered fastidious judges of melody, both by habit and education.
li1k | But as to the superior or inferior degree of excellence in the ancient music, compared with the modern, it is now as impossible to determine, as it is to hear both sides.
pbea | A GENERAL HISTORY OF MUSIC
ccpt | Indeed it is so entirely lost, that the study of it is become as unprofitable as learning a dead language, in which there are no books ; and yet this study has given rise to so much pedantry, and to such an ambition in modern musical authors, to be thought well versed in the writings of the ancients upon music, that their treatises are rendered both disgusting and unintelligible by it. Words only are come down to us without things. We have so few remains of ancient Music by which to illustrate its rules, that we cannot, as in Painting, Poetry, Sculpture, or Architecture, judge of it, or profit by examples ; and to several of these terms which are crammed into our books, we are utterly unable to affix any precise or useful meaning. To write, therefore, in favour of ancient music now, is like the emperor Julian's defending paganism, when mankind had given it up as indefensible, and had attached themselves to another religion.
0fpw | However, it is, perhaps, a fortunate circumstance for modern music that the ancient is lost, as it might not have suited the genius of our language, and might have tied us down to precedent ; as the writers of modern Latin never dare hazard a single thought or expression without classical authority.
dqn8 | The subject itself of ancient music is so dark, and writers concerning it are so discordant in their opinions, that every intelligent reader who finds how little there is to be known, has reason to lament that there still remains so much to be said. Indeed, I should have been glad to have waived all discussion about it: for, to say the truth, the study of ancient music is now become the business of an Antiquary more than of a Musician. But in every history of music extant, in other languages, the practice had been so constant for the author to make a display of what he knew, and what he did not know concerning ancient music, that it seemed absolutely necessary for me to say something about it, if it were only to prove, that if I have not been more successful in my enquiries than my predecessors, I have not been less diligent. And it appeared likewise necessary, before I attempted a history of ancient Greek music, to endeavour to investigate its properties, or at least to tell the little I knew of it, and ingenuously to confess my ignorance and doubts about the rest.
cop0 | Indeed it was once my intention to begin my history with the invention of the present musical scale and counterpoint ; for
lhkq | " What can we reason, but from what we know? "
82ju | But it was impossible to read a great number of books upon the subject, without meeting with conjectures, and it was not easy to peruse these, without forming others of my own. If those which I have hazarded should throw any light upon the subject, it will enable my readers to travel through the dark maze of enquiry with more facility, and consequently less disgust ; and if I fail in my researches, and leave both the subject and them where I found them, as the expectation which I encourage is but small, so it is hoped will be their disappointment. For with respect to all I

rhaz | De las cosas mas seguras La mas seguras es dudar (r).
wak1 | In wading through innumerable volumes, with promising titles, and submitting to the drudgery of all such reading as was never read, I frequently found that those who were most diffuse upon the subject, knew least of the matter ; and that technical jargon, and unintelligible pedantry so loaded each page, that not an eligible thought could be found, in exploring thousands of them. Indeed my researches were sometimes so unsuccessful, that I seemed to resemble a wretch in the street, raking the kennels for an old rusty nail. However, the ardour of enquiry was now and then revived by congenial ideas, and by gleams of light emitted from penetration and intelligence ; and these will be gratefully acknowledged, whenever they afford assistance.
wtfz | There are already more profound books on the subject of ancient, as well as modern Music, than have ever been read ; it was time to try to treat it in such a manner as was likely to engage the attention of those that are unable, or unwilling, to read treatises written, for the most part, by persons who were more ambitious of appearing learned themselves, than of making others so. Indeed, I have long since found it necessary to read with caution the splendid assertions of writers concerning music, till I was convinced of their knowledge of the subject ; for I have frequently detected ancients as well as moderns, whose fame sets them almost above censure, of utter ignorance in this particular, while they have thought it necessary to talk about it. Apuleius, Pausanias, and Athenaus, among the ancients, were certainly musicians ; but it is not so evident that Cicero, Horace, and others, who have interspersed many passages concerning Music in their works, understood the subject any more than our Addison, Pope, and Swift. Among these, the two first have written odes on St. Cecilia's day, in which they manifest the entire separation of Music and Poetry, and shew the possibility of writing well on what is neither felt nor understood. For Pope, who received not the least pleasure from Music himself, by the help of his friends, was enabled to describe its power with all the rapture and sublimity of a great genius, music-mad. This appears not only in his Ode of St. Cecilia, but in speaking of Handel, in the Dunciad.
