        "content": "86d4 | Even when a client invites or appears comfortable with the empathizing mode, overutilizing it can overprotect clients. Listening and validating may occur at the expense of questioning or challenging clients to engage in occupation when they are ready. Overreliance on empathy may encourage an inappropriate level of dependence in more vulnerable or isolated clients. In addition, there is a risk that some clients may become confused about the goals of therapy and about the role of the occupational therapist in his or her treatment. In the absence of appropriate boundaries (e.g., time limits, delineation of the limits of the professional relationship) some clients begin to per-\nz7qp | Chapter Four Knowing Ourselves as Therapists Ninety-seven\n6t1g | disappointed, rejected, or abandoned when the therapist does not behave accordingly in other domains. Other risks associated with overreliance on the empathizing mode include the possibility of overidentification with clients, emotional overinvolvement, guilt concerning the limitations of what a therapist can actually do for clients, and resulting feelings of burnout.\ncpls | Encouraging Mode\nm50n | The encouraging mode is one in which a therapist works to instill clients with hope, courage, and the will to explore or perform a given activity. Therapists who use the encouraging mode frequently use such strategies as compliments, applause, and cheering when a client has accomplished something or when otherwise appropriate. They may negotiate with a client or incentivize a behavior, particularly if it is developmentally or functionally appropriate and the client responds well to positive reinforcement. They may rejoice and celebrate with clients when they are successful.\neztf | Some therapists use such strategies as entertaining gestures or antics, singing or dancing, and demonstrations of involvement to improve their clients' mood, distract them from anxiety or reluctance, and improve their desire to participate in occupations. When invited by a client, therapists may also engage in humor by making jokes or funny remarks. A client will invite a therapist to use humor by initiating it with a joke, humorous gesture, or funny remark. At that point, a therapist may feel comfortable picking up on the client's lead. Generally, therapists who utilize the encouraging mode attempt any clever or creative twist on activity to generate or help sustain a client's interest in occupational engagement.\nbwsu | Strengths of the Encouraging Mode\noqod | There are several strengths associated with functioning in the encouraging mode. Therapists who prefer this mode tend to be open and generous in their emotional expression. They project a great deal of positive energy, and they are particularly skilled at conveying their optimism and hope to their clients. They are willing to celebrate and be joyful with their clients. Some therapists functioning in this mode are viewed as playful by their clients, and this playful attitude may be particularly effective with children and other kinds of clients who respond primarily to emo-\ntey0 | CASE EXAMPLE Four point five The Encouraging Mode\nghiv | Rachel was a four-year-old girl who was referred for treatment of selective mutism. She would speak only at home with her mother and father. I decided that the framework of a playgroup of peers her own age would be the optimal medium to increase her desire to speak with others. During the months of treatment, I told her that the framework of a playgroup of peers her own age would be the optimal medium to increase her desire to speak with others. During the months of treatment, I told her that the framework of a playgroup of peers her own age would be the optimal medium to increase her desire to speak with others. During the months of treatment, I told her that the framework of a playgroup of peers her own age would be the optimal medium to increase her desire to speak with others. I told her she would be allowed to make animal noises and other sounds but that talking was prohibited. I saw by the stars in her eyes that she liked the idea. \no5ts | Along with sensory integration techniques, I tied up a big sheet that divided the treatment room into two halves. Among other things, I produced dramatic plays that featured the children in the playgroup as actors. The stage became an enticing place for all the children in the playgroup to show their talents while acting out different scenarios. At first, Rachel would smile and draw during the plays. Slowly, she began to make animal sounds. I showed greater appreciation of her performances when they included characters that made sounds.\nhd7d | After a short time, Rachel decided that sounds did not adequately convey what she wanted to express, and she began to say words. I would respond dramatically by making a fuss and contending that speaking words was not in keeping with the group's rules. Soon, her peers sensed her disappointment about not being permitted to say words. They began to support her by trying to convince me to change the rules so that Rachel could speak during the plays. As a group, we then decided that the new rule for the group would be that everyone, in-\nehux | encouraging mode may be particularly capable of reaching clients with more severe developmental and cognitive impairments because they may use forms of communication that convey emotional energy and have multisensory components. Some therapists functioning in the encouraging mode are also skilled at using incentives to elicit participation. Because of their ability to convey their be-\npoxj | cluding Rachel, had to use words to communicate. Rachel agreed to this plan and through time, she began to speak more fluently in full sentences. She made significant progress at school, too.\n2xvb | I chose to be dramatic and demonstrative in the groups so that the playgroup was infused with high emotional valence and Rachel could easily read my feelings toward her. Through my affect I conveyed that I believed in her, was excited about her participation in the group at any level, and was willing to vigorously support her and meet her at the level at which she wanted to begin work (not speaking). At the same time, I made it clear to her (and to her peers) that I took the group, and its rules, very seriously. Through my emotional tone and enthusiasm, the playgroup became a big deal for Rachel and her peers.\nm1hx | Initially, I deliberately ignored the importance of Rachel's speech to her participation in the playgroup so that its emotional and social desirability would become self-apparent through time. Quickly it became clear to Rachel that, without speech, she was limited in the extent and level at which she could interact with her peers to create plays. In addition, speech became desirable to Rachel because its meaning was transformed from an anxiety-provoking activity that others demanded from her into an enticing and taboo behavior in which only she was forbidden to participate. In addition to this particular approach to use of self, the fact that she enjoyed creating plays was motivating for Rachel. Peer pressure from her new similar-aged friends also served as a powerful lever for her full participation in the group.\n9psh | be more likely than other therapists to elicit participation from clients who are otherwise anxious, demoralized, or reluctant to participate in therapy.\naiqv | Cautions of the Encouraging Mode\n4klz | Although there are few cautions associated with providing clients with encouragement, if the encouraging mode is overused, clients may become desensitized to its use\nxz5d | through time. Some clients grow to expect the therapist to bolster them to such an extent that they have difficulty developing a sense of intrinsic motivation independently of the therapist.\nerwx | In some circumstances, use of the encouraging mode with the wrong type of client carries a risk of being misinterpreted. Some clients are in an emotional state that does not allow them to hear or internalize compliments, a hopeful scenario, or comments about their strengths and capacities. Certain clients may undervalue or interpret a therapist's efforts to introduce hope, humor, play, or games into the relationship as being insulting, belittling, foolish, or manipulative. For example, a therapist once relayed a story in which she attempted to conduct a therapy group for adults with substance abuse problems that focused on ways to increase positive energy and hope. She began the session with an inspirational poem, and her ideas were quickly rejected by the group members.\nie7i | Instructing Mode\naksw | Therapists who utilize the instructing mode emphasize education of clients in therapy and assume a teaching style in their interactions with clients. Therapists who use the instructing mode are skilled at providing clients with (appropriately) detailed descriptions of the objectives and tasks of therapy, providing a clear rationale for the content",
