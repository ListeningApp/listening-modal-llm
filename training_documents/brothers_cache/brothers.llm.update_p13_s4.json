        "content": "57lp | While the borderland population thus has most to gain in development by reconnecting with their Eritrean counterparts, recent fieldwork in the twin villages of Kinin and Kinto on the Tsorona frontline indicates that similar sentiments are harboured on the Eritrean side too. This area has been militarily controlled by Ethiopian defence forces since a twenty eleven border skirmish. The Eritrean villagers remained, however, and it is now administered by the neighbouring Ethiopian district (woreda) of Glomekeda in Adigrat zone. But the villagers are caught in a precarious situation, always worrying about possible snipers or the outbreak of a fire-fight, as the Eritrean trenches skirt the villages. While visiting the area, our research team had to stay in the shadows on the Ethiopia-facing side of the small dwellings, in order to stay hidden from Eritrean snipers.",
