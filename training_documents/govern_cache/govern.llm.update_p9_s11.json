        "content": "5vqw | Endogenous Variables\nmeyw | There is, to begin with, a debate concerning the extent to which international regimes require the services of organizations (in the sense of material entities possessing offices, personnel, equipment, budgets, and legal personality) to function effectively. Those who approach the issue from the perspective of business administration or\n2e62 | International Governance\n75y3 | public administration, whose primary concern is the performance of organizations, exhibit a tendency to shift the focus of analysis from the effectiveness of international regimes to the effectiveness of international organizations. This is, in my view, a mistake. With all due respect for the roles organizations play, there is great variation among international governance systems in the extent to which their operation requires the services of some administrative apparatus, and there is no obvious correlation between the presence of organizations and the effectiveness of regimes. As numerous observers have pointed out, moreover, both material and intangible costs are associated with the operation of organizations, which suggests the value of a close examination of the factors that determine when and what sort of organizations are required to make international regimes effective.\ns2g2 | Quite apart from the matter of organization, there is much to be said for studies of decision procedures, revenue sources, and compliance mechanisms in efforts to pinpoint the determinants of institutional effectiveness in international society. In the case of decision procedures, the problem is to devise some process that makes it possible to avoid the twin pitfalls of paralysis and defection. Ingenious devices, such as the International Whaling Commission's procedure of combining majority rule with a system of individual objections, are surely worthy of study in this connection. The fundamental question regarding revenue sources, concerns the extent to which a regime is able to obtain revenue directly rather than via some pass-through arrangement under which members make periodic contributions. The controversy surrounding efforts to create independent revenue sources in specific cases, such as the proposed International Seabed Authority, indicates how sensitive this issue is. With regard to compliance, the problem centers on the need to secure compliant behavior on the part of a regime's members in a social setting in which enforcement capabilities are largely under the control of the members themselves. Recently, this issue has given rise to interesting work both on the idea of transparency (that is, the formulation of rules in such a way as to facilitate efforts to observe or measure compliance) and on\nq1q2 | Effectiveness\ncb7r | the use of sophisticated technologies to monitor compliance on the part of individual members in a nonintrusive manner.\n68xu | The growing awareness that change is one of the dominant characteristics of today's world has led also to an increasing concern for robustness and, more specifically, for adaptability or flexibility among those who think about the effectiveness of international regimes. The idea here is that a regime cannot remain effective for long unless it has some built-in capacity to adjust to changes in the issue area to which it pertains or the behavior it is designed to regulate. Because authority is decentralized in international society, there is no simple way to solve the problem of building flexibility into regimes. Yet ingenious responses to this problem have been developed in some cases. Allowing for the accession of new members (as in the cases of the whaling regime and the Antarctic Treaty regime), for example, can bring about changes in the functioning of a regime without requiring any formal alterations in its constitutive provisions. Providing for changes in the schedule of the whaling regime and the appendixes of the CITES regime without requiring formal ratification has had the effect of introducing considerable flexibility into these governance systems. Equally interesting is the process now emerging in connection with the ozone regime in which the annual review conferences, held under the auspices of the arrangements set forth in the Montreal Protocol, are empowered to make significant changes in the workings of the regime that do not require ratification.\nhd35 | Exogenous Variables\n2zpk | The category of exogenous variables thought to have a bearing on the effectiveness of international regimes covers a wider array of factors than the category of endogenous variables. Whereas endogenous factors are limited, by definition, to attributes or properties of\nepu7 | the regimes themselves, exogenous variables may range across the full spectrum of driving forces that analysts expect to influence the course of collective outcomes in international society. Thus, not surprisingly, a broad range of factors must be considered by those endeavoring to account for variations in the effectiveness of regimes. Yet these factors do divide into several major clusters associated with different schools of thought about the forces at work in international relations more generally. Three of these clusters, in particular, seem noteworthy as guides to our thinking about the determinants of institutional effectiveness: power factors, interest factors, and knowledge factors.\n7od1 | Those who call themselves realists or structuralists approach institutions as reflections of the underlying configuration of power in international society. This way of thinking may seem most familiar in connection with discussions of regime formation, but it applies just as well to analyses of the effectiveness of governance systems. A particularly prominent strand of this reasoning involves hegemonic stability theory, which suggests that the presence of a hegemon in the sense of a dominant actor or a party possessing a preponderance of material resources is necessary for a regime to function effectively. The decline or fall of the relevant hegemon, on this account, is likely to lead inexorably to a reduction of the regime's effectiveness and, in extreme cases, to its transformation. This is, however, not the only power-based argument that is relevant to a discussion of the determinants of regime effectiveness. An alternative view, which is especially interesting because it runs counter to the argument embedded in hegemonic stability theory, suggests that institutions work best or are most effective when they operate in an environment characterized by some rough balance of power among their principal members. A little thought will suggest a number of additional power-based ideas that could prove relevant in analyzing the effectiveness of international governance systems.\n0bqy | Arguments centering on interests rest on a view of international society that emphasizes interactive decision making and collective action among groups of autonomous actors. On this account, regimes\nb780 | Effectiveness\nccmb | are social institutions that emerge to circumvent or mitigate the collective-action problems that plague all social settings featuring interactive decision making in the absence of a central public authority or system of rules to guide the behavior of the participants. In thinking about regime effectiveness, those who focus on interests tend to emphasize factors relating to the configuration of interests among the players as well as factors relating to the extent to which institutional arrangements offer appropriate solutions to the relevant collective-action problems. Studies of the configuration of interests highlight not only the locus of a given issue area on the spectrum from pure cooperation (that is, coordination games) to pure conflict (that is, zero-sum games) but also other factors such as the existence of a stable equilibrium. With regard to solutions, the issue concerns the extent to which institutional arrangements are well adapted to the problem at hand, a subject to which I shall return shortly in discussing linkage variables.",
