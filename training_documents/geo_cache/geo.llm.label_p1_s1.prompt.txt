You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

936l | Linking geological and infrastructural requirements for large-scale underground hydrogen storage in Germany
06yq | Hydrogen storage might be key to the success of the hydrogen economy, and hence the energy transition in Germany. One option for cost-effective storage of large quantities of hydrogen is the geological subsurface. However, previous experience with underground hydrogen storage is restricted to salt caverns, which are limited in size and space. In contrast, pore storage facilities in aquifers -and/or depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs- could play a vital role in meeting base load needs due to their wide availability and large storage capacity, but experiences are limited to past operations with hydrogen-bearing town gas. To overcome this barrier, here we investigate hydrogen storage in porous storage systems in a two-step process: 1) First, we investigate positive and cautionary indicators for safe operations of hydrogen storage in pore storage systems. 2) Second, we estimate hydrogen storage capacities of pore storage systems in (current and decommissioned) underground natural gas storage systems and saline aquifers. Our systematic review highlights that optimal storage conditions in terms of energy content and hydrogen quality are found in sandstone reservoirs in absence of carbonate and iron bearing accessory minerals at a depth of approx. 1,100 m and a temperature of at least 40℃. Porosity and permeability of the reservoir formation should be at least 20% and 5 x 10-13 m2 (~500 mD), respectively. In addition, the pH of the brine should fall below 6 and the salinity should exceed 100 mg/L. Based on these estimates, the total hydrogen storage capacity in underground natural gas storages is estimated to be up to 8 billion cubic meters or (0.72 Mt at STP) corresponding to 29 TWh of energy equivalent of hydrogen. Saline aquifers may offer additional storage capacities of 81.6-691.8 Mt of hydrogen, which amounts to 3.2 to 27.3 PWh of energy equivalent of hydrogen, the majority of which is located in the North German basin. Pore storage systems could therefore become a crucial element of the future German hydrogen infrastructure, especially in regions with large industrial hydrogen (storage) demand and likely hydrogen imports via pipelines and ships.

8r5j | 1 Introduction
2taz | Global environmental changes and future energy needs are among the most fundamental challenges facing humanity in the near future. Green hydrogen produced by renewable energies has the capacity to overcome these obstacles by decarbonizing the industry, electricity generation, transport and heat. With its National Hydrogen Strategy (NWS), the German government has given a strong boost to the hydrogen economy in all sectors of the energy system (BMWi, 2020). But renewable energy sources needed for the production of green hydrogen are subjected to weather-related and seasonal fluctuations. Hence, measures are needed to stabilize and secure future energy supplies. Hydrogen storage could therefore be the decisive factor in the energy transition. Only then the divergent hydrogen demand and production will be balanced.
o3ya | In addition to the storage of hydrogen in tanks or pipes, the geological subsurface also offers possibilities for the long-term storage of hydrogen. The hydrocarbon industry has been using the underground for decades in Germany and around the world to store large quantities of natural gas in the pore space of rocks or in salt caverns (e.g., American Gas Association, 1997; Sedlacek, 1999a; Sedlacek, 2002; Evans and Chadwick, 2009). More than 23 billion cubic meters of natural gas are stored underground in Germany (EEK Redaktion, 2021). This gives Germany the fourth-largest storage capacity in the world after the United States, Russia and the Ukraine (EEK Redaktion, 2015). About 36% (~8.6 billion cubic meters) of the current technically usable working gas volume is stored in pore storage systems for seasonal base load coverage and 74% of the installed capacity are stored in salt caverns for peak load coverage with more efficient injection and withdrawal cycles (EEK Redaktion, 2021). Nevertheless, current research into underground hydrogen storage potential in Germany and Europe has mainly focused on salt caverns only (Iordache et al., 2014; Simón et al., 2015; Michalski et al., 2017; Tarkowski and Czapowski, 2018; Caglayan et al., 2020; Lankof, and Tarkowski, 2020; Williams et al., 2022). The total energy storage potential in salt caverns is estimated to be as high as 84.8 PWh in Europe and 35.7 PWh in Germany alone (Caglayan et al., 2020). It is therefore not surprising that first flagship projects for underground storage of hydrogen in salt caverns at the field scale have already been launched in Germany at the Bad Lauchstädt Energy Park (HYPOS), in Rüdersdorf (HyCavMobil) and in Epe (GetH2). However, suitable salt deposits are locally limited and only 9% of the total worldwide working gas capacity is attributed to salt caverns (Sedlacek, 1999b; Cedigaz, 2021). Pore storage facilities such as depleted gas fields and saline aquifers could therefore play an important role in the energy transition due to their wide spread and broad availability across Europe (e.g., Foh et al., 1979; Panfilov, 2016; Tarkowski, 2019; Heinemann et al., 2021a; Zivar et al., 2021; Hematpur et al., 2023).
r5il | Here, we investigate safety requirements and storage potentials in the light of future hydrogen needs. The aim is to formulate recommendations for future underground hydrogen storage in porous media. Our study starts with an overview of the past, present, and future of underground hydrogen storage (UHS) in Germany, discussing the experience with UHS and the prospects for hydrogen network structures. It highlights the progress that has been made and the challenges that need to be overcome for widespread

ls7d | deployment. In particular, there are critical factors that need to be considered in the design and operation of UHS facilities to ensure their safe and efficient operation. These critical factors or indicators, such as biotic and abiotic reactions, sealing capacity, cap rock integrity, cushion gas requirements, etc., are discussed before estimates of UHS storage capacity in Germany are made. Our estimates are made with respect to the discussion of technical hydrogen storage capacity in former and current underground gas storage facilities and the theoretical hydrogen storage capacity in saline aquifers. This section provides a quantitative assessment of the potential of UHS to support the energy transition in Germany. The fifth and final section discusses storage capacity and demand in Europe and assesses the costs and purity requirements of UHS. It builds on the findings of the previous sections and highlights the economic and technical challenges associated with UHS and the potential role of UHS in supporting the development of a sustainable hydrogen economy in Europe.

t8vv | 2.1 Experiences with underground hydrogen storage
qvnu | Before the introduction of natural gas, town gas with a hydrogen content of more than 50% hydrogen was produced, transported and stored in Germany and Europe. Town gas was derived from coal, and its production still persists in China and Asia. When storage tanks could no longer meet the requirements of the gas industry, underground gas storage facilities were built in the porous geological subsurface starting from the 1950s. Pore storage systems were launched in Beynes (France), Lobodice (Czech Republic), Engelbostel (Hannover) Reitbrook (Hamburg), Hähnlein (Darmstadt), Kirchheiligen (Mühlhausen/Tühringen), Eschenfelden (Fürth/Oberpfalz), Ketzin (Brandenburg) even before the first salt caverns were put into operations in Bad Lauchstädt and Kiel in the 1970s (e.g., Jones and Machsen, 1963; Šmigáň et al., 1990; Sedlacek, 2002; Panfilov, 2016; Marcogaz, 2017). Today, these underground storage facilities have been converted to natural gas storage facilities or have since been abandoned. Currently, pure hydrogen (>95% H2) is solely stored in salt caverns at a few sites, namely, Teesside (United Kingdom) and Clemens Dome (United States), Spindletop (United States), and Moss Bloss (United States) (e.g., Panfilov, 2016; Zivar et al., 2021). Given this sparse and limited experience with hydrogen in pore storage systems, it is necessary to formulate recommendations for the safe handling of hydrogen in the subsurface.
kggw | 2.2 Prospects for hydrogen network structures
xrd1 | The design of future hydrogen infrastructure and storage requirements in Germany remains uncertain and complex (Lux et al., 2022; Neuwirth et al., 2022). It is challenging to analyze
5746 | underground storage requirements and infrastructures in such a highly complex and swiftly evolving environment. While the German National Hydrogen Strategy was published in 2020 to promote the use of hydrogen in all sectors of the hydrogen economy, it didn't specify the design of the hydrogen transport and storage infrastructure (BMWi, 2020). To examine the potential use of underground hydrogen storage in porous media, three inter- dependent variables that could impact future storage requirements in Germany have to be considered: 1) spatial distribution of hydrogen production via electrolysis, 2) hydrogen demand centres, and 3) hydrogen pipelines and import terminals.
7toz | Lux et al. (2022) investigated the positioning of electrolysers, underground storage and transport infrastructure in a greenhouse gas-neutral German energy system using five scenarios. Regardless of the scenario, their calculations indicate that 71% of the total hydrogen production in Germany will be located in the North and Baltic Seas, with a combined hydrogen production of 83-129 TWh by 2050 and total electrolyzer capacities of 37-55 GWel (ibid.). The concentration in these regions is due to the high potential for wind power, and it does not conflict with the alternative of expanding the electricity grid. Sens et al. (2022) report similar findings, as they calculate the second-lowest hydrogen supply cost at the North Sea, while Husarek et al. (2021) also support the idea of regional concentration, which contrasts with the results of Gils et al. (2021). Lux et al. (2022) demonstrate that hydrogen can serve as a seasonal and long-term storage medium, with a working gas volume of 42-104 TWh of hydrogen in 2050. In contrast, Gils et al. (2021) report a required storage capacity of 53 TWh in the same year. In the modelled energy systems, hydrogen storage levels decrease during winter when renewable electricity generation is lower and increase in summer with higher renewable electricity feed-in (Lux et al., 2022). This seasonal profile for hydrogen storage has been identified in previous studies by Gils et al. (2021) and Welder et al. (2018) for Germany, and Cárdenas et al. (2021), Samsatli and Samsatli (2019), Gabrielli et al. (2020), and Hernandez and Gençer (2021) for different regions or countries. Large-scale storage directly on site or at the end of a transport pipeline at the demand location can reduce hydrogen costs by decreasing excess electricity (Welder et al., 2018; Gils et al., 2021; Sens et al., 2022).
j346 | In order to establish a cost-effective hydrogen economy and a greenhouse-gas neutral energy system in the long run, a German- wide transport network is necessary (Gils et al., 2021). However, the design of such a network and the routing of its pipelines is still up for debate. Although detailed expansion plans differ, there is consensus in the literature on the need to connect production hubs and import terminals in the North with demand centers in the South of Germany (ibid .; Lux et al., 2022; Husarek et al., 2021). The European gas network operators have proposed a European-wide hydrogen pipeline vision (hydrogen backbone), which focuses on the repurposing of existing natural gas infrastructures (Wang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). For example, in Germany, a North-South pipeline from Rostock to Lake Constance is planned to be established from 2035 onwards, repurposing the existing natural gas infrastructure, which is considered more cost effective than building new pipelines. The repurposing of pipelines and port

cwrw | infrastructure is also a part of the IPCEI Hydrogen initiative (important projects of common European interests). The association of the supra-regional gas transmission companies in Germany (FNB Gas) develops a joint network development plan every 2 years, which is then submitted to the German Federal Network Agency. The 2022 plan (FNB Gas, 2022) models a national hydrogen network in Germany, based on a survey of transportation needs. However, due to the current regulatory framework, this network is not legally binding. The 2020 plan (FNB Gas, 2020) only contained a rough outline of a visionary hydrogen network, in contrast to the more detailed model presented in the 2022 plan.
4i0e | Assessing hydrogen storage requirements is a multi-faceted endeavour that includes an evaluation of potential future hydrogen demand and its regional distribution. Future hydrogen demand is still uncertain, according to Neuwirth et al. (2022), while Lux et al. (2022) indicate a range of hydrogen demand scenarios between 34 and 667 TWh (final energy demand in 2050), attributable to different usage categories such as industry, transport, and heating. To derive a more comprehensive estimate, Neuwirth et al. (2022) conducted a site- and process- specific bottom-up analysis of hydrogen demand from the energy- intensive sectors alone, revealing a potential hydrogen demand of 326 TWh/a. The spatial distribution of this demand is heterogeneous, with concentration in a few regions. Consequently, we posit that underground hydrogen storage is more likely in these regions, given that they are probable endpoints for pipelines, and industry clusters require an economic and steady hydrogen supply, which can be secured through storage.
h2l3 | 3 Indicators for safe operations of hydrogen in pore storage systems
dfzb | There are recommendations and evaluation schemes for the geotechnical and energetic use of the subsurface on a German and European level based on the operation of hydrocarbon reservoirs, underground storage facilities for both natural gas and CO2, the search for radioactive repositories and the utilization of geothermal resources (e.g., Sedlacek, 1999a; Sedlacek, 1999b; Chadwick et al., 2008; Reinhold et al., 2011; Alfarra et al., 2020; Stober and Bucher, 2021). Here we report positive and cautionary indicators for safe operations with hydrogen in underground pore storage systems based on a literature survey. The results are summarized in Table 1.
