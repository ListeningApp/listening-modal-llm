You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

90no | We clustered these 311 methods into 27 categories, or method typologies, verifying and debating them in a workshop setting, held at the Stockholm Resilience Centre in October 2016. Our motivation for categorizing methods was twofold: (1) abstracts were not consistently detailed in the kind of methods that they highlighted; (2) it was difficult to conduct a meaningful analysis of more than 300 methods in a way that we could service our objective of providing an overview of the field. We assigned each method to a single category, although many methods could fit under several categories. Categories were based on the way that these methods were perceived to be used in SES research by experts at the workshop, and ones that were considered to have a similar function, or that had similar sets of assumptions. Some categories contained only one or two methods, e.g., agent-based modeling, because workshop participants felt that they were either very broadly used in SES research, or fulfilled a unique function. Conversely, other categories, e.g. statistical methods, contained a diversity of methods, but were not seen to play a unique role in SES research, and resources for their use are readily available. The final set of categories are intended to provide an entry point for discussion around methods that are being used in SES research, and not as a definitive list of methods that can or should be used.
jt0y | To obtain the frequency of method categories in our database, we searched the full set of 4479 place-based studies for the 311 methods we had extracted from the subset of 2000 articles, and classified which categories each record belonged to. We were able to categorize 2742 of our place-based articles in this way. Thus, the remaining 1737 articles (38%) either did not mention the methods we detected in our search, or did not mention any methods in their abstracts. Readers should thus keep in mind that the list of methods identified in this study was not comprehensive.
qb7o | Features and dynamics of complex adaptive systems
oae5 | We used Preiser et al.'s (2018) typology of six organizing principles of CAS (Table 1) to qualitatively assess each method category in terms of its ability to account for key organizing principles of CAS. By "account" we mean the extent to which a method's assumptions and application allow them to investigate systems that are constituted relationally, context-dependent, radically open, adaptive, dynamic, and have complex causality. We chose this typology on account of Preiser et al.'s (2018) clear conceptualization of SES as CAS. We distinguished between method categories that "did not account for this feature of complexity" (0); "can account for this feature of complexity, depending on how it is employed" (1, sometimes); "can account for this feature of complexity, and is usually employed in a way that does" (2, most times); and "explicitly accounts for this
s0fl | element of complexity in the way it is constituted" (3, always). In our analysis, we considered the ways in which the different types of methods are, to our knowledge, normally used. Each of the authors independently scored the method clusters against each principle, and subsequently debated the scores that we disagreed on. Based on our discussions, we simplified our scores into two categories: "does not usually account for this complexity feature" (0), and "usually accounts for this complexity feature" (x).
43ia | RESULTS
3g2y | Of the chosen search terms, "nature society relations" (71.8%), "social-ecological" (31.78%), "man-environment* relations" (29.67%), "socio-ecological" (17.15%), "social-environmental" (12.1%), and "coupled human*" (3.2%) were the most commonly used in the full final result set <LATEX>\left( n = 5 0 9 8 \right) .</LATEX> Many publications contain more than one of these key words. The term "man- environment* relations" and "human environment" appeared to be more popular in earlier years, whilst the term "social- ecological," "socio-ecological" and "nature-society relations" have become more dominant in recent years (Fig. 1).
gc7v | Growth of the SES research space
wqfv | Our results show that there is a significant increase in the number of publications in the SES space, relative to the growth in all publications over time (Spearman's rank correlation, <LATEX>\mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 1 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. r h o = 0 . 0 8 2 3 \right) .</LATEX> Significant change points were detected between 1989 and 1990, between 1999 and 2000, and 2009 and 2010. A single change point analysis revealed the change between 1999 and 2000 to be the most significant change point <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5 \right.</LATEX> Similarly, the Bayesian change point analysis revealed most probable change points between 1989 and 1990 <LATEX>\left( p r o b = 0 . 9 9 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\chi ^ { 2 }</LATEX> = 0.0003), 1999 and 2000 <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { p r o b } = 0 . 9 5 2 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>x ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 0 2 ,</LATEX> but put a third change point between 2012 and 2013 (prob 0.940, <LATEX>x ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 0 2 .</LATEX> A fourth change point, between 2008 and 2009, had a posterior probability of 0.604 (Fig. 2). A posterior probability is a term in Bayesian statistics that refers to the conditional probability assigned to a proposition after relevant evidence has been considered (Lee 2012).
j30a | Journals over time
7bdk | We identified 1234 different sources that published papers on SES. The top 20 journals each published between 0.63% and 7.73% of all publications, accounting for 28.05% of publications in total (Fig. 3a). There were significant differences in the median number of publications between the five most prominent journals <LATEX>\left( x ^ { 2 } = \right.</LATEX> 32.1302, <LATEX>\mathrm { D F } = 4 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1 ,</LATEX> with Ecology and Society having significantly more publications (compared to Ambio, <LATEX>\mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1 ,</LATEX> Ecological Economics, <LATEX>p = 0 . 0 1 9 ,</LATEX> Global Environmental Change, <LATEX>p = 0 0 1 ,</LATEX> Journal of Environmental Management, <LATEX>\left. \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1 \right) .</LATEX> There were no significant differences between other journals (Fig. 3b). Ambio and Global Environmental Change published proportionally more papers in the SES field prior to 2000, while Ecology and Society has become increasingly dominant as the main journal publishing SES research since 2000 (Fig. 3c).
