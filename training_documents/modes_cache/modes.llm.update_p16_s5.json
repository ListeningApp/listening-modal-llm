        "content": "chx3 | Therapists who utilize the empathizing mode put a significant amount of time and effort into striving to understand a client's interpersonal needs and perspective as accurately as possible. They are able to notice and respond to the nuances in clients' affect and behavior, and they pay particular attention to clients' emotional experiences during therapy. Generally, they listen carefully, are watchful of what their clients communicate, and adjust their approach accordingly.\nsfcf | To ensure that they see things from the perspective of the client, therapists utilizing the empathizing mode will periodically summarize what a client has said or make other nonverbal attempts to reflect their understanding of what the client is communicating. This strategy leads a client to either affirm the therapist's accuracy or reassert or reexplain his or her perspective. This process of careful listening and observing inevitably leads to a richer understanding of what is being communicated. During occupational therapy sessions that involve activity, empathizing\nnuxs | requires a brief period of intermission from the \"doing\" aspects of therapy so that the therapist can process and convey an understanding of what a client has communicated.\numx0 | Therapists utilizing the empathizing mode take the time to accept and validate clients' difficult problems and painful emotions. They do not rush to intervene, solve, or ameliorate them. Instead, they work slowly and cautiously, emphasizing an accurate reflection of the client's perspective and relying on his or her continual striving toward understanding to resolve rifts, obstacles, and conflicts that occur during therapy.\no306 | Strengths of the Empathizing Mode\nqm1b | Empathy is vital to a functional and trusting therapeutic relationship. Witnessing, validating, actively listening to, and understanding clients' experiences in the absence of judgment facilitates emotional healing and enables clients to organize their thinking independently and gain perspective on their difficulties. Empathizing with clients provides a model for them to learn to empathize with themselves and to self-reflect and gain insight into their emotional reactions and behaviors.\nn9ms | In addition to these strengths, empathy is fundamental to the resolution of conflicts, rifts, and misunderstandings that occur during therapy. Because therapists who utilize the empathizing mode tend to be patient and understanding of negativity when it occurs, they are able to work more effectively with interpersonally challenging clients.\nicdp | CASE EXAMPLE Four point four The Empathizing Mode\nwtse | Gretta is an eighty-year-old woman who has had many life experiences, including an enduring and loving relationship with her husband. Four months before I met her, she experienced a severe stroke. Following her stroke and within weeks of beginning outpatient occupational therapy, her beloved husband died. Gretta had been depending on caretaking from her children and in-home attendants. She was referred to outpatient therapy to increase mobilization and participation in activities of daily living and independent activities of daily living.\nbm7g | Immediately, I recognized that Gretta was in a period of intense mourning. I could see that this woman was searching for a human connection. She wanted to grieve and talk about her loss. At that time she was less interested in pursuing occupational therapy goals that would address her functional limitations. I knew I would have to wait to begin work on activities of daily living and, instead, focus on what she wanted to talk about: her husband, what he meant to her, how difficult it was to live in his absence, her thoughts about not wanting to burden her children. . . . I was very conscious about when to\njr68 | talk and when not to talk. . . . I made sure she knew that I had heard what she said and that I understood all of the difficulties she was facing. . . . I also made sure she knew that her thoughts and feelings made sense to me and that I accepted them and honored their importance. For weeks we talked about her current situation, the limitations her stroke caused, how she reacted to it, and how her family reacted. In time, we worked together to create a family situation that would make it easier for everyone to cope with the recent death. I was careful not to mention our discussions or disclose her private thoughts and feelings to her family members. A feeling of mutual trust developed between the two of us. We worked together to manage her stroke and her grieving. Therefore, we also made progress toward the original goals of the therapy.\naxix | Gretta taught me the importance of having empathy. For her, it was important that I showed an interest in her grieving and that she could tell a person outside her family about her problems and worries. Because Gretta allowed me to support her through empathy, we both saw the improvements in her emotional condition during therapy.\n05y4 | Empathizing tends to disarm clients who are reluctant, resistant, critical, or otherwise negativistic in therapy. When therapists utilize empathy, clients are likely to feel responded to, cared about, and respected. They are more likely to achieve open, honest communication with clients. This typically increases trust and results in a more stable therapeutic relationship.\n2fb0 | Cautions of the Empathizing Mode\ns9fn | It would seem that a therapist could never empathize too much with clients. However, the empathizing mode is no different than the other modes in that its overuse or misuse can cause difficulty. For some clients, overemphasis on the empathizing mode can place emotions too much in the foreground of therapy. Some clients may not be ready to see or hear their thoughts, behaviors, or emotions reflected back to them. Instead, they may feel more stable and comfortable focusing on activity and other practical behavioral aspects of occupational therapy. Similarly, if a therapist relies too heavily on empathy, the pacing of treatment is slow, and some of the fundamental tasks of therapy may be delayed or left unaccomplished. For clients who are not yet ready to engage in occupational therapy, this slower pace may be necessary and appropriate. However, therapists who rely too heavily on the empathizing mode may project their own needs for empathy onto the client. Therefore, they may misread the client's actual level of need for empathy. Therapists who show their own emotional reactions to what the clients are saying or that probe too much for emotional expression from the client are perceived by some clients as overinvolved or psychologically intrusive. These clients may respond by recoiling from what they perceive as too much intimacy or emotional intensity.\nk5r6 | Even when a client invites or appears comfortable with the empathizing mode, overutilizing it can overprotect clients. Listening and validating may occur at the expense of questioning or challenging clients to engage in occupation when they are ready. Overreliance on empathy may encourage an inappropriate level of dependence in more vulnerable or isolated clients. In addition, there is a risk that some clients may become confused about the goals of therapy and about the role of the occupational therapist in his or her treatment. In the absence of appropriate boundaries some clients begin to per-",
