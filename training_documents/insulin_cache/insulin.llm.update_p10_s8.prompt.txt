You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

8l69 | 3.5.2. Impact of insulin resistance on learning and motivation
1jyv | As observed in rodent studies, the effects of insulin resistance on brain DA signalling are not limited to food intake behaviour. Lower ß- cell function and lower insulin sensitivity were related to increased delayed reward discounting indicating more impulsive choices prefer- ring a small, immediate monetary reward, over a larger, delayed reward (Eisenstein et al., 2015). In line, more impulsive behaviour in the stop signal task of insulin-resistant subjects was mediated by striatal activa- tion (Eckstrand et al., 2017). Furthermore, overweight and obesity, which can be concomitant with insulin resistance, are associated with impaired learning from negative feedback (Coppin et al., 2014; Mathar et al., 2017). Human studies reveal that insulin resistance also affects
olce | motivation. The influence of insulin on motivation highly depends on a person's satiety/hunger state of the organism: while hunger is associ- ated with higher motivation for reward in insulin-sensitive humans, this effect gets lost in insulin-resistant humans (Hanssen et al., 2021). In- terventions improving insulin signalling (such as GLP-1 analogues) restore the effect of hunger on motivation in insulin-resistant humans. Importantly, this holds true for both food and monetary reward, indi- cating that insulin resistance not only impairs food related behaviour but is relevant for pathological states characterized by generally diminished motivational behaviour.
erx1 | Collectively, and aligned with the preclinical findings, impaired in- sulin signalling in humans impairs food cue reactivity, learning and nutritional state-dependent motivation for reward.
b3bt | 4. Clinical link to depression
0w8m | Given the influence of insulin and insulin resistance on reward behaviour, it is unsurprising that epidemiological studies have estab- lished a clear link between diabetes and depression and in particular anhedonia (Khaledi et al., 2019). Multiple meta-analyses showed a strong relationship between depression/anhedonia and obesity (which is associated with insulin resistance) (Abou Abbas et al., 2014; de Wit et al., 2010; Pereira-Miranda et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2011). Indeed, longitudinal studies demonstrated, that obesity increased the risk of experiencing depressive symptoms 1-5 years later (Frank et al., 2022), indicating a causal role on an epidemiological level. Interestingly, this association was not explained by socio-demographic, lifestyle, or illness-related factors, including systemic inflammation suggesting that metabolic dysregulation (and potentially insulin resistance) may play a direct role in the pathophysiology of depressive symptoms. Indeed, recent meta-analyses bridge the link between obesity and depression showing that insulin resistance increases the risk for depression: The prevalence of depression is increased to 19.1 % (range 6.5-33 %) for people with type II diabetes compared to 10.7 % (range 3.8-19.4 %) in people without diabetes. This is further supported by genetic studies, that report a genetic overlap between obesity, type II diabetes, and depression (Fanelli et al., 2022).
vcu3 | The link between insulin resistance and depression is bidirectional. In depressed patients, both insulin levels and the Homeostatic Model Assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) - a proxy for peripheral insulin resistance - are elevated during the acute episode but not during remission (Fernandes et al., 2022). Insulin resistance is associated with increased disease severity (Watson et al., 2021) and compromised an- tidepressant' treatment efficacy (Jeremiah et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2015). In a sub-analysis, Fernandes et al. (2022) revealed that in particular "atypical depression" is linked to increased insulin resistance. Although the concept of "atypical depression" (mood reactivity, hyperphagia, hypersomnia, interpersonal difficulty) is still under debate, notably increased appetite and weight gain belong to the core features of this subtype. In fact, about 35 % of MDD patients report increased appetite during a depressive episode, and about 20 % of MDD patients gain weight (Maxwell and Cole, 2009). Moreover, weight gain across depressive episodes is highly correlated within patients, suggesting a trait-like character (Stunkard et al., 1990). Therefore, it is unclear whether increased food intake results in reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity, or rather insulin resistance leads to mesolimbic dysregula- tion that is known to drive food intake (see 3.3). Supporting the latter hypothesis, Simmons et al. (2020) discovered that increased appetite in MDD patients was related to insulin resistance and low-grade inflam- mation (IL-1RA and IL-6) although the BMI was not different from pa- tients with reduced appetite. In fact, the extent of insulin resistance correlated with the insular cortex response to food cues. In a large sample of 400 MDD patients, Kroemer et al. (2022) confirmed that the direction of appetite change is characterised by a specific neuronal signature. In resting state fMRI data, they found different NAc functional connectivity patterns between patients with increased and reduced
hjzj | appetite; this study however did not consider metabolic parameters. Beyond appetite changes, anhedonia was found to be strongly linked with poor glycaemic control (OR 1.29, 95 % CI 1.09-1.52) in 5772 MDD patients (Nefs et al., 2012), but in a smaller sample of 604 participants with type 1 and 382 participants with type 2 diabetes, Ehrmann et al. (2017) could not replicate this finding.
j79f | 4.1. The molecular mechanisms linking diabetes and depression
6tbv | Despite the clear link between diabetes and depression on an epidemiological level, the molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Given the aforementioned evidence on DA-insulin interaction, impaired DA signalling in conditions of central insulin resistance has been pro- posed as a potential mechanism between depressive and anxious symptoms. In the last few years, a wave of fundamental rodent studies has provided evidence that insulin resistance in brain DA pathways can lead to depressive and anxious symptoms. This has been shown across different models of insulin resistance including HFD-induced insulin resistance (Dutheil et al., 2016b; Sharma and Fulton, 2013), STZ-induced diabetes (Ho et al., 2012b; Roostaei et al., 2018), and in- sulin receptor knockout in neurons (Kleinridders et al., 2015) or glial cells (Cai et al., 2018a).
xb13 | Kleinridders et al. (2015) reported that brain/neuron IR knockout (NIRKO) mice, show age-dependent depressive and anxious behaviour due to impaired mitochondrial function and increased DA turnover by MAO, which is normally suppressed by insulin. Insulin receptor knock-out in glial cells, in turn, reduces ATP exocytosis, resulting in decreased purinergic signalling on DA neurons and subsequently anxi- ety- and depressive-like behaviour (Cai et al., 2018a). Mechanistically, a subsequent hyperdopaminergic state within the amygdala is probably responsible for the increase in anxiety observed in insulin-resistant and diabetic rats (Rebolledo-Solleiro et al., 2016). Interestingly, down- regulation of the IR in the hypothalamus can also induce depressive-like behaviour in rodents (Grillo et al., 2014) indicating that insulin signal- ling in the hypothalamus might also affect DA signalling in the midbrain.
