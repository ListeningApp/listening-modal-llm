You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

pfv5 | The choice <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star } ,</LATEX> namely the one that cancels the second order response <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> performs quite well for the Feynman-Kac and divergence-free forcings, as seen in Figures 3a and 3c. It allows to extend the range of linearity for <LATEX>\eta > 1 ,</LATEX> an increase of over tenfold when compared to the original response curve for <LATEX>\alpha = 0 .</LATEX> This allows for a variance reduction of a factor of order 1000 for the estimator (2.38), as documented in Section 4.5.
8gxa | Figure 3b illustrates the discussion of Section 3.3 about choosing the values of <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> allowing to stay longer in an approximate linear response. Although the value of the parameter <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> such that <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 } \left( \alpha \right) = 0</LATEX> is <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star } = 1 . 0</LATEX> for the modified fluctuation-dissipation, we see that <LATEX>\alpha _ { \star } \left( 0 . 0 5 \right) = 0 . 6 3 9</LATEX> is a much more nicely behaved curve, staying within 5%

ysz7 | 4.3. Overdamped Langevin dynamics - two-dimensional case. We now present the numerical results for overdamped Langevin dynamics in dimension two, defined on <LATEX>\mathcal{X} = \mathbb{T} ^ { 2 } ,</LATEX> with the following periodic potential energy:
k5db | <LATEX>V \left( q \right) = \frac { 1 } { 2 } \cos \left( 2 \pi q _ { 1 } \right) + \cos \left( 2 \pi q _ { 2 } \right) + \kappa \cos \left( 2 \pi \left( q _ { 1 } - q _ { 2 } \right) \right) ,</LATEX> with <LATEX>\kappa \in \mathbb{R} .</LATEX> The observable considered here is of the same form as (4.5), and reads
7jzh | <LATEX>R \left( q \right) = \left( a \cos \left( 2 \pi q _ { 1 } \right) + b \sin \left( 2 \pi q _ { 1 } \right) \right) \mathrm { e } ^ { \beta V \left( q \right) } .</LATEX> For observables of this form, expressions (4.6) and (4.7) can be generalized to higher dimensions to compute the normalization constants. As in Section 4.2, this ensures that <LATEX>\rho _ { 1 } = \rho _ { 2 } = 1</LATEX> when <LATEX>\kappa = 0 .</LATEX> When <LATEX>\kappa</LATEX> is nonzero but not too large, <LATEX>\rho _ { 1 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 }</LATEX> are of order 1, which is convenient to observe deviations from the linear regime.
vm00 | For all numerical results presented here, we considered <LATEX>\kappa = 0 . 3</LATEX> and a constant nongradient forcing <LATEX>F = \left( 1 , 0 \right) \in \mathbb{R} ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> The spatial domain <LATEX>\mathbb{T} ^ { 2 } = \left[ 0 , 1 \right) ^ { 2 }</LATEX> was discretized using a regular product mesh of <LATEX>m _ { q } = 2 0 0</LATEX> points per dimension.
62qe | The results presented in Figure 4 correspond to response curves for each of the synthetic forcings discussed in Section 3.2.2. Figure 4a corresponds to the Feynman- Kac forcing (3.9), with <LATEX>\xi = \left( 1 , 0 \right) \in \mathbb{R} ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> It is observed that this extra forcing is more effective in extending the linear regime when it is in the same direction as the physical perturbation <LATEX>F ,</LATEX> hence our choice of <LATEX>\xi .</LATEX> We generalize the exponential divergence-free vector field (4.8) presented in Section 4.2 to higher dimensions as <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { e x t r a } } = \mathrm { e } ^ { V } \left( \nabla \cdot \right) ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\begin{array}{} \text { presented n } \\ \text { Overall } \end{array}</LATEX> in Figure 4c.
ypz9 | the results are qualitatively similar to those from Section 4.2, apart from two main differences. First, we present a divergence-free vector field of the form <LATEX>\nabla V ^ { T } A \nabla ,</LATEX> with <LATEX>A</LATEX> the symplectic matrix given by (3.11), which has an un- derwhelming impact on increasing the linear regime as seen in Figure 4d, even for <LATEX>\alpha _ { \star } \left( 0 . 0 5 \right) = 2 . 0 .</LATEX> It seems therefore not to be a good option to consider. Second, Figure 4e shows that the Feynman-Kac forcing performs better than the exponential divergence-free field. On the other hand, the modified fluctuation-dissipation (3.8) is once again underwhelming, as seen in Figure 4b, with response curve for <LATEX>\alpha _ { \star } \left( 0 . 0 5 \right) =</LATEX> 0.59 once again performing better than <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star } = 1 . 3 0 1 .</LATEX> Note that the value <LATEX>\alpha _ { \star } \left( \varepsilon \right)</LATEX> was not computed for the Feynman-Kac and the exponential divergence-free forcings, as <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star }</LATEX> sufficiently extends the regime of linear response for those cases.
