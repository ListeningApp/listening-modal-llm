Sample descriptions\ngvwz | Four basaltic eucrites (Juvinas, Camel Donga, Stannern, and Agoult) with an anomalous basaltic achondrite, Ibitira, were studied in this paper. Of the five, three (Juvinas, Camel Donga, and Stannern) are breccias, and the other two (Agoult and Ibitira) are unbrecciated granulites. Brief descriptions of the meteorites are given in the following subsections. The details are summarized in Table One.\nsk5m | Two point one. Juvinas\nqws8 | Juvinas is known to have fallen in France in eighteen twenty-one. It is composed of various igneous clasts, a porous matrix, and recrystallized areas. According to the metamorphic classification of basaltic eucrites proposed by Takeda and Graham, the chemically equilibrated pyroxenes in Juvinas indicate a thermal metamorphic grade of five. Various chronologies of Juvinas exhibit large variations, reflecting its extremely complicated metamorphic history. The two hundred and seven lead-two hundred and six lead age of its zircons has been reported at approximately four thousand five hundred sixty million years ago and four thousand five hundred forty-five plus or minus fifteen million years ago. These values are consistent with the one hundred eighty-two hafnium-one hundred eighty-two tungsten isochron age of four thousand five hundred forty-six plus or minus three million years ago for the whole rock and its silicate fractions. Conversely, the two hundred seven lead-two hundred six lead isochron of the Juvinas silicates indicates a significantly younger age of four thousand three hundred twenty plus or minus one point seven million years ago. Its forty argon-thirty-nine argon age was disturbed much later at approximately four billion years ago.\n877u | Two point two. Camel Donga\nrzhj | Camel Donga was found in Western Australia in nineteen eighty-four. This meteorite is a severely metamorphosed polymict breccia. Its highly equilibrated pyroxene indicates severe thermal metamorphism. A unique characteristic of Camel Donga is its anomalously high abundances of secondary metallic iron (up to two weight percent), which is thought to be the result of decomposition of initial iron sulfides and silicates during post-crystallization reheating. Mineralogical and chronological studies of Camel Donga also indicate its complicated metamorphism. The aluminum-magnesium short-lived radiometric system in this\nbfax | Four thousand five hundred fifty-six point seven five plus or minus zero point five seven. Four thousand five hundred fifty-two point zero plus or minus eight point eight. Four thousand four hundred ninety-six point eight million years ago. Four thousand four hundred eighty-seven plus or minus fifteen. The data are from various sources.\nf2y8 | eucrite recorded early crystallization at four thousand five hundred sixty-four point thirty-one plus zero point ninety-eight or minus three point forty-eight million years ago. Its zircon two hundred seven lead-two hundred six lead age is four thousand five hundred thirty-one plus or minus ten million years ago, resolvably younger than those of the other basaltic eucrites with mean values of four thousand five hundred fifty-five million years ago. Its oxide two hundred seven lead-two hundred six lead age has been determined to be four thousand five hundred fifteen point forty-three plus or minus zero point forty-two million years ago, slightly younger than its zircon age. Meanwhile, its plagioclase recorded a significantly younger forty argon-thirty-nine argon age of three thousand seven hundred fifty million years ago.\no7qm | Two point three. Stannern\nd52l | Stannern is a monomict brecciated eucrite that fell in the Czech Lands in eighteen oh one. Compared to Juvinas and Camel Donga, its pyroxene chemistry and textural properties exhibit weak thermal effects, suggesting a metamorphic grade of four. Chronological studies of Stannern have revealed an old crystallization age of four thousand five hundred sixty-four plus or minus two million years ago and multiple later metamorphic events. Its slightly younger zircon two hundred seven lead-two hundred six lead age has been reported at four thousand five hundred fifty plus or minus ten million years ago. The uranium-lead and potassium-argon systems in its silicates were severely disturbed.\nqlbb | Two point four. Agoult\n```",
