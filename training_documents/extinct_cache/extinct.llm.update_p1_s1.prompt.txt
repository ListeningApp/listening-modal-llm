You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

uow2 | Overview Review
iat7 | The ethics of species extinctions
ywwr | Abstract
0i6j | This review provides an overview of the ethics of extinctions with a focus on the Western analytical environmental ethics literature. It thereby gives special attention to the possible philosophical grounds for Michael Soulé's assertion that the untimely 'extinction of populations and species is bad'. Illustrating such debates in environmental ethics, the guiding question for this review concerns why - or when - anthropogenic extinctions are bad or wrong, which also includes the question of when that might not be the case (i.e. which extinctions are even desirable). After providing an explanation of the disciplinary perspective taken (section "Introduction"), the concept of extinction and its history within that literature are introduced (section "Understanding extinction"). Then, in section "Why (or when) might anthropogenic extinctions be morally problematic?", different reasons for why anthropogenic extinctions might be morally problematic are presented based on the loss of species' value, harm to nonhuman individuals, the loss of valuable biological variety and duties to future generations. This section concludes by also considering cases where anthropogenic extinctions might be justified. Section "How to respond to extinctions?" then addresses a selection of topics concern- ing risks and de-extinction technologies. Finally, the section on "Extinction studies" introduces other viewpoints on the ethics of extinction from the extinction studies literature, followed by the "Conclusion".
87cq | This is an overview review article of the ethics of species extinctions drawing on the environ- mental ethics literature. While most people seem to believe that extinctions are morally bad or wrong, no systematic review of the moral philosophical literature that can support or question such intuitions on this subject matter has been provided to date, which is the gap that this review article aims to fill.
0qs3 | Introduction
z8f7 | In an influential essay, conservation biologist Michael Soulé offered a list of what he termed 'postulates of conservation biology'. Amongst these were also 'normative postulates' (i.e. value statements) such as that '[d]iversity of organisms is good' and, relatedly, that 'the untimely extinction of populations and species is bad' (1985, 730, italics in original removed). Soulé did not present any detailed argumentative justification for these normative postulates (see Baard, 2022, 20ff), yet much could and must be said about their moral grounds, which provides an invitation to further discuss the ethical basis of species extinctions. So, why exactly are extinctions bad or wrong?
7w7j | Extinctions - either as the extinction of single species or as mass extinction events on earth - are not only a matter of scientific inquiry and of policy relevance, but also a subject addressed by moral philosophy through questions concerning, amongst other things, the moral relevance and ontological status of species, moral responsibilities for human-caused extinctions, any moral obligations to avoid the loss of species and so on. Thus, this body of literature will aid us to explore the question of why extinctions might be bad or wrong, and for that purpose, we will provide a review of philosophical articles and books pertaining to the ethics of extinction (setting aside adjacent fields such as environmental law and history).
51vd | Moral philosophy, or ethics, is a normative discipline distinguished from empirical research on people's values, preferences and practices as done in sociology, economics and history. Moral philosophy aims to assess critically and systematically the normative reasons that are expressed through/in value judgements, decisions and actions. It ranges from interrelated investigations about normative and evaluative languages and the relationship between fact and value (often known as meta-ethics), to research about fundamental ethical principles and ethical theories such as utilitarianism, deontology and virtue ethics (normative ethics), to the moral scrutiny of real-
baj1 | world cases and problems (practical/application-oriented/area- specific ethics). These three areas are often intertwined, and what is often called 'applied ethics' is not about merely applying more general or fundamental ethical theories. Rather, application- oriented practical reasoning gives rise to novel challenges and insights, which in turn also influence more general and fundamen- tal discussions in ethics.
n1wo | Environmental ethics spans across all these three areas of moral philosophy with a particular focus on concepts and arguments relating to the environment and nature, including the ethics of extinction, which gives rise to discussions about values and duties but also about issues concerning concepts such as species, ecosys- tems or biodiversity. Due to problems of deriving an action-guiding fought' from a descriptive 'is',1 ethical discussions are pivotal to reasoning about and acting upon environmental issues.
5bq3 | Based on this disciplinary perspective, different positions and arguments presented here are not necessarily compatible with each other, because there are disagreements on different argumentative premises, intuitions, sentiments and underlying ethical theories. Therefore, in the following we are presenting different argumenta- tive positions, but not a philosophical consensus on the ethical dimensions of species extinctions, such as in the form of a coherent theory that most authors would agree on, which is similar to how there are also disagreements in the natural and social sciences regarding which theory provides the best explanation of a natural or social phenomenon, which is not a weakness of this literature but an inherent feature of philosophical discussions that aim to critic- ally exchange and improve arguments and theories. Ultimately, the moral judgements one finds reasonable or justified regarding extinction will not only depend on one's empirical premises (and the quality thereof) but also on different metaphysical, ontological and normative premises and intuitions about how one sees the natural world and how one relates to it and lives within it.
ezla | Illustrating such debates in environmental ethics, the guiding question for this review concerns why - or when - anthropogenic (i.e. human-caused) extinctions are bad or wrong, which also includes the question of when that might not be the case (i.e. which extinctions are even desirable). This overarching ques- tion guides this review in two ways. Firstly, it led our selection of relevant positions and areas of discussion to be included in the review. In that regard, we aimed for as much comprehensiveness as possible pertaining to the representation of the main categories of reasons that have been presented in the field that can argumenta- tively support (or question) Soulé's postulate. Secondly, this ques- tion narrows the scope of this review by including only arguments and positions that pertain to the ethics of extinction as opposed to providing a review of the much broader field of conservation ethics (about how to protect nonhuman individuals, species, ecosystems and landscapes). Consequently, we will cover, on the one hand, the major areas of discussion regarding the ethics of extinction (such as a growing body of literature on de-extinction technologies) and, on the other hand, we only include authors that provide substantive arguments on the topic of extinction (narrowly conceived).
rsbu | To illustrate the breadth of such considerations, we will provide an overview of different concerns and arguments that are being discussed in the Western anglophone environmental ethics litera- ture on species extinctions, broadly within the tradition of analyt- ical philosophy. So, two caveats ought to be mentioned with respect
