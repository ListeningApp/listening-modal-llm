You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

We subsequently searched all abstracts and key words of the full dataset of articles (4479 studies) for the identified key words. Searching the full dataset, and combining some key terms (see Appendix 2), changed the prominence of key terms slightly. In the final analysis, the top 20 terms differed significantly <LATEX>\left( x ^ { 2 } = 5 3 2 6 . 3 7 7 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>d f = 2 5 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1</LATEX> in the frequency with which they were used in the literature. The terms that were most frequently encountered in author key words were (variations of) "policy" (30.8% of publications), "trade" (23.8%), "conservation"(22.3%), "adaptation" (22.3%), "land use change" (21.9%), "water" (20.2%), "forest loss" (19.9%), "sustainability" (18.8%) and "urban" (18.8%) and "governance and institutions" (17.5%; Fig 6b, Appendix 2).

320g | Methods addressing complexity features
tp8g | Table 4 shows how well each method category scores in terms of its ability to account for each characteristic of complexity, zero ("0") being "usually not well" and "x" being "usually well," along with a justification for each scoring decision. We judged "futures analysis," "comparative case study analysis," "behavioral analysis," "decision analysis," "games," "systems scoping," "participatory modeling and planning," "state-and-transition analysis," "historical profiling and reconstruction," "discourse analysis," and "facilitated dialogues" to be method categories that usually address all six features of CAS (mean score = 1). Method categories "optimization analysis," "impact analysis," "quantitative pattern recognition," and "statistical analysis" were reasoned to address features of complexity least well. The features of complexity that were best addressed were "constituted relationally," followed by "contextual" and "dynamic," "adaptive," "complex causality" and "radically open."
gxfd | DISCUSSION
s2v1 | Our study provides insights on trends in the SES research field in terms of the terminology used, journals being published in, the type of research, where it is being done and by whom, topics being investigated, and the methods being used. Although a number of reviews (Brandt et al. 2013, Droste et al. 2018, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Partelow 2018, Colding and Barthel 2019) exploring
jkp9 | similar issues have recently been published, our analysis takes a particularly broad view, and specifically focuses on the methods used in SES field through a list of method "categories" or typologies, also assessing the extent to which they account for the underlying organizing principles of CAS. Here we discuss five broad conclusions from these results, and their implications for advancing SES research.
