You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

87vz | 2002; Wu et al., 2002). It also inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase activity (Kehr et al., 1972; Wolf and Roth, 1990) and therefore DA synthesis (Ford, 2014). Somatodendritic D2 receptors in the VTA also regulate DA signalling. Upon DA release from the soma and dendrites, DA binds to somatodendritic D2 receptors, which activates hyperpolarizing G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel (GIRK) currents resulting in reduced firing rate and excitability of VTA DA neurons (Beckstead and Williams, 2007; Lacey et al., 1987; Mercuri et al., 1997). While both axonal and somatodendritic D2 receptors reduce DA sig- nalling onto medium spiny neuron (MSN) in the NAc, it is unclear how regulation of DA signalling via axonal and somatodendritic D2 receptors is intertwined and whether treatments, that change efferent axonal DA release, also cause similar changes in local somatodendritic DA release. Additionally, neuronal DA signalling is modulated by surrounding as- trocytes, along with microglia and oligodendrocytes, which are impor- tant for the homeostasis of the brain microenvironment (Cai et al., 2018a).
ym66 | 1.3. Operationalization of dopamine-dependent reward behaviour
l0a3 | As a result, DA signalling between VTA and ventral striatum portrays two specific signals, both of which are affected by a plethora of regu- latory influences equally important to guide reward-seeking behaviour and: 1) DA functions as a learning signal by encoding the difference between an expected and received reward guiding future reward- seeking behaviour and 2) it encodes motivation to approach a possible reward (Berke, 2018; Syed et al., 2016; Zolin et al., 2021). With both signals combined, DA conveys the decision variable "available reward for investment of effort", which is employed for both learning and motivational functions (Hamid et al., 2016). Studies assessing reward-seeking behaviour encoded by the DA midbrain in animals or humans employ many different tasks, each addressing a combination of the different aspects of reward-seeking behaviour guided by learned associations. In animals, food, in particular palatable food high in sugar (and fat), or addictive drugs are often used as rewards, the approach thereof, its retrieval and consumption as well as the effort exerted to obtain the reward (lever pressing) are measured to quantify motivation. Place preference conditioned by reward-predicting stimuli and learning of reward magnitude (such as indicated by size of lick bursts in a reward licking task) and reward retrieval (e.g. in a T-maze or three chamber arena) are widely used to analyze learning behaviour. In humans, self-report questionnaires, a variety of motivation and learning tasks in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) have been leveraged to disentangle the underlying mechanisms. While we here focus on DA-encoded reward-responsiveness, it needs to be kept in mind, that - apart from the difficulty of deciphering the many aspects of reward-seeking behaviour and the varied molecular regulators - reward-seeking behaviour is also affected by further cell types in the VTA and NAc, such as the VTA glutamate neurons, GABA neurons and local opioid signalling (Korotkova et al., 2004; Meier et al., 2021; Ohta et al., 2022; Zell et al., 2020).
u8nw | 2. Insulin signalling in the brain
l2v9 | Motivated behaviour - particularly food-seeking - critically depends on an organism's metabolic need and energy storage (e.g. an apple ap- pears more valuable when we are hungry than when we just had lunch). Therefore, homeostatic information is integrated with external cues in the midbrain DA system through multiple pathways to ensure goal- directed adaptive behaviour. One of these pathways comprises meta- bolic hormones, which bind to their respective receptors in the DA midbrain to convey the current homeostatic state. In particular, insulin receptors are densely expressed in DA circuits.
afbe | Secreted in the pancreas, insulin reaches the CNS through the bloodstream and crosses the blood-brain barrier through a saturable
78r8 | transport system (Banks et al., 1997; Rhea et al., 2018). Rodent studies indicate that a small proportion of insulin is also directly synthesised in the brain, predominantly by neurons and neuronal progenitor cells of the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus (Kuwabara et al., 2011). In particular, GABA-ergic neurogliaform cells have been identified as po- tential producers of insulin in the CNS (Molnár et al., 2014). However, whether this CNS-derived insulin is physiologically relevant is still controversial and, so far, there is no evidence for local insulin produc- tion in the human brain.
320g | In the brain, insulin receptors are ubiquitously expressed on neurons and glial cells, with the highest density in the olfactory bulb and the limbic areas. In contrast to adult peripheral tissues, where the long re- ceptor isoform B (IR-B) predominates, neurons almost exclusively ex- press the short isoform A (IR-A), lacking 12 amino acids within the C- terminus of the «-subunit (Gammeltoft et al., 1985; Heidenreich et al., 1983), but glial cells primarily express IR-B (Adamo et al., 1989; Mil- stein and Ferris, 2021). In contrast to IR-B, IR-A has a 2-fold higher sensitivity for insulin and can also bind IGF-1 (Denley et al., 2004; Milstein and Ferris, 2021; Mosthaf et al., 1990; Yamaguchi et al., 1991).
tp8g | 2.1. Intracellular pathways activated by insulin
gxfd | Insulin unfolds its action by binding to the extracellular alpha- subunit of the insulin receptor, which causes dimerization and auto- phosphorylation of the intracellular ß-subunit.
s2v1 | This induces two canonical signalling pathways: 1) the PI3K/AKT pathway via tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate proteins (IRS) supported by the adaptor molecule SH2B1 (Morris et al., 2009) and 2) the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways via phosphorylation of Shc (and/or IRS) (for details see Fig. 1).
