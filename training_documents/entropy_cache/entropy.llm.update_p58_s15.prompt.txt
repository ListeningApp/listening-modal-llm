You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7wep | Thanks to this, if we have a system whose space of states is <LATEX>\mathbb{R} ^ { n }</LATEX> and its energy function <LATEX>E : \mathbb{R} ^ { n } \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</LATEX> is a positive definite quadratic form, we can compute
70t5 | <LATEX>\langle E \rangle = \frac { \int _ { \mathbb{R} ^ { n } } E \left( x \right) \exp \left( - \beta E \left( x \right) \right) d x } { \int _ { \mathbb{R} ^ { n } } \exp \left( - \beta E \left( x \right) \right) d x }</LATEX> by reducing it to the previous case using a change of variables. We get
kwz0 | <LATEX>\langle E \rangle = \frac { 1 } { 2 } n k T</LATEX> 51
vool | So, each degree of freedom still contributes akT to the expected energy. That's the equipartition theorem!
jwym | But be careful. The equipartition theorem doesn't apply when the energy is an arbitrary function of n variables. It also fails when we switch from classical to quantum statistical mechanics.
umh8 | People sometimes memorize the conclusion of the equipartition theorem, E = 2nkT, without learning that it holds only for classical systems whose energy is a positive def- inite quadratic form. These people sometimes get fooled into thinking (E) is always proportional to T. Some of these poor benighted souls go around saying that temper- ature is just a measure of energy per degree of freedom. This completely ignores the subtlety of the concept of temperature.
1zay | As we've seen, the truly general relation between temperature and energy, for sys- tems in thermal equilibrium, also involves entropy:
ns7i | TdS = d(E).
fztd | THE AVERAGE ENERGY OF AN ATOM
o5o5 | Since an atom of helium gas can move in 3 directions, and its energy depends quadratically on its velocity and not on position, the equipartition theorem says that classically its expected energy should be
r5z1 | (E) = - kT 2 3
j696 | where T is temperature and k is Boltzmann's constant, about 1.38 . 10-23 joules/kelvin.
34d0 | So, heating an atom of helium gas 1 ℃ should take
9ugn | This is very close to the truth.
zvft | We can finally start reaping the rewards of all our thoughts about entropy! The equipartition theorem lets us estimate how much energy it takes to heat up one atom of helium one degree Celsius. And it works!
c1b3 | Of course we don't heat up an individual atom: we heat up a bunch. A mole of helium is about 6.02 . 1023 atoms, so heating up a mole of helium one degree Celsius (= 1 kelvin) should take about
k969 | 6.02 . 1023 x 2.07 . 10-23 ~ 12.46 joules
vt1d | And this is very close to correct! It seems the experimentally measured answer is 12.6 joules.
24sn | What are the sources of error? Most importantly, our calculation neglects the interaction between helium atoms. Luckily this is very small at standard temperature and pressure. We're also neglecting quantum mechanics. Luckily for helium this too gives only small corrections at standard temperature and pressure.
o0sh | It's important here that helium is a monatomic gas. In hydrogen, which is a diatomic gas, we get extra energy because this molecule can tumble around, not just move along. We'll try that next.
3max | THE ENERGY OF HYDROGEN
sysw | If we treat a molecule of hydrogen as a dumbbell whose position takes 3 numbers and whose axis whose takes 2 numbers to describe, we can try to use the equipartition theorem to estimate its expected energy as
nbik | (E) = - kT 5
sqoe | where T is temperature and k = 1.38 . 10-23 joules/kelvin.
ok42 | In this approximation, heating a molecule of hydrogen gas 1 kelvin takes
a22o | In reality it takes 3.39 . 10-23 joules at standard temperature and pressure. Not bad!
txc2 | A molecule of hydrogen gas is a blurry quantum thing, but let's pretend it's a classical solid dumbbell that can move and tumble but not spin around its axis. Then it has 3+2 = 5 degrees of freedom, and we can use the equipartition theorem to estimate its energy.
65aq | For T significantly less than 6000 kelvin, hydrogen molecules don't vibrate with the two atoms moving toward and away from each other. They don't spin around their axis until even higher temperatures. But they tumble like a dumbbell as soon as T exceeds about 90 kelvin.
i3ag | We need quantum mechanics to compute these things. But at room temperature and pressure, we can pretend a hydrogen gas is made of classical solid dumbbells that can move around and tumble but not spin around their axes! In this approximation the equipartition theorem tells us (E) = 5kT.
t1vi | This is fine as far as it goes-but our goal in this course is to compute the entropy of hydrogen. We'll start with a useful warmup: the classical harmonic oscillator.
hkxq | ENTROPY OF THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR: 1
9gst | A classical harmonic oscillator has energy
094q | = p2 kg2
nlyd | 2m
k5jo | where q is its position, p its momentum, m its mass and « its spring constant.
r3vp | By the equipartition theorem, in thermal equilibrium at temperature T it has expected energy (E) = kT where k is Boltzmann's constant.
nuc1 | So, using d(E) = TdS, its entropy is
2vej | S=Jas- Ja = k | -k(In
zj7x | Since this does not approach 0 as T -> 0 from above, the Third Law of Thermodynamics doesn't hold for the classical harmonic oscillator.
5dcq | But what is this constant C'? For that we must think harder.
1hqm | What's the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium? Using the equipartition theorem and the formula d(E) = TdS, we can show it's
2r71 | So, the entropy grows logarithmically with temperature. And it does not go to zero as T approaches zero: instead, it goes to negative infinity. So the Third Law of Thermo- dynamics does not hold for the classical harmonic oscillator!
ajz6 | That may seem shocking, but it actually makes sense. The Third Law holds only for certain special systems. Furthermore, we've seen that the entropy of a sharply peaked probability distribution on a continuous state space is negative. We'll see that the Boltzmann distribution for the classical oscillator gets more and more sharply peaked near q = p = 0 as the temperature approaches zero from above. So in fact, it makes perfect sense that the entropy approaches -0.
bsoa | However, the classical harmonic oscillator is just an approximation to the quantum harmonic oscillator, which does obey the Third Law. It's a good approximation at high temperatures, but bad at low temperatures. In fact, this business of negative entropies at low temperature is not something that happens in the real world. It's just a defect of classical mechanics. It's trying to tell us that quantum mechanics is better.
mmo2 | Another point: you'll have noticed that constant C here. What is it? We can make progress with a bit of dimensional analysis. The quantity ln T is a funny thing: if we change our units of temperature, it doesn't get multiplied by a constant factor, the way
j69r | physical quantities usually do. It changes by adding a constant! So k In T doesn't have dimensions of entropy. But
2ugw | must have dimensions of entropy. The constant C must somehow save the day! How does that work? Let's see.
