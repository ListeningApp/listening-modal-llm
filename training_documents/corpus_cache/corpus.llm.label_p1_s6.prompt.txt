You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

936l | Abstract
06yq | Objective: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe form of epileptic encepha- lopathy, presenting during the first years of life, and is very resistant to treatment. Once medical therapy has failed, palliative surgeries such as vagus nerve stimula- tion (VNS) or corpus callosotomy (CC) are considered. Although CC is more ef- fective than VNS as the primary neurosurgical treatment for LGS-associated drop attacks, there are limited data regarding the added value of CC following VNS. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of CC preceded by VNS.
dpv6 | Methods: This multinational, multicenter retrospective study focuses on LGS children who underwent CC before the age of 18 years, following prior VNS, which failed to achieve satisfactory seizure control. Collected data included

82qc | Results: A total of 127 cases were reviewed (80 males). The median age at epilepsy onset was 6 months (interquartile range <LATEX>\left. \left[ I Q R \right] = 3 . 1 2 - 2 2 . 7 5 \right) .</LATEX> The median age at VNS surgery was 7years <LATEX>\left( I Q R = 4 - 1 0 \right) ,</LATEX> and CC was performed at a median age of 11 years <LATEX>\left( I Q R = 8 . 7 6 - 1 5 \right) .</LATEX> The dominant seizure type was drop attacks (tonic or atonic) in 102 patients. Eighty-six patients underwent a single-stage complete CC, and 41 an ante- rior callosotomy. Ten patients who did not initially have a complete CC underwent a second surgery for completion of CC due to seizure persistence. Overall, there was at least a 50% reduction in drop attacks and other seizures in 83% and 60%, respec- tively. Permanent morbidity occurred in 1.5%, with no mortality.
ls7d | Significance: CC is vital in seizure control in children with LGS in whom VNS has failed. Surgical risks are low. A complete CC has a tendency toward better effectiveness than anterior CC for some seizure types.

t8vv | 1 INTRODUCTION |
qvnu | Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe form of epileptic encephalopathy, presenting during the first years of life, and is very resistant to control through antiseizure medications (ASMs). LGS may cause gen- eralized seizure phenotypes, and significantly impact neurodevelopmental aspects such as learning, behavior, alertness, and quality of life.1 Thus, seizure reduction is of utmost importance, especially in young children.2 Moreover, drop seizures, which occur in more than half of the patients, are a significant source of morbid- ity, causing severe injuries, and are among the most disabling factors in this syndrome.3 Many such patients require close and continuous supervision and head pro- tection with special helmets.
kggw | Once conventional ASMs have failed, palliative surger- ies such as vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) or corpus cal- losotomy (CC) should be considered.4,5 A comparison of the effectiveness and safety of CC and VNS, which are the most common palliative surgical methods, suggests that CC is more effective than VNS in reducing atonic seizure; there is 74%-85% reduction in tonic and atonic seizures following CC, compared to approximately 55% reduc- tion following VNS.46 However, CC is associated with a higher rate of adverse events when compared to VNS. For this reason, in many cases, physicians or family favor VNS over CC as the primary surgical palliative treatment.7
xrd1 | Although CC is more effective than VNS as the primary treatment for LGS-associated drop attacks, there are lim- ited data regarding the added value of CC following VNS.

7toz | Key Points
j346 | · CC has an added value on all seizure subtypes in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who have undergone prior vagus nerve stimulation
v8uq | · Complete CC has a tendency toward better ef- fectiveness than anterior CC
x972 | · Additional studies are needed to ascertain the low morbidity associated with complete callosotomy
cwrw | The current study evaluates the safety of CC and its ef- fectiveness for drop attacks and other seizure types follow- ing prior VNS for LGS.
4i0e | 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS |
h2l3 | This is a multicenter, multinational, retrospective, histori- cal cohort study. Following institutional review board ap- proval, we retrospectively reviewed the files of all children with LGS who underwent CC (complete or incomplete) following a prior VNS. Seventy-one international epilepsy centers were invited to participate based on personal con- tacts. No institutions were excluded; 27 did not respond, 17 centers had no cases meeting the inclusion criteria, one declined participation, and 26 centers contributed 145 pa- tients (ranging from one to 18 patients from each partici- pating center) operated on between 2003 and 2021.
dfzb | 2.1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria
u6ty | Children (up to 18 years of age during CC surgery) under- going CC surgery, who also underwent a prior VNS for LGS, were included in the study. The LGS diagnosis was based on the criteria of the International League Against Epilepsy.8 All variations of CC were included (anterior, posterior, complete, open disconnections, and radiofre- quency or laser ablation). All LGS etiologies were included. Other epileptic syndromes (unrelated to LGS) and patients who underwent VNS following prior CC were excluded.
awvu | 2.2 | Collected data
on9b | Collected data included demographics, epilepsy etiology, age at seizure onset, and seizure semiology. Surgical data included any prior epilepsy-related surgery (including re- sections, but not including CC), data regarding VNS sur- gery (including complications and effectiveness on drop seizures and other seizures), data regarding CC surgery (including technique, extent, complications, and effective- ness), and the need for additional surgeries.
a8ge | 2.3 | Study outcomes
h27a | The primary outcome was effectiveness of CC in reducing 50% of drop attacks at the last follow-up despite failure of a prior VNS. Secondary outcome measures were other sei- zure reductions, role of extent of callosotomy, and safety.
pdjh | 2.4 | Statistical analysis
xmgs | Data were tabulated in an Excel spreadsheet. SPSS soft- ware was used for all statistical analyses (SPSS Statistics, version 25, IBM). Categorical variables are reported as numbers and percentages. Comparison between outcomes of partial and complete callosotomy was done using the chi-squared test. Continuous variables are reported as me- dian and interquartile range (IQR). Correlation between
