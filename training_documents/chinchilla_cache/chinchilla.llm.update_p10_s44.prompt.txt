You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

yj0m | Chinchilla significantly outperforms Gopher on all evaluation subsets of The Pile (Gao et al., 2020), as shown in Figure 5. Compared to Jurassic-1 (178B) Lieber et al. (2021), Chinchilla is more performant on all but two subsets- dm_mathematics and ubuntu_irc- see Table A5 for a raw bits-per-byte comparison. On Wikitext103 (Merity et al., 2017), Chinchilla achieves a perplexity of 7.16 compared to 7.75 for Gopher. Some caution is needed when comparing Chinchilla with Gopher on these language modelling benchmarks as Chinchilla is trained on 4x more data than Gopher and thus train/test set leakage may artificially enhance the results. We thus place more emphasis on other
ewfp | tasks for which leakage is less of a concern, such as MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) and BIG-bench (BIG-bench collaboration, 2021) along with various closed-book question answering and common sense analyses.
oczy | 4.2.2. MMLU
2ttg | The Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2020) consists of a range of exam-like questions on academic subjects. In Table 6, we report Chinchilla's average 5-shot performance on MMLU (the full breakdown of results is shown in Table A6). On this benchmark, Chinchilla significantly outperforms Gopher despite being much smaller, with an average accuracy of 67.6% (improving upon Gopher by 7.6%). Remarkably, Chinchilla even outperforms the expert forecast for June 2023 of 63.4% accuracy (see Table 6) (Steinhardt, 2021). Furthermore, Chinchilla achieves greater than 90% accuracy on 4 different individual tasks- high_school_gov_and_politics, international_law, sociology, and us_foreign_policy. To our knowledge, no other model has achieved greater than 90% accuracy on a subset.
his3 | 4.2.3. Reading comprehension
m50z | On the final word prediction dataset LAMBADA (Paperno et al., 2016), Chinchilla achieves 77.4% accuracy, compared to 74.5% accuracy from Gopher and 76.6% from MT-NLG 530B (see Table 7). On RACE-h and RACE-m (Lai et al., 2017), Chinchilla greatly outperforms Gopher, improving accuracy by more than 10% in both cases-see Table 7.
me84 | 4.2.4. BIG-bench
o56m | We analysed Chinchilla on the same set of BIG-bench tasks (BIG-bench collaboration, 2021) reported in Rae et al. (2021). Similar to what we observed in MMLU, Chinchilla outperforms Gopher on the vast majority of tasks (see Figure 7). We find that Chinchilla improves the average performance by 10.7%, reaching an accuracy of 65.1% versus 54.4% for Gopher. Of the 62 tasks we consider, Chinchilla performs worse than Gopher on only four-crash_blossom, dark_humor_detection,
slz6 | mathematical_induction and logical_args. Full accuracy results for Chinchilla can be found (Paperno et al., 2016), Chinchilla outperforms both Gopher and MT-NLG 530B. improves performance over Gopher. Note that GPT-3 and MT-NLG 530B use a different prompt format than we do on RACE-h/m, so results are not comparable to Gopher and Chinchilla. On LAMBADA 82.3 71.6 47.9 - Table 7 | Reading comprehension. On RACE-h and RACE-m (Lai et al., 2017), Chinchilla considerably
90k5 | in Table A7.
9m8s | 4.2.5. Common sense
893y | We evaluate Chinchilla on various common sense benchmarks: PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020), SIQA (Sap
favz | et al., 2019), Winogrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2020), HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), and BoolQ
7szx | (Clark et al., 2019). We find that Chinchilla outperforms both Gopher and GPT-3 on all tasks and
hx9e | outperforms MT-NLG 530B on all but one task-see Table 8.
ywn2 | On TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021), Chinchilla reaches 43.6%, 58.5%, and 66.7% accuracy with 0-shot, 5-shot, and 10-shot respectively. In comparison, Gopher achieved only 29.5% 0-shot and 43.7% 10-shot accuracy. In stark contrast with the findings of Lin et al. (2021), the large improvements (14.1% in 0-shot accuracy) achieved by Chinchilla suggest that better modelling of the pre-training
a63r | data alone can lead to substantial improvements on this benchmark.
dqvj | 4.2.6. Closed-book question answering
r17u | Results on closed-book question answering benchmarks are reported in Table 9. On the Natural
3c47 | Questions dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), Chinchilla achieves new closed-book SOTA accuracies:
g345 | 31.5% 5-shot and 35.5% 64-shot, compared to 21% and 28% respectively, for Gopher. On TriviaQA
svhz | (Joshi et al., 2017) we show results for both the filtered (previously used in retrieval and open-book
oaen | work) and unfiltered set (previously used in large language model evaluations). In both cases, Chinchilla substantially out performs Gopher. On the filtered version, Chinchilla lags behind the open book SOTA (Izacard and Grave, 2020) by only 7.9%. On the unfiltered set, Chinchilla outperforms
5u67 | GPT-3-see Table 9.
dvms | 4.2.7. Gender bias and toxicity
qrd3 | Large Language Models carry potential risks such as outputting offensive language, propagating social biases, and leaking private information (Bender et al., 2021; Weidinger et al., 2021). We
rxrg | expect Chinchilla to carry risks similar to Gopher because Chinchilla is trained on the same data,
tf43 | Chinchilla, Gopher, and MT-NLG 530B on various Common Sense benchmarks. We see that Chinchilla BoolQ 60.5% 78.2% 91.4% - Table 8 | Zero-shot comparison on Common Sense benchmarks. We show a comparison between

df3e | albeit with slightly different relative weights, and because it has a similar architecture. Here, we examine gender bias (particularly gender and occupation bias) and generation of toxic language. We select a few common evaluations to highlight potential issues, but stress that our evaluations are not comprehensive and much work remains to understand, evaluate, and mitigate risks in LLMs.
