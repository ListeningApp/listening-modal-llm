        "content": "```\nyogo | conted It is well established that several receptors for bioactive lipids including LPAR and S one P R, and chemokine receptors including C X C R four can couple to G A twelve and thirteen and are involved in the metastatic potential of cancers. Either overexpression of these receptors, or their cognate ligands can create an oncocrine feed forward loop promoting proliferation and migration of cancer cells. Consistent with this, blockade of G A twelve signalling using breast cancer mouse models has been found to significantly reduce the metastatic ability of four T one mouse breast cancer cells, and significantly increase the metastasis-free survival of mice.\n2285 | Interestingly, the G A thirteen Rho A signalling axis has been found to have a tumor-suppressive role in a wide range of hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies including Burkitt's lymphoma, and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma. COSMIC analyses have revealed that G N A thirteen,\nys0g | and its downstream effector Rho A are significantly mutated in these cancer types with mutations distributed across the gene body as compared to easily recognizable hotspot mutations, which tend to be activating in nature. Across T C G A PanCancer studies, G N A thirteen appears to have a potential hotspot mutation at R two hundred, although it has not been formally tested and annotated as such by OncoKB. This cluster of mutations appears exclusively in bladder urothelial carcinomas, where G N A thirteen is significantly mutated; however, the function is currently unknown. G A twelve and thirteen has been well-studied in the context of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma where it is mutated in seven point three two percent of patients in T C G A. In particular, G N A thirteen is the most frequently mutated gene in germinal center derived B-Cell lymphomas, caused by aberrant expansion and dissemination of a subset of B cells that are highly regulated and tightly confined to germinal centers in lymphoid tissues. Mutations in upstream effectors, including the G A twelve and thirteen coupled including Sphingosine-one-phosphate-receptor- two, and P two R Y eight, a putative G A twelve and thirteen-coupling orphan G P C R, or in downstream effectors, including A R H G E F one have also been found.\n7zvp | Indeed, functional characterization of the most commonly detected G A thirteen, Rho A, and lymphoma associated S one P R two mutants showed significantly reduced signalling and downstream transcriptional activity, which could be rescued by expression of wild-type proteins in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism by which inactivation of the G A thirteen signalling pathway promotes development of lymphoma has not been fully characterized; however, several studies have found that suppression of the G A thirteen Rho A axis leads to an increase in phosphorylated-A K T in B cells. Consistent with this, elevated p A K T levels can be detected in immunohistochemistry of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma tumors, and high p A K T is associated with poor survival in Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma patients, suggesting that targeting the P I three K A K T pathway may be a viable treatment option for patients with G A thirteen loss.\nww6u | Mutations affecting G B and R G S signalling in cancer\nhpi6 | Functional participants of G protein signalling, including Regulator of G protein Signalling family proteins and B Y subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins can also play pro-oncogenic roles by modulating or potentiating G protein-driven signalling. R G S family proteins are physiological inhibitors of G proteins through their intrinsic G T P ase-accelerating protein activity, enhancing G T P hydrolysis by the G A-subunit, and promoting the reassembly and deactivation of the heterotrimeric G protein complex. Recent pan-cancer analyses have revealed transcriptomic dysregulation and hundreds of mutations in R G S proteins, enriched for those leading to loss of function, thereby promoting G protein activity via a previously unanticipated tumor suppressive\n4uhb | role, and mechanism of G protein signalling potentiation. For example, R G S seven is recurrently mutated in approximately thirteen percent of melanomas, where it promotes anchorage-independent growth, migration and invasion. Similarly, a close homolog R G S six, has been found to possess tumor suppressive functions in breast and bladder cancers.\nepyi | Currently, five G B subunits and twelve G Y subunits have been described, which can dimerize in numerous unique B Y combinations. Once activated by G T P binding, the G A subunit dissociates from G B Y dimers, enabling G B Y dimers to regulate distinct signalling axes including the P I three K A K T and M A P K pathways. Recurrent, activating mutations in G B proteins, G N B one and G N B two have been discovered in multiple cancers, namely in haematological malignancies where they induce aberrant activation of P I three K A K T and M A P K pathways. Strikingly, expression of patient-derived G N B one mutants were found to be transforming in vivo by induction of myeloid and B cell malignancies in mouse models. Of note, distinct mutations tend to cluster within cancer types based on cell lineage, suggesting that there may be lineage-dependent cellular predispositions determining the impact of specific G B mutations.\ny51p | G B Y subunits have been also been found to drive cell migration and metastasis. Along with P I P three, G B Y can directly bind to and synergistically activate the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor PREX one, which is a stimulator of the small G T P ase R A C. In addition, G B Y have been found to activate different P I three K isoforms, primarily P I three K beta and P I three K gamma, through interaction with both p one ten and p one zero one catalytic subunits of P I three K to transduce signalling. Of note, expression of G B Y has been shown to be necessary for the transforming capacity of P I three K beta, where binding-defective p one ten mutants have been demonstrated to significantly attenuate the transforming potential and G P C R driven chemotaxis of cells. In line with these findings, expression of this mutant in breast cancer cells significantly inhibited extravasation, matrix-degradation and macrophage-stimulated invasion of tumor cells, highlighting the potential role of G B Y in paracrine signalling between tumor and immune cells. In this context, there is an emerging body of literature demonstrating the importance of G B Y signalling in tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancer, in part by modulation and promotion of a pro-metastatic tumor microenvironment.\nx95m | G P C Rs and Cancer Immune Evasion\nyfum | The immune system is intricately linked to cancer initiation and progression, and as such, cancer immunotherapy is now one of the fastest growing areas of translational and clinical research for cancer treatment. Indeed, the functional roles of G P C Rs in inflammation, cell trafficking, and the\nppx4 | A\nqf11 | diversity of ligands they bind, establish G P C Rs as major regulators of the tumor-immune microenvironment.\n```",
