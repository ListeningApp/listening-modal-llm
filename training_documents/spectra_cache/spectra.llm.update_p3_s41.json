        "content": "aq5a | It was found recently that the SL flash from the synchronously repeating stable S L, which originates from nonlinear motion of a single bubble, occurs in the final stage\nsc5y | Didenko and Pugach\n0yab | of its implosion. Note that the authors of the papers were working at the intensity of ultrasound that is higher than the threshold of instability of the bubble surface, i.e., at conditions where the bubble disruption and the detachment of tiny bubbles from the bigger one seem incredible.\nw95z | The sonoluminescence spectra of hydrocarbons show no emission lines or bands of charged particles, which is also in disagreement with the electrical discharge hypotheses.\n0i1k | Nevertheless, there are no well-recognized hypotheses about the mechanism of sonoluminescence and sonochemistry, and the debates still continue. To our knowledge, the majority of experimental results can be explained by the thermal hypothesis and its variations. Next we shall try to explain the data obtained in this work with the help of this hypothesis.\ndqlg | Sonoluminescence as Blackbody Radiation. SL occurs at the compression of a cavitation bubble just before the minimum of its size is reached. The velocity of the bubble wall can exceed one hundred thirty meters per second or even around the speed of sound in the gas. The time of SL flash is less than fifty picoseconds, and the number of photons emitted from one flash is around one hundred five. The spectra of SL emitted by a single cavitation bubble have a maximum at approximately two hundred thirty nanometers. The authors of mentioned papers believe that S L is a blackbody radiation with temperature twenty-five thousand or sixteen thousand two hundred kelvin. The decrease of bulk solution temperature from twenty-two to ten degrees Celsius increases a blackbody temperature to fifty thousand kelvin.\np6pq | Suppose that sonoluminescence is the equilibrium thermal radiation at twenty-five thousand kelvin. Let us estimate the number of photons emitted by a single bubble. The SL flash occurs at the bubble radius R S L approximately equals two point two times ten to the power of negative four centimeters. The density of the bubble content at its minimum size should be around liquid density. Thus, the number of particles inside the bubble N zero at R equals R S L is about N zero approximately equals ten to the power of twelve. The number of particles N i with the energy of epsilon i approximately equals five point four epsilon V, one equals two hundred thirty nanometers, maximum in the spectra, is, in accordance with the Boltzmann distribution, N i approximately equals N zero times exp of negative epsilon i over k T approximately equals seven times ten to the power of ten. The experimentally determined value of N i is equals ten to the power of five. So, at equilibrium temperature of twenty-five thousand kelvin the number of photons emitted by one cavitation bubble must be five orders larger than the experimental value. For N i to be equal to the calculated value, temperature inside the bubble has to be around four thousand to forty-five hundred kelvin. However, in this case according to Wein's rule, the maximum in the spectra has to be situated in the region of seven hundred twenty-five to six hundred forty-four nanometers. Thus, the temperature inside the bubble cannot be so high, twenty-five thousand kelvin or even fifty thousand kelvin, and it is probably around the values estimated in references twenty-eight and twenty-nine.\nzse6 | The calculations of temperature from the experimental data on the broadening of potassium lines or on the rovibrational distribution of the lines in the C two star band gave the values of three thousand three hundred sixty plus minus three hundred thirty and five thousand seventy-five plus minus one hundred fifty-six kelvin, respectively. The temperature inside the bubble is distributed irregularly: its maximum in the center can be five-fold higher than average one. For example, according to reference thirty-one, the liquid temperature around the bubble does not differ essentially from that in the bulk liquid; however, the temperature on the bubble-liquid frontier from the bubble side can be approximately one thousand nine hundred kelvin and in the bubble center\np2n3 | Spectra of Water Sonoluminescence\nohh7 | At the average temperature inside the bubble of T equals five thousand K, the number of molecules with epsilon i equals ten electron V (the energy of the first stable excited state tilde C one B one of water molecule), N i, is approximately fourteen at T equals eight thousand K N i approximately equals one point seven times ten to the power of five. The number of molecules with epsilon i equals eight point three electron V (the energy of tilde B one A one state), N i, is approximately equals one thousand at T equals five thousand K and N i approximately equals four times ten to the power of five at T equals seven thousand K. Thus, the average temperature inside the bubble at the conditions of references six and seven is, probably, within the five thousand to eight thousand K limits.",
