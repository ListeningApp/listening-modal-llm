There are numerous natural products and bioactive molecules that contain allene substructures. It has been demonstrated that allene-substituted bioactive compounds, like steroids, prostaglandins, carbacyclins, nucleosides, and unnatural amino acids, display higher potency, increased metabolic stability, and bioavailability. Because of the strained nature of the cumulene structure, allenes have been engaged in numerous synthetic transformations as a versatile building block to form a variety of carbo- and heterocyclic frameworks. Axial-to-central chirality transfer is an efficient method for generating chiral compounds containing one or more stereogenic centers from chiral allenes.\nfj24 | Due to the important utility of allenes, it is highly desirable to develop new synthetic methods to generate functionalized allenes from readily available starting materials. One of the traditional approaches to the synthesis of allenes involves one, two-elimination of vinyl derivatives under strong basic or metal-catalyzed conditions. SNtwo'-type reactions with propargylic alcohol derivatives also constitute an efficient method for generating allenes. Transition metal-catalyzed coupling between terminal alkynes and carbonyl moieties in the presence of a secondary amine is also a well-established method, and a copper one-catalyzed cross-coupling of terminal alkynes with diazo compounds is another efficient protocol for generating allenes. Trisubstituted allenes can be accessed via metal- catalyzed cationic Heck coupling of alkynes with aryl halide/triflate. Enones and ynones are also explored as a precursor of allenes.\nuz3c | In two thousand four, Fu reported a copper one-catalyzed coupling of alkynes and diazoacetate under mild conditions to generate three-alkynyl carboxylate and only small amounts of the corresponding allenoates were observed. On the contrary, Lee\nd5bi | and others found that the alkynes containing a heteroatom substituent at the propargylic or homopropargylic carbon center preferentially generate the allenoate, and in particular in\nba4l | the presence of a base such as triethyl amine, allenoate became the exclusive product. Fox also reported a similar reaction that selectively generated allenoate as the product. Although the exact mechanisms of these reactions are not well understood, on the basis of other related reactions, we propose a copper acetylide-mediated mechanism for the formation of the three-alkynoate and allenoate. Relying on this copper acetylide- mediated mechanism, we envision that the copper-catalyzed coupling of terminal one, three-diyne one and azide would generate three-alkynyl and allenyl imidamide/imidate two or three. We surmise that the terminal one, three-diyne would form the corresponding copper acetylide, which will participate in a three plus two cycloaddition with tosylazide to form triazole IN-one. The subsequent loss of molecular nitrogen will lead to two equilibrating organocopper aza-cummulenes IN-two and IN-three, which then react with a nucleophile such as an amine or alcohol to generate imidamide or imidate containing either an alkyne or an allene moiety. A unique feature of this transformation is the selective transformation of the terminal alkyne moiety for the construction of imidamide and imidate functionality. Although starting from a different set of starting materials, the formation of closely related products from transformations in A and B is noteworthy. Herein, we describe our exploration of copper-catalyzed reactions of terminal one, three-diyne one with tosylazide, which generated functionalized one, three-disubstituted two, three-dienyl imidamides and imidates three with good selectivity over the corresponding alkyne derivative two. Also, it was found that the types of nucleophiles, the base additives, and the substituent patterns of the one, three-diynes not only affect the ratio of two to three but also promote the formation of alternative products such as three cumulenes and triple-bond-migrated products.\nffx8 | Our exploration commenced with the assessment of the efficiency and selectivity for the formation of three-alkynyl and allenyl imidamide two and three. Under the conditions that include a copper catalyst at ten mole percent, an azide at one point two equivalents, and an amine at one point two equivalents, one, three-diynes containing different substituents were examined. A hexyl-substituted terminal one, three-diyne one a and TsN three provided a mixture of three-alkynyl and allenyl imidamides two aa and three aa in seventy-five percent yield with a\ns6su | two to one ratio. Reactions of one a with other azides such as diphenyl phosphoryl azide and mesyl azide are also efficient, affording three-alkynyl imidamide two ab and two ac as the major products. On the contrary, employing piperidine as a nucleophile under otherwise identical conditions, one a provided two ad exclusively. One, three-diynes with a secondary or tertiary alkyl group provided good yields of two or three ba and two or three ca but low selectivity with a slight preference for alkynyl products two ba and two ca. One-cyclohexenyl-substituted one, three-diyne provided two or three da in forty-eight percent yield with a preference for compound three da. One, three-diyne one e containing a propargylic hydroxyl group afforded allene derivative three ea predominantly, whereas one, three-diyne one f containing a trimethylsilyl group provided alkyne derivative two fa selectively but in marginal yield.\ny219 | Once a general trend for the efficiency and selectivity between two and three had been revealed from the entries in Table one, we next explored the selective formation of three-alkynyl imidamide two.
