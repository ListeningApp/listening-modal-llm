You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ccmb | Even though MVT2D has established itself as a stan- dard benchmark in the past, this dataset (especially the tex- tures) is easily solvable for recent methods, and differences are mainly in the sub-percent range, which is only a mi- nor difference in terms of the comparatively small size of the dataset. In the following, we focus on the newer, more challenging MVT3D dataset where the normal data shows
ma93 | more variance and anomalies only partly occur in one of the two data modalities, RGB and 3D.
c6hh | The results for individual classes of MVT3D grouped by data modality are given in Table 3. We are able to outper- form all previous methods for all data modalities regard- ing the average of all classes by a large margin of 5.1% for 3D, 5% for RGB and 7.2% for the combination. Fac- ing the individual classes and data domains, we set a new state-of-the-art in 21 of 30 cases. Note that this data set is much more challenging when comparing the best results from previous work (99.1% for MVT2D vs. 86.5% AUROC for MVT3D). Nevertheless, we detect defects in 7 out of 10 cases for RGB+3D at an AUROC of at least 93%, which demonstrates the robustness of our method. In contrast, the nearest-neighbor approach PatchCore [36], which provides comparable performance to us on MVT2D, struggles with the increased demands of the dataset and is outperformed by 11% on RGB. The same applies for the 3D extension [24] using FPFH [40] despite using a foreground mask as well. Figure 1 shows qualitative results for the RGB+3D case given both inputs and ground truth annotations. More ex-
y7ea | amples can be found in the supplemental material. Despite the low resolution, the regions of the anomaly can still be localized well for practical purposes. Table 4 reports the pixel-AUROC of our method and previous work.
nav4 | For the class peach in the RGB+3D setting, the top of Figure 5 compares the distribution of student-teacher dis- tances for anomalous and normal regions. The distribution of anomalous samples shows a clear shift towards larger dis- tances. At the bottom of Figure 5, the outputs of student and teacher as well as our the distance of corresponding pairs representing our anomaly score are visualized by a random orthographic 2D projection. Note that visualizations made by techniques such as t-SNE [49] or PCA [33] are not mean- ingful here, since the teacher outputs (and therefore most of the student outputs) follow an isotropic standard normal distribution. Therefore, different random projections barely differ qualitatively.
gem8 | 4.4.2 Ablation Studies
e8nr | We demonstrate the effectiveness of our contributions and design decisions with several ablation studies. Table 5 compares the performance of variants of students with the teacher, which can be used as a density estimator itself for anomaly detection by using its likelihoods, given by Eq. 2, as anomaly score. In comparison, a symmetric student- teacher pair worsens the results by 1 to 2%, excepting the RGB case. However, the performance is already improved for RGB and 3D+RGB by creating the asymmetry with a deeper version of the student than the teacher by doubling the number of coupling blocks to 8. This effect is further
k78w | enhanced if the architecture of the NF-teacher is replaced by a conventional feedforward network as we suggest. We also vary the depth of our student network and analyzed its relation to performance, model size and inference time in Table 6. With an increasing number of residual blocks nst_blocks, we observe an increasing performance which is almost saturated after 4 blocks. Since the remaining poten- tial in detection performance is not in relation to the lin- early increasing additional computational effort per block, we suggest to choose 4 blocks to have a good trade-off.
g9du | In Table 7 we investigate the impact of the positional en- coding and the foreground mask. For MVT3D, positional encoding improves the detection by 1.4% of our AST-pair when trained with 3D data as the only input. Even though the effect is not present when combining both data modal- ities, we consider it generally reasonable to use the posi- tional encoding, considering that the integration with just 32 additional channels does not significantly increase the computational effort.
f682 | Foreground extraction in order to mask the loss for train- ing and anomaly score for testing is also highly effective. Since the majority of the image area often consists of back- ground, the teacher has to spend a large part of the distri- bution on the background. Masking allows the teacher and student to focus on the essential structures. Moreover, noisy
li1k | background scores are eliminated.
pbea | 5. Conclusion
ccpt | We discovered the generalization problem of previous student teacher pairs for AD and introduced an alternative student-teacher method that prevents this issue by using a highly different architecture for student and teacher. We were able to compensate for skewed likelihoods of a nor- malizing flow-based teacher, which was used directly for detection in previous work, by the additional use of a stu- dent. Future work could extend the approach to more data domains and improve the localization resolution.
