Therefore, in our study, we chose to focus on one person-centered characteristic from each category suggested by Van Dyne et al. Building on past voice research, we chose satisfaction as our affective construct because it is the key antecedent in existing models of voice. Extending past research, we included global self-esteem. Global self-esteem was chosen because of its importance in predicting behavior that is somewhat risky to the self.\n9uwy | Satisfaction With the Group\nsrly | Job satisfaction is defined as a pleasurable emotional state resulting from positive cognitive appraisal of one's job or job experiences. To date, satisfaction has been the primary antecedent included in models of voice behavior. Researchers typically use Hirschman's framework and describe voice as a response to dissatisfaction in the context of overall satisfaction or prior satisfaction. Some studies report no relationship between satisfaction and voice, and others report a weak but positive relationship. However, job satisfaction is complex and multidimensional and the use of overall job satisfaction may be problematic because it confounds sources of satisfaction. Overall job satisfaction scores based on measures containing multiple components (e.g., work itself, pay, promotion opportunities, recognition, benefits,\ndl6i | working conditions) are ambiguous and can lead to weak or inconsistent empirical findings. For example, an individual would be characterized as having moderate overall job satisfaction if he or she reported high levels of satisfaction with some things (e.g., work itself, pay, and promotion opportunities) and low levels of satisfaction with others (e.g., recognition, benefits, and working conditions). Another individual would also be characterized as having moderate job satisfaction if he or she reported moderate levels of satisfaction for everything. Although these two people would have equal overall scores on a measure of job satisfaction, they most likely have different thoughts and feelings regarding their work experience. To the extent that these differences lead to different behaviors, the use of overall job satisfaction may be problematic.\n89ub | We suggest that satisfaction with a specific aspect of the work situation rather than overall job satisfaction may be a better predictor of voice behavior. In most organizations, the most proximal work-related source of affect for employees is their group. When employees must interact with others in their work group to perform their jobs, their affective response to this interdependence can be a major source of low and/or high satisfaction. Consistent with social exchange theory, we would expect those who are satisfied with their group to be more highly motivated, to invest effort in developing new ideas, and to take the time to communicate these ideas to others in the group. From this perspective, speaking up with constructive recommendations can be viewed as a reciprocal response based on high levels of satisfaction with the group.\ndhle | Satisfaction with the group should also relate to voice because those who experience positive affective states are likely to be proactive in taking steps to maintain their good feelings. According to Locke, \"job satisfaction results from the perception that one's job fulfills or allows the fulfillment of one's important job values.\" Values are relatively stable and enduring individual beliefs that have pervasive and fundamental effects on behavior. Combining the general importance of values and their specific relevance to satisfaction, it is reasonable to expect that individuals who are satisfied with their work group should be more attached to the group and more dependent on the group to maintain feelings of satisfaction and to fulfill their values. The implication is that individuals who are highly satisfied with their group should be more likely to engage in proactive behavior (e.g., voice) in the interest of group viability.\n2nib | Of course, it is possible that those who are highly satisfied with their group may have fewer issues about which to offer voice and, therefore, may be less likely to engage\nnaev | in voice. However, we suggest that individuals who are highly satisfied with their group should be more vigilant and more likely to offer suggestions regarding issues that might detract from the group's long-term viability than individuals who are dissatisfied. Highly satisfied individuals should also be more willing to invest the time and effort required to deal with these issues (i.e., formulating and presenting ideas and suggestions for change). Individuals who are highly dissatisfied with their group (perhaps due to an awareness of many problems and issues), on the other hand, should be more likely to express themselves by complaining (e.g., \"I am very unhappy with this group because of all the back stabbing\"). Complaints are expressions of discontent or dissatisfaction, and unlike voice, do not include or imply suggestions for change or improvement. Thus, even though highly satisfied individuals may have fewer issues about which to offer voice than dissatisfied individuals, we believe those who are satisfied are more likely to offer constructive ideas and suggestions for change. Stated as a hypothesis,\n7h0h | Hypothesis one. Satisfaction with the group will be positively related to voice such that those who are more satisfied with their group will engage in more voice than individuals who are less satisfied with their group.\na64c | Global Self-Esteem\ngi7n | Self-esteem is an important predictor of attitudes and behavior in work and nonwork contexts. Global self-esteem is the degree of positive self-worth that an individual ascribes to him- or herself. It indicates the degree to which individuals believe they are capable, significant, successful, and worthy and is often thought of in terms of self-confidence and generalized self-competence. Research demonstrates that those with high self-esteem conform less and exhibit more initiative and assertiveness than those with low self-esteem.\n3pn1 | By definition, voice behavior requires proactive and assertive nonconformance. Behavior that is change-oriented and challenging is risky because organizations often view dissent and other nonconforming behaviors negatively. In addition, pressure to conform, particularly in work groups, can be substantial because speaking up and engaging in voice can threaten cohesiveness and result in sanctions against those who express divergent opinions. Accordingly, traits such as self-esteem should be important predictors of voice behavior, particularly in the context of work groups. For\nwjuz | VOICE IN WORK GROUPS",
