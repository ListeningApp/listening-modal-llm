You are working with a twenty-six-year-old, recently divorced truck driver who is recovering from internal injuries and multiple abrasions and fractures to his left hand, arm, and leg. His injuries occurred during a post-divorce party with friends that involved drinking and riding jet skis. In the middle of an uncomfortable icing treatment on his hand, he tells you that none of his friends have visited him in the hospital and that he feels very anxious about how dependent he has become on the hospital staff. He is worried about losing his job, being alone, and how he will get by once he returns to his home. Please rank-order each response according to the following scale:\nwm3n | One equals highly consistent with how I would usually respond\n1anr | Two equals very consistent with how I would usually respond\n600w | Three equals moderately consistent with how I would usually respond\n60w7 | Four equals slightly or not at all consistent with how I would usually respond\n```",
