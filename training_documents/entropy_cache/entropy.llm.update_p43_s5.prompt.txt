You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0w4e | The limit where T approaches zero from above is often called absolute zero. Why? First people made up various temperature scales like Celsius, where zero was the freez- ing point of water, and Fahrenheit, where zero is the freezing point of a mixture of water, ice, and ammonium chloride. But researchers discovered that nature had a more fundamental concept of zero temperature: the limit of infinite coolness! This happens as the temperature approaches -273.15 ℃, or roughly -459.67 ºF. This discovery led Kelvin to propose a shifted version of Celsius where zero is absolute zero. This was originally called 'absolute Celsius', but now it is called the Kelvin scale. This is the scale of temperature I'll always use here. The size of the degrees is a somewhat arbitrary convention, but the zero is not: it's absolute zero.
0nu4 | THE HAGEDORN TEMPERATURE
0x8p | If a system has a countable infinity of states <LATEX>n = 1 , 2 , 3 , \ldots .</LATEX> with energies <LATEX>E _ { n } ,</LATEX> the Boltzmann distribution
a8ov | <LATEX>p _ { n } = \frac { \exp \left( - E _ { n } / k T \right) } { \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } \exp \left( - E _ { n } / k T \right) }</LATEX> is either:
32hh | 1) defined for all
0ow0 | <LATEX>0 < T < + \infty</LATEX> 2) undefined for all
y0lw | <LATEX>0 < T < + \infty</LATEX> 3) defined for all <LATEX>0 < T < T _ { \mathrm { H } }</LATEX> but not for <LATEX>T _ { \mathrm { H } } < T < + \infty ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>T _ { \mathrm { H } }</LATEX> is some temperature called the Hagedorn temperature.
8a9n | We've been discussing systems with finitely many states, but many physical systems have a countable infinity of states. So let's think a bit about those. We can copy everything we've done so far, but we have to be careful. For thermal equilibrium to be possible at some temperature <LATEX>T ,</LATEX> we need the Boltzmann distribution
kyih | <LATEX>p _ { n } = \frac { \exp \left( - E _ { n } / k T \right) } { \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } \exp \left( - E _ { n } / k T \right) }</LATEX> to make sense. But it might not. Sometimes the sum fails to converge! This happens when the terms <LATEX>\exp \left( - E _ { n } / k T \right)</LATEX> don't go to zero fast enough as
zvx5 | <LATEX>n \rightarrow + \infty .</LATEX> Let's investigate this issue. We'll assume that
aok4 | <LATEX>\sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } \exp \left( - E _ { n } / k T \right)</LATEX> converges for some <LATEX>T > 0 .</LATEX> Then the energies <LATEX>E _ { n }</LATEX> must be bounded below: otherwise the terms <LATEX>\exp \left( - E _ { n } / k T \right)</LATEX> will get bigger and bigger. Furthermore for any <LATEX>E \in \mathbb{R}</LATEX> there can be at most finitely many <LATEX>E _ { n }</LATEX> less than <LATEX>E :</LATEX> otherwise we'd be adding up infinitely many terms greater than <LATEX>\exp \left( - E / k T \right) .</LATEX> As a result, we can reorder the states so their energies are nondecreasing:
omvu | <LATEX>E _ { 1 } \leq E _ { 2 } \leq E _ { 3 } \leq \cdots .</LATEX> and
e271 | <LATEX>E _ { n } \rightarrow + \infty .</LATEX> Reordering a sum can't change its convergence or value if <LATEX>f \mathrm { i t } _ { s } ^ { \gamma } s</LATEX> a sum of nonnegative numbers, like the sum we have here. So we might as well assume we've listed the energies in nondecreasing order as above. Then there are two cases:
lmdg | 1. The energies <LATEX>E _ { n }</LATEX> approach <LATEX>+ \infty</LATEX> so fast that <LATEX>\sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } \exp \left( - E _ { n } / k T \right)</LATEX> converges for all <LATEX>0 < T < + \infty .</LATEX> Then our system can be in thermal equilibrium at any finite posi- tive temperature. This is the nicest situation, and the one we typically expect ..
5gqf | 2. The energies <LATEX>E _ { n }</LATEX> approach <LATEX>+ \infty</LATEX> slowly enough that <LATEX>\sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } \exp \left( - E _ { n } / k T \right)</LATEX> converges when <LATEX>T</LATEX> is small enough, but not otherwise. In this case there is some temperature <LATEX>T _ { \mathrm { H } } ,</LATEX> called the Hagedorn temperature, such that our system can be in thermal equilibrium at positive temperatures <LATEX>T</LATEX> below <LATEX>T _ { \mathrm { H } } ,</LATEX> but not above
yg2b | <LATEX>T _ { \mathrm { H } } .</LATEX> In both cases, <LATEX>\sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } \exp \left( - E _ { n } / k T \right)</LATEX> diverges for all <LATEX>- \infty \leq T < 0</LATEX> and <LATEX>T = + \infty .</LATEX> So, for a system with a countable infinity of states, if thermal equilibrium exists for some positive temperature, it cannot exist for negative or infinite temperatures.
kftl | The second case is weird and interesting. It's named after Rolf Hagedorn, who in 1964 noticed that this was a possibility in nuclear physics. He considered a model of nuclear matter where the energies <LATEX>E _ { n }</LATEX> approach <LATEX>+ \infty</LATEX> in a roughly logarithmic way. As you heat it, its expected energy keeps increasing, but its temperature can never exceed <LATEX>T _ { \mathrm { H } } .</LATEX> This model turned out to be incorrect, but <LATEX>\mathrm { i t } ^ { \gamma } \varsigma</LATEX> interesting anyway.
wulb | Now let's solve some puzzles on systems with a countable infinity of states. Some of these show up in quantum mechanics, but you don't need to know quantum mechanics to do these puzzles.
le9r | Puzzle 27. Show that for a system with a countable infinity of states, if thermal equi- librium is possible for some negative temperature, it is impossible for positive or infinite temperatures.
