You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ry5f | This ability to integrate and see an increasing number of parallels between one's therapeutic style and one's in- terpersonal style outside of therapy, combined with the ability to draw on a wide repertoire of interpersonal be- haviors as appropriate for any given interaction, may be associated with decreased feelings of burnout and frustra- tion. Having a therapeutic style that feels consistent with one's day-to-day personality is referred to as an integrated use of self.
31wg | Assessing Mode Use
celk | To date, nine assessments of mode use based on the IRM have been developed. One of these assessments is featured in this chapter: The Self-Assessment of Modes, Version III. The Self-Assessment of Modes, Version III, consists of nine different clinical scenarios, each portraying a client or caregiver facing a dilemma. Four possible therapeutic responses (i.e., modes) are presented beneath each clinical scenario. Respondents are required to rank-order the re- sponses from one to four based upon the degree to which they agree with the given response. The additional IRM assessments, most of which have been validated or are in the process of being validated, are available at the IRM website: http://irm.ahslabs.uic.edu/.

xgur | Self-Assessment of Modes Questionnaire, Version III
iz66 | This assessment is designed to allow you to identify whether you have a dominant way or central set of ways of responding to various interpersonal events that arise in therapy. Please do not think too hard about the responses and respond as if you were facing the situations described in real-time practice. All responses represent plausible therapeutic actions, and there are no incorrect responses.
dndq | For every scenario, please rank-order each of the four response options accord- ing to the extent to which you would view the option as being consistent with your predominant (i.e., usual) way of interacting. Please rank the general idea or feeling you have about the response, even if the way that the example is worded is not identical to what you would actually say. Your numeric rankings should adhere to the following scale:
xzce | 1 = highly consistent with how I would usually respond
w4vd | 2 = very consistent with how I would usually respond
cuh0 | 3 = moderately consistent with how I would usually respond
k36t | SUMMARY
z1wx | The "cautions" section under each of the interpersonal modes reveals one of the hidden secrets of therapeutic use of self-that no therapist is perfect. There is no way to escape the caveats and downsides that go along with any therapeutic mode or set of modes. Additionally, no one is immune from communicating the modes suboptimally from time to time. One key to the intentional use of self is to familiarize oneself with the caveats to each of the modes that are part of one's therapeutic style. The more you develop an ability to draw on as many modes as neces- sary and appropriate for a given client, the more likely you are to avoid overutilizing one style at the expense of using a more appropriate or more indicated style for that client.
o6gf | Please note that you may only assign a number once; please do not assign the same number to more than one response option. It is recognized that your actual response may depend on information that is not available in the case description. The point of this questionnaire is not to ascertain a correct response but to ascertain the one that is most representative of your interpersonal style. Please do not dwell on the options for too long. Instead, choose the response that would be the easiest, most natural, or most typical for you in each situation.
0hs6 | Please see the following example, where, in this case, option "d" is the response most consistent with the respondent's usual way of interacting:
m05x | A marathon runner is looking for a relief station to rehydrate but cannot find one. The runner is trying to decide whether to continue running or to rest in order to avoid a state of complete exhaustion. Walking alongside the runner, you are able to have a con- versation. Please rank-order the following possible responses.
ds29 | a. __ 3_Assume a clear leadership role by providing the runner with information, struc- ture, guidance, or constructive feedback (e.g., educate the runner on the poten- tial consequences of continuing to run without hydration).
qcmr | b. __ 2_ Ask questions or engage in a discussion that leads the runner to think about alternative ways of approaching the situation (e.g., assist the runner in weighing the pros and cons of continuing to run without hydration).
7c6p | c. _ 4_ Give the runner total and complete control over the situation (e.g., ask the run- ner what he or she feels is the best thing to do in this moment).
d1ee | d. 1_Normalize the runner's experience or connect the runner with social or physical resources that will enable him or her to have an equal chance of finishing (e.g., let the runner know that dehydration is common among marathoners; if desired, gather information for the runner about the location of the next relief station).
itx4 | 1. You are working with a 92-year-old retired steelworker who has always performed his own handiwork around the house. He is receiving postsurgical therapy for a shoulder in- jury that he endured after a fall from a stepstool while changing a light bulb in his home. When the client is not in the room, his family members tell you that this is not the first accident that he has had doing handiwork. They add that, recently, he has become more accident-prone while completing tasks that should be done by hired workers. The cli- ent's family is concerned about his safety. They feel that he does not listen to them when they ask him to call a hired worker instead of performing household duties on his own. The family reports that the client is otherwise safe when not engaging in household tasks. Please rank-order each response to the family according to the following scale:
vwrs | 1 = highly consistent with how I would usually respond
xjkw | 2 = very consistent with how I would usually respond
wght | 3 = moderately consistent with how I would usually respond
3lgb | 4 = slightly or not at all consistent with how I would usually respond
ttwt | a. Assume a clear leadership role by providing the family with information, struc- ture, guidance, or constructive feedback (e.g., provide the family with informa- tion on the type of safety recommendations that you will discuss with the client and reassure them that these recommendations will be included in the client's next session).
x5l2 | b. Give the family total and complete control over the situation (e.g., ask the family what they think they will need from you to better ensure the client's safety at home).
ilrs | c. Witness, listen to, and show full acceptance of the client's thoughts, feelings, or behavior (e.g., summarize what you have just learned and make a statement that validates their concerns about the client's safety).
0a03 | d. Ask questions or engage in a discussion that leads the family to think about alternative ways of approaching the situation (e.g., assist the family in weighing the pros and cons of a range of ways that a convincing message about safety might be best communicated to the client).
