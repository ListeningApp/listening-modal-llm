You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

1ujy | Figure 13 presents the practical training throughput of Chimera and the throughput predicted by the performance model (see Sec- tion 3.4). Note that since Chimera greatly alleviates the bubble problem, it greedily chooses the largest B that fits in the device memory. The performance model is mainly used to select the best configuration of W and D. Therefore, Chimera has a much smaller tuning space compared with the synchronous baselines. The error of the performance model (see Equation 1) is within 10% for both Bert-48 and GPT-2. For Bert-48, the performance model accurately selects the best configuration, i.e., W=8 and D=4. For GPT-2, the per- formance model selects W=16 and D=32, but the best performance is achieved by W=64 and D=8. However, the best performance is only 1.7% higher than the one selected by the model. The inaccurate prediction is mainly because our model may overestimate the cost
qzor | of activation recomputation used with W=64 and D=8. Although these two configurations achieve very close performance for GPT-2, it is worth mentioning that D=8 works better when scaling to large mini-batches because of less computation and p2p communication overhead, while D=32 works better when scaling to more machines because of less gradient synchronization overhead.
a0by | 4.2.3 Comparison with the Best Performance. Figures 14 and 15 present the results of weak scaling on Bert-48 and GPT-2, respec- tively. For all the baselines we present the best performance after searching the parameter space at different scales. Especially, to achieve the best performance, GPipe switches from D=8 to D=16 for GPT-2 on more than 512 GPU nodes. For Chimera, we present the practical throughput using the best configuration predicted by the performance model. The configuration used by each approach for the best performance is annotated in the legends of the figures.
u1ky | For both Bert-48 and GPT-2, Chimera outperforms all the base- lines at all scales. For Bert-48 on 64 nodes, Chimera outperforms PipeDream and PipeDream-2BW (asynchronous approaches) by 1.94x and 1.17x, respectively, and outperforms GPipe, GEMS, and DAPPLE (synchronous approaches) by 1.32x, 2.41x, and 1.19x, re- spectively. PipeDream frequently synchronizes the gradients after each backward pass, which compromises the training throughput.
htm9 | PipeDream-2BW uses B=16 with recomputation to achieve the best performance. Although PipeDream-2BW does not have bubble problem, it may not have enough computation to fully overlap the gradient synchronization overhead. GEMS has the highest bubble ratio and therefore has lower throughput than the others. To achieve the best performance, GPipe and DAPPLE use B=4 to reduce the bubble ratio but at the cost of lower computational efficiency. In contrast, Chimera has low bubble ratio while using B=8 for higher computational efficiency, and therefore outperforms GPipe and DAPPLE.
8hul | For GPT-2 on 2,048 nodes, Chimera outperforms PipeDream and PipeDream-2BW (asynchronous approaches) by 2.01x and 1.16x, respectively, and outperforms GPipe, GEMS, and DAPPLE (synchro- nous approaches) by 1.42x, 2.34x, and 1.38x, respectively. There are two major advantages of Chimera: (1) Chimera has a low bub- ble ratio; (2) benefiting from a balanced memory consumption (as discussed in Section 4.1), Chimera with D=32 fits in the de- vice memory without activation recomputation, while all other approaches except GEMS require recomputation. Chimera out- performs PipeDream-2BW mainly because no recomputation is required, and outperforms GPipe and DAPPLE because of both less bubbles and no recomputation. Using 512 nodes as the base- line, Chimera achieves 91.4% parallel efficiency on 2,048 nodes in weak scaling for GPT-2, which demonstrates the efficiency of the communication scheme used in Chimera.
87vz | Note that we use the same model partition method as the default setting in PipeDream-2BW, namely evenly partitioning the basic layers among the workers. Other model partition methods trying to balance the weights among the workers may help to reduce the peak memory consumption of PipeDream-2BW, but this is outside the scope of this paper. Generally, Chimera is on-par with PipeDream-2BW (the latest asynchronous approach) in terms of training throughput, but more convergence-friendly since there is no stale weights in Chimera.
