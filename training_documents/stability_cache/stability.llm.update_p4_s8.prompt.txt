You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

2e62 | Statistical Analyses
75y3 | Latent Profile Analysis (LPA)
s2g2 | Psychopathology profiles at T1 were previously derived using the same procedures described below [13]. In earlier work, the Sleep Problems syndrome scale of the CBCL was not included in the analyses. Here, we applied LPA to define
q1q2 | psychopathology subgroups at T1, T2 and T3, using CBCL T-scores of all available syndrome scales as indicators, includ- ing Sleep Problems. Consistent with earlier work within Gen- eration R, we used five criteria to determine the optimal num- ber of profiles [6, 13]. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the bootstrapped likelihood ratio test (BLRT) were used to evaluate the fit of each model. The BIC is a measure of model fit considering the rule of parsimony, with a lower BIC indicating a better fit. The BLRT is a likelihood ratio for k classes versus k - 1 classes, with a p-value greater than 0.05 indicating that k - 1 classes are sufficient. Entropy of the models was evaluated with values closer to 1 indicating better classification. Moreover, all profiles obtained should include a minimum of 1% of the participants. Lastly, all profiles were inspected visually to ensure each additional profile had a dis- tinct severity or shape pattern.
cb7r | Latent Transition Analysis (LTA)
68xu | We applied LTA to calculate transition probabilities between psychopathology profiles over time. Due to the use of different CBCL versions (v1.5-5 at T1), we were unable to test a model where we held the profiles equal across all ages. Therefore, the quantitative change in profile patterns was taken into account in interpreting the transition probabilities. In our primary model we allowed profiles to be estimated freely. Addition- ally, a partial invariant model was tested in which the profiles were held equal between T2 and T3. Lastly, we tested a model in which demographic characteristics (biological sex, national origin and SES based on maternal education and household income) were included as covariates. The number of profiles included in the LTA at each age wave was based on the optimal number of profiles at each individual time point.
hd35 | Both LPA and LTA were performed using Mplus version 8.6 [23]. Full information maximum likelihood (FIML) was used in both the LPA and the LTA analyses to account for missing data, which can be used to account for data con- sidered either missing at random (MAR) or missing com- pletely at random (MCAR). No missing data was imputed. A detailed overview showing in how many data collection waves each individual participated, split by demographic variables, is provided in Supplementary Table 1. Participants with a lower SES and participants from non-western national origin were more likely to have fewer measurements avail- able, pointing towards a pattern of MAR.

epu7 | Latent Profile Analysis
7od1 | The optimal model fit was determined, based on the BLRT, the BIC, the entropy and the inclusion of at least 1% of the
0bqy | participants in the smallest profile obtained. When two or more models fitted the data equally well, optimal fit was based on visual inspection. We were unable to discrimi- nate between models based on the BLRT, since the BLRT was < 0.001 across all waves and across all tested profiles, indicating that adding a profile would improve model fit, even when six profiles were fitted to the data. Likewise, the BIC decreased with an increasing number of profiles added to the model and could therefore not discriminate between the models at T1-T3. At T1, a four-profile fit was deter- mined the best fitting model, as the five-profile fit resulted in one profile with fewer than 1% of participants. At T2, the entropy varied between the models, indicating that the model with four, five or six profiles at T2 fit the data equally well. Visual inspection of the four and five profile fit showed that the fifth profile did not differ largely in both shape and severity from profiles that were already identified in the four- profile fit (Supplementary Fig. 1). Therefore, a four-profile fit was determined optimal at T2. At T3, the optimal fit was based on the entropy, which was highest for the four-profile fit. Model fit indices are provided in Supplementary Table 2.
b780 | We describe these four profiles as: (1.) no problems (T1: 85.9%, T2: 79.0%, T3: 78.0%) with low scores on all syn- drome scales, (2.) internalizing (T1: 5.1%, T2: 9.2%, T3: 9.0%) with particularly high scores on Anxious/Depressed,
ccmb | Withdrawn/Depressed and Thought Problems, (3.) external- izing (T1: 7.3%, T2: 8.3%, T3: 10.2%), consisting of chil- dren scoring high on Attention Problems, Rule-Breaking Behavior and Aggressive Behavior, and finally (4.) the DP (T1: 1.7%, T2: 3.5%, T3: 2.8%), with elevated scores on all syndrome scales, see Table 2 and Fig. 2. To remain con- sistent with our earlier work, we use the term DP with the understanding that the term is synonymous with the term 'comorbid group'.
ma93 | Latent Transition Analysis
c6hh | Based on fit statistics, the freely estimated model and the partial invariant model fitted the data equally well (freely estimated: BIC=660,642.04, entropy =0.87; partial invari- ant: BIC=660,641.32, entropy=0.87). Transition probabili- ties, based on the freely estimated model, between T1-T3 are shown in Tables 3 and 4. Transition probabilities for the partial invariant model are presented in Supplementary Table 3 and 4.
y7ea | Homotypic continuity, indicating that children were classified in the same psychopathology subgroup at two consecutive time points, was 84.5% between T1 and T2 for the no problems group and 88.1% between T2 and T3. As expected, homotypic continuity was lower for the
nav4 | psychopathology subgroups than for the no problems group. Homotypic continuity between T1 and T2 and between T2 and T3 for the internalizing group was 38.1% and 37.6%, for the externalizing subgroup was 37.3% and 46.8%, and for the DP subgroup was 44.7% and 33.6%, respectively.
