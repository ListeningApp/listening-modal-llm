        "content": "ixfj | Intention: To enable as many people as possible, in due order, to achieve the understanding which will facilitate the higher (as well as the lower) effects of the Teaching to give the maximum developmental help.\nn08k | Programme: To keep the group operating as a channel for the successively refined impulses from the Source, and to attune the members to be able to perceive these impulses.\nmk3f | Characteristics: Enough serious-minded but not indoctrinated people; attitudes suitable for the transmission to act upon; an orientation suitable to accept and work with the materials provided or indicated by the Representative for the time being of the Teaching.\nup8n | Modus Operandi: Meetings, reading, 'audition', performances, practices, theoretical and practical study, organisation of environment.\n2zga | Deterioration: Evidenced by the acceptance of simplifications, contraction of activity, messianic and panacea thinking, hierarchical behaviour patterns believed to be sacrosanct, literal acceptance of the figurative and vice-versa, hagiography, providing social and psychological stimuli and/or reassurances, offering scope for personality-projection, assuaging desires for attention, substituting itself for diversions of a political, organisational, religious, psycho-\ny6u5 | logical, social, academic, family and other groupings.\nxm5s | Contrast this with the kind of group, that of the 'man of learning' surrounded by others, of whom Al-Thauri says 'Be assured that he is an impostor and a fraud: because if he were to tell them the truth, they would hate him'.\nc9kl | Prerequisites for a Student of Sufism\n0wxt | Q: Can you give me an essential prerequisite for a student of Sufism? I think that it is to be misunderstood.\nsrft | A: One essential is that the student should not attempt to impose his own conditions of study or criteria of progress.\ndnic | On understanding, a student should not think that he can understand just because he wants to.\n1okp | A THOUSAND WILL CALL YOU AN UNBELIEVER\nmd0i | On being understood, it was the great Junaid of Baghdad who said:\nl2xj | 'Nobody attains to the degree of Truth until a thousand sincere people have pronounced him an unbeliever.'\n9n43 | But the sincerity he is talking about here is not real sincerity, absolute objectivity. It is the sincerity of people who imagine themselves to be sincere because they believe certain things, whether they know these things or not.\ng6gt | The sincere act, reflecting the real sincerity, is defined by Abu-Yaqub al-Susi, in Kalabadhi's Taaruf:\nn4u8 | 'The really sincere act is the one which is known by no recording angel, by no demon to afflict it, nor by the self, to become prideful of it.'\nmusv | This means that human beings have to become aware of their essence, the real part of themselves, which speaks when the other elements are silent.\nkogj | THE INSECT\ni7m9 | In Fiki ma Fihi, Rumi says that there is a minute insect in a field, which cannot be seen at first. But as soon as it makes a sound, people are alerted and see it. People, similarly, are lost in the field of this world, their surroundings and preoccupations. The human essence within is concealed by all this disturbance.\nffkj | THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME\nthmt | A Chinese restaurant manager, asked in a London court to identify a man who was appealing against sentence for stealing chickens from a Chinese restaurant, said: 'All white men look the same to me.'\n4dmm | What is seen is not always understood in its qualities which may be relevant to a given perception, as with the Chinese and the white man. The Chinese, in Rumi's terms, is 'lost' in the field of his own world. The white man, in the expectation of the court, was in his appearance instrumental: that is to say, identification of his appearance would lead to certain facts. The description, though necessary, was secondary.\nw1yv | The student should also regard such things as lectures as instrumental, not descriptive, remembering what Faris relates that Abu-Abdullah Shikthal answered when asked why he did not lecture:\nbhwq | 'Existence is not real, and it is wrong to speak of what is not real. Words cannot be used to describe the Real, so why should I speak?'\n7kda | The student must be prepared for experience and intakes which do not affect the ordinary consciousness where words and emotions exercise their functions.\nwdbn | Although 'the world' is not real, since what we perceive of it depends on our sense-perceptions which may be faulty, trained or changed: and it is hence not any kind of an absolute, the instrumental function means that it can be employed for teaching purposes. This is why an 'essential prerequisite' which you ask for is certainly that this principle should be registered in your mind. As the Sufi Gharib-Nawaz puts it:\nleeb | 'Every particle of dust is a cup wherein all the world can be seen.'\npvc6 | Some things in the world conduce towards understanding and some towards a greater involvement with the world and consequent lack of perception and false understanding.\nvqqf | PARABLE OF THE TREE\nkeq0 | Sheikh Abdul-Qadir of Gilan, in his twenty-seventh address of the\ncnqd | Futuh al-Ghaib invites his hearers to think of good and evil as two fruits from the same tree. 'Approach the tree itself and become its guard and attendant servant and acquire knowledge of these two branches and of the two fruits and their neighbourhoods and remain near that branch which yields sweet fruit - then it will be your food and source of strength and beware lest you should approach the other branch and eat the fruit thereof and thus its bitterness should kill you ... and when these fruits are brought before you and the sweet cannot be distinguished from the bitter and you start eating them ... you may put the bitter one in your mouth.'\ng4kx | In Step is out of Step\nojou | Q: Can you say something about the technical use of the term 'The Madman' for the Sufi?\nricu | A: There is a Persian saying: 'To a madman, it is enough to shout HOO!' The repetition of the syllable HOO is a part of Sufi rites. Hence this saying indicates, to the intellectualist, that you merely shout this word and the well-conditioned disciple starts capering; and capering, as the uninitiated would think, without rhyme or reason. But the Sufi prides himself upon being, in the eyes of the uninstructed, 'a madman'; and so he uses the phrase himself to indicate that at a certain stage of initiation, the one syllable, once repeated, is enough to sustain him and produce in him the state which he desires.\n2hgf | This brings us straight away to the difficulties of a practice which is inexplicable to one set of people, yet completely LIVED by another.\naog1 | The books that have been written by Sufis are partial ones; they have to be read at certain times, perhaps in conjunction with certain movements, or certain attunements, otherwise their meaning is but fragmentary like a great deal of other initiatory material which has been taken at its face value by 'outer' observers. It is as if a man were to lick the outside of an apple and pronounce it pleasant to the nose but seemingly devoid of nourishment.\nx1e3 | Some people may say that they will not seek illumination or other-worldly truths if it involves their capering about. This is like saying that you will drive your car, providing that nobody is allowed to fill the fuel tank. Some say that they want something that they can understand before they will 'go into it'. This can be like saying that you will have to drive the train, or you will not travel in it at all.\ndgol | It is this 'outer' attitude towards initiatory systems which gives rise to false cults which purport to give you 'secrets' that you can understand. Except that they do not, in fact, give you such",
