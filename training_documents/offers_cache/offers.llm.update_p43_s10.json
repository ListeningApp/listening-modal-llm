        "content": "zx3s | Let's say you have a perfect market, but no way of finding the people who comprise it. Well, making a Grand Slam Offer will be difficult. I make my life easier by looking for easy-to-target markets. Examples of this are avatars that have associations they belong to, mailing lists, social media groups, channels they all watch, etc. If our potential customers are all gathered together somewhere, then we can market to them. If searching them out, however, is like finding needles in a haystack, then it can be very difficult to get your offer in front of any potentially interested eyes.\n6c25 | This point is tactical. It is reality, not theoretical. For instance, you may want to serve rich doctors. But if your ads are being displayed to nursing students, your offer will fall on deaf ears, no matter how good it is. Main point: you want to make sure you can target your ideal audience easily. Clarifying point - there is no issue wanting to serve rich doctors, they are easy to find. This is just illustrative that your promotions must be served to the right audience.\n2ese | Four. Growing\nxvzx | Growing markets are like a tailwind. They make everything move forward faster. Declining markers are like headwinds. They make all efforts harder. This was Lloyd's example. Newspapers had three of the four makings of a great market: one. lots of pain, two. purchasing power, three. easy to target. But they were shrinking fast. No matter how hard he tried, the entire marketplace was fighting against him. Business is hard enough, and markets move quickly. So you might as well find a good market to give you a tailwind to make the process easier.\nt08l | Making This Real\nk6vc | There are three main markets that will always exist: Health, Wealth, and Relationships. The reason that those will always exist is that there is always tremendous pain when you lack them. There is always demand for solutions to these core human pains. The goal is to find a smaller subgroup within one of those larger buckets that is growing, has the buying power, and is easy to target (the other three variables).\nlnqw | So if I were a relationship expert trying to find my avatar, I'd rather focus on \"second half of life relationship\" coaching for old timers than helping college students in relationships. Why? Because senior citizens who are alone are likely suffering more pain as they are nearer their deaths (pain), have more buying power (money), and are easy to find (targeting). Lastly, at the time of this writing, there are more people turning sixty-five each year than turning twenty (growing).\nkdr7 | That is the idea. Think about what you are good at in regards to health, wealth, and relationships. Then think about who might value your service the most (is in the most pain), has the buying power to pay what you want (money), and can be found easily (targeting). As long as those three criteria are strong and the market isn't shrinking, you'll be in good shape.\nh1ds | But how important to your success is finding a \"great market\" versus a \"normal market\" versus a \"bad market?\" The answer: it actually depends. Let me explain.\nsgu6 | Order of Importance: Three Levers on Success\n47j0 | It's unlikely you are going to be in a dying market like the newspaper example. It's also unlikely you're going to be selling toilet paper in COVID (buying frenzy). You'll likely be in a \"normal\" market. And that's totally okay. There is a fortune to be made within normal markets. My single point here is that you can't be in a \"bad\" market, or nothing will work. That being said, here's the simplest illustration of the order of importance between markets, offers, and persuasion skills:\n1c60 | Starving Crowd (market) greater than Offer Strength greater than Persuasion Skills\n0gex | Let's say you were to rate these elements on a scale of great, normal, and bad. You could essentially move down the line from left to right in order of importance. A \"great\" rating on a higher-order piece overpowers anything else lower on the priority scale. A \"normal\" rating moves the buck to the next part of the equation. A \"bad\" stops the equation unless a \"great\" from a higher priority component nullifies it. Here are a few examples:\n8r7m | Example Number One: Even if you have a bad offer and are bad at persuasion, you're going to make money if you're in a great market. If you're on the corner hocking hot dogs when the bars close up at two am, with mobs of starving drunk folks, you're gonna sell out your hotdogs.\nqj19 | Example Number Two (most of us): If you are in a normal market and have a Grand Slam Offer (great), you can make tons of money\nl5ia | even if you're bad at persuasion. This is most people reading this book. That's why I wrote it - to help you maximize your success by learning to really build a Grand Slam Offer.\necp0 | Example Number Three: Let's say you're in a normal market and have a normal offer. In order to be massively successful, you would have to be exceptionally good at persuasion. Then and only then will you succeed, with your persuasive skills serving as the fulcrum of your success. Heck, many empires have been built by exceptional persuaders. It's just the hardest path to follow and requires the most effort and learning. Nailing your offer helps you shortcut this path to success. Otherwise, you will just have a normal business that takes exceptional skill to be successful (nothing wrong with that, but probably not what you signed up for).\ncujm | Commit to the Niche\n25y0 | Too often, a newer entrepreneur half-heartedly tries one offer in one market, doesn't make a million dollars, then mistakenly thinks \"this is a bad market.\" Most times that's not actually the case. They just haven't found a Grand Slam Offer yet to apply to that market.\n8u4f | They think, I'll switch from helping dentists to helping chiropractors - that's it! When, in reality, both of those are normal markets and represent billions of dollars in revenue. Either would work, just not both. You must pick one. No one can serve two masters.\n5bai | I have coined the term \"niche slap\" to remind entrepreneurs in my communities to commit once they pick. All businesses and, all markets, have unpleasant characteristics. The grass is never greener once you get to the other side. If you keep hopping from niche to niche, hoping that the market will solve your problems, you deserve to be niche slapped.\n2z5m | You must stick with whatever you pick long enough to have trial and error. You will fail. In fact, you will fail until you succeed. But you will fail far longer if you keep changing who you market to, because you must start over from the beginning each time. So, pick then commit.\n63p4 | Riches Are In The Niches\nlvik | The other reason to commit to the niche is because of how much more you will make.\n16a3 | Simply put, niching down will make you far more money.",
