You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0b39 | 'Colonia' Land and Housing Market Performance and the Impact of Lot Title Regularisation in Texas
qecd | Summary. This article analyses performance of the land market in several irregular settlements (colonias) outside Rio Grande City, Starr County, Texas. Specifically, it explores the impact upon land prices of a major title 'regularisation' initiative to clear property titles of very poor households undertaken by the Community Resources Group (CRG) Receivership Program at the behest of the Texas State government between 1995 and 2002. Land price data and trends are analysed using a major CRG database of over 1400 price records and files, complemented by a questionnaire survey of over 260 households applied by the research team as part of an evaluation of the CRG Program. The data show that prices are relatively 'flat' in real terms over time and that, while there was a spike in prices during the early 1990s, there does not appear to have been any significant increase since regularisation. The data suggest that prices appear to be shaped more by socially determined criteria associated with the developers themselves, rather than by settlement characteristics, location, etc. Regularisation of land title appears to make little difference to land market performance and, while colonias are a vehicle for investment for low-income groups, the rate of return compared with other segments of the (formal) property market is very low. These findings are compared with similar work for less developed countries and also challenge those theories that argue in favour of land regularisation as a means to improve land market performance and integration of the urban poor.
1o7p | Informal Land Markets and 'The Mystery of Capital'
cp13 | Scholars and analysts who study rapid urban- isation in less developed countries are fam- iliar with 'regularisation' programmes, understanding these as policy interventions to provide services and legal property titles to settlements that will often have developed illegally, either through squatting or by il- legal land sales and development. In many
bgre | contemporary Latin American cities, rapid population growth in the second half of the 20th century led to anything between 25 and 60 per cent of the built-up area having origi- nated as irregular residential settlement (Gilbert and Ward, 1985; Gilbert, 1996). To- day, such regularisation policies have at- tained conventional wisdom status throughout the region and come in two forms: first, those that focus upon extending
57lp | essential infrastructure (power, water, drain- age, public lighting, street paving, etc.) to areas that lack them; while elsewhere a se- cond approach is to accord priority to legalis- ing the illegal by converting de facto ownership into full de jure legal title.1 Some- times the two programmes go hand-in-hand and, although full title has rarely been an absolute requirement in order to secure government intervention (Varley, 1985, 1987), it usually helps, if only because it brings people onto the property registry, pro- viding a basis for on-going cost recovery of (service) consumption charges and for the levying of property taxes, albeit at low and modest rates, thereby making urban develop- ment programmes more sustainable (Ward, 2003a). Moreover, to the extent that planning controls can only be exercised effectively where the property market is formalised, title regularisation forms an increasingly import- ant component in programmes to improve urban management and administration (Jones and Ward, 1994).
ukth | In Latin America, such policy scenarios are neither novel nor controversial, such that in the region today the principal questions usually hinge around two issues: first, how to recover the costs of regularisation without imposing an excessive burden upon the poor, inadvertently forcing their displacement. And, secondly, how best to prioritise pro- grammes given the large backlog of service requirements in older settlements as well as more newly created ones that continue to proliferate, notwithstanding tighter govern- ment controls and greater political willing- ness to prevent developers from continuing their egregious land development and lot sales. Important background variables in the Latin American policy environment are democratisation, together with economic lib- eralisation and greater global integration. Political and economic opening have had a profound impact not only upon socioeco- nomic conditions, but also upon the housing process and the nature of land market per- formance. Time-worn practices of patron- client links between politicians and the urban poor whereby settlement services and legal
kpvt | recognition were a quid pro quo for party political (or individual) support are largely a thing of the past; as is the existence of an overarching (patrimonial) state seeking to provide a broad range of social benefits to the poor. Today's government bureaucracies are slimmer and programmes are more care- fully targeted to those that need them most. Social services may also increasingly be con- tracted out to privately organised enterprises and to non-government organisations that have become a virtual arm of the state (Ward, 2005). The prevailing orthodoxy is that, wherever possible, the market(s) should provide, such that the primary task of policy- makers is effectively to 'prime' the market, or at the very least to make it work more equitably by generating jobs, cutting out red tape that frustrates entrepreneurial spirit, en- gaging the private sector in home-building programmes for the lower end of the market and providing serviced lots at affordable lev- els, etc. Thus, from the 1980s onwards, the policy paradigm has changed: initially to- wards greater active sponsorship and support for self-help housing and informal settlement initiatives; and latterly to more effective regulation and improved administration that would reduce waste, enhance cost recovery and provide greater incentives for the poor to become a part of the market place and be better placed to fend for themselves (Ward, 2005).
jie2 | Notwithstanding a growing recognition of some of the positive elements of informality (Roy and AlSayyad, 2003), for those wedded to the orthodoxy of formal urban land devel- opment, the very idea of informal title and property land markets remains anathema. Therefore, numerous arguments are re- hearsed in favour of titling programmes. First, planners and public officials, for whom the formal legal system is the one that they know best and work towards, are often un- easy with 'plural' systems and alternative property rights that are unfamiliar and which threaten and jibe with the sanctity of private property. A second argument stems from the assertion that only within a formally or- ganised property market can a true market
d0ik | economy flourish (McLaughlin and de Soto, 1994). A third argument is the idea that legal title provides security against eviction and displacement, and provides the necessary in- centives for home improvement and consoli- dation. As Mclaughlin and de Soto argue
0x0s | When people have formalized titles they feel their property is under their legal con- trol and therefore have the incentive to invest their intelligence and work in im- proving it (McLaughlin and de Soto, 1994, p. 308).
4exe | They further add that when there is no formal title to provide security of tenure, planning horizons are shorter and there are no incen- tives to protect and improve property. Fourthly, it is argued that service providers cannot, or will not, introduce services until legalisation and full property entitlement are in place and secure. A fifth assertion is that tenure offers people a new source of col- lateral (legal property), thereby leveraging access to credit. Sixthly, there is an ideologi- cal component to regularisation, insofar as formal title 'integrates' the poor into the urban citizenry, inculcating a belief system that respects free markets, supports democ- racy and engenders respect for, and partici- pation in, the tax and regulatory bases of city management.
