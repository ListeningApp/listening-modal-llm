How could I better support my partners in their other relationships?\nmk0a | A benefit of nonmonogamy is that you don't have to provide or expect to receive all of this from one partner. Different partners can be more of a safe haven, a secure base or both, offering different facets of each. We all have different strengths and it can be wonderfully satisfying to have some partners that support you in safe haven ways, while others offer more of a secure base.\nzn35 | When I first began presenting at nonmonogamy conferences, I was nervous. I had experience presenting in academic settings and in leading workshops, but the conference format was different. I didn't know whether the nonmonogamous audience would connect with what I was talking about. At this time, I was still nursing my infant son on demand, so being away from him for more than three or four hours felt like a big deal. I needed both emotional support and logistical help with my son. Thankfully, I had two different partners who could take on these roles for me.\nrrn2 | My co-parent (and husband at the time), Dave, was an amazing secure base. He cleared his day to be with our son and gave me the freedom and encouragement to go rock it as a presenter. He reassured me that my son would be fine while I was gone and that he wouldn't starve if he couldn't nurse at the exact moment he wanted to. Dave reminded me to remember to have fun while I was presenting, which was precisely what I needed to hear right before I gave a talk. In this incident, he was the secure base that I needed to be able to confidently turn away from my family and go take a risk in the larger world. However, since he was caretaking our son, he was understandably not available for any of the safe haven types of emotional support that I also needed. This is where my other partner, Sam, stepped in. Sam wasn't able to be at the conference with me, but they made themselves available to talk on the phone right when my talk was done. They were excited to hear about my experience and gave me their full attention as I debriefed everything I needed to. In that instance, Sam was my safe haven. I could let my guard down with them, lean into them, and experience being accepted with love, warmth\nfoid | and attunement. Both partners came through for me exactly how I needed, and neither needed to be or do more than they did.\n152h | On a separate but similar note, I presented the information in this chapter at a different polyamorous conference and bumped into an attendee from that conference several months later. She told me that after hearing my talk, she realized that all three of her current partners were a safe haven for her, but that none of them were really functioning in secure base ways. This person was fulfilled and content with how her partners were showing up for her, so she decided not to request that any of them take on more of a secure base role. She also felt that it wasn't necessary to take on a fourth partner who could provide a secure base. Instead, she decided to start acting in more secure base ways for herself, which she did by encouraging her own growth and expansion. In just a few short months she started a blog that she had long thought about and also bought and renovated the vintage car of her dreams. To me, this demonstrates the importance of how we do not always have to turn to our partners to meet our safe haven or secure base needs, especially when our pre-established relationship dynamics are working well. We can focus on cultivating a more secure attachment with ourselves, which is one of the pillars of being polysecure. Chapter Nine focuses on the importance of being our own safe haven and secure base, so that we can better establish a secure attachment with our self. When attachment ruptures and traumas occur, we can lose access to the parts of ourselves that are able to be a safe haven through self-soothing, self-nurturance, self-compassion and self-acceptance, and to the parts of us that are able to be a secure base through self-encouragement, healthy standards, appropriate boundaries and alignment with our values. While having multiple partners to turn to for a secure base or safe haven is a definite benefit of nonmonogamy, we can't forget how powerful and important it is to also rely on our self in these ways.\njvjk | CHAPTER EIGHT THE HEARTS OF BEING POLYSECURE\ns2v8 | NOW THAT WE'VE COVERED being a safe haven and secure base-the two broader strokes of being polysecure-I want to focus on some more specific things you can do to cultivate being polysecure in your multiple relationships. I've combed through the literature on the conditions needed to create secure attachment in adult romantic relationships and considered what I've experienced and witnessed in the polyamory partnerships that I've counseled. The result is the acronym HEARTS, which I use to encapsulate the different ingredients, skills, capacities and ways of being required for secure functioning in multiple attachment-based partnerships.\nm2uh | HHere (being here and present with me) EExpressed Delight AAttunement RRituals and Routines TTurning Towards after Conflict SSecure Attachment with Self\nerho | The first five letters in HEARTS cover the relational level of being polysecure. When explaining these, I suggest different behaviors and practices that you can experiment with and take on in your attachment-based polyamorous relationships. The S in HEARTS focuses on the individual level of being polysecure. I have dedicated the whole next chapter to this, where I will guide you through suggestions and practices for applying HEART to yourself. An important caveat is that you do not need to be perfect in all of these things all of the time, but my hope is that if you prioritize these things at the heart of your relationships, you will discover beautiful and powerful ways to thrive in love.\nbpnq | H: ARE YOU HERE?\n3xla | From an infant's perspective, it would be impossible to attach and bond to someone who is not there. The absence of caregivers can be dangerous and damaging,\n```",
