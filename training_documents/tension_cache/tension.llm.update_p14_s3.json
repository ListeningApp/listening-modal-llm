        "content": "29a3 | This renders comparisons hard to interpret.\" The compliance officer believed that the disclosed information is generally of high relevance, but pointed out that \"many companies seem selective in their information disclosure and seem to write more about themes where they have performed well and less about areas in which they have done less, but that are still important.\" Several of the respondents, including the portfolio manager, the financial analyst and the sustainability manager, argued that comparability was a key weakness - both within and between firms. The sustainability manager elaborated: \"Comparison with peers is difficult - even for companies that are quite similar. The problem is exacerbated when companies merge, spin out sub-units and so on, at which point the basis for comparison changes.\" However, the portfolio manager pointed out a maturing of companies in their disclosure practices: \"We're seeing a run of new firms becoming listed on the stock exchange and their ESG disclosures are often insufficient in the early stages. But as they become more experienced, the quality of information in disclosures normally improves.\"\nsb1e | Discussion\nw2yn | The results of our survey and qualitative interviews shed light on the tensions between the two approaches to materiality and the implications for users of information in sustainability reports. While the different financial market stakeholders included in our sample had somewhat different information needs, they were in relative consensus about the challenges and shortcomings of discerning between various forms of material information in sustainability reports. Our findings thus contribute further to the understanding of how the materiality of sustainability information may lie \"in the eye of the beholder\", or at least be assessed and consumed very differently by different users of information.\nap6l | Tensions in the uses of the materiality concept\niest | The results of our survey showed that the different users of information in our sample - all of whom have roles related to financial markets - desired information about various types of material information (i.e. both in GRI and SASB approaches to the concept). However, they similarly expressed a belief that it is challenging to discern between sustainability issues that are financially material and those that are (only) material in a GRI sense. As shown in the survey, the respondents in our study judged sustainability reports to provide relevant information, but lacking in comparability, timeliness and verifiability.\ncox8 | In follow-up interviews with selected users of information from the survey sample, we dug deeper into the tensions experienced by these users of information and their practical implications. As outlined in the results section above, the respondents generally found it difficult to discern between:\nppqi | · financially material sustainability information;\noxou | · information of broader importance for other stakeholders; and\n495n | · information useful for making inferences about real sustainability impacts.\nawri | This perceived difficulty echoed the tension between assessing sustainability tensions \"not only assessed relative to when but also according to whom\". Our respondents pointed out that the increased standardization of sustainability reports favored some user groups (in particular financial market professionals) over other groups. Nonetheless, they argued that the information is still presented in a manner that was too muddled for real discernment between different types of material information that respond to the various information needs of these user groups.\nbl28 | The respondents judged materiality to be a crucial dimension of their information needs and emphasized the need for both disclosure on financially material issues and issues that are material in a GRI sense. Hence, they expressed a preference for disclosure in line with double materiality, which directly addresses the problem of clearly delineating financially material from non-financially material sustainability issues. This problem is even more comprehensive when taking into account, as pointed out by the European Lab Project Task Force on preparatory work for the elaboration of possible EU non-financial reporting standards, that \"the financial materiality of a sustainability matter is not constrained to matters that are within the control of the reporting entity\". That is, the financial materiality part of double materiality goes beyond sustainability issues that are under the control of the reporting entity itself, i.e. within the boundary of financial reporting.\nd5bz | In its Guidelines on reporting climate-related information, the EU outlines a double materiality perspective in the context of reporting climate-related information. Here, there is a clear argument for reporting both issues that are financially material \"to the extent necessary for an understanding of the company's development, performance and position\" and those that are socially and environmentally material in order to account for the \"impact of its activities.\" Perhaps the movement towards explicitly reporting on material issues in a double materiality perspective can lead to more clarity that benefits users of such information. Importantly, as pointed out by Global Reporting Initiative and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board in the document \"A Practical Guide to Sustainability Reporting Using GRI and SASB Standards\":\nap5o | SASB's industry-specific standards identify the sustainability-related risks and opportunities most likely to affect a company's financial condition (i.e. its balance sheet), operating performance (i.e. its income statement), or risk profile (i.e. cost of capital). All of these factors impact a company's current and future market valuation. The GRI Standards focus on the economic, environmental and social impacts of the activities of a company and hence its contributions - positive or negative - towards sustainable development. It is the underlying assumption that if not already financially material at the time of reporting, these impacts may become financially material over time.\n7zvf | Thus, in their recent collaborative efforts, GRI and SASB have emphasized how double materiality is important both to discern between these two types of materiality. Furthermore, as indicated in the last sentence of the quote above, the two institutions also suggest that such disclosure may be important to account for dynamic materiality.\nmov9 | Our respondents expressed a desire for more dynamic materiality information but at the same time expressed concern that such information was difficult to produce as well as to verify. Thus, the respondents implicitly addressed another widespread tension in the field of sustainability - namely, the time dimension, which in turn influences the scope of disclosures. In this regard, as pointed out by the respondents, there is a tension between demands for:\nks7m | · high-quality information that is verifiable, which may often be the case for well- established indicators such as CO2 emissions or energy consumption; and\nw1w1 | · timely information on emerging topics that may become financially material, which may often have less standardized and well-developed measures and indicators.\nh8gv | Therefore, the introduction of dynamic materiality may necessitate a tolerance for less standardized and less comparable information, at least in the period when new reporting themes emerge.\nkwkp | Sustainability reporting and materiality\nyj0m | Taken together, then, tensions of several varieties are perceived and pointed out by the respondents of our study. First, there are tensions arising from different information needs and appetites of different user groups - specifically, between financial market professionals (investors, portfolio managers, financial analysts, etc.) on the one hand and stakeholders more oriented towards real sustainability impacts on the other hand. Thus, in addition to being tied to the practical nature of these groups' different decision-making purposes, this type of tension may also relate to a deeper-lying ideological tension. The dividing line then goes between those that believe that sustainability reporting should first and foremost be a tool for better informing decision-makers in financial markets about the financial implications of sustainability issues and those that believe that sustainability reporting should serve to increase the transparency of sustainability impacts in a manner that can drive real sustainability improvements.",
