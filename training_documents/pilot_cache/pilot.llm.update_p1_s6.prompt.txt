You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

uodj | The Nature of Emerging Practice in Occupational Therapy: A Pilot Study
k16v | The Nature of Emerging Practice in Occupational Therapy: A Pilot Study
b2lm | ABSTRACT. The profession of occupational therapy is responding to changes in the health care system by expanding the contexts and models for service provision, typically referred to as emerging practice. As a pilot study, a survey was completed by 174 occupational therapists to gather information and opinions about emerging practice. Results indicated oc- cupational therapists hold diverse perceptions about emerging practice settings and services as well as the role and significance of emerg- ing practice within the profession. Occupational therapists engaged in emerging practice described numerous rewards and challenges inherent within the process of developing and delivering services. The findings indicate continued professional dialogue and research are needed to sup- port the development and efficacy of occupational therapy services in emerging settings and roles.
ti7f | INTRODUCTION
oksu | The health care system in the United States is dynamic with continuous changes in policies, models of service delivery, and reimbursement sys- tems. Ongoing challenges include the number of medically uninsured indi- viduals in the United States at 45.7 million in 2007, down slightly from 47 million in 2006 (DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, & Smith, 2008), and those under- insured estimated at 25 million (Reinberg, 2008). As well, the management of chronic diseases among an increasingly aging population (Clarke, 2007) and the continual growth of health care expenditures at approximately 6.7% annually (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2008) fur- ther strain the existing system. During the 1970s and 1980s, philosophical and policy decisions began to shift the focus of health care away from the medical model to alternative models of care. Baum (2000) described these elements of change in the health care system as a "progression from an institution-centered medical model, with treatment delivered episodically, to a community-based sociopolitical model, the goal of which is to plan or manage health care delivery" (p. 12). Accompanying the development of alternative and managed models of care is a stronger emphasis on wellness, health promotion, and disease prevention. Experts believe future changes will include larger, integrated care systems, an increasing focus on patient- centered care, the shift of procedures from hospitals to outpatient and home settings, and a continued emphasis on facilitating reimbursement for pre- ventive care (Carpenter, 2007; Clarke, 2007). This ongoing evolution com- pels health care professionals to examine their philosophy of services, cur- rent and future roles within the health care system, and methods for service delivery.
wtow | The profession of occupational therapy experienced both challenges and opportunities brought about by these changes in the health care system. As an example, during the 1990s, occupational therapy practitioners increas- ingly found their daily practice shaped by restrictive reimbursement poli- cies and a decreasing availability of employment in medical settings (Fisher & Cooksey, 2002a, 2002b; Reiss, 2000). More recently, data show an in- creasing availability of occupational therapy positions nationwide with school systems, early intervention programs, and hospitals employing the majority of practitioners (52.6%) and a 4% annual growth in available po- sitions in several regions of the country (American Occupational Therapy Association [AOTA], 2006). Concurrently, the context for providing occu- pational therapy services began to expand beyond facility-based environ- ments, such as rehabilitation programs and hospitals, to community-based and emerging practice settings (Baum & Law, 1998; Fazio, 2008; Scaffa,
o22k | 2001). These developments align with the call for occupational therapy practitioners to evaluate their roles and services in light of the philosoph- ical foundations of the profession and the therapeutic goal of engagement in occupations for the promotion of health, well-being, and full participa- tion in life (Baum, 2000; Fidler, 2000; Jacobs, 2002a, 2002b; Kornblau, 2004).
nwfz | The Centennial Vision (AOTA, 2003) outlines broad practice categories from which emerging practice may meet new and growing needs of com- munities and individuals. These categories are children and youth, health and wellness, productive aging, work and industry, and rehabilitation, dis- ability, and participation. Examples of emerging practices within these cat- egories include ergonomic consultation, driver rehabilitation and training, health promotion for aging communities at senior centers, welfare-to-work services, and life skills training at homeless shelters (Johansson, 2000).
nvfy | Although the provision of occupational therapy services in community- based settings is often a component of emerging practice, multiple settings and roles may be considered an emerging practice. However, it remains a limited area of practice for the profession as a whole. The results of a recent workforce and salary survey conducted by the AOTA (2006) showed few occupational therapy respondents reporting community (1.6%) or emerg- ing practice settings (other, 1.9%) as their primary work setting. Because emerging practice is a relatively new development within the profession, its nature and significance to the profession is not clearly understood. Accord- ingly, the purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the characteristics of emerging practice prior to an exploration of the competencies for emerging practice (Holmes & Scaffa, in press).
mror | METHODOLOGY
zlxc | A written survey was developed for this study to answer the following questions. What is the nature of emerging practice today and what are its challenges and rewards? Survey research was chosen as the method to collect information from the population of occupational therapists in order to complete an initial description and exploration of the topic (Babbie, 2001). Survey research provides information about a targeted population or sample at one point in time and in that respect can be considered cross- sectional (Bailey, 1997). The written survey results offered preliminary information relevant to understanding and further investigating emerging practice.
k0bw | Participants
aq5a | The population included occupational therapists who were current U.S. residents and initially certified for practice by the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT). The study sample was recruited using convenience and purposive sampling techniques. The sam- ple comprised 700 occupational therapists who were current members of AOTA and who either identified the AOTA Home and Community Health or Education Special Interest Sections (SISs) as their primary in- terest on their initial or renewing membership applications from 1999 to 2000. These SISs were thought to include members with interest or expertise in emerging practice. Names and addresses of the SISs mem- bers were selected by the AOTA List Rental Service and purchased in electronic format. Each of the 700 therapists received a letter inviting them to participate in the study. The survey and a return envelope were also included in the packet. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval to conduct the study was obtained from Gonzaga University. Return of the survey form was considered voluntary consent to participate in the study.
