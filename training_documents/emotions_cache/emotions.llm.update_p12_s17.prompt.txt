You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

7bdk | Subjects were seated in separate cubicles. Some were randomly assigned to the bipolarity hypothesis-bittersweet clip condition <LATEX>\left( n = 3 3 \right)</LATEX> and others to the no-hypothesis-control clip condition <LATEX>\left( n = 3 0 \right) .</LATEX> Because Study 5 featured a novel open-ended measure, other subjects were randomly assigned to a no-hypothesis- bittersweet clip condition <LATEX>\left( n = 3 1 \right) .</LATEX> After they watched the bitter- sweet film, subjects in the bipolarity hypothesis-bittersweet clip condition were asked to describe their emotions. Specifically, the computer provided subjects with the following prompt: "Emotions can affect language comprehension, so please tell us how you feel right now. Type in how you are feeling and why." The prompt was accompanied by a field with a capacity of approximately 300 words. We gave subjects up to 4 min to respond but, to prevent confabulation, gave them the option to finish early. Subjects then read that we were interested in how any positive and negative emotions they felt "played out over time" and that "[w]hat we're really interested in is whether people can feel happy and sad at the same time. Two groups of researchers have spent several years debating whether people can feel happy and sad at the same time." They then read that one group's prediction is that people can feel happy and sad at the same time but that
fim0 | [o]ur own group, the Boulder Group, predicts that people CANNOT feel happy and sad at the same time. So we have predicted that people CANNOT feel both happy and sad at the same time, but evidence for
ojro | or against our prediction would be interesting, so we'll let the data decide.
l6t9 | These subjects were then asked to indicate which of Figure 6's panels best captured the time course of their emotions. Finally, they were asked whether they had been told that our hypothesis was or was not that people could feel both happy and sad at the same time. Data from the four subjects (12%) who incorrectly thought they had been told that our hypothesis was that people could feel both happy and sad were removed from all analyses.
1ujy | Subjects in the no-hypothesis-bittersweet clip condition went through the same procedure, except they were neither told nor asked about our hypothesis. Subjects in the no-hypothesis-control clip condition also went through the same procedure, except they watched the control clip and were neither told nor asked about our hypothesis.
qzor | Results and discussion. The percentage of subjects in each group who reported mixed emotions and simultaneously mixed emotions is shown in Table 4.7 Chi-square tests revealed effects of condition on both measures, <LATEX>\chi ^ { 2 } \left( 2 , N = 9 0 \right) = 1 9 . 5 7</LATEX> and 16.58, Cramér's <LATEX>V = . 4 7</LATEX> and .43, respectively, both <LATEX>p s < . 0 0 1 .</LATEX> Follow-up Fisher's exact tests indicated that subjects who watched the bit- tersweet clip and were told nothing about our hypotheses were more likely than subjects who watched the control clip to report mixed emotions <LATEX>\left( \varphi = . 5 1 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. p < . 0 0 1 \right)</LATEX> and simultaneously mixed emotions <LATEX>\left( \varphi = . 4 1 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. p = . 0 0 2 \right) .</LATEX> Additional tests indicated that subjects who watched the bittersweet clip and were told that we doubted that people can feel happy and sad at the same time were also more likely than subjects who watched the control clip to report mixed emotions <LATEX>\left( \varphi = . 5 7 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. p < . 0 0 1 \right)</LATEX> and simultaneously mixed emotions
a0by | <LATEX>\left( \varphi = . 5 4 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. p < . 0 0 1 \right) .</LATEX> In sum, individuals who watched the bittersweet clip reported more mixed emotions than those who watched the control clip whether or not they were led to believe that we doubted the existence of mixed emotions. Thus, these data replicate Study 4's evidence for mixed emotions and extend them by indicating that subjects pay more attention to reporting their emotions than to speculating about our hypotheses.
u1ky | Study 6: Lay Theories Revisited
htm9 | As in Studies 1 and 2, subjects in Studies 4 and 5 may have simply reported feeling both happy and sad because they believed that people can feel happy and sad at the same time. To test this hypothesis, we conducted another study that included subjects who did not endorse the belief that happiness and sadness can co-occur. Rather than ask subjects to write about their emotions, we had an interviewer ask them to describe their emotions verbally (J. T. Larsen, To, & Fireman, 2007).
8hul | Method. Three weeks before the study began, 852 University of Colorado, Boulder, undergraduates enrolled in introductory psychology courses completed a mass survey. One questionnaire contained the yes-no question "Do you think people can feel happy and sad at the same time?" embedded among similar ques- tions about psychological phenomena. Those who said "yes" and

l0a3 | A subset of endorsers and nonendorsers were invited to partic- ipate in the study <LATEX>\left( n = 7 4 ; \right.</LATEX> 38 women; 51%). Data from an additional subject were lost because the voice recorder malfunc- tioned.
u8nw | Subjects completed the study individually. Because few nonen- dorsers were available and we thought it unlikely that they would report mixed emotions after watching the control clip, all nonen- <LATEX>d o r s e r s \left( n = 2 8 \right) w a t c h e d</LATEX> the bittersweet clip. Endorsers watched either the bittersweet Life Is Beautiful clip <LATEX>\left( n = 2 2 \right)</LATEX> or the control clip <LATEX>\left( n = 2 4 \right)</LATEX> by random assignment. After providing the cover story, the experimenter left and subjects watched the clip. After the clip, the experimenter told subjects that she needed to ask a few questions about their emotional reactions to the film because emotions can affect language comprehension. She first asked, "How do you feel right now?" Throughout, whenever subjects mentioned an emotion, the experimenter asked them to explain why they felt that way if they had not spontaneously done so. If they mentioned positive or negative emotions only in response to the first question, she asked, "Do you feel anything else?"8 At this point, the experimenter confirmed any reports of mixed emotions by asking, "So you feel happy and sad?" (When applicable, the experimenter replaced "happy" and "sad" with the positive and negative emotions mentioned by the subject.) No subjects who initially reported mixed emotions subsequently denied them.
