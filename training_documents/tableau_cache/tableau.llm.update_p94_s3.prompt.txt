You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

nh8n | Aggregation of the measures plays an important role here. The default behavior of Tableau Public is to aggregate measures (for example. by using sums or averages). This may be fine for most analyses, but you may want a clearer picture (or you may want to expose outliers) by looking at all the data points. You can override this aggregation behavior by disaggregating the data, which will display all the values in the data source for that measure. To do so, go to the Start button and select Analysis. Then, click on Aggregate Measures and deselect that menu command. Note that disaggregation may remove the information displayed from the tool tip when hovering over a data point. You can add the contextual values displayed in the tool tip by dragging dimensions and measures from the Data window to the Detail or Tooltip shelves in the Marks card.
ircn | If too many values are displayed, you can add the measures to the Filters shelf and set parameters in the filter dialog box to limit the number of data points (marks) that are being shown.
npsf | We created the scatter plot shown in the following screenshot, which shows the relationship of GDP and mobile phone users between 2000 and 2010 in Asia by country from the World Bank Indicators data, by performing the following steps:
dynl | 1. Drag Finance: GDP (current. USD) to the Columns shelf, which puts it on the x axis and makes it the independent variable.
msij | 2. Drag Business: Mobile Phone Subscribers from the Measures pane to the Columns shelf, which makes it the dependent variable.
8n3m | 3. Drag Date from the Dimensions pane to the Color shelf.
ech9 | 4. Click on the context menu for the Color legend and assign the Cyclic color palette.
p94v | 5. Drag Region to the Filters shelf and select Asia.
gf1i | 6. Drag Country to the Label shelf.
rouh | 7. Drag Population: Urban (count) to the Size shelf on the Marks card, which further encodes the default circles with the relative urban populations.
080i | Visualization - Tips and Types
4fln | From this, we learned that the relationship between the GDP and Mobile phone subscribers in China is linear and that in other countries such as Japan, it is relatively consistent. It is also not surprising that the urban population of China is the largest, since it has the largest population. In the next chapter, you will learn how to create calculated fields that show you the percentage of the total that is urban rather than just a discrete number.
tmlf | Pie charts
oy09 | Pie charts allow you to show the composition of parts to a whole, like slices in a pie. Pie charts should be used sparingly because humans cannot interpret angles and area that well. Noted visualization experts, including Stephen Few and Edward Tufte, are generally against using pie charts, except in limited circumstances. It is often said for data, authors consider using a stacked bar chart instead.
wvb1 | That being said, pie charts can sometimes be used effectively under certain circumstances. Limit the number of slices to 5 (at the most), and make sure that the slices are not too small and are visible. You can use pie charts effectively to give a general sense of how one dimension compares to another, but don't use it to report measures that are close in value. It is too difficult for people to interpret when the measures (the pie slices) are of similar sizes. Tableau Public, unlike other data visualization software packages, does not support 3D pie charts and drill-downs into pie slices. This is a good thing because these characteristics lead to confusing and misleading pie charts.

r7ii | We made the pie chart shown in the following screenshot, which still uses the World Bank Indicators data to show the relative percentage of mobile phone users in the world by region:
ezxx | 1. On a new worksheet, change the mark type to a pie on the Marks card.
zzb7 | 2. Drag Region to the Color shelf.
zts3 | 3. Click on the context menu on the Color shelf to change the color palette to Cyclic.
q5zo | 4. Drag Business: Mobile Phone Subscribers to the Size shelf on the Marks card.
z20w | 5. Click on the Color controller on the Marks card and add a black border.
ig3d | 6. Drag both Region and Business: Mobile Phone Subscribers to the Label shelf on the Marks card.
dgts | 7. Click on the context menu for Business: Mobile Phone Subscribers on the Label shelf of the Marks card, select Quick Table Calculation, and choose Percent of Total.
p1zf | 8. Filter Date by setting it to 2010.
k0wj | 9. Click on the Context menu on the Color legend, select Sort, and sort Regions in the descending order by Business: Mobile Phone Subscribers:
p83v | Visualization - Tips and Types
5yts | This pie chart shows that half of the mobile phone users in the world are in Asia. The pie chart is easy to use, and it does not mislead users. It provides them with the context that they need to sort through the information points quickly.
l1qt | Using groups and sets
183q | It can be useful to group dimension members into groups to report on these groups, as compared to others. For example, in the Life Expectancy Map that we built earlier, it might be helpful to add Canada, USA, and Mexico into a group or set named North American Countries.
vdw3 | A group is a simple set that is composed of the dimension members that you choose. In the following example, we set up the North American group by performing the following steps:
8whh | 1. Right-click on the Country field in the Dimensions pane.
iywu | 2. Select Create and then choose Group from the context menu.
qn1v | 3. Give the group a name.
o9ng | 4. Manually select the three countries that we want to put into the group.
6od4 | 5. Click on the Group button and then name the group.
jx1z | 6. Click on OK.
hrlm | Note that the group field appears at the bottom of the Dimensions pane. It is considered to be metadata. It exists in the Tableau Public workbook, but it does not appear in your original data source.
wfjt | Chapter 4
g779 | In the following example, we added the group to the Color shelf on the Marks card of the map. Countries are colored by their membership in the group. Either they are in, or they are out, as shown in the following screenshot:
by5l | Similarly, we can create a set that groups members of a dimension by their adherence to the criteria that you establish.
wye3 | We can create a set that identifies the top 25 countries by life expectancy, which will be used again to modify the map, from the World Bank indicators data source by performing the following steps:
oc7w | 1. Right-click on the Country field in the Dimensions pane.
k5k4 | 2. Click on Create and then select Set.
wngq | 3. Rename the Set to Country Set.
udft | 4. Click on the Condition tab rather than manually selecting the members of the Set so that it will be updated if and when we get new data.
foay | Visualization - Tips and Types
43mx | 5. Create a condition that includes the top 25 countries by Health: Life Expectancy at Birth (total years).
ld7j | 6. Click on OK, as shown in the following screenshot:
mf5v | We dragged the set from the bottom of the Dimensions pane and dropped it on the top of the field on the Color shelf on the Marks card, thus replacing it. Countries that are in the top 25 countries filtered according to life expectancy are colored blue, and all the others are gray, as shown in the following screenshot:
