You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ghss | 5. Psychoeducational purposes. Persons who need information about grief and loss and to normalize what they are experiencing can use such pages to obtain information about the grief process (Dominick et al., 2009). These are generally not interactional pages but are pages set up to give information on a topic. There are, however, some sites that allow the reader to ask a question about a particular topic that may or may not be answered by another person reading that particular page.
3s61 | 6. Communicating with the deceased. Some sites and some Facebook pages are set up in the name of the deceased. Mourners may use these pages to regularly write to the deceased, often in a letter format, expressing their thoughts, feelings, and questions. Those who have studied this phenomenon find that such communications with the deceased are primarily used for the purpose of meaning making and second for providing a continuing bond with the deceased (Bell, Bailey, & Kennedy, 2015; De Groot, 2012; Irwin, 2015).

pqxb | WHAT IS THE NATURE OF COMPLICATED BEREAVEMENT?
08qc | For years, most of those working with complicated mourning and grief therapy have used terms like chronic grief, delayed grief, and absent grief to delineate the diagnosis of those with complicated bereavement or complicated mourning. In fact, some of these concepts were defined by consensus when Beverly Raphael and Warwick Middleton (Middleton, Moylan, Raphael, Burnett, & Martinek, 1993) conducted a survey to determine which terms were the most frequently used by leading ther- apists in the field. Although there was a surprising degree of consen- sus, the problem is that complicated grief is a Z code in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, and Z code diagnoses do not qualify for third-party payment through insurance carriers. Another problem has been the lack of precise definitions of these terms, which makes rigorous research of them difficult. The easiest solution has been to conduct research using well-defined pathological entities like depres- sion, anxiety, and somatization, for which there are good standardized measures. Although these clinical entities may be part of the mourn- er's experience, they clearly are not measures of grief. There were a few
hdj2 | measures of grief like the Texas Revised Grief Inventory (Faschingbauer, Devaul, & Zisook, 2001) and the Hogan Grief Reaction Checklist (2001), but most were normed on a clinical population.
a57g | Beginning with the work of Holly Prigerson, Kathryn Shear, and Mardi Horowitz in the 1990s, there has been a 20-year-plus attempt to come up with a diagnosis of complicated grief that would be accept- able to go into the DSM-5, which was released in 2013. Such a diagnosis would make insurance money available for the treatment of patients with this diagnosis and would make research funds available for fur- ther investigation on this clinical entity. Details on this diagnosis, its development, and its current status can be found in Chapter 5.
g8m3 | DISENFRANCHISED GRIEF
a9av | This term, coined by Ken Doka and further developed by Attig (2004), has been an important addition to the field. Although Doka's first vol- ume came out in 1989, he updated the concept in a second volume that came out in 2002 (Doka, 1989, 2002). Disenfranchised grief refers to losses in the mourner's life of relationships that are not socially sanc- tioned. A classic example would be the death of someone with whom the mourner is having an affair. If this affair is not widely known, the mourner will not be invited to participate in the funeral rituals and may not receive the social support that many people find helpful after a death. Alternate lifestyles may not be socially sanctioned, and the friend or lover may be ostracized by the family of the deceased. There are numerous other examples of disenfranchised grief, and there are suggestions in this book for re-enfranchising some of these losses to aid the mourner in adapting to the loss.
73l3 | Aaron Lazare (1979, 1989), an early colleague at Massachusetts General Hospital, talked about two kinds of loss that are directly related to this concept of disenfranchised grief. Socially negated losses are those losses that society treats as nonlosses. An example of this would be pregnancy loss, either spontaneous or induced. The second kind of loss related to disenfranchised grief would be socially unspeakable losses. These are specific losses about which the mourner has a difficult time talking. Common examples would be death by suicide and death by AIDS. Both of these losses carry some stigma in the broader society. One intervention that can be helpful to those experiencing these types of losses is assisting them in talking about them and exploring their thoughts and feelings about the death. Re-enfranchising suggestions for these types of losses can be found in Chapter 7 of this volume.
