        "content": "epyi | To compute a filtering estimate, the ensemble of forecasts is adjusted using an innovation term and gain matrix as in Equation twenty point nineteen. There is only one observation y(i) available, but it turns out that using it unchanged for all innovations in the ensemble tends to underestimate the variability of the filtering distribution. Hence, the innovation term y(i)-Hi Mili-one in the ordinary Kalman filter is replaced by an innovation ensemble y(i) plus e minus H;x, where the perturbations e; are simulated observation errors with the same distribution as the errors in the data model. One can therefore compute an ensemble of simulated filtering states,\ny51p | Ex minus one plus R; y(i) plus e; minus H[-].\nx95m | This ensemble is used to produce estimates &j ; of the filtering mean and 2 ;; of the filtering covariance matrix. One then uses N( *ยก , [i) as an estimate of the filtering distribution at time step i, and the algorithm has completed a step. There is also a reanalysis version of this method.\nyfum | If the process model is actually linear, such that Equation twenty point twenty-three reduces to Equation twenty point sixteen, then the ensemble Kalman forecasting and filtering estimates converge in the limit of large ensemble size to those of the ordinary Kalman filter algorithm. However, if the M; are nonlinear, then the forecasting and filtering distributions become non-Gaussian, and there will be biases from the ensemble approach that do not disappear with large ensemble size. These biases must be assessed or possibly corrected separately.\nppx4 | Twenty point eight. Data Assimilation for the Lorenz System\nqf11 | If the space of process variables is high-dimensional one zero to the power of six or one zero to the power of eight is not uncommon, the ensemble approach successfully avoids the problem of high-dimensional integration and the manipulation of huge covariance matrices. However, typically the ensemble size is much smaller, perhaps m equals zero one zero to the power of two. Then the sample covariance matrices have rank at most m and cannot possibly give all covariances correctly. On the other hand, in such situations the process vector X(i) may describe physical quantities at different locations across a region or around the globe. Then one often multiplies sum from i to i minus one or sum from i to i elementwise with a \"cut-off\" matrix C whose entries are small far from the diagonal (for component pairs that have little to do with each other). This trick eliminates spurious large correlations at distant locations and at the same time tends to restore full rank to the estimated covariance matrices. Care must be taken to avoid destroying teleconnections.\n8oqt | The EnKf is now widely used. Many versions have been developed, and the literature has grown quite large.\n6zah | Twenty point eight. Data Assimilation for the Lorenz System\n4v5o | To illustrate the EnKf technique, we apply the algorithm to the Lorenz model seven point one with the fixed parameter values sigma equals ten, beta equals eight divided by three, and rho equals twenty-eight. The attractor is shown in Figure seven point two.\nha9e | Let X equals (x, y, z): t maps to x(t) equals (x(t), y(t), z(t)) be the solution of the Lorenz system (seven point one) which satisfies the initial data x(0) equals (x(0), y(0), z(0)) in R cubed. The process model associated with the Lorenz equations is the map\nxrnt | Script M: R cubed to R cubed check R cubed defined by Script M(x(0)) equals x(one) in R cubed, x(0) in R cubed.\nc8ra | There is no closed formula for Script M, so Script M must be computed numerically by solving the system of differential equations for each",
