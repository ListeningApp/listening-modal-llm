Genome mining efforts have revealed several enzymatic strategies employed by nature to catalyze these reactions for the biosynthesis of important natural products. Arguably, the best characterized class of enzymes known for this type of reactivity are radical S-adenosylmethionine enzymes, which use powerful radical-mediated chemistry to catalyze various types of C-C bond formation and a breadth of other reactions. In addition to radical S-adenosylmethionine enzymes, the analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters has shown a preponderance of mononuclear heme and nonheme enzymes responsible for catalyzing the oxidative formation of C is p two-C is p three, C is p two-N is p two, and C is p three-N is p two bonds. Inter- and intra-molecular bond formation by cytochrome P four fiftys is prevalent in the biosynthesis of pharmacophores that include phenol cross-link formation during the assembly of glycopeptide antibiotics (e.g., teicoplanin and vancomycin) and desertorin or orlandin alkaloids, flaviolin dimerization, tryptophan nitration, and amination for indolactam generation, among others. Cytochrome P four fiftys have also been recently shown to dimerize tryptophan-containing cyclic dipeptides.\npbea | Tryptophan-linked dimeric two, five-diketopiperazine alkaloids are a large family of natural products that are found in numerous species and exhibit broad and often potent (e.g., antimicrobial and antiparasitic) cytotoxicity. One route for dimer biosynthesis consists of a cyclodipeptide synthase enzyme that converts two amino acid charged\nccpt | tRNA molecules to form a cyclic dipeptide. Cytochrome P four fiftys, prevalent in many bacterial cyclodipeptide synthase-containing biosynthetic gene clusters, have been found to catalyze the downstream dimerization of diketopiperazine dipeptides through an oxidative mechanism that has yet to be clarified. One such pathway, shown in Figure one A, is found in Streptomyces sp. NRRL S-eighteen sixty-eight and consists of the cyclodipeptide synthase AspA that generates cyclo-L-tryptophan-L-proline, also termed brevianamide F. The cytochrome P four fifty AspB subsequently forms the N one- C seven'-linked dimer termed aspergilazine A (Figure one A). Cytochrome P four fiftys that share a very high degree of sequence identity to AspB have been found to catalyze different modes of cyclo-L-tryptophan-L-proline dimerization, including the C three-C six' and intramolecular C-N linkage of naseseazine C by NascB. Another recently discovered cytochrome P four fifty NzeB was found to have more relaxed regio- and stereo- specificity to form mixtures of both aspergilazine A and naseseazine C. The divergent chemoselectivity of cytochrome P four fifty dimerases provides an attractive alternative to synthetic routes for late-stage functionalization, particularly for the assembly of asymmetric diketopiperazine-dimers.\n0fpw | Despite the prevalence of cytochrome P four fifty-catalyzed C-C/C-N bond formation in a number of important natural product biosynthesis pathways, very little is known regarding the enzymatic\ndqn8 | basis for catalyzing a reaction outcome that profoundly differs from the \"oxygen addition\" (e.g., monooxygenation) reactions that have been the subject of intense scrutiny for many decades. Both radical coupling and cationic pathways have been shown to be energetically plausible, and the most commonly invoked mechanism involves a primary oxidation catalyzed by an iron four-oxo pi cation radical intermediate, followed by a secondary oxidation by the resultant iron plus plus-OH compound two. However, direct insight into this process is extremely limited due to the complexity in preparation of the substrates involved (a carrier- protein-linked peptide in the case of glycopeptide antibiotics), direct access to the fleeting intermediates in the catalytic cycle, or both.\ncop0 | In this study, we use a combination of steady-state and transient kinetics, alternative substrate analogs, and single turnover approaches to evaluate the mechanism for C-N bond formation by the cytochrome P four fifty diketopiperazine-dimerase AspB. The data provide kinetic and spectroscopic evidence for the unexpected reactivity of an iron-superoxide intermediate for initiating substrate dimerization to form aspergilazine A. We also demonstrate that this reaction trajectory is generalizable to C-C bond formation catalyzed by NzeB. This catalytic strategy rationalizes the circumnavigation of canonical cytochrome P four fifty ferryl reactivity to promote selective bond formation that may be extended to the biosynthesis of many other natural products.\nlhkq | RESULTS\n82ju | Inverse Steady-State Kinetic Solvent Isotope Effect in AspB-Catalyzed Formation of Aspergilazine A. As very little is known about the mechanism for cytochrome P four fifty-catalyzed oxidative diketopiperazine-dimerization, we sought to explore the basis for C-N bond formation using the diketopiperazine dimerase AspB. In vitro multiple turnover studies with recombinant AspB and a surrogate redox partner system composed of spinach ferredoxin, ferredoxin reductase, and NADPH as a source of reducing equivalents resulted in nearly complete consumption of the cyclo-L-tryptophan-L-proline substrate to form one major product (ninety-eight percent) and minor amount of another product with m/z equals five hundred sixty-five corresponding to a diketopiperazine dimer. The highly chemoselective profile is in good agreement with prior in vivo fermentation experiments by Li et al., which showed that ninety-eight percent of the substrate was converted to aspergilazine A, while the other two percent corresponded to two other diketopiperazine dimers with varying linkages. Thus, we assigned the major product peak as aspergilazine A.",
