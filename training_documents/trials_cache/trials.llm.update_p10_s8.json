In reality this is rarely achieved and some adjustments to the sample size needs to be made to account for this.\n4exe | In this section the implications of these two scenarios will briefly be considered including what adjustments can be made. Note that these adjustments make certain assumptions but provide useful guidance to the number required. In addition, the situation where more patients will be randomised to one group than the other will also be discussed.\n0myz | Eight point one Losses to follow-up\nxh3i | If patients are lost to follow-up for some endpoint then this reduces the effective sample size. For example, if two percent of patients in the UK PACE trial were expected to be lost to follow-up for mortality then the effective sample size of one thousand nine hundred twenty-six would be reduced by two percent.\nsyiw | Suppose the proportion expected to be lost to follow-up is 'Q' then, in order to adjust for this, the total sample size needs to be multiplied by\nkg3t | one divided by one minus Q. For example, the UK PACE trial would need to be increased to\nlvae | one thousand nine hundred twenty-six times one divided by zero point nine eight equals one thousand nine hundred sixty-six.\no9sc | Eight point two Patients who receive the alternative treatment\n121u | In many trials some patients will receive the alternative treatment. The impact of this is to make the groups more similar and therefore potentially reduce the observed treatment effect and therefore power is lost. In order to allow for this a correction formula is given below.\nzh03 | Let Q one equal proportion in group one getting the treatment for group two Let Q two equal proportion in group two getting the treatment for group one\n1mvw | Correction formula: multiply the required sample size by\n6d4s | one minus Q one minus Q two squared\nmqah | For example, suppose in the UK PACE trial:\nxxr8 | One percent of patients randomised to the single chamber group received the dual chamber treatment Two percent of patients randomised to the dual chamber group received the single chamber treatment\nrl4j | The required size equals one minus zero point zero one minus zero point zero two squared one thousand nine hundred twenty-six equals two thousand forty-eight\nvz32 | Alternatively the treatment effect to be detected might already account for the impact of patients receiving the alternative treatment.\nncb0 | Clearly, it is desirable to limit the number of patients who switch treatments and if the percentages become too large then interpretation becomes increasingly difficult. This is particularly important in non-inferiority trials where the aim is to show treatments are similar.\n8mp0 | Eight point three Patients who stop treatment\nxjyk | One simple adaptation to the formula introduced on the previous page relates to placebo controlled trials where a proportion, Q, on the active therapy stop taking their medication. For the purposes of the sample size adjustment, the proportion who stop their placebo medication is less important as the randomised treatment contains no active ingredient expected to affect outcome.\nmt0f | The impact will be to make the active treatment group more similar to the placebo group. The correct formula used is to multiply the sample size by one divided by one minus Q squared.\nawab | As mentioned, certain assumptions are made but the adjustments do provide useful guidance.\nixcc | Eight point four Other adjustments\n8p6h | A trial which randomises patients to two treatment groups of equal size is usually the most efficient design in terms of total numbers required. However, it is sometimes the case that more patients are randomised to one group than the other.\npmgl | Suppose patients are to be randomised to two groups in the ratio R to one. Then the total sample size required for equal numbers needs to be increased as follows:\n90no | Multiply the sample size by\njt0y | R plus one squared divided by four R. For example, in the UK PACE trial, suppose the investigators wanted to randomise patients in the ratio two to one to the dual chamber treatment. The total sample size would need to be increased as follows:\nqb7o | one thousand nine hundred twenty-six times two plus one squared divided by eight equals two thousand one hundred sixty-six. Since the required ratio is two to one, the number required in the dual chamber group would be two thousand one hundred sixty-six times two divided by three equals one thousand four hundred forty-four, and the number required in the single chamber group seven hundred twenty-two.\noae5 | Nine Trials which are too small and other issues\ns0fl | There are a number of important problems associated with trials which are too small. Such trials will be underpowered to detect realistic treatment differences, i.e. increasing the chance of a false negative result. In addition, the observed treatment effects could be far from the true values. These observed effects will also be measured imprecisely.\n43ia | Unfortunately many trials are too small and as a result will be unable to reliably answer clinically meaningful questions. In addition they use valuable resources and it could be considered unethical to expose patients in a trial which has little chance of being able to address a clinically meaningful question.\n3g2y | In addition the results can be misleading and potentially lead to publication bias. Suppose a number of small trials are conducted addressing a similar question. It is likely that some small trials will produce results showing a large, statistically significant effect which might be a chance finding or at best an exaggeration of the truth. The trials showing a significant effect are more likely to be written up and accepted for publication.\ngc7v | Trials which are too small are a hindrance to medical progress but finding adequate numbers of patients is not easy. In addition investigators may be over-optimistic in the ability of a trial to recruit eligible patients and recruitment often takes longer than expected. Therefore a realistic appraisal of resources and potential patient accrual is needed.\nwqfv | However, there are a number of ways in which numbers can be potentially increased.\nj30a | · The trial may need to be conducted as a multi-centre collaboration. Patient accrual will be quicker and more eligible patients available.\n7bdk | · Avoid being too restrictive in respect of the patient entry criteria. This will also have the advantage of making the results more broadly applicable.\nfim0 | · Trials of more than two treatments require more patients so some thought is necessary as to any benefits of including more than two treatment groups. One possible approach would be through the use of a factorial design.\nojro | In this session the main techniques have been covered to calculate sample size when comparing percentages and means for a clinical trial where each individual is randomised. Similar considerations are needed when estimating the required sample size for other measures of effects, e.g. rates which account for varying follow-up times, however a detailed discussion of these formulae is beyond the scope of this module but included in the articles in the references.\nl6t9 | In addition, other sample size considerations are required depending on the trial design, e.g. when the aim is to show one treatment is equivalent or non-inferior to another treatment or when groups or clusters are randomised rather than individuals. These will be discussed in more detail later in the module.\n1ujy | Ten Summary\nqzor | In this session the importance of estimating the required number of patients needed to produce a clinically meaningful result has been discussed. Sample size formulae have been introduced for comparing percentages or proportions and means together with adjustments which can be made under different conditions. More complex formulae exist but give similar results.\n```",
