Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document

  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

5esx | To summarise the available data, insulin in the VTA reduces extra- cellular somatodendritic DA concentrations through increased DA re- uptake, reduces LTD of excitatory inputs, and decreases PPTg-evoked DA release in the NAc.
m5ka | 2.3. Insulin action in the ventral striatum
byu8 | In the NAc, DA-projections target GABA-ergic MSN, which form several subpopulations depending on the expression of D1 or D2 re- ceptors (Soares-Cunha et al., 2019) (see Appendix, Table S1). The ac- tivity of MSNs is modulated by inputs from cholinergic and GABA-ergic interneurons as well as glial cells. All of these different cell types within the NAc express insulin receptors (Cai et al., 2018a; Warner-Schmidt et al., 2012). Hence, insulin can activate a complex signalling pathway in downstream DA target areas independent of its action in the VTA.
76b0 | 2.3.1. Insulin increases DA release and reuptake
zxz6 | Similar to its action on somatodendritic DA release in the VTA, in- sulin increases DAT surface expression and DA reuptake (Patel et al., 2019a; Williams et al., 2007) through PI3K-signalling in the DA termi- nals (Garcia et al., 2005; Patel et al., 2019b). Despite their role in re- uptake, DATs are also known to mediate AMPH-induced DA-efflux through reversed transport. In line with this, insulin has been shown to facilitate AMPH-stimulated DA release mediated by DAT in hypo- insulinemic mice (Williams et al., 2007). In ex-vivo slices of the NAc and the dorsal striatum, Stouffer et al. (2015) demonstrated that insulin increases terminal DA release by acting on cholinergic interneurons. Furthermore, acute insulin administration has been shown to stimulate ATP release from astrocytes, which activates purinergic signalling cas- cades in DA neurons to facilitate DA efflux (Cai et al., 2018a). Due to the dynamic action of insulin on DA outflow and reuptake, the net effect is
xnth | difficult to predict. However, Stouffer et al. (2015) demonstrated that insulin-mediated DA release is higher than DA reuptake suggesting a positive net effect of insulin on extracellular DA concentrations in DA downstream targets. In line with this, systemic intra-peritoneal appli- cation of insulin has been shown to increase DA release in the NAc (30 min after the injection) and the dorsal striatum (80 min after the injection) in a dose-dependent manner (Potter et al., 1999). Likewise, ICV administration increased DA-release and DA content in the striatum (McCaleb and Myers, 1979). More specifically, while insulin application in the striatum has been shown to increase DA release, insulin admin- istration in the VTA induces a long-lasting decrease of DA release in the striatum (Naef et al., 2019). Notably, the insulin release after food intake inhibits excitatory synaptic transmission in the VTA for 3 h - and hence considerably longer that the duration of the postprandial insulin spike itself - (Labouebe et al., 2013b; Liu et al., 2016) likely underlying the long-lasting depression of DA release in the striatum (Naef et al., 2019).

2zmw | Besides, its direct effect on MSN, insulin has been shown to modulate excitatory transmission on MSN in a concentration-dependent manner. While low physiological insulin concentrations increased excitatory
bf9k | Fig. 3. Selected rodent tasks to assess depressive and anxious symptoms: Comprehensive frameworks for the analysis of depressive or anxious behaviour in rodent models are still missing. The currently available screening tools were developed to assess the efficacy of monoaminergic antidepressants. Anhedonia and behavioural despair are classically tested to describe depressive behaviour. Anhedonia- the loss of experiencing pleasure from usually enjoyable/rewarding activities-is operationalized by assessing reward sensitivity to food (sucrose preference test, conditioned place preference test using food stimuli) and non-food related stimuli (female urine sniffing test, intracranial self-stimulation, conditioned place preference using non-food stimuli) and motivational behaviour (sucrose self-administration, progressive ratio schedule). The immobility time when exposed to an unavoidable life-threatening situation (forced swim test, tail suspension test, learned helplessness) characterises behavioural despair. Antidepressants shorten the period of immobility and increase the number of escapes in the learned helplessness task. Anxiety is assessed by the animal's conditioned reaction to painful (shock-probe burying test) and stressful events (restraint stress) or its spon- taneous reaction to a new environment or new stimuli that elicit a conflict between stress avoidance and exploratory drive (elevated zero maze, open field test, novelty suppressed feeding test, light/dark box task).

ibgs | transmission on MSN neurons, high insulin concentrations suppressed excitatory transmission on MSNs (Oginsky and Ferrario, 2019).
colo | In summary, the effect of insulin on terminal DA release in the striatum is dependent on the site of administration. While insulin applied in the striatum increases terminal DA release, insulin applied to the VTA suppresses phasic DA release by inhibiting excitatory inputs.
d6r4 | 2.4. Impact of insulin signalling on reward behaviour in rodents
9mrz | Unsurprisingly, the aforementioned effects of insulin on DA signal- ling within the mesolimbic pathway have been linked to changes in reward-seeking behaviour (see Fig. 3 for a brief description of the rodent tasks). The differential effects of insulin in the DA midbrain and the downstream targets result in different behavioural alterations depend- ing on the site of insulin administration and the homeostatic status (hungry/sated) (see Appendix, Table S2).
pk06 | 2.4.1. The effect of insulin on food approach behavior
7wn9 | Injections of insulin into the VTA decreased food anticipatory behaviour (Labouèbe et al., 2013b) and food approach behaviour in a light-dark box (Liu et al., 2016). Insulin infusions in the VTA as well as in
wcd0 | the NAc reduced regular chow consumption in rodents (Bruijnzeel et al., 2011a; Finnell and Ferrario, 2022a). The insulin action in the VTA is dose and time-dependent. While low doses of insulin (0.005-0.5 mU) do not modulate food intake behaviour, reduced food consumption can only be observed for high insulin levels (5 mU) in the first 24 h after the intervention. Mebel et al. (2012) investigated the influence of hunger and satiety status and demonstrated that 500 nM insulin applied to the VTA did not modulate regular chow feeding in hungry mice within the first four hours, but rather suppressed sweetened high-fat diet intake when applied in sated mice suggesting that insulin primarily suppresses "hedonic feeding" through modulating reward behaviour. Consistent with this, mice lacking insulin receptors in DA neurons had increased food intake, leading to increased body weight and adiposity (Könner et al., 2011).
caos | 2.4.2. Impact of insulin on reward sensitivity
qrvy | In rats fed ad libitum intra-VTA application of low levels of insulin increased the threshold for intracranial self-stimulation suggesting reduced reward sensitivity (Bruijnzeel et al., 2011a). Opioid-stimulated feeding - a model for hedonic feeding - was only suppressed, when in- sulin was applied in the VTA (Figlewicz et al., 2008a, 2008b). Neither insulin application in the NAc nor in the hypothalamic nuclei showed a similar effect suggesting that this effect is specific to the VTA. ICV-insulin application combined with the D2-receptor antagonist raclopride reduced the lick rate in a sucrose-licking task (fixed-ratio), while insulin alone was not sufficient to induce this effect, confirming that insulin action is dependent on DA signalling (Sipols et al., 2000). Both ICV and intra-VTA insulin infusions have been shown to inhibit conditioned place preference to a high-fat diet or sweetened froot loops in a concentration-dependent manner in ad-libitum-fed rodents; again suggesting a reduced reward sensitivity (Figlewicz et al., 2004; Lab- ouèbe et al., 2013b).
pn9j | 2.4.3. Role of insulin in learning and motivation
1pmc | Insulin promotes learning of reward associations (such as nutritive value of food) and consequently forms preferences (Woods et al., 2016): Flavor-nutrient-preference learning in food-restricted and ad-libitum mice is dependent on insulin receptor activation in the nucleus accum- bens. However, Figlewicz et al. (2004) revealed that in ad libitum-fed mice intra-ventricular insulin does not impair learning of the reward value of a high-fat diet. But, intra-ventricular insulin inhibits reward retrieval indicating an effect on motivation (Figlewicz et al., 2004). Finnell and Ferrario (2022b) systematically investigated the differential effect of intranasal insulin application in the core of the nucleus accumbens on cue-triggered food approach and motivation: while cue-triggered food approach remained unchanged by insulin the moti- vation to spend effort for food was reduced after insulin application.
5z6q | For effort spending in progressive ratio tasks, the findings were inconsistent though: While (Labouèbe et al., 2013b) and Figlewicz et al. (2008a) reported no effect after intra-VTA and intra-NAc insulin appli- cation, others found reduced motivation after intra-NAc and ICV administration (Figlewicz et al., 2006; Finnell and Ferrario, 2022a). Findings from ICV-application have to be interpreted with caution, as the insulin effects cannot be attributed to specific brain areas or neuron populations. Here, insulin can either act directly on DA-circuitry or indirectly through other insulin receptive brain areas (e.g. hypothala- mus) that modulate DA-signalling through multisynaptic connections. Moreover, it is important to note that most of the rodent studies used food stimuli to assess reward sensitivity, learning, and motivation. This is simply due to the fact that food stimuli are well-established in rodent assays and are easy to apply. However, Bruijnzeel et al. (2011b) lever- aged an intracranial self-stimulation protocol and demonstrated a reward-suppressing effect, indicating that the action of insulin on the brain's DA system has implications far beyond food intake and meta- bolic regulation. These findings demonstrate conclusively that insulin has a reward-suppressing impact via its action on midbrain DA neurons,

b8hf | primarily under conditions of satiety. However, more research is required to delineate the receptors /cell subtypes involved and the different forms of rewarding stimuli such as drugs and social/sexual stimuli that are affected.
hntf | 2.5. Impact of insulin on reward behaviour in humans
99fo | Recent human research has provided additional evidence for the insulin-mediated downregulation of reward-related processing (see Appendix, Tables 7-10). In humans, brain function is generally assessed using fMRI, which provides a surrogate marker for neuronal and glial activity through quantifying blood hemoglobin oxygenation (Ogawa et al., 1990). The standard procedure to study central insulin effects in humans is through intranasal insulin application, which enters the nasal mucosa and is transported to the CNS via diffusion and trans-neuronal transport via olfactory and trigeminal pathways bypassing the blood-brain barrier (Dhuria et al., 2010). The exact tem- poral dynamics of insulin's effect on neuronal signalling are unclear, however, there is increasing evidence that the main effect is achieved after 30 min in a dose-dependent manner (Born et al., 2002; Edwin Thanarajah et al., 2019; Kullmann et al., 2018).
y5r7 | 2.5.1. Effect of intranasal insulin on mesocorticolimbic connectivity
lrry | Studies using fMRI have shown that intranasal insulin reduces not only the ratings of food palatability but also modulates the connectivity between the VTA and the NAc (Tiedemann et al., 2017), as well as the functional connectivity between the VTA and the ventromedial pre- frontal cortex (Edwin Thanarajah et al., 2019). These findings align with several studies that reported alterations in regional activity and con- nectivity patterns of the reward circuitry after intranasal insulin appli- cation (Heni et al., 2012; Kullmann et al., 2012, 2018). These connectivity changes have been related to peripheral insulin sensitivity and measures of eating behaviour (Heni et al., 2012; Kullmann et al., 2015). Kullmann et al. (2021) performed a combined fMRI and PET study using the D2/D3-receptor ligand [11 C]-raclopride and directly assessed brain DA-signalling. They discovered that intranasal insulin decreased DA transmission in the ventral and dorsal striatum. Interest- ingly, insulin-induced effects in PET imaging were related to functional connectivity changes detected with fMRI 45 min after intranasal insulin intervention indicating that signal alterations, we observe in fMRI are indeed related to DA signalling.
hvhm | 2.5.2. Effect of insulin on food preference
863b | Tiedemann et al. (2017) reported that after an overnight fast, blood insulin levels predicted food preference in insulin-sensitive participants: Higher blood insulin levels were associated with lower food liking. This suppressing effect was also evident after intranasal insulin application. In insulin-resistant participants, this association between food prefer- ence and blood insulin as well as central insulin was not detectable. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of intranasal insulin on food prefer- ence seems to be sex-dependent: While in normal-weight men, insulin reduced food preference and food intake in the hungry state (Benedict et al., 2008), this effect was not evident in women neither in pre- nor postmenopausal stage (Benedict et al., 2008; Krug et al., 2010). In contrast, insulin reduced post-prandial snacking and food cravings in women (Hallschmid et al., 2012a). In line, the neuronal processing of food cues after intranasal insulin application has been demonstrated to depend on body weight and sex (Wagner et al., 2022).
fj24 | 2.5.3. Effect of insulin on motivation
uz3c | The effect of insulin is not limited to food rewards. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1), which has an insulin-enhancing effect, modulates incentive motivation for both food and money (Hanssen et al., 2021). Of course, this effect is not solely attributable to insulin, since GLP1 has direct effects on DA neurons. Furthermore, food intake (elevating insulin levels among other factors) has been shown to reduce susceptibility to
