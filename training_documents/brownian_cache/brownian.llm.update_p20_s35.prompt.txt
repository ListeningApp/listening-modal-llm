You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ep8e | The Effective Action (EA) I allows one to derive ef- fective equations of motion (EEOMs) for the average po- sition <LATEX>\chi \left( t \right) \equiv \langle x \left( t \right) \rangle</LATEX> and variance <LATEX>\langle x ^ { 2 } \left( t \right) \rangle</LATEX> in an analogous manner to the classical equations of motion, by taking variational derivatives. We used the LPA and WFR to compute the elements entering the EEOM, for instance the dynamical effective potential. We verified the accu- racy of the equilibrium limit to these equations, further emphasising the physical significance of certain aspects of the effective potential <LATEX>V _ { k = 0 } :</LATEX> namely how the mini- mum of <LATEX>V _ { k = 0 }</LATEX> corresponds to the equilibrium position and its second derivative evaluated at this point to the vari- ance through equation (128). We noted here that while the LPA reproduces these equilibrium quantities, the ac- curacy of covariance's temporal evolution diminished as temperature was lowered.
7mv3 | Going beyond equilibrium, we examined how LPA+WFR handle relaxation towards it for the
der6 | average position x(t) in potentials such as a polynomial, a doublewell comprised of two LJ type interactions, or a bare x2 plus gaussian bumps. The latter potential clearly demonstrates that the fRG is capable of capturing the effect of the non-trivial local features of this potential. In fact, the fRG could still offer reasonable approximations even in those cases where the Fokker-Planck numerics failed to converge. We have also shown how the fRG can closely match the relaxation of the variance (x2(t)) to its equilibrium value: for both the unequal Lennard-Jones type potential and the x2 plus gaussian bumps, the LPA variance has reasonable accuracy and still cap- tures highly non-trivial behaviour such as the variance overshooting its equilibrium value before settling to it. This is in a system where numerically solving the Fokker-Planck equation failed to provide good results, at least using standard methods. Again, we find that accuracy decreases with decreasing temperature.
8xg2 | A clear conclusion that can be drawn from the above investigations is that decreasing the temperature nega- tively impacts the accuracy of using the LPA + WFR derivative expansion for the fRG to describe Brownian motion in the potentials we examined. This appears to correlate with the increasing importance at lower tem- peratures of higher order terms in the spectral expan- sion; indeed, it is expected that the lowest order terms in the derivative expansion (LPA + WFR) are best placed to describe evolution dominated by the lowest non-zero eigenvalues of the Fokker-Planck spectral expansion. It would seem that the derivative expansion of the fRG for studying thermal fluctuations has utility in the range from moderate temperatures (roughly when the classi- cal force is comparable to the noise), up to the very high temperature regime where the small local features of the potential become less relevant.
njvp | Although our conclusions on the temperature depen- dent relation between the spectral expansion and the derivative expansion of the fRG are suggestive, and rea- sonable given the premise of the latter, a more precise quantitative comparison would be called for and should be addressed in future work. The insights gained from a more detailed, quantitative understanding of the fRG's range of validity when applied to the dynamical studies of thermally driven systems may lead to interesting and im- portant applications. There are also issues relevant to the technicalities of applying the fRG programme and which may lead to better convergence properties. For example, the recent findings of [47, 48] suggest that an appropri- ately optimized regulator, which also excludes the regime w > k from contributing to the flow, can ensure good con- vergence properties and a sizeable radius of convergence. Comparisons with [47, 48] are non-trivial because the su- persymmetry of the Brownian motion problem makes the structure of the flow equations different to that of a sim- ple scalar theory. This is an important question to be resolved however and we hope to return to it in future work.
s8b5 | Future work could also examine if higher order approx-
p450 | imations beyond the WFR offer any advantage, as these might better capture higher order terms in a spectral ex- pansion. One could further investigate an ensemble of initial conditions and try to quantify better the compu- tational time gain the fRG offers. It is worthwhile trying to see if there is a more concrete way to determine a priori which systems will be well described by the fRG before having to compare to numerical simulations or do- ing a spectral expansion analysis. An interesting appli- cation that we didn't touch upon here might be thermal barrier escape, which in this formulation seems to be more akin to tunnelling in the corresponding euclidean quantum mechanics [49-51]; it would indeed be interest- ing to flesh out any analogies, if they exist. Most im- portantly, further understanding the application of fRG techniques to stochastically driven systems may allow ex- tension to systems with more degrees of freedom, such as field theories and/or systems with a large number of particles. Advances in the above directions may lead to progress in theoretically tackling a broad range of physi- cal phenomena with large separation between fundamen- tal timescales of thermal fluctuations and long emergent timescales of macroscopic change, addressing what is now a major barrier for predictive simulations across scien- tific and engineering disciplines including materials sci- ence [52], drug design [53], protein folding [54], and cos- mology.
