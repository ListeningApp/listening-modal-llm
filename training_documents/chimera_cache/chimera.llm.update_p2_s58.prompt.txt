You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

7w7j | Operator parallelism is a solution to train large models by parti- tioning the operators of a layer among multiple workers, but it may suffer from high communication volume as discussed in Section 1. Hybrid approaches [29, 30], which combine operator parallelism with data parallelism, suffer from the similar problem to the pure operator parallelism.
51vd | To reduce the communication volume of operator parallelism, pipeline parallelism is intensively studied [16, 19, 26, 28, 38, 39, 55, 57]. The key idea is to partition the model in a layer-wise way and treat each worker (and the layers on it) as a pipeline stage. The mini-batch is partitioned into multiple micro-batches, that are pipelined across the stages to increase the resources utilization. Recent work [16, 28, 39] also shows improved performance when combining pipeline parallelism with data parallelism. However, to efficiently pipeline deep neural network training is challenging because of (1) a training step contains one one forward pass fol- lowed by one backward pass, (2) the gradient computation in the backward pass rely on the intermediate results of the forward pass, and (3) to achieve good convergence accuracy the mini-batch size is usually not very large.
baj1 | Bubbles in the pipeline. For better convergence quality, synchro- nous approaches synchronize the gradients and flush the pipeline
n1wo | at the end of each training iteration, as shown in Figure 2. There- fore, synchronous approaches lead to pipeline bubbles. To utilize the pipeline, GPipe [26] injects N micro-batches into the pipeline concurrently; DAPPLE [16] uses the One-Forward-One-Backward (1F1B [38, 39]) schedule with periodic flushes. Both GPipe and DAP- PLE incur 2(D-1) bubbles (i.e., D-1 bubbles in the forward passes and D-1 bubbles in the backward passes). In contrast, Chimera (this work) incurs D-2 bubbles (i.e., D/2-1 bubbles in the forward passes and D/2-1 bubbles in the backward passes), which is about 50% reduction compared with DAPPLE and GPipe. We define the bubble ratio as the bubble overhead divided by the overall runtime of the pipeline. In practice, the workload of a backward pass is about two times of a forward pass, which leads to D/2-1 bubbles in the mid- dle of the pipeline for Chimera (bubble ratio = (D-2)/(3N/2+D-2)), as shown in Figure 2. We will discuss how to remove the middle bubbles in Section 3.5 (bubble ratio = (D-2)/(2N+D-2)).
5bq3 | GEMS [28] is a memory-efficient pipeline approach which sched- ules micro-batches among two model replicas. Since GEMS is mainly designed for small B and has at most two active micro-batches at
ezla | the same time, its bubble ratio is much higher than the other ap- proaches and cannot be alleviated by a larger N. Asynchronous approaches (such as PipeDream [38] and PipeDream-2BW [39]) do not have periodic pipeline flushes, so they do not have bubble problem but with stale weights.
rsbu | Memory consumption. Memory overhead mainly comes from two aspects: the weight parameters and the activations (the inter- mediate results of the forward pass required in the backward pass to compute gradients). For GPipe and DAPPLE, each worker maintains the weights of one pipeline stage. For GEMS and Chimera (with the default setting), each worker maintains the weights of two pipeline stages since there are two pipelines in two directions. PipeDream updates the model after each backward pass on a micro-batch (N=1); therefore, to ensure weight version consistency between forward and backward passes, it requires to stash up to D versions of weights on a worker, which has the same memory cost as pure data paral- lelism. By using gradient accumulation (N>=D), PipeDream-2BW reduces the number of weight versions to be stashed to 2.
