Cyclooxygenases one and two inhibition and analgesic efficacy of dipyrone at different doses or meloxicam in cats after ovariohysterectomy


## Abstract

Objective To evaluate the cyclooxygenases inhibition, adverse effects and analgesic efficacy of dipyrone or meloxicam in cats undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy.

Study design Prospective, blinded, randomized, clinical study.

Animals A total of thirty healthy young cats.

Methods The cats were randomly assigned to three postoperative groups: D twenty-five (dipyrone twenty-five milligrams per kilogram every twenty-four hours), D twelve point five (dipyrone twelve point five milligrams per kilogram every twelve hours) and M (meloxicam zero point one milligrams per kilogram every twenty-four hours). In the first twenty-four hours, the drugs were administered intravenously, and then orally for six (dipyrone) or three days (meloxicam). Prostanoids thromboxane B two and prostaglandin E two concentrations served as indicators of COX activity and, with physiological variables and pain and sedation scores, were measured for twenty-four hours after first analgesic administration. Rescue analgesia (tramadol, two milligrams per kilogram intravenously) was provided if Glasgow feline composite measure pain scale greater than or equal to five. Laboratory tests included symmetric dimethylarginine and adverse effects were evaluated regularly up to seven and ten days after surgery, respectively. Parametric and nonparametric data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests, respectively (P less than zero point zero five).

Results In the first half hour after analgesic administration, COX-one activity was close to zero and remained significantly lower than before drug administration for twenty-four hours in all groups. The inhibition of COX-two activity was significant for thirty minutes in all groups and up to four hours in group M. No alterations in laboratory tests or significant adverse effects were observed. Pain scores and need for rescue analgesia did not differ statistically among groups.

Conclusions Dipyrone at both doses and meloxicam provided a nonselective inhibition of COX-one and two activities and effective analgesia without causing significant adverse effects or laboratory tests alterations.

Clinical relevance Dipyrone at both doses provides equally effective analgesia without causing adverse effects in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy.


## Introduction

Dipyrone, also known as metamizole, is a drug used in some European and Latin American countries for its analgesic, antipyretic and spasmolytic effects. Although introduced in pharmacotherapy in nineteen twenty-two, the mechanism of action is not yet completely understood. Previous studies have reported its action on different receptors: stimulation of the arginine-NO-cGMP pathway; central action through inhibition of cyclooxygenase-three; endogenous opioid system; inhibition of COX-one and COX-two and endogenous cannabinoid system.

Dipyrone may be a safe choice compared with opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, dipyrone has been withdrawn from the market in several countries because it has been associated with agranulocytosis in humans. Studies investigating this association are heterogeneous and some results carry significant biases, such as small sample size, presence of comorbidities and the combination of dipyrone with other drugs. The estimated mortality from agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, anaphylaxis and gastrointestinal complications after short-term dipyrone use is reported as similar to that of paracetamol and lower than that of diclofenac and aspirin.

In veterinary medicine, literature on this drug is sparse. Pharmacokinetics studies of dipyrone (twenty-five milligrams per kilogram) administered by various routes in cats and dogs have been published. Clinical studies have demonstrated analgesia efficacy from dipyrone in several scenarios in dogs. Only one published study was identified that used dipyrone for pain management in cats. In that study, dipyrone (twenty-five milligrams per kilogram every twenty-four, twelve or eight hours for five days) combined with tramadol (two milligrams per kilogram every eight hours) administered intravenously after ovariohysterectomy provided effective postoperative pain management with no significant adverse effects, biochemical alterations or erythrocyte oxidation.

In domestic animals, there are no reports of significant adverse effects or laboratory tests alterations associated with dipyrone, and a study reported no renal, hepatic, bleeding time or bone marrow function alterations in dogs. Regarding gastrointestinal effects, no pathological changes in the gastrointestinal tract of control rats or rats with preexisting induced gastric ulcers were observed after dipyrone administration. In addition, there are reports of increases in gastric mucus and gastric prostaglandin E two and less gastric prostaglandin E two reduction than from piroxicam or celecoxib. However, the mechanisms of a protective effect by dipyrone on the gastric mucosa are still unclear.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dipyrone on COX-one and COX-two activities, to assess postoperative pain in cats undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy after intravenous administration of dipyrone or meloxicam during the first twenty-four hours and to identify any adverse effects occurring in seven or four days after surgery with dipyrone or meloxicam, respectively. Our hypothesis was that dipyrone may inhibit COX with few adverse effects and provide postoperative analgesia similar to meloxicam.


## Materials and methods

Experimental design

This prospective, randomized, blinded, controlled study was conducted at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the School of

Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of São Paulo, Brazil. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee and a written informed consent was obtained from the owners before inclusion of the animals.


## Animals

A total of thirty female domestic cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy were studied. All animals were deemed healthy and with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status one based on medical history, physical examination, complete blood count and serum chemistry tests. Acclimatization occurred in two visits at the hospital before the beginning of the study, when animals were also introduced to the environment, cage, observers and sedation and pain assessment tools. Exclusion criteria included excessive fear or aggressiveness, signs of pre-existing pain, pregnancy, underlying diseases and recent use of anti-inflammatory drugs.


## Anesthesia

Cats were administered acepromazine (zero point one milligrams per kilogram; Acepran zero point two percent; Vetnil Indústria Comércio Produtos Veterinários Ltda, SP, Brazil) intramuscularly as premedication. After fifteen minutes, a twenty-two gauge catheter (Angiocath; Becton Dickinson, SP, Brazil) was placed in a cephalic vein and anesthesia was induced with IV propofol (five-eight milligrams per kilogram; Propovan; Cristália Produtos Químicos e Farmacêuticos Ltda, SP, Brazil); maintenance was accomplished with isoflurane (Isoflorane; Cristália Produtos Químicos e Farmacêuticos Ltda) in sixty-seventy percent oxygen (air-oxygen mixture) administered through a rebreathing circuit. Pressure-controlled ventilation (Anesthesia Machine Inter Linea A; Intermed, SP, Brazil) was instituted with a peak inspiratory pressure of seven-eight centimeters of water, tidal volume eight milliliters per kilogram, inspiratory:expiratory ratio of one to two, and positive end-tidal expiratory pressure one centimeter of water. The respiratory rate was adjusted to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure within thirty-forty millimeters of mercury (five point zero-six point zero kiloPascals). End-tidal isoflurane concentration and inspired oxygen concentration were measured using a side stream gas analyzer (POET IQ2; Criticare Technologies Inc., WI, USA). Heart rate, rhythm (DX twenty twenty multiparametric monitor; Dixtal Biomédica Indústria e Comércio Ltda, SP, Brazil) and Doppler systolic arterial pressure (Doppler eight eleven B; Parks Medical Electronics, OR, USA) were monitored during the entire procedure. Intraoperative IV fluid therapy was lactated Ringer's solution (three milliliters per kilogram per hour).

A remifentanil constant rate infusion (CRI; zero point two micrograms per kilogram per minute; Ultiva two milligrams; GlaxoSmithKline Brasil Ltda, RJ, Brazil) was administered IV with a syringe driver (ST six seventy syringe pump; Samtronic, SP, Brazil) starting after induction of anesthesia and finishing during abdominal closure. If systolic arterial pressure and/or heart rate increased or decreased by greater than fifteen percent of values immediately before skin incision, remifentanil CRI was increased or decreased, respectively, by zero point one micrograms per kilogram per minute.

Cats were randomly assigned by an online random sequence generator to one of three groups, ten cats in each. At ten minutes before the end of the remifentanil CRI, during skin closure, cats were administered IV analgesics according to the assigned group: group D twenty-five, dipyrone (twenty-five milligrams per kilogram every twenty-four hours; D five hundred; Zoetis Inc., SP, Brazil); group D twelve point five, dipyrone (twelve point five milligrams per kilogram every twelve hours); or group M, meloxicam (zero point one milligrams per kilogram every twenty-four hours; Maxicam zero point two percent; Ouro Fino Saúde Animal, SP, Brazil). The drugs were diluted in zero point nine percent saline solution to a final volume of zero point five milliliters for each group. A collaborator prepared the injections so that the evaluator would be unaware of the group assignment. In the first twenty-four hours after anesthesia, the drugs were administered IV. At hospital discharge, the clients were directed to administer the same drug orally for six days (dipyrone) or three days (meloxicam).

All the procedures were performed by a single anesthesiologist (LAG) and a single senior surgeon (JMM) with an assistant using a standardized surgical protocol.


## Measurement of ex vivo COX activity

Ex vivo COX-one and COX-two activities were determined by measuring concentrations of their major enzymatic products, thromboxane B2 and PGE2, respectively, according to an adaptation of a previously described technique. Blood samples (two milliliters) were drawn from the cephalic vein catheter of six randomly selected cats per group and were transferred to a heparin tube and a glass tube at the following time points: immediately before the first analgesic administration and at thirty minutes, four and twenty-four hours. At twenty-four hours, blood was collected before the next drug administration.

For thromboxane B2 analysis, immediately after collection, one milliliter of whole blood in the glass tube was incubated at thirty-seven degrees Celsius for one hour. Afterwards, the blood was centrifuged at three thousand g for five minutes at four degrees Celsius and one hundred microliters of the supernatant plasma was harvested, added to four hundred microliters of methanol and homogenized. This solution was then centrifuged at six thousand g for ten minutes and stored at negative eighty degrees Celsius until COX-one activity was determined by means of a technique previously described.

For ex vivo COX-two activity, heparinized blood (one milliliter) was immediately transferred into two one point five milliliter polypropylene tubes (five hundred microliters each). One tube contained ten microliters of lipopolysaccharide isolated from Escherichia coli in zero point one percent bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffered saline solution. The second tube contained ten microliters of phosphate buffered saline and was used as the negative control sample. Samples were then incubated at thirty-seven degrees Celsius for twenty-four hours. Afterwards, samples were centrifuged at two thousand g for five minutes at eighteen degrees Celsius, one hundred microliters of plasma were added to four hundred microliters of methanol and homogenized. This solution was then centrifuged at six thousand g for ten minutes at eighteen degrees Celsius; supernatant was harvested and stored at negative eighty degrees Celsius until the time of PGE2 concentration analysis.

All tests were performed in duplicate and the quantification of thromboxane B2 and PGE2 concentrations were performed with commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Thromboxane B2 ELISA kit and PGE2 ELISA kit monoclonal; Cayman Chemical, MI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.


## Laboratory tests

Blood samples, two milliliters, were collected for measurement of hepatic function tests, alanine transaminase; alkaline phosphatase; aspartate aminotransferase; gamma-glutamyltransferase; serum albumin and total protein, and renal function tests, creatinine; urea, seven days before and seven days after anesthesia. Symmetric dimethylarginine concentration was also measured at seven days before, twenty-four hours and seven days after anesthesia in samples from all cats used in the COX inhibition evaluation.


## Adverse effects

Adverse effects and short-term postoperative complications were monitored in the twenty-four hours after first analgesic administration and reassessed on postoperative days seven and ten, suture removal. Through daily telephone contact, the owners were asked about their cats' general condition, presence of emesis, sialorrhea, diarrhea, changes in food and water intake, abnormal behavior and general aspect of the surgical wound.


## Physiological variables

Measurements of heart rate, respiratory frequency, rectal temperature and blood glucose concentration were obtained immediately before the premedication, baseline, and one, two, four, eight, twelve and twenty-four hours after first analgesic administration.


## Pain and sedation assessment

Pain and sedation were evaluated at the same time points as the physiological variables. Subjective pain scores were obtained from four pain scales; the visual analogue scale, Colorado State University feline acute pain scale in English, U N E S P-Botucatu multidimensional composite pain scale for assessing postoperative pain in cats in Portuguese, Brondani et al. two thousand twelve, and Glasgow feline composite measure pain scale, Reid et al. two thousand seventeen. Sedation was evaluated using a scale, zero to three, no effect, mild, moderate and severe, adapted from Valverde et al. two thousand four.


## Rescue analgesia

Rescue medication tramadol hydrochloride, two milligrams per kilogram Cro, nidor two percent; Agener União Saúde Animal, S P, Brazil, was administered I V if C M P S-Feline scores were greater than or equal to five. Additional tramadol, one milligram per kilogram I V, could be administered if analgesia was inadequate after thirty minutes. The person that performed pain assessment was unaware of the drug administered. Cats administered rescue medication were reassessed thirty minutes after tramadol administration and up to twenty-four hours; however, the physiological variables data, pain and sedation scores recorded after rescue analgesia were excluded from the analysis.


## Statistical analysis

A sample size calculation was performed for ex vivo COX activity and pain assessment; need for rescue analgesia of seventy percent and twenty percent of dogs submitted to ovariohysterectomy and I V administration of fifteen or twenty-five milligrams per kilogram of dipyrone, respectively.

Data are expressed as mean plus or minus standard deviation, parametric variables, or median, range, nonparametric variables, as appropriate. The data were tested for normality using a D'Agostino-Pearson test. A two-way analysis of variance was used to evaluate parametric data and a Kruskal-Wallis test was applied on nonparametric data. Post hoc analysis was performed with Tukey or Dunn tests to identify differences among time points and groups. The Spearman's rank correlation between pain scales was evaluated. The number of cats that required rescue analgesia was compared among groups using the Fisher exact probability test. Statistical significance was attributed if P is less than zero point zero five. Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Version seven point zero three.


## Results

A total of thirty-seven cats were initially selected for participating in the study. Overall, four cats were excluded because of non-compliant preoperative behavior and three cats were excluded because of pregnancy. Groups D twenty-five, D twelve point five and M did not differ significantly regarding body weight, two point seven plus or minus zero point five; two point seven plus or minus zero point four; two point seven plus or minus zero point five kilograms, respectively, age, thirteen plus or minus five; twelve plus or minus nine; fifteen plus or minus thirteen months, respectively, and surgical time, twenty-eight plus or minus six; twenty-five point four; thirty-four minutes, respectively.

Before analgesic drug administration, TX B two concentrations were not different among groups. After drug administration, concentrations were decreased at all time points in all groups P is less than point zero zero zero one; Figure one. However, there was a highly significant increase between zero point five and four hours in M P equals zero point zero zero zero four. TX B two concentrations were higher in M than D twelve point five and D twenty-five at four hours P equals zero point zero zero three and P is less than point zero zero zero one, respectively, and at twenty-four hours P equals zero point zero zero seven and P equals zero point zero one one, respectively.

P G E two concentrations did not differ among groups before drug administration. At four hours, P G E two concentration was higher in D twenty-five than in M P equals zero point zero four eight; Figure one. P G E two concentration had decreased in D twelve point five at zero point five hour P equals zero point zero zero zero one and four hours P equals zero point zero one one; in D twenty-five at zero point five hour P is less than zero point zero zero zero one, four hours P equals zero point zero zero zero one and twenty-four hours P equals zero point zero zero zero four; and in M at zero point five and four hours P equals zero point zero zero two and P equals zero point zero zero seven, respectively.

There were no significant differences regarding laboratory test results, except for SDMA. When compared with SD before anesthesia, SDMA concentration was lower at twenty-four hours in M P equals zero point zero one two two and higher at seven days postoperatively than at twenty-four hours in D twenty-five and M P equals zero point zero three eight and P equals zero point zero two six, respectively; Figure two. There were no significant differences among groups. A high SDMA concentration fifteen micrograms per deciliter was measured in a single cat in M at seven days.

Sialorrhea was observed in all cats administered dipyrone drops orally at home. No emesis or alterations in food and water intake were observed.

The respiratory frequency was not significantly different postoperatively among groups or time points (Table one). Heart rate did not differ among groups, but was increased at one hour compared with baseline in M P equals zero point zero three three; Table one. Rectal temperature was decreased one hour after anesthesia compared with baseline in all groups. Blood glucose concentrations were not different among groups, but were higher than hours in D twenty-five P equals zero point zero one eight and at one hour in M P equals zero point zero two zero; Table one. Pain scores did not differ significantly among groups; however, VAS scores were significantly higher than baseline in D twelve point five at four hours P equals zero point zero four one five; Figure three. A correlation between pain scales indicated a moderate VAS times MCPS R equals zero point four five three six, strong CSU-FAPS times MCPS: R equals zero point six six three four VAS times CMPS-F; R equals zero point seven zero two one MCPS times CMPS-F; R equals zero point seven one five two or very strong association VAS times CSU-FAPS; R equals zero point eight three one three. Sedation numbers were increased at one hour after first analgesic administration in all groups P is less than zero point zero zero zero one; Table two. There were no significant differences among groups regarding the need for rescue analgesia, even though the time of administration differed among groups (Table three). A total of eight cats required a single tramadol administration; four, two and two in groups D twenty-five, D twelve point five and M, respectively.


## Discussion

Surprisingly, dipyrone at both doses inhibited COX-one and COX-two for twenty-four hours and zero point five hour, respectively, in cats. However, no

significant adverse effects and alterations in laboratory tests were observed throughout the study. In addition, dipyrone was as effective as meloxicam for postoperative analgesia.

During the literature search, no previous papers evaluating the effect of dipyrone on COX activity in cats were found. This study was based on the one performed by Duz et al., which described this technique in horses.

The administration of the drugs led to an inhibition of COX-one activity, as observed by the plasma TXB two concentration decrease. These results corroborate previous studies on the use of dipyrone in other species and meloxicam in other species and in cats.

The COX-one activity inhibition was greater at both dipyrone doses than meloxicam from four hours on. Even though this inhibition is similar to that caused by nonselective NSAIDs, dipyrone was not associated with any adverse effects commonly observed with NSAIDs. A multicentric study of humans reported higher gastrointestinal safety with dipyrone than classical NSAIDs and its low acidity may be responsible for the favorable gastrointestinal tolerance.

Despite the significant COX-one inhibition seen in this study, no postoperative bleeding was observed in any cat. In a similar study in dogs, a single dose of dipyrone twenty-five milligrams per kilogram I V alone or in combination with meloxicam zero point two milligrams per kilogram I V inhibited platelet aggregation for three and five hours, respectively, with no alterations in thromboelastometry and buccal mucosal bleeding time.

The ex vivo evaluation of COX-two activity inhibition showed that it occurred in all groups, similar to results from studies in other species. At zero point five hour, PGE two concentrations had decreased significantly in all groups, lasting longer four hours in group M.

In the present study, both dipyrone doses strongly inhibited both COX isoforms in a nonselective way; COX-one inhibition was greater and longer lasting than that of COX-two. The COX

selectivity ratio was not calculated because ex vivo assays cannot be used for these estimates. Hinz et al. observed that four-methylamino antipyrine, an active metabolite of dipyrone, led to a substantial COX inhibition of both isoforms equally.

Meloxicam also inhibited both COX isoenzymes, however inhibition of COX-one by meloxicam was less intense than from dipyrone, whereas COX-two inhibition was longer lasting. Previous studies, including assays of canine and feline whole blood after administration of meloxicam, identified only a slight COX-two selectivity COX-one to COX-two ratio of ten and three point five, respectively. Blood collected from ten cats revealed that meloxicam inhibited COX-one by at least twenty percent at minimal plasma concentrations and exceeded forty percent at therapeutic plasma concentrations. These results are similar to those in the present study.

Despite the nonselective COX-two inhibition, the drugs and dosages administered in the present study resulted in no adverse effects or alterations in laboratory tests throughout the evaluation period. In group M, serum SDMA concentrations decreased at twenty-four hours compared with seven days before and seven days after anesthesia. In group D twenty-five, they were significantly lower at twenty-four hours compared with seven days postoperatively. However, the changes showed a similar pattern in all groups, and the values did not exceed the feline normal reference interval (zero to fourteen micrograms per deciliter). These results suggest that glomerular filtration rate increased after the surgical procedure, probably influenced by intra-operative fluid therapy. There were no differences among

groups in concentrations of SDMA, however, one cat in M presented a high value (fifteen micrograms per deciliter) at seven days postoperatively.

Pain is a vital sign that has a complex pathophysiology. Sensitization of nociceptors or hyperalgesia is a common finding in inflammatory pain and is a consequence of the action of inflammatory mediators such as PGE two. These mediators lower the threshold of excitability of receptors, facilitating the activity of notoriously painful substances, such as histamine and bradykinin. NSAIDs, such as meloxicam, have a proven analgesic potential related to COX inhibition, decreasing the production of PGE two in cats.

Although dipyrone is not a new drug, the mechanism of action is complex and not yet completely understood. Based on studies in other species, it was hypothesized that effects of dipyrone depend at least partially on COX inhibition and consequently on the reduction in PGE two synthesis peripherally. Our findings corroborate these data; however, it is likely that dipyrone also produces analgesia through other mechanisms in cats. Chandrasekharan et al. reported the existence of a splicing variant of COX-one, referred to as COX-three, and suggested that dipyrone selectively inhibits this enzyme. However, that in vitro study used constructs of canine COX-three and murine COX-one and COX-two with disparate activity levels, leading to uncertainties and controversies. In addition, there is no evidence regarding the presence, physiological role and dipyrone selectivity for COX-three in the feline species.

Pain scores did not differ significantly among groups, indicating that all analgesic protocols were effective in controlling

ovariohysterectomy postoperative pain. Although monotherapy with dipyrone or an NSAID is indicated for mild pain only, an experienced surgeon performing ovariohysterectomy in young animals with an ideal body condition score may produce less surgical trauma and thus mild pain, corroborating the findings of previous studies.

To find the lowest effective analgesic dose yielding the least adverse effects, a low dose (twelve point five milligrams per kilogram) was tested and compared with the commonly used dose for dogs and cats. There were no significant differences among groups regarding the need for rescue analgesia (forty percent, twenty percent and twenty percent in D twenty-five, D twelve point five and M, respectively), similar to a study in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy administered either dipyrone, meloxicam or a combination of these drugs. The administration of tramadol as rescue analgesia was adequate to reduce scores in all pain scales in the present study.

The four subjective pain scales were used to measure postoperative pain more precisely and to analyze correlations among them. All cats requiring rescue analgesia were assigned scores above the cut-off value for rescue in all scales and a moderate (VAS by MCPS) to very strong (VAS by CSU-FAPS) correlation among them was found. A strong association between validated scales, MCPS and CMPS-FS scores, was observed, corroborating the findings of Steagall et al. However, only VAS displayed a significant difference between baseline and four hours, when two cats in group D twelve point five needed rescue analgesia.

This study had limitations. First, because the surgical procedure was performed by an experienced surgeon, results may not be extrapolated for the same surgery performed under different conditions including less experience and longer duration of anesthesia. Second, the twenty-hour interval between blood collection for ex vivo COX activity analysis may have missed some information, such as the exact duration of the COX-2 inhibition by meloxicam. Third, meloxicam was prescribed for only four days postoperatively, whereas dipyrone was prescribed for seven days. The duration of drug administration followed our standard meloxicam protocol for management of postoperative ovariohysterectomy pain in cats and the main objective of this study was to evaluate the short-term effects of dipyrone.


## Conclusion

In the present study, dipyrone (twelve point five and twenty-five milligrams per kilogram for seven days) and meloxicam (zero point one milligrams per kilogram for four days) were administered after ovariohysterectomy in cats. The results indicated adequate analgesia provided by all protocols and that both dipyrone regimens were equally effective. Unexpectedly, both dipyrone doses strongly inhibited COX-1 and COX-2. Laboratory tests of CBC and hepatic and renal function were unchanged and no significant adverse effects were observed. Further trials are indicated to study the mechanism of action of dipyrone and the anti-inflammatory effect of this drug.
