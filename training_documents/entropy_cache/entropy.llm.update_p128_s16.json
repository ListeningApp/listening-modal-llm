Using Puzzle fifty-seven, conclude that the expected value of E as a function of beta approaches E sub one exponentially fast as beta approaches positive infinity. Finally, since\n1sn7 | S equals k times beta times the quantity F minus the expected value of E and both F and the expected value of E approach E sub one exponentially fast as beta approaches positive infinity, conclude that S approaches zero exponentially fast as\nbcxr | beta approaches positive infinity. Let's summarize! Suppose we have a system with a countable infinity of states and just one state of lowest energy. If thermal equilibrium is possible for this system for some T greater than zero, the Third Law of Thermodynamics says its entropy in thermal equilibrium goes to zero as T approaches zero from above. But in fact we can say more: for some a and b greater than zero we have\n0dtd | the absolute value of S as a function of beta is less than a times the exponential of negative b times beta for all large enough\n```",
