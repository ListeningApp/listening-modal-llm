The row and column hierarchical clustering trees (average linkage) are based on a dissimilarity measure one minus the pairwise Pearson correlation between log-transformed values. The left barplot indicates the mean methylation levels of the CpGs in each state for all eutherian samples in our data. We used the fourteen thousand seven hundred five eutherian CpGs as the background for enrichment of the comethylation modules. By contrast, twenty-eight thousand three hundred eighteen CpGs (high-quality\n29a3 | as a background for enrichment of significant life span-related EWAS CpG groups with chromatin states and genome annotations. Each EWAS CpG group includes up to five hundred most significant CpGs per direction (positively or negatively related with life span), as detailed in the caption of Fig. five.\nsb1e | hypergeometrics test, and only cell values with significant P is less than zero point zero zero one are shown. The chromatin states are learned based on epigenetic datasets profiling chromatin mark signals in different human cell and tissue types, resulting in a genome annotation shared across cell types. The common partially methylated domains (commonPMD), solo CpGs (WCGW), and highly methylated domain (HMD) annotations are from forty-two. PRC one and PRC two binding sites are obtained from the ChIP-seq datasets of PRC one and PRC two from ENCODE forty-five.\nw2yn | but promoters demonstrate either full or partial conservation across species.\nap6l | We found that thirty of the resulting fifty-five modules identified from an unsupervised machine learning method were readily associated with species traits (taxonomic order, maximum life span, and average adult weight) or individual traits (chronological age, tissue, and sex). We expect that many of the remaining twenty-five modules will be associated with biological characteristics about which we currently have no information. As a case in point, although the yellow module was not associated with any of our primary tested traits, it did show association with response to a murine circadian rhythm disruption study (light pollution during the night; fig. S7B). The upstream regulator analysis of the EWAS of life span identified the pluripotency transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG. We showed that the transient overexpression of OSKM in murine tissues affects the methylation levels of CpGs near genes implicated by our EWAS of maximum life span (Fig. five E). We speculate that the enhanced activity of the pluripotency network in long-lived species results in more efficient tissue repair and maintenance, ensuring a longer life span.\niest | Both the EWAS and eigengene-based analyses identified methylation signatures of maximum life span presumably established at birth. Most of these were independent of aging and interventions that affect murine mortality risk. Several CpGs that are more highly methylated in long-lived species are located near HOXL subclass homeoboxes and other genes that play a role in morphogenesis and development. Some of these life span-related CpGs are located next to genes that are also implicated in our analysis of upstream regulators (e.g., ASCL1 and SMAD6).\ncox8 | CpGs with methylation levels that are inversely related to life span are enriched in TSS one and promoter flanking (PromF four and PromF five)-associated chromatin states. Genes located in chromatin state TSS one are constitutively active and enriched for nucleic acid metabolic processes. This could imply that long-lived species either evolved selective mechanisms to maintain low methylation levels near TSSs or may have adaptations that promote the high expression of essential genes. This high expression may indirectly prompt more active DNA demethylation mechanisms.\nppqi | Methods summary\noxou | The Mammalian Methylation Consortium generated cytosine methylation data from N equals fifteen thousand four hundred fifty-six DNA samples derived from seventy tissue types of three hundred forty-eight mammalian species (three hundred thirty-one eutherians, fifteen marsupials, two monotremes) using a custom-designed mammalian methylation array that targets CpGs at conserved loci in mammals. DNAm data were used for phylo-epigenetic tree development using one-cor dissimilarity applied to mean methylation values\n495n | per species. The choice of the correlation-based dissimilarity matrix is justified in the supplementary materials and methods.\nawri | For unsupervised analysis, we formed WGCNA networks based on two sets of CpG probes in our data. The first network was generated from fourteen thousand seven hundred five conserved CpGs in ten thousand nine hundred twenty-seven samples of one hundred sixty-seven eutherian species. The preservation of this network was evaluated in an independent dataset comprising three thousand six hundred ninety-two samples from twenty-nine tissues of two hundred twenty-eight mammalian species (one hundred sixty-four new species; sixty-four overlapped with the training set). The second network was a subset of seven thousand nine hundred fifty-six conserved CpGs in eleven thousand one hundred five samples from one hundred sixty-seven eutherian and nine marsupial species. In addition, we developed seven consensus comethylation networks to remove the confounding effects of species and tissue type. Consensus WGCNA can be interpreted as a meta-analysis across networks in different species and tissue types.\nbl28 | For the eutherian network (Net one), module eigengenes (MEs) were defined as singular vectors (corresponding to the highest singular value) from the singular value decomposition of the scaled CpGs that underlie the respective module. The eigengenes in the eutherian network (Net one) explained a range of twenty-four to sixty-three percent (average forty-three percent) of the variance in the methylation data in the training set, replication set, and all data in each module. For a given module, we defined the measure of module membership (kME) as the Pearson correlation between the module eigengene and the CpGs. The association of module eigengenes was examined for different traits using individual regression models.",
