Thus, G sub I and G sub I superscript star typically convey much the same information.\nqfmx | EXAMPLE THREE\nrut3 | Consider a large regular lattice for which we seek the distribution under H sub zero for G sub I superscript star with W sub I neighbors. Let P equals proportion of As equals proportion of Bs and one minus two P equals proportion of\nm3cp | M S. Let angle bracket K sub one, K sub two, K sub three denote the number of As, Bs, and M S, respectively so that K sub one plus K sub two plus K sub three equals N. For large lattices, in this case, the joint distribution is approximately tri-multinomial with index W and parameters\nmq4s | left parenthesis P, P, one minus two P right parenthesis.

The distribution is symmetric and the standardized fourth moment is\nob1z | three plus one minus six P over two P W sub I. This is close to three provided P W sub I is not too small.\nm4cb | Since we are using G sub I and G sub I superscript star primarily in a diagnostic mode, we suggest that W sub I is greater than or equal to eight at least, that is, the queen's case, although further work is clearly necessary to establish cut-off values for the statistics.\nm61y | A GENERAL G STATISTIC\nu2ob | Following from these arguments, a general statistic, G left parenthesis D right parenthesis, can be developed. The statistic is general in the sense that it is based on all pairs of values left parenthesis X sub I, X sub J right parenthesis such that I and J are within distance D of each other. No particular location I is fixed in this case. The statistic is\n2gnm | G left parenthesis D right parenthesis equals the sum from I equals one to the sum from J equals one to N W sub I J left parenthesis D right parenthesis X sub I X sub J over the sum from I equals one to the sum from J equals one to N X sub I X sub J, J not equal to I. N left parenthesis five.\nemgw | The G-statistic is a member of the class of linear permutation statistics, first introduced by Pitman in nineteen thirty-seven. Such statistics were first considered in a spatial context by Mantel in nineteen sixty-seven and Cliff and Ord in nineteen seventy-three, and developed as a general cross-product statistic by Hubert in nineteen seventy-seven and nineteen seventy-nine, and Hubert, Golledge, and Costanzo in nineteen eighty-one.\nxaqt | For equation five,\n5rcb | W equals the sum from I equals one to the sum from J equals one W sub I J left parenthesis D right parenthesis, J not equal to I so that\n524j | E left bracket G left parenthesis D right parenthesis right bracket equals W over left bracket N left parenthesis N minus one right parenthesis right bracket. six.\nxd3m | The variance of G follows from Cliff and Ord in nineteen seventy-three, pages seventy to seventy-one:\n8qb6 | E left parenthesis G squared right parenthesis equals one over left parenthesis M sub one squared minus M sub two right parenthesis squared N superscript four left bracket B sub zero M sub two squared plus B sub one M sub four plus B sub two M sub one squared M sub two plus B sub three M sub one M sub three plus B sub four M sub one to the fourth power.
