You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

vz7z | VALUE OFFER: THE VALUE EQUATION
wk43 | I want to be abundantly clear: the goal should be to charge as much money for your products or services as humanly possible. I'm talking heinous amounts of money. That being said, anyone can raise their prices, but only a select few can charge these rates and get people to say yes.
1002 | From this point forward, you must abandon any notion you have about "what's fair." Every enormous company in the world charges you money for things that cost them nothing. It costs pennies for the phone company to add an additional user, except they don't mind charging you hundreds per month for access. It costs pennies to manufacture pharmaceutical drugs, but they don't mind charging hundreds of dollars a month for it. Media companies charge advertisers a king's ransom for your eyeballs, and it costs them next to nothing to get you to like kitten photos on social media. You need to have a big discrepancy between what something costs you and what you charge for it. It is the only way to be unreasonably successful.
ujk8 | Many entrepreneurs believe that charging "too much" is bad. The reality is that, yes, you should never charge more than your product is worth. But you should charge far more for your product and services than it costs to fulfill it. Think up to a hundred times more, not just two or three times more. And if you provide enough value, it should still always be a steal for the prospect. That is the power of value. It unleashes unlimited pricing and profit power to scale your company.
fqbt | For example, one of my private clients (whose company I have equity in) is in the photography space. Over two years, implementing the tactics outlined in this book, the owner was able to increase the average ticket from $300 to $1,500. That's a 5x increase (gasp). Even cooler, they now spend less time per customer, and have higher customer satisfaction. The 5x increase in average ticket, 38x'd the profit of the business. It went from making $1,000/wk in profit to $38,000/wk in profit, and continues to grow. As a result, the company was finally able to continue to scale to multiple locations and provide meaningful work to great employees. And a fun benefit, we were able to donate even more money to children's charities which is something the owner and I have in common (almost $500,000 at the time of this writing). But none of that would have been possible without figuring out what people valued most, tripling down on it, and ruthlessly eliminating everything else. A 5x price increase may seem crazy to you, but clients voted with their dollars that what the company provides now is far better than what it did before. Cracking value opens up the world of unlimited profit, impact and possibilities.
rkbk | Those who understand value are the ones who will be able to charge the most money for their services. The good news is that there is a repeatable formula that I have created (I've never seen it displayed elsewhere) to help quantify the variables that create value for any offer. I call it The Value Equation. Once you see it, you can never unsee it. It will operate in your subconscious, running in the background, calling out to you. It's a new lens through which to see the world.
u1bd | The Value Equation
q22z | PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD OF ACHIEVEMENT
l8vb | DREAM OUTCOME
jrb6 | = VALUE
ptaj | TIME DELAY
nusy | EFFORT 3 SACRIFICE
gsnv | If you want to know how I break down a businesses core offering into something more valuable go to acquisition.com/offers and select the "Value Equation" video to watch a short tutorial. I also included a downloadable checklist. My goal is to gain your trust and deliver value in advance. As such, it's absolutely free. Enjoy.
0mnu | As you can see from the picture, there are four primary drivers of value. Two of the drivers (on top), you will seek to increase. The other two (on the bottom), you will seek to decrease.
3w0z | 1. (Yay) The Dream Outcome (Goal: Increase)
uwfw | 2. (Yay) Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (Goal: Increase)
0caz | 3. (Boo) Perceived Time Delay Between Start and Achievement (Goal: Decrease)
4auz | 4. (Boo) Perceived Effort & Sacrifice (Goal: Decrease)
6nou | If you noticed the questions in the last section that my father asked me, you'll see they corresponded with these pillars:
xaqk | · What will I make? (Dream Outcome)
a1ou | · How will I know it's going to happen? (Perceived Likelihood of Achievement)
zae5 | · How long will it take? (Time Delay)
oa93 | · What is expected of me? (Effort & Sacrifice)
lcuj | Get The Bottom To Zero
cua2 | In the beginning of my career, I focused all my attention on dream outcomes and the perception of achievement (social proof, third-party edification, etc). In other words, the top side of the equation. That's where beginner marketers make bigger and bigger claims. It's easy, and it's lazy.
uipb | But as time has gone on, I have realized that these larger-than-life claims are the easiest to establish (and therefore less unique). After all, anyone can make a promise. The harder, and more competitive, are the Time Delay and Effort & Sacrifice. The best companies in the world focus all their attention on the bottom side of the equation. Making things immediate, seamless, and effortless. Apple made the iPhone effortless compared to other phones at the time. Amazon made purchasing a single click of a button and made purchases arrive almost immediately (maybe by the time you read this, they'll be sending drones to our doors within 60 minutes). Netflix made consuming television immediate and effortless. So, the older I get, the more I have shifted my focus to "the hard stuff' - decreasing the bottom side of the equation. And I believe the better you do this, the more you will be rewarded by the marketplace.
bjno | Final note: The reason this is a division equation and not an addition ("+") is that I wanted to convey one key point. If you
w2lh | can make the bottom part of the equation equal to zero, you're golden. No matter how small the top side is, anything divided by zero equals infinity (which is technically undefined for the math nerds). In other words, if you can reduce your prospects' true time delay to receiving value to zero (aka you realize your immediate dream outcome), and your effort and sacrifice is zero, you have an infinitely valuable product. If you accomplish this, you win the game.
qryo | Given this postulate, a prospect would (in theory) purchase something from you, and the moment their credit card was run, it would immediately become their reality. That is infinite value.
d0c0 | Imagine clicking the purchase button on a weight loss product and instantly seeing your stomach turn into a six-pack. Or imagine hiring a marketing firm, and as soon as you sign your document, your phone begins ringing with new highly qualified prospects. How valuable would these products/services be? Infinitely valuable. And that's the point.
c4id | I don't know if we entrepreneurs will ever get there, but that is the hypothetical limit we all should strive towards, and why I structured the equation this way.
2fj6 | Perception is Reality
5mai | Perception is reality. It's not about how much you increase your prospect's likelihood of success, or decrease the time delay to achievement, or decrease their effort and sacrifice. That in itself is not valuable. Many times, they will have no idea. The Grand Slam Offer only becomes valuable once the prospect perceives the increase in likelihood of achievement, perceives the decrease in time delay, and perceives the decrease in effort and sacrifice.
