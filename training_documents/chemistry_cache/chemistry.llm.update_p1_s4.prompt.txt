You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

bbpr | All-Solid-State Reference Electrode with Heterogeneous Membrane
5zyf | ABSTRACT: Novel reference electrodes with a solid contact coated by a heterogeneous polymer membrane are described. The electrodes are obtained AgBr E using Ag nanoparticles, AgBr, KBr suspended in tetrahydrofuran solution of PVC KBr -157 ±2 mV and DOS and deposited on Ag substrate, or another substrate covered with Ag, by Agnao drop casting. After a short period of soaking in a KBr solution, stable and PVC DOS pX, pOx reproducible formal potentials of -157 ± 2 mV (vs Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl) were THF 1 Ag or Ag covered observed, and the solid-contact reference electrodes were ready to use. It is shown substrate that the described reference electrodes are relatively insensitive to the changes in the sample matrix, the concentrations of ions, the pH and the redox potential. These electrodes can also be fabricated in miniaturized form, and thus used to produce miniaturized multielectrode probes.
9own | The application of a conducting polymer as a solid contact (SC) for ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) with polymeric (e.g., PVC) membranes has opened a new avenue in potentiometry.""2 Different all-solid-state indicator and refer- ence electrodes have since then been reported, and interest in solid contact ion-selective electrodes (SC-ISEs) is a mainstream of potentiometry today.3-6 Solid contact reference electrodes (SC-REF), owing to their high metrological demands and distinctively different design techniques, occupy a know-how niche of their own.7
bqfb | A significant technical challenge is in selecting the materials and procedures that would be compatible in production for both SC-ISEs and SC-REFs. In the case of all-solid-state PVC electrodes, obviously advantageous would be the application of the same material, for example, conducting polymer and PVC.6,8,9 Some benefits can be gained by using organic salts and ionic liquids dispersed in PCV or inorganic salts in inert polymer binders.10 So far, the electrochemical mechanism of all-solid-state reference electrodes is not sufficiently elucidated, which prompts the researcher to use trial-error methods. A general electrochemical rationale points to a condition of the equitransferent liquid junctions.17 However, in the case SC- REF, one has the asymmetric junction between the solid contact and solution, and applicability of the equitransferent condition is challenged. To understand the mechanism of SC- REF, the concept of pseudoreference electrode.8,18 and a "stable-in-a matrix" diffusion potential19 can be useful, but it appears that a more comprehensive interpretation is needed. At the moment though, further developments primarily depend on the practical purpose, the scope of applications and technical inventiveness.
wwdt | For both theoretical and practical reasons, the most popular reference electrodes are silver chloride electrode systems (e.g., Ag/AgCl/KCI) used in different configurations.7,16,20-25 An inventive approach was the introduction of a composite membrane made of polyvinyl acetate containing a very large loading of KCI (1:1 w/w KCI/PVA).10,11 Very recently,
mn1r | polypropylene (PP) has been successfully used as the binding polymer for the same purpose with the advantage of production by injection molding.10 In this report, we show that a composite based on poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) membrane containing nanoparticles of Ag, AgBr, KBr, and potassium bromoargentates allows the design of a solid-contact reference electrode.26 In general, even the conventional Ag/AgBr electrodes are rarely used25 and, to our knowledge, the system reported has never been explicitly described.
5vqw | Our technical note sees an avenue for a new class of the reference electrodes with heterogeneous membranes. We show that, by conventional drop casting, it is possible to obtain all- solid-state reference electrodes coupled with excellent analytical properties.
meyw | EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
2e62 | Reagents. Bis(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate (DOS), tetrabutylam- monium tetrabutylborate (QB), and poly(vinyl chloride) high molecular weight (PVC) were purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Silver nanowires of diameter 175 nm x L 20-50 um as 0.5% suspension in isopropanol obtained from Sigma- Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany) were used as received. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich was distilled before use.
75y3 | The other compounds used were obtained as p.a. form POCh, Poland and Merck, Germany and used as received. The gases were obtained from Linde Gas, Poland.
s2g2 | Water redistilled from quartz was used to prepare the solutions. All solutions with concentrations lower than 0.01 mol dm-3 were prepared just before use.
q1q2 | Preparation of Reference Electrode Cocktails. Silver bromide was precipitated from 3 M silver nitrate with the 3 M potassium bromide solution. Precipitated salt was filtered

Next, silver bromide and potassium bromide were mixed in molar ratio 1:5, and the mixture was thoroughly ground again and exposed to light to allow for photochemical decomposition of AgBr. The presence of metallic silver nanoparticles was proved by XPS and AgBr KBr by XRD analysis. Bis(2-ethylhexyl)-sebacate (DOS) and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) of total mass 3.3 g and 35-50 weight% of PVC were dissolved in 25 mL of freshly distilled THF.
hd35 | Three types of THE solutions containing bromide salts (cocktails) were used.
2zpk | The first contained 0.336 g of AgBr/KBr in 1.5 mL of the solution. This cocktail (owing to the small amount of Ag nanoparticles produced during the photochemical reaction) is depicted and referred to below as "REF-Br-photo".
epu7 | The third type of reference cocktail contained an additional amount of metallic silver formed during the redox reaction of AgBr with reducing agent, for example, QB. To prepare this cocktail, QB was added to the solution containing the AgBr/ KBr suspension. The amount of QB introduced to 1.5 mL of suspension containing 0.336 g AgBr/KBr was varied from 1 to 25 mg. After QB addition, the cocktail color changed from light yellow to dark brown owing to the formation of metallic Ag, as proved by XPS. The reference membranes prepared from such cocktails are called "REF-Br-QB".
7od1 | Regarding the major components, the typical composition of the above three membranes used in our studies was (in % w/ w): 15.2 (AgBr), 47.8 (KBr), 23.1 (DOS), and 13.9 (PVC).
0bqy | Preparation of the Reference Electrodes. Before membrane casting, each cocktail was vigorously mixed and a cloudy mixture of 100-200 uL was deposited on the silver substrate as well as on the glassy carbon (GC) or the gold substrate covered with Ag and (for comparison) on the pure GC or Au. The electrodeposition of a silver layer on the GC or Au substrates was done in 0.05 M AgNO3 solution using an Autolab PGSTAT-100 Analyzer (Ecco Chemie, Nederlands) in the three-electrode electrochemical cell. The silver chloride electrode Ag/AgCl/satd KCI with a bridge filled with the 1 M KNO3 solution was used as the reference electrode. A Pt sheet with an area of about 2 cm2 was used as an auxiliary electrode. The deposition potential was adjusted to a current density of 1.5-3 mA/cm2 and a typical deposition time was 1000 s.
