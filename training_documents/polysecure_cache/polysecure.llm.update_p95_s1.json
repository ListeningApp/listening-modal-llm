What daily practices or perspectives can you take on that bring your preferred expression of self more to the front and center in your life?\nl8vb | Let yourself laugh and seek out humor.\njrb6 | A: Attuning to Yourself\nptaj | Attunement is at the heart of secure attachment. In its absence, attachment security\nnusy | ceases to be possible. When there are early childhood attachment ruptures, requisite developments in a person's ability to tune into themself and regulate their inner states can become hindered. When our childhood needs are not met from the outside and our attachment figures are unable to help us learn how to identify and label our inner experiences in order to make sense of them and soothe ourselves, as adults we can then struggle with knowing how to feel our own feelings, identify our own needs, and calm down our own body, mind and heart in the way a nurturing caretaker would have. We can also run into considerable relational difficulty when we continue to have an \"outside-in\" approach to getting our needs met, expecting that our partners act as a substitute for our own inner nurturer. When we are able to tune in and tend to our needs from the inside first, we may still seek outward support, comfort and guidance from our partners, but our fundamental well-being and sense of being OK are not dependent on it.\ngsnv | When applied to the self, attunement is our ability to turn inward in order to become receptive and aware of our interior world. Self-attunement is the inner inquiry into what you are feeling, needing, thinking and experiencing. Self-attunement facilitates self-knowing, which furthers our ability to self-regulate and soothe our own physiological and emotional states, as well as respond appropriately to our environment. Regardless of a person's specific attachment style, people with attachment insecurity will all struggle to some degree with emotional regulation and self-soothing. People with more attachment anxiety tend to seek outward regulation from others-they want to be taken care of, try to overprocess with partners, look for someone fix or take away what they're going through, or can even seek someone else to just tell them what to do. People with an anxious attachment style can struggle with being able to hold and sit with their own feelings and so, like a game of emotional hot potato, they try to pass off their emotions to their partners in order to diffuse their own discomfort. Seeking this external regulation from others is often at the exclusion of their own self-regulation and their own sense of self.\n0mnu | People functioning from a dismissive attachment style steer clear of trying to emotionally regulate with others because, in many ways, they don't even see it as a\n3w0z | possibility. The co-regulation that a child needs and would experience with an attachment figure was not available to them, so they learned to take care of themselves by disengaging from others and taking space to regulate. From the outside, it may look like people with avoidant attachment are able to self-regulate well since they are comfortable on their own, but usually they are not actually self-attuning and self-soothing as much as they are autoregulating-that is, partaking in activities that are more about zoning out or tuning out in order to dissociate from their internal states than tuning into and intentionally working with their internal states.\nuwfw | Types of Regulation\n0caz | Auto-Regulation (It just happens)\n4auz | · Self-stimulation or self-soothing done more automatically than consciously.\n6nou | · Autoregulation is done alone, so there is no interpersonal stress.\nxaqk | · Can be similar to overfocusing on an object or task and can be dissociative or zoning out.\na1ou | Examples: Thumb-sucking, averting eye contact, reading, doing art, watching TV, alcohol, drugs, masturbating, daydreaming, overeating, swiping or scrolling on your phone.\nzae5 | External Regulation (You do it)\noa93 | · Reaching for another to help regulate and soothe you.\nlcuj | · Interactive, but only focusing on one person attuning to the other at a time.\ncua2 | · Can overfocus on either the self or on the other.\nuipb | Examples: Being held and soothed by a caregiver, talking with a friend about your problems, listening to a live talk or music,\nbjno | getting a massage.\nw2lh | Mutual or co-regulation with another where both people are regulating each other.\nqryo | Interactive Regulation (We do it)\nd0c0 | · Skin-to-skin and eye-to-eye contact.\nc4id | · Both people are attuning to each other. Examples: Dancing with a partner, sex, having a mutual dialogue, musicians playing together, cooking together.\n2fj6 | Self-Regulation (I do it)\n5mai | Regulating one's own state through active or intentional techniques that are self-soothing or stimulating.\npqyp | Ability to exhibit self-control through managing bodily or emotional impulses.\nnev2 | Examples: Calming down through breath control, mental techniques (e.g., reframing), muscle relaxation, vocal control. Some of the autoregulation behaviors can also be examples of self-regulation when they are intentional.\nlo13 | People with a preoccupied style learned that in order to survive they needed to be vigilant about reaching out towards others, often at the expense of losing their sense of self, whereas people with dismissive or fearful-avoidant attachment styles learned the danger or futility of reaching out to others and so in retreating into themselves they lose their sense of other. In my practice, I see that regardless of a person's starting point, all of those with insecure attachment styles need support\n1gm9 | with knowing themselves better. People with insecure attachment need guidance in connecting more with their authentic needs, preferences and desires instead of defaulting into their more reflexive insecure defense mechanisms. Just as we need techniques that support us in quieting down and transforming our inner critic, we also need strategies that enhance our inner nurturer. Even when we haven't experienced nurturing from others, we still have an innate caregiving behavioral system that we can access and animate through practice. With self-compassion we can learn how to re-parent ourselves in ways we may have never received. All of the insecure styles will benefit from practicing self-attunement and learning how to truly self-regulate and self-soothe, rather than turning to distraction, deflection or avoidance. There can be a healing effect of being with discomfort, of contacting pain or pleasure without collapsing or disconnecting, that can allow people to access their own inner safe haven and secure base. Each of the insecure attachment styles also has some specific ways that they can further grow.\n94yd | Ways that each of the insecure attachment styles can focus on growth:\nox3w | Preoccupied",
