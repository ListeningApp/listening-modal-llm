This result suggests that, for the example presented here, the magnitude of the extra forcing should be chosen so that\ntlzt | rho sub two extra equals negative rho sub one. Bounding the relative error. From a practical viewpoint, and following the usual bias/variance tradeoff, it might be more advantageous to stay close enough to the linear response for larger eta, even if that means decreasing the true linear regime. In\n6iyf | order to make these statements quantitative, we consider the relative error delta in the response relative to the linear response, that is\no1nk | delta sub alpha of eta equals the absolute value of the fraction with numerator r sub alpha of eta minus rho sub one eta and denominator rho sub one eta. For an extra perturbation widetilde mathcal L sub extra and alpha in the set of real numbers fixed, the response stays in the neighborhood of the linear response until a certain value of eta, at which point it deviates too far from the linear regime. Since delta sub alpha of zero equals zero, we look, for some small fixed value epsilon greater than zero, for the smallest value of the absolute value of eta such that delta sub alpha of eta equals epsilon, which we denote by eta sub alpha of epsilon. The question of optimizing alpha can be reformulated as finding alpha such that eta sub alpha of epsilon is maximized:\nmnaf | Three point fifteen\n0yxe | alpha star of epsilon equals the argument max of alpha in the set of real numbers of eta sub alpha of epsilon, eta sub alpha of epsilon equals the argument min of eta in the set of real numbers such that the absolute value of eta satisfies delta sub alpha of eta is greater than or equal to epsilon. As we tighten the bound epsilon, the value of alpha star of epsilon gets closer to the value alpha star for which rho sub two of alpha star equals zero. This comes from the fact that eta sub alpha of epsilon is of order big O of epsilon for alpha not equal to alpha star, and of order big O of the square root of epsilon for alpha equals alpha star. Indeed, three point fourteen can be written as\nerre | delta sub alpha of eta equals the absolute value of rho sub two extra times alpha minus alpha star eta plus order big O of eta squared.\n835g | Intuitively, canceling the leading order term, namely rho sub two in the small eta regime, is equivalent to minimizing the deviation from the linear regime, the latter being implied by the limit epsilon approaches zero. Figure two illustrates how alpha star and alpha star of epsilon can yield drastically different response curves. The functions r sub alpha of eta are fourth-order polynomials in eta whose coefficients have been hand-picked in order to demonstrate the possibly very different behaviors of r sub alpha star of eta and r sub alpha star of epsilon of eta. Figure two a shows the full response curves r sub alpha of eta, and Figure two b shows the corresponding relative error curves relative to the linear response three point fourteen. The curve obtained by choosing alpha star minimizes the deviation from the linear regime for small n as the second-order response rho sub two is canceled. On the other hand, the curve for alpha star of epsilon equals zero point zero five slightly departs from the linear regime earlier than the one associated with alpha star. It stays, however, in the vicinity of the linear response for much larger n. This behavior is more clearly observed in figure two b.\nx3l9 | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS",
