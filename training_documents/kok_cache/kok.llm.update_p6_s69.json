The strong correlation of the b one to b two or B one to B two ratio with the Gamma star over C sub c ratio (with R squared greater than zero point eight zero Figure five A) does not mean that the varying Gamma star over C sub c ratio can explain more than eighty percent of the Kok effect because other factors such as R sub d and f sub acv may vary with Gamma star over C sub c as well. However, the relative difference in the slope value between the b one to b two versus the Gamma star over C sub c plot (two point five five nine, Figure five A) and the B one to B two versus the\nwqfv | The slope values have a unit of mol mol to the negative one and standard errors of the estimates are given in brackets; data used for estimation were from the three sets of measurements as described in Table one.\nj30a | Cc plot (two point two six two; Figure five A) should quantify the contribution of the decreasing Phi two in explaining the Kok effect. This relative difference was left parenthesis two point five five nine minus two point two two six right parenthesis divided by two point five five nine times one hundred percent equals eleven point six percent, suggesting that, overall, the varying P two explained approximately twelve percent of the Kok effect across varying O two and CO two concentrations and varying temperatures.\n7bdk | We plotted the modelled A against I sub abs to generate slope values of b one and sixty-two, and thereby the modelled b one to b two ratios. The modelled b one to b two ratios did increase with the Gamma star over C sub c ratio (Figure five B), in line with the statement of Farquhar and Busch twenty seventeen that the changing Gamma star over C sub c ratio explains much of the observed Kok effect.\nfim0 | fraction A vs sub abs plot over b one fraction A versus I sub abs Phi two plot over B one\nojro | Farquhar and Busch twenty seventeen did not estimate quantitatively the extent of the explanation.",
