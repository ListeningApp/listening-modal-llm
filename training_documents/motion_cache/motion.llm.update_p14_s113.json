        "content": "8uji | Two. Linearization Error\ndf3e | The effects of the linearization are evident near the periselene. Considering, for instance, the distance test, the error index V at the periselene is larger for the linearized sets E-L-E-R-M and C-L-E-R-M than for the nonlinear set C-N-E-R-M; see Figures six a through six c. In Figure eleven the values of\n53eu | the error index V for values of the mean anomaly near the first and the second periselene are shown. For distances above seventy to eighty meters the error is clearly larger for the linearized sets, compared with the C-N-E-R-M equations. For the rest of the target orbit the linearization error is negligible. The cause lies in the high velocity of the target at the periselene that results in a quick separation of the spacecraft, which exceeds the linearization domain of validity.\na5u1 | Six. Conclusions\nry7u | The relative dynamics in the local-vertical local-horizon frame for restricted three-body scenarios were characterized and described by means of a set of nonlinear time-varying equations. Possible simplifications were discussed and applied, obtaining simplified sets with a reduced number of time-varying parameters, and/or linear with respect to the relative motion state. The accuracy of the equation sets was analyzed by means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations, and compared against the two linear equation sets generally employed in Keplerian orbits, namely, linear equations of relative motion and Hill's equations. The tests confirmed that two-body-based equation sets are not suitable for restricted three-body scenarios, especially when the relative velocity becomes significant. The assumption of circular motion for the primaries introduces considerable error, at least for the Earth-Moon system and the orbit chosen as reference target trajectory. However, the error is reduced near the aposelene, making the circular nonlinear equations of relative motion and circular linear equations of relative motion sets suitable for relative guidance and navigation system design in this regions, provided that robust control techniques are adopted.",
