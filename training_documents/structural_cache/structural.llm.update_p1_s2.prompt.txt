You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

bqfb | Structural and Mechanistic Insights into Methane Oxidation by Particulate Methane Monooxygenase
wwdt | ABSTRACT
mn1r | Particulate methane monooxygense (pMMO) is an integral mem- brane copper-containing enzyme that converts methane to metha- nol. Knowledge of how pMMO selectively oxidizes methane under ambient conditions could impact the development of new catalysts. The crystal structure of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) pMMO reveals the composition and location of three metal centers. Spectroscopic data provide insight into the coordination environ- ments and oxidation states of these metal centers. These results, combined with computational studies and comparisons to relevant systems, are discussed in the context of identifying the most likely site for O2 activation.
5vqw | Introduction
meyw | The oxidation of methane to methanol is a challenging reaction because methane is the most inert hydrocarbon (104 kcal mol-1 C-H bond) and because methanol reacts further at high temperatures.1 In nature, methanotrophic bacteria oxidize methane to methanol in the first step of their metabolic pathway. Methane hydroxylation is carried out at ambient temperature by methane monooxygenase enzymes (MMOs).2,3 There are two forms of MMOs. All methanotrophs except members of the Methylocella genus produce an integral membrane MMO called particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO). Several strains also express a cytoplasmic form called soluble methane mo- nooxygenase (sMMO).2-4 In organisms that possess both forms, including Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) and Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, differential expression is regulated by the bioavailable copper concentration.5-7 Both MMOs are metalloenzymes, but that is the extent of their similarity. The two systems differ in molecular structure, metal ion composition, and substrate specificity.8-11
2e62 | Whereas pMMO is more selective toward alkanes and alkenes that are five carbons or less, substrates for sMMO include alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, and halogenated hydrocarbons.12,13
75y3 | Activation of O2 by sMMO and related enzymes has been investigated extensively (see the Account by Murray and Lippard in this issue). In contrast, the metal content, organization, and location of the active site in pMMO have been and continue to be controversial. It is only recently that enough information on pMMO has been obtained to begin thinking about O2 activation chemistry. In the past 5 years, there have been significant advances in the biochemical, spectroscopic, structural, and mechanistic characterization of pMMO. In this Account, we highlight recent discoveries, with an emphasis on their relevance to O2 activation chemistry.
s2g2 | Overall Architecture of pMMO
q1q2 | The 2.8 Å resolution crystal structure of M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO revealed its overall architecture for the first time.14,15 pMMO consists of three subunits, pmoA (B), pmoB (x), and pmoC (y), with molecular masses ~24, ~47, and ~22 kDa, respectively. The three subunits assemble into a cylindrical 038373 trimeric structure that is ~105 Å in height and ~90 Å in diameter (Figure 1A). The pmoA and pmoC subunits comprise the bulk of the membrane-spanning regions and are composed of seven and five transmembrane helices, respectively. In contrast, pmoB includes two distinct cupredoxin-like ß barrels linked by two transmembrane helices and a long loop region. The ß barrels from pmoB form a soluble domain that houses two of the three metal centers identified in each protomer in the crystal structure (Figure 1B).
cb7r | In addition to the crystal structure, Dalton and co- workers determined the structure of M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO by electron microscopy (EM).16 Although the 23 Å resolution cryo-EM structure limits detailed compari- sons with the crystallographic data, two observations are particularly significant. First, the EM structure represents an active complex and agrees well with the overall oligomeric state and architecture of the subunits in the crystal structure. Thus, the crystal structure of pMMO is physiologically relevant. Second, the identification of side "holes" in the soluble regions near the membrane inter- face are hypothesized to serve as entry points for hydro- phobic substrates (Figure 1A). A central cavity, present in both X-ray and EM structures, may function in product egress.16 Recent cryo-EM studies suggest that the pMMO trimer forms a larger assembly with methanol dehydro- genase (MDH), the subsequent enzyme in the methan- otroph metabolic pathway. In the complex, MDH is proposed to interact with the soluble ß-barrel regions of pmoB.17
68xu | pMMO Metal Centers
hd35 | Metal Ion Composition. Early analyses of the pMMO metal content suggested that copper is the primary metal involved in methane oxidation.9 Different groups have reported copper stoichiometries for purified M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO of 2 (Dalton laboratory),18 2-3 (our labora- tory),19 8-10 (DiSpirito laboratory),20 and 15-20 (Chan laboratory)21,22 copper ions/100 kDa aßy protomer. Puri- fied pMMO from M. trichosporium OB3b contains 2 copper ions/100 kDa.23 Iron is generally also present with reported stoichiometries of 0.75-2.5 ions/100 kDa. 18-20,24 The varying metal ion content highlights the difficulty in
2zpk | the isolation and purification of pMMO. The discovery of methanobactin, a siderophore-like, copper-binding mol- ecule associated with some preparations, 25-28 resolves some of the discrepancies, however. The DiSpirito prepa- ration containing 8-10 copper ions actually includes 6-8 molecules of methanobactin and 2 copper ions20 and is thus consistent with values obtained by us19 and the Dalton group.18 Most but not all20 iron-containing pMMO preparations exhibit spectroscopic features characteristic of heme, suggesting that the iron derives from contami- nants in the membrane fractions.19,29
epu7 | Spectroscopic Data. Both membrane-bound and puri- fied pMMO have been studied extensively by spectro- scopic techniques. Prior to the crystal structure, these data were used to suggest models for the metal centers.9,15,30 At this point, we are trying to reconcile these data with the crystal structure to assess the physiological relevance of the structure and to glean more detailed information on the metal coordination environments and oxidation states. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectros- copy has been widely used to investigate pMMO. Chan and co-workers report a broad isotropic signal at g ~ 2.1, which was proposed to derive from a ferromagnetically coupled trinuclear Cu" cluster.31 Because no trinuclear copper center is present in the structure, alternative interpretations for this signal, such as methanobactin,24 superposition of a radical signal with a type 2 Cu" signal, 32 Cu[Fe(CN)6]2-,33 or adventitiously bound copper ions,18 might be more reasonable. All researchers observe a type
7od1 | 2 Cu" signal for both membrane-bound and purified pMMO.18-20,24,34,35 This signal accounts for 40-50% of the total copper present, disappears upon chemical re- duction, 18,19,29 and is not altered by the addition of azide or cyanide.35
