You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

y2qo | The logistics of mapping at 20 cm resolution exacerbates uncertainty, especially in the context of such a finely heterogeneous landscape. At such a high resolution, unavoidable sub-meter errors in data collection and processing become important, but remain difficult to quantify. These errors might include small artifacts from imagery stitching and orthorectification; minor spatial variations in lidar ground-control adjustments; centimeter-level errors in GNSS base station location or RTK corrections; and slight mismatches in the location of a reference plot photo center and the measurement of its GNSS coordinates-any of which could displace a
1piq | reference plot into the wrong pixel and introduce noise into the modeling process. Indeed, the large difference between the value for kappa (0.47) and weighted kappa (0.65) suggests that many misclassifications are attributable to small ecological (gradient-related) offsets or locational errors in the data.
7fqw | Nonetheless, we believe that the high resolution of the maps, their relatively large extent, and the granularity of the classes offset the moderate map accuracy we were able to achieve, especially given the challenges inherent in any vegetation classification. For example, the gradient nature of vegetation communities can make class assignment for a plot ambiguous, since a given location may show characteristics of multiple vegetation communities. This might lead to two similar training plots being assigned to different classes based on an arbitrary distinction, introducing noise to the training data. The granularity of our classification scheme also increases opportunities for confusion. For example, there were five shrubby classes, many of which are structurally similar, as well as two common classes (Tussock Tundra and Moist Non-Tussock Tundra) that each had a corresponding 'Shrubby' class. These 'Shrubby' versions would only be differentiable from their non- shrubby counterparts based on the presence of sparse, low-stature shrubs (<30 cm height), which are difficult to detect in remotely sensed data. Nonetheless, we retained the granular classes because we believe the maps accurately reflect landscape vegetation patterns, and that this classification will be most valuable to map users.
rhaz | 3.3. Predictor importance
wak1 | Although the Random Forest approach is valuable for its flexibility and robustness, it provides only limited options for ecological interpretation of results. Variable importance metrics are derived by examining how much the accuracy (both class-wise and overall) changes when the model is run iteratively with the values of each predictor permuted (i.e., randomly reordered among plots). However, variable importance metrics become less meaningful when input variables are highly correlated (Nicodemus et al 2010, Kuhn and Johnson 2013, Raschka and Mirjalili 2017), as they are in this study, so it is not advisable to interpret the variable importance values rigorously in this case.
wtfz | With that caveat, some results are interesting (table S4). For example, lidar intensity was important to accuracy for several classes, with standard deviation of intensity especially important for very wet vegetated classes (Raised Areas in Wet Tundra, Wet Tundra), where the occurrence of intermixed high- and low-intensity pixels could indicate areas of intermixed vegetation and saturated microsites. Intensity smoothed at 1 m was the predictor with the largest impact on the overall Gini purity index (not shown) and was especially important for very dry vegetated classes (Dry Exposed Tundra, Dry Sheltered Tundra) where intensity would be high, and for Water, where intensity would be low. This adds to emerging evidence that lidar intensity can be an important ecological metric (Eitel et al 2016).
qy1i | Greenness indices (NDVI, DSI, 2GRBI) were important for predicting all shrubby classes, as would be expected, and coarse-scale topographic position was important for predicting Low to Tall Moist Shrub, which generally occurs in low-lying streambed areas. Unsurprisingly, lidar-derived canopy height metrics were important for predicting Tall Shrub, and heat load index was important for predicting Moist Snowbed-but it
1k9e | was somewhat more surprising that percent red appeared important for predicting wet tundra classes (Wet Tundra, Raised Areas in Wet Tundra) and moist upland tundra classes (Moist snowbed, Tussock Tundra, Moist Non-Tussock Tundra), perhaps owing to a comparatively high degree of red absorption by both water and plants in those areas. The standard deviation of the panchromatic (R + G + B), although not at all important for most classes, was highly important for predicting Tussock Tundra, where high values may have indicated the distinctive speckled image texture created by tussock shadows. Indeed, in our early modeling attempts, which
5bjs | employed 1 m spatial resolution rather than 20 cm, we found that models could not distinguish tussock tundra from non-tussock tundra, perhaps owing to dilution of this signal when averaged over a larger area.
uodj | Overall, in a list of 15 most important predictors per class, all 33 predictors appear for at least one class (table S4); in a list of the five most important variables per class, only seven predictors fail to appear for at least one class (hue_sd, swi_05, swi_1, ws_05, ws_1, tpi_25, and tpi_50). Although this may be due in part to the correlated nature of many of the predictor variables, the wide variety of variables appearing as important for different classes also suggests the complicated interrelationships between vegetation communities and their ecological drivers.

ti7f | 4. Conclusion
oksu | This project combined predictor datasets derived from two airborne sensors in a machine learning approach that permitted the construction of very high-resolution validated vegetation classification maps based on simple ground reference data. The approach highlights the ability of high-quality airborne data to produce very high- resolution geospatial data products over relatively large areas, providing an important link between limited- extent ground- and UAS-based remote sensing products and coarser geospatial data products covering larger extents. The maps should prove to be a valuable resource for Arctic researchers requiring fine-scale reference data for these important research landscapes.
