        "content": "ppqi | It must be remembered that G of d is based on a variable that is positive and has a natural origin. Thus, for example, it is inappropriate to use G of d to study residuals from regression. Also, for both I of d and G of d one must recognize that transformations of the variable X result in different values for the test statistic. As has\noxou | Arthur Getis and J. K. Ord / 199\n495n | been mentioned above, conditions may arise when d is so small or large that tests based on the normal approximation are inappropriate.\nawri | EMPIRICAL EXAMPLES\nbl28 | The following examples of the use of G statistics were selected based on size and type of spatial units, size of the X values, and subject matter. The first is a problem concerning the rate of sudden infant death syndrome by county in North Carolina, and the second is a study of the mean price of housing units sold by zip code district in the San Diego metropolitan region. In both cases the data are explained, hypotheses made clear, and G of d and I of d values calculated for comparable circumstances.\nd5bz | One. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome by County in North Carolina\nap5o | SIDS is the sudden death of an infant one year old or less that is unexpected and inexplicable after a postmortem examination. The data presented by Cressie and Chan were collected from a variety of sources cited in the article. Among other data, the authors give the number of SIDs by county for the period nineteen seventy-nine to nineteen eighty-four, the number of births for the same period, and the coordinates of the counties. We use as our data the number of SIDs as a proportion of births multiplied by one thousand. Since no viral or other causes have been given for SIDS, one should not expect any spatial association in the data. To some extent, high or low rates may be dependent on the health care infants receive. The rates may correlate with variables such as income or the availability of physicians' services. In this study we shall not expect any spatial association.\n7zvf | Results using the G statistic verify the hypothesis that there is no discernible association among counties with regard to SIDS rates. The values of Z of G are less than one. In addition, there seems to be no smooth pattern of Z values as d increases. The Z of I results are somewhat contradictory, however. Although none are statistically significant at the point zero five level, Z of I values from thirty to fifty miles, about the distance from the center of each county to the center of its contiguous neighboring counties, are well over one. This represents a tendency toward positive spatial autocorrelation at those distances. Taking the two results together, one should be cautious before concluding that a spatial association exists for SIDS\nmov9 | among counties in North Carolina. Perhaps more light can be shed on the issue by using the G sub i of d and G sub i star of d statistics.\nks7m | Table four and Figure two give the results of an analysis based on the G sub i of d and G sub i star of d statistics for a d of thirty-three miles. This represents the distance to the furthest first-nearest neighbor county of any county.\nw1w1 | The G sub i star of d statistic identifies five of the one hundred counties of North Carolina as significantly positively or negatively associated with their neighboring counties at the point zero five level. Four of these, clustered in the central south portion of the state, display values greater than positive one point nine six, while one county, Washington near Albemarle Sound, has a Z value of less than negative one point nine six. Taking into account values greater than positive one point fifteen, the eighty-seven point five percentile, it is clear that several small clusters in addition to the main cluster are widely dispersed in the southern part of the state. The main cluster of values less than negative one point fifteen, the twelve point five percentile, is in the eastern part of the state. It is interesting to note that many of the counties in this cluster are in the sparsely populated swamp lands surrounding the Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds. If overall error is fixed at point zero five and a Bonferroni correction is applied, the cutoff value for each county is raised to about three point five zero. However, such a figure is unduly conservative given the small numbers of neighbors.\nh8gv | Arthur Getis and J. K. Ord / 201\nkwkp | Positive one point one five to negative one point one five Positive one point one five to positive one point nine six Greater than positive one point nine six FIG. two. Z of G star of d equals furthest nearest neighbor equals thirty-three miles for SIDS Rates of Counties of North Carolina, nineteen seventy-nine to eighty-four.\nyj0m | In this case it becomes clear that an overall measure of association such as G of d or I of d can be misleading because it prompts one to dismiss the possibility of significant spatial clustering. The G sub i of d statistics, however, are able to identify the tendency for positive spatial clustering and the location of pockets of high and low spatial association. It remains for the social scientist or epidemiologist to explain the subtle patterns shown in Figure two.\newfp | Two. Dwelling Unit Prices in San Diego County by Zip Code Area, September nineteen eighty-nine\noczy | Data published in the Los Angeles Times on October twenty-nine, nineteen eighty-nine, give the adjusted average price by zip code for all new and old dwelling units sold by builders, real estate agents, and homeowners during the month of September nineteen eighty-nine in San Diego County. The data are supplied by TRW Real Estate Information Services. One outlier was identified: Rancho Santa Fe, a wealthy suburb of the city of San Diego, had prices of sold dwelling units that were nearly three times higher than the next highest district, La Jolla. Since neither statistic is robust enough to be only marginally affected by such an observation, Rancho Santa Fe was not considered in the analysis.",
