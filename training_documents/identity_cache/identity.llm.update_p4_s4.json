Identity politics is blamed for a host of political ills and theoretical mistakes, from overly homogenized conceptions of groups to radical separatism to the demise of the left. But what are its own claims? In what is undoubtedly its locus classicus, the Combahee River Collective's \"A Black Feminist Statement\" of nineteen seventy-seven, identity politics emerges as a belief in the general relevance of identity to politics: \"We realize that the only people who care enough about us to work consistently for our liberation is us. ... This focusing upon our own oppression is embodied in the concept of identity politics. We believe that the most profound and potentially the most radical politics come directly out of our own identity, as opposed to working to end somebody else's oppression.\" Such a claim does not assume that identities are always perfectly homogeneous or that identity groups are unproblematic. The very formation of the\nm5ka | Combahee River Collective was motivated by the founders' concerns with the racism in the white-dominated wing of the women's movement, the sexism in the male-dominated wing of the black liberation movement, and heterosexism that was virulent everywhere. They knew that social identities are complex entities and that identity groups are always heterogeneous, but they argued that, in their experience of political work, identities mattered.\nbyu8 | The Combahee River Collective argued that African American women needed to develop some organizational autonomy at that time in order to develop their analysis of the particular forms of subordination they faced as well as to articulate an effective agenda for change. Members of the collective did not see this call for autonomy as in any way rejecting the simultaneous need for coalition. They state, \"We feel solidarity with progressive black men and do not advocate the fractionalization that white women who are separatists demand.\" They also declared themselves to be socialists who believed that overcoming oppression will require a movement of solidarity against capitalism and imperialism, but they argued that \"although we are in essential agreement with Marx's theory as it applied to the very specific economic relationships he analyzed, we know that this analysis must be extended further in order for us to understand our specific economic situation as black women.\" Thus, the collective was not supportive of a general separatism but simply insistent on the need for specific analyses.\n76b0 | Nonetheless, for many theorists today, the belief articulated by the Combahee River Collective that identities are relevant to one's politics has had a devastating impact on progressive and democratic politics. Identity politics is often called \"balkanization\" and arguments are made that even the atrocities of ethnic cleansing we have witnessed elsewhere will become a reality in the West if we don't trounce this trend once and for all. The eminent French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, for example, offers an amazing list of all the \"places, groups, or authorities that constitute the theater of bloody conflicts among identities.\" His listing of identity-based conflicts run from the struggles for autonomy in Chiapas to the Islamic Jihad to the military conflict in Chechnya to \"Chicanos\" (without explanation), as if these struggles are essentially caused and motivated by clashing identities. In his analysis, it doesn't matter whether identities are religious, ethnic, cultural, mythical, historical, transnational, \"independent or 'instrumentalized' by other groups who wield political, economic, and ideological power\": he proposes to offer one analysis that can address the conflicts among the groups on this \"endless list.\"\nzxz6 | My question is, How did the legitimate concern with specific instances of problems in identity-based movements become a generalized attack on identity and identity politics in any and every form?\nxnth | Schlesinger's \"America\"\nvafm | To begin to answer this question, we should surely look at one of the most powerful early salvos in the war on identity: the publication of Arthur Schlesinger's The Disuniting of America in nineteen ninety-one. In this short, readable book, Schlesinger paints a picture of a past \"America\" happily moving toward the melting-pot nation that Hector St. John de Crèvecoeur first described in the seventeen hundreds in his widely read Letters from an American Farmer. Crèvecoeur imagined a United States where individuals lost their old identities and formed a \"new race of men.\" This was a good thing, not simply because a homogeneous nation would be a stronger nation, but because what these individuals left behind included \"ancient prejudices and manners\" or backward ways of life, in favor of a more advanced set of rules based on democratic ideals. Schlesinger is well aware that nonwhite ethnicities were not initially included in this imagery of the new nation, but he argues that, by the eighteen hundreds, a new trend toward inclusiveness had emerged and was manifest in some of the most important representations of the \"new race,\" such as the writings of Herman Melville and Ralph Waldo Emerson. There was also a nativist and racist countertrend, to be sure, such as the \"American Party\" of the eighteen fifties, which opposed immigration and \"political rights for the foreign-born.\" But Schlesinger's principal narrative is one of constant, steady movement toward an inclusiveness in which ethnic differences would be left behind, and he neglects to consider the implications of the divergent treatment received by Northern European, Southern European, and non-European ethnic groups.\n2zmw | Schlesinger's main thesis is that the nineteen sixties \"cult of ethnicity\" derailed this steady progress. He suggests that this cult had a precursor in the early nineteen hundreds, which was not a product of the grass roots but of intellectual elites who presumed a right of cultural and political leadership as \"ethnic spokesmen.\" These intellectual ethnic spokesmen were actually alienated from the groups for which they spoke but were \"moved by real concern for distinctive ethnic values and also by real if unconscious vested interest in the preservation of ethnic constituencies.\" Thus, their opposition to assimilation was neither an expression of the spontaneous will of the masses nor was it wholly motivated by their own selfless concern with principles of fairness. This is a charge that he continues to maintain against the political leadership of minority communities today.\nbf9k | Schlesinger considers Congress's passage in nineteen seventy-four of the Ethnic Heritage Studies Program Act to be a key moment in the culmination of the identity problem. This act applied \"ethnic ideology to all Americans\" and thus \"compromised the historic right of Americans to decide their ethnic identities for themselves,\" ignoring those millions who refused ethnic identification of any sort (he claims this latter group must surely represent the majority of Americans, but he does not consider whether there is a difference between white and nonwhite Americans in this regard). Here, then, is the picture Schlesinger paints: authoritarian elites ramming ethnicity down the throats of gullible citizens for their own narrow purposes. And here is the effect:\notkr | The ethnicity rage in general ... not only diverts attention from the real needs but exacerbates the problems. The recent apotheosis of ethnicity, black, brown, red, yellow, white, has revived the dismal prospect that, in happy melting-pot days, Americans thought the republic was moving safely beyond-that is, a society fragmented into separate ethnic communities. The cult of ethnicity exaggerates differences, intensifies resentments and antagonisms, drives ever deeper the awful wedges between races and nationalities. The endgame is self-pity and self-ghettoization.\n```",
