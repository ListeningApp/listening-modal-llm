You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ko3c | Soluble MMO. MMOH interacts with MMOB and MMOR. MMOB is essential for efficient hydrocarbon oxidation by MMOH. Binding of MMOB increases the reaction rate of reduced MMOH with O2 by 1000-fold,77,78 lowers the redox potential of the diiron center," changes the regioselectivity of substrate oxidation, and affects the structure of the diiron center.3 59,81,82 The 2.9 Å resolution structure of the M. capsulatus (Bath) MMOH-2MMOB complex reveals that MMOB binds to the canyon region at the dimer interface of MMOH, leading to the ordering of the N-terminal 35 residues of MMOB, which are not observed in the NMR structures, 83,84 into a ring-like fold (Figure 7A).55 MMOB binding also causes

(B) Active site region in uncomplexed MMOH (PDB accession code 1MTY). The hydrophilic pore is open to solvent, and cavities 1 and 2 are separated by Leu110 and Phe188. (C) Active site region in MMOH-MMOB complex (PDB accession code 4GAM). The pore is closed, and conformational changes in Phe188 link cavities 1 and 2, allowing substrate access to the active site.

In addition, Thr213 of the MMOH a subunit rotates inward toward the active site, forming new hydrogen bonds with Glu240 and closing the hydrophilic pore (Figure 7B,C). This residue has been proposed to play a role in proton delivery. Finally, MMOB binding induces small changes in

9own | some of the ligands, including a shift of Glu243 to a coordination more similar to that in reduced MMOH.55
bqfb | MMOR transfers two electrons from NADH one at a time to the diiron site in MMOH via its FAD and [2Fe-2S] cofactors.85,86 There is no crystal structure of the MMOH- MMOR complex, but NMR titrations indicate that residues 24-34 in <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> helix 1 and residues 67-69 in <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> helix 2 interact with MMOH. Chemical cross-linking studies have suggested that MMOR interacts with both the <LATEX>a ^ { 8 8 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\beta ^ { 8 1 }</LATEX> subunits of MMOH, and recent work using hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and computational docking suggests that the ferredoxin domain of MMOR binds to MMOH at the same location where MMOB binds. At this binding site, the MMOR [2Fe-2S] cluster is positioned 14 Å away from the diiron active site and does indeed interact with both subunits. Consistent with these findings, MMOB inhibits MMOR binding as well as electron transfer. However, it is also possible that MMOB inhibits MMOR binding by forming a complex with MMOR.81
wwdt | Recent fluorescence anisotropy experiments suggest that MMOB has a higher affinity for MMOH in the reduced form <LATEX>\left( K _ { d } = 0 . 1 7 \mu M \right)</LATEX> than in the oxidized form <LATEX>\left( K _ { d } = 0 . 5 5 \mu M \right) _ { j } ^ { 9 0 }</LATEX> an observation that is difficult to reconcile with the lowered redox potential of MMOH in the presence of MMOB.79,91 Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopic data further suggest that the conformation of the N-terminal tail of MMOB is more rigid when MMOH is reduced." The key role of the MMOB N-terminus is underscored by data showing that mutants of MMOB disrupting the N-terminus display significantly reduced activity.55,92 In one functional model, MMOR is proposed to replace MMOB, transfer electrons to reduce the active site, and then MMOB is proposed to rebind to the reduced form, displacing MMOR, and initiating <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> activation and methane oxidation. In the absence of experimental evidence for MMOR displacing MMOB from the oxidized MMOH, this scenario remains speculative.
mn1r | Particulate MMO. Protein-protein interactions are not required for pMMO activity in vitro, but protein-protein complexes involving pMMO have been suggested. Besides the interaction with the mystery helix observed crystallographically (Figure 3), 24-26 26 pMMO has been proposed to interact with the next enzyme in the methane oxidation metabolic pathway, methanol dehydrogenase (MDH).93 MDH is a periplasmic enzyme that oxidizes methanol to formaldehyde and is composed of a 63 kDa a subunit, which contains a pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)/calcium ion cofactor, and a 8 kDa <LATEX>\beta</LATEX> subunit arranged as an <LATEX>\alpha _ { 2 } \beta _ { 2 }</LATEX> dimer.94, The <LATEX>M .</LATEX> capsulatus (Bath) MDH can also form higher order heterogeneous oligomers.95 A putative pMMO-MDH super- complex was isolated, and its structure was determined to 16 <LATEX></LATEX> resolution by electron microscopy. This structure was interpreted as three aß MDH monomers capping the periplasmic pmoB soluble domains of the pMMO <LATEX>\alpha _ { 3 } \beta _ { 3 } \gamma _ { 3 }</LATEX> trimer." This pMMO-MDH complex exhibited moderately higher propylene epoxidation activity than pMMO alone, 96,97 but its methane oxidation activity was not reported. Recent biolayer interferometry studies of MDH and pMMO from <LATEX>M .</LATEX> <LATEX>c a p s u l a t u s</LATEX> (Bath) reveal a specific protein-protein interac- interaction was also detected between MDH and the spmoB recombinant protein, indicating that the periplasmic regions of pmoB are involved.95 These data are consistent with reports that MDH is associated with the membranes in various methanotrophs.98-10 The observed complex is likely dynamic

meyw | since a stable complex cannot be isolated by size exclusion chromatography, and its formation may depend on the presence of the membrane or other proteins. One proposal is that the lysine-rich <LATEX>\beta</LATEX> subunit of MDH, of which the function is not known, interacts with pMMO and/or negatively charged phospholipid headgroups at the periplasmic membrane," thus associating with pMMO in a fashion that would be difficult to reconstitute in vitro. Such a model would not apply to methanotrophs that utilize a subset of MDH enzymes lacking the <LATEX>\beta</LATEX> subunit, but these methanotrophs, which include the Verrucomicrobia,102 also have different types of membranes.36
2e62 | A pMMO/MDH supercomplex would provide a direct pathway for methanol produced at the proposed dicopper active site in the pMMO pmoB subunit to the active site of MDH where it is oxidized to formaldehyde. In addition, such a complex could directly provide reducing equivalents to pMMO through the cytochrome <LATEX>c _ { \mathrm { L } } ,</LATEX> the electron acceptor of MDH.96,97,103-105 Another and perhaps more widely accepted electron source for pMMO involves ubiquinol generated by a type 2 NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (NDH-2).12, 12,106,107 In support of this pathway, NADH is an effective reductant for membrane-bound pMMO, but duroquinol is the only reductant that is effective after detergent solubilization.71,108 Duroquinol may mimic the function and redox potential of endogenous quinols, and it is known that methanotrophs produce a range of ubiquinones, but not menaquinone.1 110 Moreover, addition of NADH and NDH-2 to purified pMMO samples leads to a modest increase in propylene epoxidation activity.12 NDH-2 and pMMO can be copurified,12 but there is no evidence that they form a specific protein-protein complex. Finally, in M. capsulatus (Bath), a cytoplasmic hemerythrin protein increases the activity of pMMO, suggesting that hemerythrin facilitates oxygen delivery to pMMO. However, there is no evidence for a protein-protein interaction between pMMO and this hemerythrin.

s2g2 | Soluble MMO. The details of how sMMO activates dioxygen have been probed extensively by single turnover kinetic studies, resulting in the identification of transient oxygen intermediates, the kinetic and spectroscopic properties of which are detailed elsewhere. 14,19,112 First, the reduced diiron(II) MMOH reacts with <LATEX>O 2</LATEX> in the presence of 2 equiv of MMOB to form a species O in which <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> is bound, but not directly to the diiron cluster.77 Intermediate O is then converted to peroxo intermediates P* and P. For <LATEX>M .</LATEX> capsulatus (Bath) MMOH, <LATEX>\mathrm { P } ^ { \mathrm { s } }</LATEX> is observed to be a diiron(III) site that differs from the subsequent intermediate <LATEX>P</LATEX> only in ligand arrangement.113 However, recent studies of <LATEX>M .</LATEX> trichosporium OB3b MMOH utilizing a variant of MMOB that slows conversion of <LATEX>\mathrm { P } ^ { * }</LATEX> to <LATEX>\mathrm { P }</LATEX> indicate that <LATEX>\mathrm { P } ^ { * }</LATEX> contains a diiron(II) site similar in structure to the diiron(II) site in reduced MMOH. In this system, <LATEX>p ^ { * }</LATEX> is proposed to form by displacement of the <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O</LATEX> by <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> without electron transfer from the diiron(II) center.114 Thus, it remains unclear whether the two intermediates denoted <LATEX>\mathrm { P } ^ { * }</LATEX> are the same. The second peroxo intermediate, P, is a diiron(III) species, and spectroscopic comparisons as well as computational work suggest that <LATEX>a \mu - 1 , 2</LATEX> µ-1,2-peroxo bridge is likely.14,115 Formation of <LATEX>\mathrm { p }</LATEX> is pH-dependent and exhibits a kinetic solvent isotope effect in D2O, indicating that proton transfer plays a role.113,116 It is also possible to bypass the requirement for MMOB and MMOR in these steps by reacting the oxidized MMOH with H2O2 as source of both oxygen and

hd35 | Intermediate P is then converted to Q in a proton-dependent step 113,116 that results in O-O bond breaking. Intermediate Q is the species that reacts with methane to break the C-H bond. On the basis of Mössbauer spectroscopic data indicating the presence of two Fe ions in similar coordination environments and EXAFS data best fit with an Fe-Fe distance of 2.46 Å, Q was proposed to adopt a di(u-oxo) diamond core struc- ture. e 119,120 Difficulty reproducing this distance computation-
2zpk | ally121,122 'combined with the observation that a model complex with an open core terminal Fe=O unit can oxidize C-H bonds rapidly,123 although not those in methane, suggested Q might have an alternative structure. However, a recent time- resolved resonance Raman study reveals a vibration from Q that best matches vibrations observed for the diamond core in model compounds. Additional experiments with mixed isotopes of O2 further indicate that Q forms via homolytic cleavage of the O-O bond.63,124 Once Q is formed, there are several mechanistic possibilities for C-H activation, including both concerted and radical or cationic processes."" A range of approaches, such as the use of chiral alkane and radical clock substrates, the measurement of kinetic isotope effects, and computational analysis, have been used to investigate these options. After methane oxidation, Q is converted to the product complex T, which is proposed to have a mono-u-oxo bridged structure.63
epu7 | Particulate MMO. Mechanistic studies of pMMO are far behind those of sMMO, due to ongoing difficulties isolating highly active purified enzyme and uncertainty as to the atomic details of the active site (vide supra).9 Density functional theory (DFT) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/ MM) studies suggest that a monocopper Cu"-oxo species or a di (p-oxo)Cu"Cu" species could oxidize methane and that formation of the dicopper species is more favorable.126 Calculations using a dicopper active site model suggest that either a u-n1 :n2-peroxo Cu'Cu" or u-n2:n2-peroxo Cu"Cu" species is formed first and then is transformed into the more reactive di(u-oxo)Cu"Cu" species after O-O bond cleav- age.12
