You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

cox8 | The FFIT's body shape classification's applicability to extensive anthropometric surveys, including SizeUK, is potentially low yet untested. Rejecting the FFIT based on poor applicability with the anthropometric surveys that influences how industry understands human measurements is radical. Meticulous examin- ation is, therefore, essential.
ppqi | 3D Body Scanning - following accepted ISO stand- ards - takes measurements following different place- ment definitions than FFIT - loosely - dictates. Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan (2004a, 2004b) name the bust, waist, hip, stomach, and abdomen when developing FFIT, but omits replicable measurement defi- nitions. Sokolowski and Bettencourt (2020, 2) even state, ‘Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan did not provide detailed descriptions of where on the scan these meas- urements were taken'. Instead, Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan (2004a, 2004b) primarily used the measure- ments programmed into the TC2 (TC2 2011) anthropo- metric software - as their later work with Yim Lee (2007) describes. Unless a researcher seeking to use FFIT has the same TC2 software, they must choose measure- ment within the stated regions, as Figure 2 shows.
oxou | The FFIT's definitions are potentially incompatible with the way 3 D Body Scanning's anthropometric software defines measurements as standard. This incompatibility may have serious consequences given the FFIT's common application to 3 D Body Scanning data. The FFIT used a hip measurement definition that allows the hip circumference to occur anywhere in a given zone (see Figure 2), including above the seat. Hips cannot, anatomically, occur above the seat. This may be why SizeUK used the Seat in place of the Hip. The standard 3 D body scanning posture requires par- ticipants to keep their feet at least 200 mm apart: 'standing position A' according to ISO 20685 (ISO 2010a). 3 D Body Scanners require standing position A
495n | (Figure 3) to identify crotch and thigh geometry more accurately.
awri | Nevertheless, 'standing position A' has a problem. Its wide feet position causes the largest circumference between crotch and waist to move, occurring at a position different from the hip level defined in ISO 8559-1:2017 (Gill and Parker 2017). A person's measurements, therefore, change if the practitioner uses manual or 3D Body Scanning measure- ment methods.
bl28 | Practitioners are placing measurements on different parts of the body by using different measurement methods. If the different measurement methods can place the same body into a different shape classifica- tion, the impact may be severe. Two surveys - both using the FFIT shape classification tool but using dif- ferent measurement methods - may reach conclusions about inter-group body shape differences that do not exist in reality. Researchers in these hypothetical stud- ies may assume they classify bodies in the same way. This is because FFIT is not explicit on where to place measurements. FFIT also relies on measurements exist- ing within zones (see Figure 2) instead of precise placements. Even the most meticulous practitioners may, therefore, be measuring bodies at different loca- tions without knowing it.
d5bz | If this is true, then the FFIT - or any research that utilises the FFIT - cannot be authoritative because of the FFIT's propensity for error caused by the effects of slight differences in measurement definitions. The published FFIT research does not, arguably, communi- cate the need for measurement definition standards to an adequate level. This is important because con- sistent results rely on practitioners applying consistent measurement definitions.
ap5o | Additionally, the FFIT only classifies a person's lower-torso region instead of the entire body, despite
7zvf | research using the FFIT for this purpose. In defining the body, the FFIT only uses six circumferences in the region from the bust to the hip. The restricted body form consideration limits how the FFIT might inform pattern construction because it excludes measure- ments in the critical upper-body control zone/the shoulders' anchor area. Unlike earlier body classifica- tion systems - e.g. Rasband (1994) - the FFIT's shape sorting formulae excludes shoulder anthropometry. Shoulder measurement's exclusion is surprising as they are essential for clothing design and construction (Aldrich 2015; Beazley and Bond 2003). The FFIT's suit- ability for garment construction, and apparel related purposes, is unsubstantiated.
mov9 | FFIT defines the bust in line with ISO definitions. However, as Figure 2 shows, the waist and hip are defined as occurring within zones. Within these zones, measurements can fall into regions that they would not naturally occur within. For example, the hip can occur anywhere from the crotch to the waist, including above the seat. For all definitions, this can never be classified as the hip as the seat (a circumference at maximum buttock projection) should be the upper limit. Because FFIT omits clear measurement definitions, differently defined measurements sharing the same name are likely to be applied to the published shape calculations; as with Sokolowski and Bettencourt (2020).
ks7m | While the FFIT may have specific measurements, these measurements are unavailable - and unreplica- ble - to the broader ergonomic field (Sokolowski and Bettencourt 2020). The measurement extract is spe- cific to TC2's Scanner software and hardware. As measurements are used interchangeably by name,
w1w1 | two practitioners will likely use such alternative meas- urements - such as SizeUK - while attempting to rep- licate FFIT. Sokolowski and Bettencourt (2020) even modifies FFIT to address the underlying assumptions about measurement placement that cannot work on women over size 14. However, these placement assumptions are invisible to third-party practitioners who do not run studies 'hacking' the algorithm. If using alternative measurements reclassifies bodies into different shapes, then FFIT is unauthoritative out- side of its original application because of unreplicable measurement definitions. In such a situation, ergono- mists who attempt to use the FFIT system in their work may not, therefore, be able to compare their work to others - but they are unaware of these underlying issues.
h8gv | We aim to assess the FFIT's suitability as a body classification system for scientific research and gar- ment construction purposes, considering how slight changes in measurement definitions may affect shape classifications. We use FFIT as the case by which to explore how body shape systems may provide unreli- able when used more broadly than specified systems and measurements extractions. In pursuing this aim, we consider the following hypotheses:
kwkp | 1. Calculating the FFIT using alternative measure- ment definitions causes the same human shape to be categorised as alternative body shapes, with a low - below 50% - agreement between measure- ment definition groups.
