You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

7hgg | . The relation between the reduced material toughness in the k-area of I-shaped links and the recently observed link web fractures is still unclear and necessitates additional experiments.
xwsv | · The deteriorative effect of misalignment between the link end stiffeners and brace flanges in triggering fracture was observed during recent earthquakes, and thus, providing practical methods for reducing the probability of this misalignment in field applications would be fruitful.
756b | · The current intermediate stiffener spacing requirements of built-up box shear links are not dependent upon the required level of yp. Further experimental research is needed to validate such a relation.
6bx7 | . Although the crucial importance of link lateral bracing is well understood, there exist only a handful of studies which have explicitly investigated the effect of lateral bracing on link behavior,
spl6 | considering realistic loading and boundary conditions. Additional research on this topic would be beneficial since the current codified lateral bracing requirements for links are in fact based on studies which focused mainly on the plastic hinge locations of MRFs.
7wzm | . There is a significant research need in the field of link-to-column connections considering the fact that most of the connections suitable for MRFs exhibit poor performance when used as link-to- column connections. Promising details such as the all-around fillet weld and the supplemental web doubler connections require further experimental verification, especially for long links, with the aim of developing prequalified link-to-column connections. In addition, other less studied link-to- column connections such as the end-plate connection with and without rib stiffeners as well as the connection reinforced by haunches need additional investigation and development of design procedures. There are also details such as the reduced flange section link connection, which have not been studied experimentally at all.
e9xj | · There is almost no study which specifically investigates the behavior and design of the column panel zones of EBFs with link-to-column connections. Research on this issue is indispensable. The current AISC Seismic Provisions [3] use the requirements of special MRFs for EBF column panel zone design without the necessary research background.
9vl6 | . The amount of reduction in Q2 for the capacity design of columns in EBFs is typically limited since there are no methods for predicting the actual number of simultaneously yielded links above the column under consideration except for complicated nonlinear analysis. Thus, developing simple and reliable methods for estimating the reduced column forces can be advantageous, especially for high-rise EBFs, where a potential cost saving might be achieved.
c2fd | . There is an urgent need for the reevaluation of the response modification factors (R) of EBFs that are in use by most of the design specifications, since they can significantly overestimate the ductility of these structures. In a similar manner, previous studies have proven that the codified displacement amplification factors (Ca) for EBFs are not capable of predicting the actual inter-story drifts and inelastic link rotations based on the results of linear analysis, and thus, reevaluation again appears to be necessary. Although several studies have been undertaken regarding these issues, further research is essential in order to confirm such alterations.
jzvp | · The problem of the concentration of yielding in a limited number of stories is reported even for some properly designed mid- and high-rise EBFs. New methodologies have been proposed recently to overcome this issue, which require further verification (and in some cases simplification) so as to be considered as reliable and practical methods for the design of EBFs.
f71y | . The codified assessment procedures for EBFs typically do not consider the effect of the loading history on the acceptance criteria and link failure detection. As noted in recent studies, this deficiency can be overcome by introducing measures based on cumulative demands. Further monotonic tests or experiments with other more suitable loading histories might be fruitful for developing these cumulative criteria, which can be used for predicting the actual link rotation capacities during an earthquake.
31e1 | · The research on EBFs with vertical links is limited when compared to their horizontal counterparts. There is a significant need for research on the behavior and design of these structures to address issues such as stability and the detailing of vertical links. There is also a notable gap in the design specifications regarding EBFs with vertical links, which can only be closed with additional studies.
40ry | . The promising performance of tied braced frames (TBFs) as well as EBFs upgraded with zipper struts in terms of the proper distribution of yielding over the structure height necessitates further confirmation through extensive numerical simulations as well as experimental studies. Practical procedures for the design of these systems are also required.
d1j2 | · There has been a considerable improvement in the field of replaceable links in the past decade; however, there is still a need for additional research to develop codified design and detailing rules for link-to-beam connections with the final goal of proposing prequalified connection types for replaceable links. Furthermore, studies on intermediate and long replaceable links as well as external replaceable links located between a brace and a column are few in number.
wstc | · Research on the progressive collapse of EBFs is very limited. Future research on this topic is essential, particularly for improving the behavior of these structures under probable blast loading scenarios.
ba1e | · Newly proposed concepts such as composite links, EBFs with shape memory alloy (SMA) devices, EBFs made of high strength or stainless steel, and the use of energy-dissipating steel links in other structural systems such as diagrids and linked column frames (LCF) are also potential areas for future studies.
