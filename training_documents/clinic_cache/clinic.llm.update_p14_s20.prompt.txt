You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

xrnt | PPVs and NPVs of the four tooth-level endpoints ranged between 12.8% (PPD < 6 mm) and 15.1% ('stable periodontitis') and
c8ra | between 29.3% ('PPD < 6 mm') and 88.2% ('stable periodontitis'), respectively (Table 3). The total number of teeth lost per patient per year of SPC was 0.08 (all studies: average of 9.88 SPC years) and 0.06 (conventional APT studies: average of 12.75 SPC years). Heterogene- ity in the tooth-level studies/analyses varied from unimportant to considerably higher compared to the subject-level findings but did not affect the direction of effects (i.e., lack of periodontal stability led to tooth loss) and only affected the precision with which the summary effect was calculated.

vk4h | 4 DISCUSSION
nsm3 | This systematic review confirms that very few periodontitis cases achieve the proposed endpoints following steps 1, 2 and 3 of peri- odontal therapy. In studies following conventional APT, 9.43% of sub- jects achieved 'stable periodontitis' and 27.6% achieved the desirable 'endpoints of therapy'. Our data showed that 54.2% of subjects achieved 'controlled periodontitis', coinciding with a multi-centre study where approximately 50% of the population was within the limits of 'controlled periodontitis' (Feres et al., 2020). The prevalence
jdfw | of achieving and sustaining these endpoints is likely to be reduced fur- ther with increased time of SPC (Bertl et al., 2022) and reduced opera- tor experience (Fleischer et al., 1989). Therefore, the reality of successfully achieving or sustaining these endpoints in general dental practice is likely to be limited further.
uc9r | An average of 11.36 teeth per patient were considered 'diseased' after APT. This result needs to be interpreted in light of the proven efficacy of steps 1 and 2 of periodontal therapy, which show an over- all proportion of 74% of 'pocket closure' (PPD ≤ 4 mm and an absence of BoP; Suvan et al., 2020), bearing in mind that the effi- ciency of NSPT is reduced in areas of difficult access, such as furca- tions or deep pockets (Caffesse et al., 1986; Fleischer et al., 1989; Tomasi et al., 2007).
l0ap | Analysing long-term outcomes showed that 29.05% of 'unstable' subjects, as per WWC 2017 and following conventional APT, experi- enced tooth loss during a mean observation period of 12.75 years. Yet, only 8.49% of teeth responsible for an 'unstable' diagnosis were extracted. The lack of a statistically significant association of tooth loss at the subject level <LATEX>\left( R R = 1 . 3 6 ; \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. p = . 2 0 7 2 \right)</LATEX> within this data sup- ports that an 'unstable' periodontitis subject does not increase the risk for periodontitis-related tooth loss among subjects strongly com- pliant with SPC (Bertl et al., 2022). Consideration of this endpoint may be important when planning treatment at the tooth level, for example, utilising a 'stable' abutment tooth where our data highlight an <LATEX>R R = 1 0 . 2 7</LATEX> for tooth loss if the tooth is 'unstable'.
x815 | Although approximately one third (34.34%) of the subjects not meeting the 'endpoints of therapy' lost teeth during SPC after con- ventional APT, similarly, statistical significance was reached only at the tooth level <LATEX>\left( R R = 1 4 . 8 6 ; \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. p = . 0 1 5 1 \right) .</LATEX> This may be due to BoP, a variable of these composite endpoints, which has been found to be a useful predictor of periodontal progression and subsequent tooth loss only at the tooth level (Claffey & Egelberg, 1995; Matuliene et al., 2008). Yet, the effect of smoking on masking the predictive abil- ity of BoP cannot be excluded (Bergström & Boström, 2001). Less than 20% of subjects within this dataset were current smokers.
epbj | 'Controlled periodontitis' was the most frequently achieved end- point (52.42%) among studies following conventional APT. At the sub- ject level, it has an RR of 2.78 <LATEX>\left( p = . 0 0 6 8 \right)</LATEX> of tooth loss during SPC when not achieved, which is similar to the findings reported else- where (Siow et al., 2022). Unlike other subject-level endpoints, this endpoint considers multiple residual sites, which is relevant, as subject- and tooth-level factors can affect the treatment response, particularly in relation to specific tooth types (Tomasi et al., 2007). All endpoints showed low PPVs and high NPVs at the subject level, sup- porting existing literature (Saydzai et al., 2022).
nmn2 | The number of teeth lost per subject per year of SPC varied between 0.06 and 0.08, corroborating that a small number of teeth are lost in a small proportion of the population (Hirschfeld & Wasserman, 1978; McFall, 1982; Needleman et al., 2018; Nibali et al., 2017). Optimal adherence to long-term SPC has been shown to
g3tm | effectively reduce the progression of periodontitis and tooth loss, par- ticularly in private practice and university-based hospitals (Axelsson & Lindhe, 1981; Chambrone et al., 2010; Leow et al., 2022). This is sup- ported by our data at the subject and tooth level, respectively, where the highest incidence of tooth loss was reported in studies where <10% of subjects adhered to the recommended SPC regime (De Wet et al., 2018) and where SPC regimes were executed by the subjects' general dental practices (Nibali et al., 2020). With maxillary molar teeth being the most frequently lost teeth within SPC, this raises the question whether end- points should be individualized to the tooth type, as their complex anat- omy may affect 'pocket closure' (Tomasi et al., 2007).
