This last feature in particular is crucial, ensuring that the spheroids can be used immediately without the need to select the appropriate spheroids. Furthermore, with these types of plates, it is possible to use the spheroids in an automated drug-screening platform, which may be relevant to the pharmaceutical industry. However, due to plate incompatibility with microscopes and uncentered spheroids in the well plates, hanging drop plates can be difficult to image. Moreover, media exchange is a difficult process in traditional plates, whereas specialized open-top plates are costly and difficult to adapt to the experimental requirements.\nojro | Three point one point three. Liquid overlay technique and low adhesion plates\nl6t9 | In the liquid overlay technique, cells are cultured on a nonadherent surface and centrifuged to induce spheroid formation. Nevertheless, it is necessary to take\n1ujy | into consideration that this technique differs according to the type of plate used and that the plate surface has to be coated with nonadherent materials, such as agarose or poly-HEMA, to induce spheroid formation. This protocol allows for quickly producing single, compact spheroids with a uniform size on a large scale that are suitable for high-throughput assays. Another significant feature of this method is the easiness to manipulate the spheroids for further cultivation or analysis. MCTS from more than twenty different tumor cell lines were already established using this method. Nonetheless, there are certain cell lines, such as MDA M B two thirty one, MDA M B four sixty eight, S K B R three, and MDA M B three sixty one, which do not form round spheroids using this technique, a problem that can be solved using a reconstituted basement membrane extract. A commercial alternative of this basement membrane extract is Matrigel, a basement membrane preparation derived from Engelbreth Holm Swarm mouse sarcoma, rich in laminin, collagen four, entactin, heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and growth factors, in order to induce the formation of an organized three D structure. Similar to the liquid overlay method, low adhesion plates are able to promote spheroid formation due to the absence of cell attachment surfaces. These pre-coated low-adhesion plates have the advantage that, in most cases, prolonged cultures and experimental assays can be performed without the need to transfer the spheroids to another type of plate. In comparison with the liquid overlay technique, low-adhesion plates are easier to manipulate, as the plates are already pre-coated, although this aspect results in a higher cost. Regardless of cost, low adhesion plates are the superior method for drug screening of all spheroid manufacturing methods.\nqzor | Three point two. Microengineering-based models\na0by | The implementation of micro- and nanoscale technologies with biomaterials has created great prospects for the development of three D models for cancer research. Through this combination, it is possible to precisely control important variables involved in tumor growth, such as cellular spatial organization, biochemical gradients, and mechanical properties, among others. Techniques such as micropatterning, three D bioprinting, and microfluidics have been used as platforms for the discovery and preclinical evaluation of anti-tumoral drugs due to their exceptional adaptability in creating precise experiments.\nu1ky | Three point two point one. Micropatterning three D models\nhtm9 | Controlling cellular adhesion, shape, and spread based on the control of the spatial features of the culture surface is the aim of micropatterning techniques. The micropatterning of surfaces allows for recapitulating the structure of the microenvironment found in vivo, making it possible to further understand the correlations between microarchitecture and cellular function. Using these approaches, it is possible to precisely position the cells in certain areas of the substrate, allowing for the control of its shape and the overall tissue architecture. The most often used micropatterning procedures include seeding cells on a surface with regions of varied adhesiveness, which correspond to different patterns, and depending on the application and size of the cells to be patterned, these patterns can range from a few microns to hundreds of microns. Micropatterning models have been used to assess the efficacy of anti-tumoral drugs and to study cancer development at the microscale level; however, generating stencils, which are used to generate the patterns, with small feature sizes using soft lithography, is a significant limitation of this technique.\n8hul | Three point two point two. Three D bioprinting models\n87vz | Three-dimensional bioprinting consists of building three D structures by accurately arranging biological and biochemical elements layer by layer, and allows for the production of interesting and accurate tumor models using bioinks, which contain cells, cytokines, and biomaterials similar to the in vivo ECM. There are several methods of three D bioprinting, such as biomimicry, where one attempts to recreate the tissue found in vivo; autonomous\nym66 | self-assembly, which simulates organ development through the manipulation of tissue genesis and organogenesis; and mini-tissue building blocks, which consist of building smaller constructs and combining them into a larger structure. Additionally, material deposition can be performed through inkjet, in which a nozzle produces droplets that are precisely placed on a scaffold; extrusion, similar to inkjet but for viscous materials; and laser-assisted printing, where an energy-absorbing layer is exposed to a laser beam, causing a bubble to form in the bioink solution.\nl0a3 | Contrary to scaffold-based three D models, bioprinting technology provides a greater vascularization because of the process's reliability, scalability, and enhanced control over vascular growth, resulting in the design of scaffolds that better represent tumor microenvironment heterogeneity and in the creation of superior three D in vitro models of cancer. Additionally, three D bioprinting technology enables the modular and standard construction of in vitro models for a high-throughput method for personalized drug screening. Some limitations inherent to three D bioprinting are related to the materials used and the manufacturing process, such as unwanted biological interactions, bioink-printing compatibility, resolution, and low efficiency. Another aspect that has to be further studied is the development of bioinks that are biocompatible, non-toxic, do not induce immune responses, and properly support the cells for each application. Nevertheless, several platforms based on three D bioprinting have been used to test anti-tumoral drugs and for cancer basic research.\nu8nw | Three point two point three. Microfluidic models\nl2v9 | In microfluidic devices, cells are cultured in chambers with dimensions on the micrometer scale. These devices are probably mostly used for perfusion-based cell cultures, allowing for a consistent supply of oxygen and nutrients while also eliminating waste, providing an environment similar to the one found in vivo. Furthermore, in perfusion systems, the culture medium perfusion recapitulates the shear forces caused by blood flow in vivo. However, besides the perfusion-based microfluidic devices, static models have also been developed for cancer research.\n```",
