Consequently, representing Arctic tundra vegetation communities accurately requires very high resolution raster maps with a grid cell size of less than five meters. However, using remotely sensed data to produce maps with sufficient spatial detail at an extent appropriate for understanding landscape-scale ecological patterns is challenging. In this study, we used predictor layers derived from airborne lidar and high-resolution approximately five centimeter four-band airborne imagery to classify vegetation communities at twenty-centimeter spatial resolution for three landscapes twelve and a half square kilometers total near the Toolik Lake research area in the Alaskan Low Arctic. The maps were built using a Random Forest model that was trained and tested on eight hundred ground reference plots, using classes derived from commonly used legends on existing polygon maps of the area. Withheld test plots twenty-five percent of dataset had a balanced map accuracy of zero point five seven, kappa of zero point four seven, and weighted fuzzy kappa of zero point six five. These maps provide high-resolution plant community information that can serve as important baseline reference data for vegetation monitoring and change detection in this rapidly changing tundra ecosystem, and as validation for coarser scale maps. They also permit fine-scale characterization of landscape phenomena such as community-level nutrient dynamics and wildlife habitat suitability in an important Arctic research site. Our approach demonstrates that very high resolution mapping results can be achieved and validated by integrating high-resolution remote-sensing datasets from multiple sensors in a machine learning model trained on simple field reference data.\nko3c | One. Introduction\nxek3 | As the Arctic continues to warm rapidly, research efforts seeking to improve understanding of potential impacts on human, animal, and vegetation communities are becoming increasingly urgent. To address these challenges, there is often a need to understand the distribution of features across the landscape-for example, to understand how much area is covered by lakes and wetlands that may release increasing quantities of methane, or which permafrost slopes might soon thaw and erode, impacting local and downstream terrestrial, aquatic, and human communities and releasing ancient soil carbon to the atmosphere.\nbbpr | The spatial requirements for mapping these landscape features in a scientifically relevant way depend on the ecological change process under study. Coarse to moderate resolution classification maps covering large extents provide valuable information about general surface features, and can be important inputs to regional and global climate models. However, the low spatial resolution and usually coarse classification schemes of these mainly satellite-derived maps cannot represent the heterogeneity of Arctic landscapes accurately enough to reproduce the distribution of diverse vegetation community types or fine-scale ecological phenomena. Capturing the natural variability of Arctic tundra surfaces across complex environmental gradients requires surface mapping at very high spatial resolution, generally five meters or less. For example, very high spatial resolution mapping is necessary for identification of suitable nesting habitat for migratory songbirds that require open, dry hillsides, and for determining whether individual patches of small shrubs growing along narrow waterways are expanding. On the other hand, classification maps derived from unmanned aerial systems may be of very high spatial resolution, but the spatial extent of such datasets may be restricted by short flight times and other logistical considerations, limiting their general usefulness. High-quality piloted-airborne datasets therefore still represent a gold standard, with the potential for producing high-resolution data products at the moderately large spatial extents necessary for understanding landscape-level influences on fine scale vegetation change.\n5zyf | Fusing lidar and passive optical data produces a robust combination of structural and spectral information for a surface, and consequently this has proven to be a powerful approach to quantifying geospatial features. For example, Reese found that combining lidar and optical metrics improved classification of low-stature vegetation in an alpine zone over optical data alone, and Greaves similarly found that this approach produced strong models for quantification of shrub biomass in Arctic tundra.\n9own | Our objective was to fuse high-quality lidar and optical datasets to produce tundra vegetation community maps with the high spatial resolution and fine classification granularity necessary to be relevant for the study of fine-scale ecological features at a landscape extent. We used predictor layers derived from airborne lidar and multispectral imagery along with simple field reference data to train a Random Forest model to classify vegetation communities at twenty centimeter resolution across three research areas near Toolik Lake twelve and a half square kilometers total, an area of important long-term and ongoing Arctic ecological research.\nbqfb | Two. Methods\nwwdt | Two point one. Study area\nmn1r | The study was conducted near the Arctic Long Term Ecological Research site at Toolik Lake Alaska U S A, sixty-eight degrees thirty-eight minutes North latitude, one hundred forty-nine degrees thirty-six minutes West longitude; figure one. Located on continuous permafrost tundra in the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, the Toolik Lake area has been an important site for North American Low Arctic research since the nineteen seventies. The region is characterized by cold winters mean coldest month temperature negative thirty degrees Celsius and mild summers mean warmest month temperature thirteen degrees Celsius, with roughly three hundred millimeters of precipitation annually. Complex topography, glacial features, and prevailing weather patterns notably scouring southerly winds generate a complex mosaic of microenvironmental gradients driven by parent material, exposure, and drainage, which in turn host a finely heterogeneous patchwork of low-stature tundra vegetation communities. The dominant vegetation is graminoid tundra especially Eriophorum vaginatum and Carex bigelowii with abundant Sphagnum and other mosses and erect deciduous shrubs, mainly Betula nana and Salix species.\n5vqw | Two point two. Data collection\nmeyw | Two point two point one. Airborne data collection\n2e62 | Airborne lidar and high-resolution digital imagery were collected August first, twenty thirteen. Data were collected in three discrete footprints totaling twelve and a half square kilometers figure one. The largest and westernmost footprint hereafter 'Toolik', approximately six square kilometers covers research areas near Toolik Field Station at Toolik Lake. The other two footprints are each roughly three square kilometers: the 'Pipeline' footprint approximately three kilometers east of Toolik Lake follows a stretch of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline from a high moraine ridge down a sloping drainage toward the Kuparuk River; the 'Imnavait' footprint includes research areas along Imnavait Creek, roughly ten kilometers east of Toolik Lake. Lidar collection specifications are shown in table one. The vendor performed pre-processing of the lidar data, including aircraft attitude adjustments and ground control georectification. Simultaneous four-band digital imagery RGB and near infrared, hereafter 'RGBN' was collected by a Leica RCD thirty sixty MP camera mounted to the aircraft. The imagery was orthorectified by the vendor and delivered as orthoimagery mosaics with a pixel resolution of\n75y3 | roughly four point two five centimeters. A GPS check of forty stationary objects distributed across the Toolik footprint suggested that the imagery was accurately orthorectified to within approximately ten centimeters.\ns2g2 | Two point two point two.
