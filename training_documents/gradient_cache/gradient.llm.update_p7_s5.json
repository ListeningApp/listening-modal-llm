        "content": "3wck | Fixed-size convolutional networks have been applied to many applications, among other handwriting recognition, machine-printed character recognition, online handwriting recognition, and face recognition. Fixed-size convolutional networks that share weights along a single temporal dimension are known as time-delay neural networks or TDNN's. TDNN's have been used in phoneme recognition without subsampling, spoken word recognition with subsampling, online recognition of isolated handwritten characters, and signature verification.\njq2u | B. LeNet-Five\n9zf9 | This section describes in more detail the architecture of LeNet-Five, the Convolutional Neural Network used in the experiments. LeNet-Five comprises seven layers, not counting the input, all of which contain trainable parameters, weights. The input is a thirty-two by thirty-two pixel image. This is significantly larger than the largest character in the database, at most twenty by twenty pixels centered in a twenty-eight by twenty-eight field. The reason is that it is desirable that potential distinctive features such as stroke endpoints or corner can appear in the center of the receptive field of the highest level feature detectors. In LeNet-Five, the set of centers of the receptive fields of the last convolutional layer, C3, see below, form a twenty by twenty area in the center of the thirty-two by thirty-two input. The values of the input pixels are normalized so that the background level, white, corresponds to a value of negative zero point one and the foreground, black, corresponds to one point one seven five. This makes the mean input roughly zero and the variance roughly one, which accelerates learning.\nclwo | In the following, convolutional layers are labeled C followed by a number, subsampling layers are labeled S followed by a number, and fully connected layers are labeled F followed by a number, where the number is the layer index.\naki1 | Layer C1 is a convolutional layer with six feature maps. Each unit in each feature map is connected to a five by five neighborhood in the input. The size of the feature maps is twenty-eight by twenty-eight which prevents connection from the input from falling off the boundary. C1 contains one hundred fifty-six trainable parameters and one hundred twenty-two thousand three hundred four connections.\nvf5h | Layer S2 is a subsampling layer with six feature maps of size fourteen by fourteen. Each unit in each feature map is connected to a two by two neighborhood in the corresponding feature map in C1. The four inputs to a unit in S2 are added, then multiplied by \nl51p | a trainable coefficient, and then added to a trainable bias. The result is passed through a sigmoidal function. The two by two receptive fields are nonoverlapping, therefore feature maps in S2 have half the number of rows and column as feature maps in C1. Layer S2 has twelve trainable parameters and five thousand eight hundred eighty connections.\ns9zz | Layer C3 is a convolutional layer with sixteen feature maps. Each unit in each feature map is connected to several five by five neighborhoods at identical locations in a subset of S2's feature maps. Table one shows the set of S2 feature maps combined by each C3 feature map. Why not connect every S2 feature map to every C3 feature map? The reason is twofold. First, a noncomplete connection scheme keeps the number of connections within reasonable bounds. More importantly, it forces a break of symmetry in the network. Different feature maps are forced to extract different, hopefully complementary, features because they get different sets of inputs. The rationale behind the connection scheme in Table one is the following. The first six C3 feature maps take inputs from every contiguous subset of three feature maps in S2. The next six take input from every contiguous subset of four. The next three take input from some discontinuous subsets of four. Finally, the last one takes input from all S2 feature maps. Layer C3 has one thousand five hundred sixteen trainable parameters and one hundred fifty-six thousand connections.\nx97k | Layer S4 is a subsampling layer with sixteen feature maps of size five by five. Each unit in each feature map is connected to a two by two neighborhood in the corresponding feature map in C3, in a similar way as C1 and S2. Layer S4 has thirty-two trainable parameters and two thousand connections.\nqwix | Layer C5 is a convolutional layer with one hundred twenty feature maps. Each unit is connected to a five by five neighborhood on all sixteen of S4's feature maps. Here, because the size of S4 is also five by five, the size of C5's feature maps is one by one; this amounts to a full connection between S4 and C5. C5 is labeled as a convolutional layer, instead of a fully connected layer, because if LeNet-Five input were made bigger with everything else kept constant, the feature map dimension would be larger than one by one. This process of dynamically increasing the size of a convolutional network is described in Section seven. Layer C5 has forty-eight thousand one hundred twenty trainable connections.\n6lnq | Layer F6 contains eighty-four units, the reason for this number comes from the design of the output layer, explained below, and is fully connected to C5. It has ten thousand one hundred sixty-four trainable parameters.\nnxb1 | As in classical neural networks, units in layers up to F6 compute a dot product between their input vector and their weight vector, to which a bias is added. This weighted sum, denoted aj for unit i, is then passed through a sigmoid\nkwpw | squashing function to produce the state of unit i, denoted by xi\nusfa | X i equals F of a i.\ndnjr | The squashing function is a scaled hyperbolic tangent\nqser | F of a equals A tangent hyperbolic of S a.\n8gam | where A is the amplitude of the function and S determines its slope at the origin. The function F is odd, with horizontal asymptotes at plus A and negative A. The constant A is chosen to be one point seven one five nine. The rationale for this choice of a squashing function is given in Appendix A.\nlw7l | Finally, the output layer is composed of Euclidean radial basis function units, one for each class, with eighty-four inputs each. The outputs of each radial basis function unit y i is computed as follows:\n2exi | y i equals the square root of P i minus W i j squared.",
