Though the theory may be simple, the process is not. Regulators have myriad levers and tactics that they can use to influence behavior directly or by manipulating the environment, and each choice in a regulatory system can and should be studied for its effectiveness, in both absolute terms and relative to less burdensome alternatives. Among the mechanisms are taxation and subsidies, changes in the information environment, changes in the built environment, and signals sent by tort litigation.\nojro | With respect to laws imposing outright prohibitions on particular behaviors, many of the key research questions relate to mechanisms of implementation and enforcement: What penalties are applied to violators of legal rules? What processes are used to detect violators? With what\nl6t9 | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health\n1ujy | degree of certainty and swiftness will sanctions ensue from a violation? Sociolegal research drawing on disciplines such as psychology, criminology, and sociology has a great deal to contribute to mechanism studies in PHLR. The psychological literature has explored contingencies of reinforcement; criminologists have fleshed out the factors influencing deterrence; and sociology research has plumbed the normative effects of standard setting. Tom Tyler's influential work, for example, has shown the importance of experiences of procedural fairness to compliance with the law.\nqzor | A classic example of compliance research in public health law is the investigation of primary versus secondary enforcement of seatbelt laws. Primary enforcement laws permit police to pull over motorists for not wearing a seatbelt, while secondary enforcement laws permit police to issue a ticket for not wearing a seatbelt only when the motorist has been pulled over for another reason. Because secondary enforcement relies primarily on social norms to enforce seatbelt use, with the threat of a ticket serving a greatly subordinate role, studies comparing these approaches to enforcement are essentially a test of the relative effectiveness of punishment versus social norms as a means of encouraging compliance. Among the most interesting findings of this PHLR is that the relative benefits of primary enforcement laws varied across population subgroups, with the greatest marginal benefit observed for those groups with lower rates of seatbelt use, including males, young people, African Americans, and Native Americans.\na0by | These and other studies make clear that deterrence is a complex phenomenon. The deterrent effect of law often seems to be assumed, without an appreciation of the factors influencing whether a person's behavior is influenced by a fear of detection or punishment. The threat of fines may have an effect different from the threat of jail. Deterrence may be weak or incomplete because people are ill informed about what the law requires, because they do not believe violation will result in a sanction, because they are insulated from the adverse effects of a sanction (e.g., by insurance coverage), or because the sanction is not strong enough to outweigh the perceived benefits of noncompliance with the law. Uncertainty about legal standards can also have the opposite effect, leading to overcompliance in an attempt to avoid sanctions. Mechanism studies can examine all these phenomena. Survey methods, interviews, focus groups, and formal decision analysis can be used to deconstruct how people think\nu1ky | through the costs and benefits of different actions. Analysis of administrative data on enforcement actions can shed light on the degree to which popular perceptions reflect what actually happens when a law is violated.\nhtm9 | Another variable of interest in mechanism studies that focus on compliance with legal rules is the perceived legitimacy of the body imposing the legal rule. Even people who are aware of the law may not trust \"the system,\" or they may see strategies other than compliance as more useful to them in achieving their goals. Studies of the perceived legitimacy of public health lawmakers and law enforcers may be particularly useful in understanding differences in compliance across population groups whose historical experience in the United States has led to different levels of trust in government.\n8hul | Mechanism studies may also investigate how law shapes behavior in ways more subtle than outright prohibitions. How do regulatory tools such as taxes and subsidies, mandated disclosure or receipt of information, default rules, accreditation and certification, and delegations of authority to private institutions shape how individuals and organizations behave? When are these alternatives more effective and desirable than traditional, command-and-control regulation using rigid rules and penalties? For many of these forms of regulation, understanding the cognitive biases and heuristics that affect individual decision making about risk is critical, and empirical research can examine how these biases influence health outcomes.\n87vz | PHLR takes a number of forms, each utilizing diverse methods. By illuminating the paths we have delineated in our logic model, these forms each play important roles in establishing how law is being deployed to promote population health, and how and to what extent it is achieving its intended purpose.\nym66 | Challenges Facing PHLR\nl0a3 | We have argued that PHLR is a distinct and important field of research but that it faces a set of challenges shared with social research of other kinds. These include increasing methodological rigor, ensuring adequate research funding, identifying data sources, and ensuring the impact of PHLR on policy. We describe how each of these challenges takes shape in PHLR and explain why we are optimistic that they can be met.\nu8nw | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health\nl2v9 | Increasing Methodological Rigor\nafbe | PHLR is part of a recent \"explosion in empirical work\" in law. Some investigators are concerned that legal scholars are producing empirical work faster than the field can create the mechanisms necessary to ensure its rigor. The fact that much PHLR is published in peer-reviewed health journals helps avoid one of the major problems confronting empirical legal studies more generally: the rarity of peer and expert editorial review in law journals. The further development of PHLR as a distinct field within empirical legal and public health research will be instrumental in defining and maintaining high standards of scientific rigor.\n78r8 | One challenge is how to draw new investigators with the right expertise into the field. Perhaps to a greater extent than other areas of empirical legal research, PHLR must grapple with how to integrate individuals who are primarily practitioners into the field. Their involvement in PHLR can improve research in many ways: practitioners bring an intimate knowledge of what the cutting-edge public health problems are and of the practical realities of policymaking and implementation, and they constitute a pipeline for putting research into practice. However, they typically lack both significant training in research methods and experience conducting empirical research. Similarly, even methodologically expert health researchers often lack any grounding in empirical legal scholarship, hampering their ability to conceptualize or measure legal influence on environments, behavior, or health outcomes.\n320g | The involvement of traditional legal scholars in PHLR raises similar challenges. Among the assets they bring to PHLR are a commitment to thinking deeply about the law's form, evolution, and function; the capacity for nuanced argument for or against particular legal approaches; and an appreciation of how social values and other normative considerations guide the law's path. Among the things they often lack are expertise in quantitative methods, an allegiance to the scientific method, and an inclination to think systematically about qualitative data collection and analysis.",
