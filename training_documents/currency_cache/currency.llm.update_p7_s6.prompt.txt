You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

21dc | Designed as a socially responsible public good, a local currency may be administered by a tax-exempt non-profit organization. Operating as a recognized non-profit organization is beneficial in terms of federal policy. For local fiat currency systems that are not pegged to the U.S. dollar, operating as a non-profit allows the currency organization to be exempt from the Securities Act of 1933 (Solomon, 1996a). Without this exemption, currency organizations would have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, abide by disclosure, privacy, and other administrative requirements, and pay related fees (Securities Act of 1933). For time banks and LETS, the IRS has provided private guidance that operating as a non-profit is a condition which might help ensure a time bank is not considered a "barter exchange" (Swennen, 2012), thus avoiding additional 1099-B reporting responsibilities under the U.S.

8zk4 | Treasury regulations (26 C.F.R. § 1.6045-1). Though nonprofits may gain trust and promote community values (Solomon, 1996b), without sufficient resources they may face difficulties in administering local currencies. In fact, nonprofit currency managers often rely on volunteer staffing and tend to use on word-of-mouth advertising rather than employing more professional marketing methods (Lepofsky & Bates, 2005; Seyfang, 2002; Williams, 1997).
8nk0 | Other federal laws apply to the look and denomination of complementary currencies. These restrictions are most applicable to proxy and fiat currency systems that print and distribute bills. The production of metal coins (18 U.S.C. § 486), money similar in look to U.S. national currency (18 U.S.C. § 491), or currencies with denominations of less than one dollar (18 U.S.C. § 336) is banned. Notably, the Supreme Court has ruled that the prohibition of denominations of less than one dollar does not apply to currencies with "only a neighborhood circulation" (United States v. Van Auken, 1877). This suggests that local currencies may be able to issue denominations of less than one dollar, but the legislation remains in the U.S. Code with no modern ruling to clarify the meaning of neighborhood circulation. As a result of these laws, printed local currencies have unique design features that set them apart from U.S. national currency. If currency systems desire coins, they may use materials other than metal to make coins, but the prohibition of denominations less than one dollar could inhibit the currency's usefulness for small purchases.
89e4 | There are at least two situations in which federal laws with administrative requirements may apply to local currency systems. LETS are considered barter exchanges (26 C.F.R. § 1.6045-1(a)(4)) in the United States and the reporting responsibilities for barter exchanges can be substantial. Specifically, the U.S. Treasury requires barter exchanges with over 100 transactions per year to issue a 1099-Bs for each transaction in excess of one dollar made by a non-corporate

gmw8 | member. LETS like the Green America Exchange, which have only business members, are able to issue 1099-Bs on an annual basis (Green America Exchange, n.d.) because their members are businesses, but LETS with individual members are required to provide the paperwork at the time of each individual exchange.
6bja | The second potential set of administrative requirements comes from the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 which applies to money transmitters. It is possible that local currency systems with electronic exchanges (e.g., LETS) may be subject to it. Businesses covered by the act must become licensed and provide reports to regulatory agencies. Though the regulation suggests that local currency systems might not fall under its reach, it states that whether or not a business is covered is "a matter of facts and circumstances" (31 CFR §1010.100(ff)(5)(ii)) without a precise explanation of what the facts and circumstances entail. FinCEN, the branch of government that enforces the act, has not provided guidance on the applicability of the act to local currencies (United States Department of the Treasury, n.d.). If the act does apply, small local currency operations could find compliance with the act burdensome.
su5i | In addition to currency managers, participants are also affected by federal policy. For a currency system to be viable, it must attract and retain members who use the currency. One major disincentive to full use of local currency is that money earned in local currency is taxable income, yet the federal and state taxes must be paid in U.S. dollars (Eisenstein, 2011). In fact, the U.S. Constitution prohibits states from accepting "any Thing but gold and silver coin" (U.S. Const. art. I, §10) as payments. Even though payment by gold and silver coin is no longer customary, it does not follow that local currency can be accepted. This provision means that users of local currency must also acquire enough U.S. dollars to pay their tax liabilities, even when the liabilities are incurred in local currency. The ability to pay taxes in a particular
15ws | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT
ss8f | currency is what validates it (Wray, 1998) and without this characteristic, local currency may struggle. Consider some fiat systems in which currency accumulates with businesses who are unable to spend it in the same amount they receive it due to the lack of commercial vendors who will accept the currency (Eisenstein, 2011; Lepofsky & Bates, 2005). As a result, the businesses may limit the amount they accept or decline to participate in the system altogether. A healthy local currency system needs participating businesses. If participating businesses could pay taxes in local currency, this problem would be diminished (Eisenstein, 2011).
6pdd | State Law
cof8 | With some notable exceptions, most states allow private local currency. Arkansas prohibits its issuance by individuals or corporations (Ark. Code Ann. § 4-17-102; Ark. Code Ann. § 4-17-103). Massachusetts bans the issuance and use of currency that is not created by a bank incorporated in the state (Mass. Gen. Laws ch 267, § 21). Lastly, Virginia prohibits issuance of local currency without specific authorization by law (Va. Code Ann. § 6.2-202). Florida and Massachusetts have state laws that prohibit counterfeiting (Solomon, 1996b), but appropriately designed community currencies would not be considered counterfeits.
2ppr | Supporting Local Currency through Policy
5ljm | Widespread use of community currency is difficult to achieve without government support (Eisenstein, 2011). After a massive review of complementary currency literature and publications, Schroeder and colleagues (2011) concluded the need for policy change to help local currencies prosper. Internationally, government support has been given to currency systems and may serve as a model for policy support in the United States. Examples of international as well as domestic policy support illustrate how government bodies can encourage local currencies.
