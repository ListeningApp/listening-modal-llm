You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

0i1k | Town Talk of 2 August said that several people had suggested that the British Government should now launch a full separate investigation into the Godber case. As against this, a UK enquiry would be a major blow to Hong Kong's amour propre.41
dqlg | This suggests that MOOD, a significant enhancement to Town Talk, was taken into account by officials in the policymaking process.
p6pq | State records on the Golden Jubilee Incident in 1977 and 1978 provided a good account of how MOOD influenced government's administration. The MOOD report was found carefully kept in one of the files on the Golden Jubilee Incident in the National Archives in London, indicating that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office did consider it an important document. Most importantly, the content found in the telegram sent by MacLehose to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on 31 May 1978 closely resem- bled the MOOD report which was published a week earlier. On 24 May, MOOD described the mixed opinions found in Hong Kong society:
zse6 | Overall public reaction was still very mixed, different people taking different sides according to their own education background, convictions and basic attitudes. The government's publicity efforts to redress the balance during the next few days were successful to some extent in enabling the public to see the situation in better perspective .... Unfortunately, this message came rather late and the more critical sectors of the public were inclined to be incredulous ....
p2n3 | There was still not much support for the 16 teachers. Only radical students, free thinkers and critics of the government sympathized with them. However, there was much more sympathy towards the displaced students whose schooling had been thus disrupted .... Secondary and post-secondary students were inclined to criticize the closure of the school as suppressive and Draconian action.42
ohh7 | Similar records were found in the Governor's telegram:
vbni | Vocal opinion is split fairly down the middle between those supporting and those opposing the Government's action. Much of the criticism is directed at the closure itself and appears to have derived from sympathy for the pupils whose education has been disrupted .... There has not been much public sympathy for the 16 teachers who claimed to have been victimized for revealing financial mismanagement of the school .... Nevertheless, the revelation of this earlier complaint has understandably caused confusion and some damage to the Education Department and government's credibility. Some people have clearly found it difficult to believe the true situation.43
dgcw | MOOD's account, which suggested that the secondary and post-secondary students were 'particularly sensitive and resentful to any government measure which appeared to them to be high-handed or dictatorial', was clearly being taken into consideration by the Education Department.44 In encountering the tutorial classes organized by radical post-secondary stu- dents, the non-interventionist approach was deliberately taken by the Department as it was believed that 'to do so [intervene] would have brought post-secondary students directly into the arena'.45 The Department instead offered to place Golden Jubilee students in other schools. To ensure that 'decisions would be taken on an intelligent understanding of com- munity aspirations and sensitivities' and that decisions would respond to the call for 'more opportunities for public consultation', a Committee of Inquiry was set up.46 A 'public invi- tation' was issued to invite Hong Kong citizens to share their views on the incident.47 Lord Goronwy-Roberts was also aware of the public confusion stated in MOOD. To reduce 'prevailing tension and distrust', he recommended the Director of Education to 'make pub- lic his findings of the financial mismanagement' of the school and make clarifications regarding the school's closure and its change of sponsorship.48 These records suggest that MOOD had influenced the state's ruling strategies.
gvwz | The credibility of MOOD was always questioned. The Commissioner for Census and Statistics, for example, pointed out that the 'MOOD method has areas where it can be improved', such as the choice of samples and statisticians' conduct.49 As better-informed respondents were contacted frequently, reports did not 'truly reflect the attitudes and thinking of an average citizen or a man in the street'.50 In no way was MOOD a wholly representative sample which revealed comprehensive views of a cross-section of com- munities in Hong Kong. Issued on a weekly basis, there was insufficient time for thor- ough investigations.51 Another criticism of MOOD was that it could be biased. Officials used MOOD as 'an axe of their own to grind'.52 City District Officers' and monitors' personal opinions distorted public attitudes. People who were approached may also have been reserved, knowing that the MOOD monitor was a civil servant.
sk5m | As MOOD was 'not comparable with that of a professional public opinion survey and exact accuracy is not claimed', the administration sought to improve its methodologies,
qws8 | which reinforces the view that MOOD was valuable to bureaucrats.53 Its highly restric- tive nature also suggests that its findings were acknowledged and handled carefully. Archival evidence indicates that MOOD was a sizable unit with a clear chain of account- ability (see Figure 1).54 Records also reveal that the Home Affairs Department was sys- tematic in observing and soliciting public opinion. Each MOOD exercise began with the debriefing given by the Deputy Director at the Home Affairs Department Headquarters. Policy papers were provided to ensure MOOD Officers, who were nominated by City District Officers, had 'an intelligent and accurate understanding of the subject [topic]'. Similar documents were disseminated to the Community Information Unit in the Home Affairs Department, which consisted of six experienced liaison civil servants. During each meeting, the City District Officers were given a topic and the number of respond- ents required. On the next day, every City District Officer, assisted by his or her MOOD Officer, held a meeting to explain and discuss the subject with the district MOOD team.55
877u | To reach the grass roots, the MOOD staff then created samples using data supplied by Mutual Aid Committees and kaifong associations, by liaising with community leaders. Each monitor had a 50-person contact list, of which every week, one-third of the people were removed from the list and replaced by new contacts. On special occasions, the City District Officers could add previous contacts to the list and use them more than once.56 The Community Information Unit also monitored comments made through the mass media and attempted to determine the sentiments of groups and areas that were poten- tially sensitive, such as coolies and hawkers in some circumstances. It also conducted random sampling through telephone calls, using the data provided by the Census and Statistics Department.57 Each MOOD drew data from approximately 2500 people.58 MOOD also advised its staff to be indirect and pay close attention to their interviewing techniques. This avoided giving the impression of surveillance and could 'take the
rzhj | respondents off their guards'.59 When the reports were returned, the City District Officers convened a meeting in which findings were checked, discussed, analysed, and compiled in note form. The officers had to provide details of the respondents, including age group, class, educational background, type of residence, gender, and occupation. A final MOOD meeting, attended by all MOOD Officers, the Deputy Director and Assistant Director, was then held at the Home Affairs Department Headquarters. During the meeting, feed- back collected from all districts was examined as a whole and compared with data obtained by the Community Information Unit.60 An editor analysed all findings to pro- duce one MOOD report for circulation. In 1975, MOOD was printed on every Thursday for circulation on Friday.61 In 1977, MOOD became a biweekly report.62
