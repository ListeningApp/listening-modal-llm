Conditions for assumptions to be satisfied. We now discuss the conditions under which Assumptions one through four are satisfied for the perturbed Langevin dynamics, which correspond here as well to standard results in the literature.\nd2za | For Langevin dynamics, the momentum space is always unbounded, so the choice for the Lyapunov function to satisfy the condition depends on the position space. For compact position spaces, it suffices to choose script K sub n left parenthesis P right parenthesis equals one plus absolute value of P superscript n. For unbounded position spaces, there are various possible choices. One possibility is to consider\nr38m | script K sub n left parenthesis Q, P right parenthesis equals left parenthesis one plus H left parenthesis Q, P right parenthesis minus V sub minus plus the fraction of gamma over two P transpose M inverse Q plus the fraction of gamma squared over four Q transpose M inverse Q right parenthesis superscript n, under the following conditions: the potential energy function V is bounded from below by V sub minus greater than negative infinity, and there exist A, B greater than zero and C in the reals such that\nqq0z | Q transpose M inverse nabla V left parenthesis Q right parenthesis is greater than or equal to A V left parenthesis Q right parenthesis plus B Q transpose M inverse Q plus C. The existence of an invariant probability measure in Assumption one can be shown using Lyapunov techniques when a minorization condition holds. It can be shown that the dynamics has a unique invariant measure, as psi sub zero has positive density with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Thus, since the generator script L sub eta is hypoelliptic, it follows that trajectorial ergodicity holds.\nrgva | Assumption two holds as discussed.\nmlcd | Assumption three holds under some conditions on the potential V, which include see for a precise discussion.\n2qe7 | Lastly, Assumption four is trivially satisfied, as tilde script L sub P H Y S equals F transpose nabla sub P is stable by script S, and tilde script L sub P H Y S one equals zero recall the discussion around.\nlpzf | Two point two. Transport coefficients and their numerical approximations. We discuss in this section how to compute transport coefficients such as the mobility, thermal conductivity and shear viscosity, in the context of linear response theory. We outline in Section two point two point one the theoretical framework of linear response theory, discuss regularity and well-posedness conditions, and state some technical results. We then discuss standard numerical techniques for computing transport coefficients in Section two point two point two. We finally discuss the paradigmatic example of mobility in Section two point two point three, which is the running example we use to theoretically illustrate our framework.\n24rz | Two point two point one.
