        "content": "3mf9 | · As habitat heterogeneity increases and more bird species are added, these have to separate on an increasing number of niche dimensions, particularly:\nz2rd | > Food type, Foraging techniques, Foraging height, Micro-habitat type\nvqld | Biogeography - The Species-Area Model One\nljmz | · When increasing the area A from which one samples various species populations, the total species number S increases in a positive way according to the following logarithmic deterministic model: S equals C times A raised to the power of Z. Areas equals Oceanic islands or Habitat islands on mainlands\nen1l | . Factors that specifically contribute to the S-Area relationship are:\n45gx | One. Large islands are also subject to larger sampling sizes of individuals N from species populations thereby increasing the probability of encountering new species; hence a mere sampling phenomenon or artefact of more effective species sampling as N increases\nxgur | Two. As the island size increases, the probability of encountering different habitat types also increases: High landscape heterogeneity: Lakes, mountains, valleys, swamps, oases etc., and such features contain more potential niches that can be filled by species\niz66 | Biogeography - The Species-Area Model Two\ndndq | Three. Large islands inevitably also contain large populations, and large populations are less vulnerable to local extinction phenomena such as predation, parasites, pathogens\nxzce | Four. Large island populations also have higher speciation potentials due to higher population variability contained herein, high polymorphism and resource use diversity\nw4vd | Five. Large islands inevitably represent larger targets for colonizing species immigration as the probability of encountering the area increases with size\ncuh0 | Biogeography - The Species-Area Model Three\nk36t | · The normal range of Z is zero point two zero to zero point four zero for true oceanic islands and often around zero point two five.\nz1wx | · Z is only zero point one to zero point two five for recently isolated habitat islands such as forest surrounded by farms, a lake, a gap in the forest, or an oasis.\no6gf | · Z greater than zero point two six for long-term isolated habitats on the mainland or very large islands such as Australia.\n0hs6 | · As habitat connectivity increases, the S-Area relationship is reduced, resulting in a low z-value\nm05x | · Habitat connectivity is related to habitat diversity and as oceanic islands are more isolated than mainland habitat islands, they display stronger S-Area relationship high z-value\nds29 | Biogeography - The Species-Area Model Four\nqcmr | · Logging both sides of the S-Area power function:\n7c6p | log S equals log C plus z log A\nd1ee | · C and Z are constants depending on both habitat type, animal community and are specific to variability in dispersability and mobility of the species herein.\nitx4 | . In a x-y logarithmic plot, log C is the intercept on the y-axis, and z denotes the graph slope.\nvwrs | . The z-value denotes how strong the S and A relationship is positive correlation.\nxjkw | MacArthur-Wilson's Equilibrium Theory One\nwght | · Modelling species number S on true islands: S depends on two independent variables: One. Immigration rate I Two. Extinction rate E\n3lgb | · S is determined when an equilibrium between I and E rates is obtained\nttwt | · As S increases, I rate is lowered one as potential niche space is occupied saturation\nx5l2 | . In contrast when S î then E rate increases due to increased interspecific competition\nilrs | . Small islands have high E and low I rates: They are small targets and have small vulnerable populations; the opposite is the case for large islands; high I and low E\n0a03 | Immigration rate I\nauae | · Distance to mainland also a factor for I rate: Distance islands have low I and close islands have higher I.\n5b6y | . Thus, S is highest on large islands nearby mainland D, and smallest on small islands far from the mainland A\n1y10 | MacArthur-Wilson's Equilibrium Theory Two\n6mnx | . Extinction Rate: Depends on One Island Size, Two Distance to mainland isolation degree\ntynp | · Island Size: Large islands have larger populations, hence genetic population variability is high and populations therefore more resilient towards predators, diseases, and stochastic detrimental events such as storms, tsunamis, floods, drought etc.\nob0u | · Distance to mainland: If close to mainland, extinctions may be delayed by regular immigration, thus compensating for the species loss over time\n50o1 | MacArthur-Wilson's Equilibrium Theory Three\ncw76 | · Immigration Rate: Depends on One Island Size, Two Distance to mainland\nlkk5 | · Island Size: A large island represents a greater target for colonisers resulting in higher probability of colonization.\nmolj | · Distance to mainland: If the distance is short, the likeliness of species colonizing from the mainland is higher than for more remote islands, to which many species may have difficulties in reaching successfully depending on mobility and dispersability of animals.\n5pto | · In effect species number is highest on large islands close to the mainland and smallest on small islands far away remote isolated from the mainland\nmo6k | Modelling Species Number on Habitat Islands\nzh6q | . On habitat islands, species numbers depend on: One Speciation rate and Two Extinction rate\nkp04 | · Immigration plays a minor role on the large scale and is replaced by speciation processes.\n3e8r | . However, if habitat connectivity is high between islands, immigration from species rich areas is important in ecological time frame; speciation only evolutionary time frame\n8g7g | Speciation Rate\n5j4f | · Fewer empty niches reduce the chances of adaptive radiation by virtue of reducing character displacement processes\n4xe7 | Extinction Rate\npg4b | As species saturation increases interspecific competition increases extinction rate through the competitive exclusion principle similarly to true islands\nb0d0 | Summary - Niche Partitioning and Species Richness One\nd7eu | One. Species richness and the niche concept are interrelated and determined by:\nxndr | . Niche dimensionality and differentiation: Related to habitat heterogeneity\nm6hi | . Niche width and shape: Narrow and leptokurtic niches increase diversity\nvpkf | · Niche overlap and competitive coefficient: Complementarity increase S\n4d67 | Two. Species richness and niches also interrelated with the habitat\ne7j2 | · Habitat complexity: Both vertical and horizontal heterogeneity increase S\nlqzt | · Habitat area: Large and interconnected habitat areas increase richness\n1ocm | Summary - Niche Partitioning and Species Richness\n527v | Three. The species-area model explains the number of species on islands\nlrri | S equals C times A raised to the power of z. True islands: z-value higher than on mainland islands\n5cl9 | z equals zero point two zero to zero point four zero approximately zero point two five. Mainland islands: Lower than for true islands z equals zero point one zero to zero point two five, greater than zero point two six. Lakes: Similar to mainland islands but largely depends on connecting rivers.\nu7a3 | Four. The theory of island biogeography and species richness depend on\nw409 | · Area size: Large size has larger populations and higher habitat heterogeneity\nm04y | · Distance to mainland: Nearness results in Higher colonization rate\n23jk | S increases. · Habitat connectivity: Low connectivity means lower colonization rate\noa63 | · Speciation-extinction dynamics: Related to time and population size or area\ne3lv | Lecture Seven - Foraging Theory\nrqv6 | What is Optimal Foraging Theory, O P T ?\noa48 | . It is a behavioral ecology model that helps predict how an animal behaves when searching for food\n3fp1 | Aim of the Optimal Foraging Theory\n557x | · To predict the foraging strategy of a forager or predator to be expected under specified conditions\nep8e | Important terminologies\n7mv3 | . Ideal Free Distribution theory - theory which makes a case of uniform distribution of food for predators such that there is no need for foragers to switch foraging patches.\nder6 | · Functional response - deals with a predator's intake rate in response to variation in prey distribution and densities",
