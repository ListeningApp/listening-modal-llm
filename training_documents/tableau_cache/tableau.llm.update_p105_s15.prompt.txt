You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

2jap | · Strings: This includes options to find characters, measure string length, split and parse fields, and match character strings
bvr5 | Chapter 5
9epd | . Date: This includes functions for duration, the addition and subtraction of dates, the truncation of dates, and the identification of date parts
yt8f | . Type conversion: This allows you to convert fields into different types without modifying the metadata of the source field
5rn1 | . Logical: This includes the powerful IF, CASE, and ISNULL and allows you to tell Tableau Public how to group fields or relate them to parameters
pv88 | . Aggregate calculations: These are the most commonly used functions; they include sum, count, avg, min, max, and median
qhnu | . User functions: These are more commonly used for Tableau Server rather than Tableau Public; they allow you to create calculated fields that operate on usernames or groups
ibdj | . Table calculation: This will be detailed in the next chapter; it allows you to compute aggregations based on data points that are visible in the current window
799w | The number functions
r3vu | Number functions include several functions that you may be familiar with owing to working with applications such as ROUND and ABS. Many of us may not have used several of these functions, such as the trigonometric and exponential functions, since our high school math class. There are some number functions that we will use extensively, such as MIN and MAX, while there are others that have limited uses, such as the geometric and trigonometric functions.
k899 | Number functions include the following, in order of decreasing precedence:
29to | . ABS: This takes the absolute value of a number. It is commonly found in the denominator of table calculations.
0bo0 | . CEILING: This rounds up a decimal to its nearest integer and is the opposite of INT.
sbs5 | · FLOOR: This rounds a decimal down to its nearest integer.
einv | . MAX and MIN: These take the maximum and minimum values in a sequence respectively. They are also considered to be string functions.
1vda | . ROUND: This allows you to specify how many decimals to round up a float number to.
zfos | · ZN: This is predominantly found in table calculations. It tells Tableau Public that if a numeric field has a NULL value, you want to replace it with zero.
gzuq | . DIV: This produces the whole number product of a division statement.
crr5 | . PI: This produces the numeric value of pi.
a0je | . SIGN: This produces a numeric value (1, 0, or 01) based on the input, which may be positive, zero, or negative respectively.
egcq | . Trigonometric and geometric functions: These are largely beyond the scope of this book. These functions include ACOS, ASIN, ATAN, ATAN2, COS, COT, DEGREES, RADIANS, SIN, and TAN as well as HEXBINX and HEXBINY.
klw0 | . Exponential and logarithmic functions: These functions include EXP, LN, LOG, POWER, SQRT, and SQUARE.
uhd3 | The date functions
9ivc | The date functions are useful for a variety of tasks, such as identifying the elapsed time between two events or a part of a date.
dd00 | Many date functions in Tableau Public operate on dateparts. Dateparts are the small units of measurement of dates, such as a year, quarter, month, week, day, and the units of time, such as an hour, a minute, and a second. Writing date functions in Tableau Public is similar to writing date functions in ANSI SQL or Microsoft Excel with a big difference- dateparts need to be spelled out and enclosed in single quotation marks, which is a relatively simple design and use of punctuation for a programming language.
n9f1 | The most commonly performed analysis is the measurement of change over time, and the prevalence of date functions is high. Therefore, it is worth the time and effort to master them early on in your work with Tableau Public.
o0ah | The date functions include the following functions:
tblh | . DATEADD: This adds numeric values, which can be hard-coded or variable, in a specific number of dateparts to a date.
e3h8 | . DATEDIFF: This calculates the elapsed number of specified dateparts between two dates.
5e6c | . DATENAME: This produces the name of the specified datepart of a date. An example that demonstrates the implementation of this function is, DATENAME ( 'month', #7/21/2015#) = "July".
ghh6 | . DATEPARSE: This turns a string into a date in the format that you specify.
ddky | Chapter 5
7y2m | . DATEPART: This is similar to DATENAME. It returns the datepart of a specified date but returns a numeric value. An example that demonstrates the implementation of this function is, DATEPART ( 'month', #7/21/2015#) = 7.
xmzo | . DATETRUNC: This rounds up a date to the first date of the datepart that you specify. An example that demonstrates how to implement this function is, DATETRUNC ('month, #7/21/2015#) = '7/1/2015'.
c3ng | . DAY: This returns the day of the month of a given date. An example that demonstrates how to implement this function is, DAY (#7/21/2015#) = 21.
9dle | . ISDATE: This tests whether a string that you enter is actually a date and produces a Boolean value (true or false).
xhxk | . MONTH: This produces the numerical month of a date.
kidv | . TODAY and NOW: These produce the date and datetime of the current moment by using the time settings on your computer.
zawm | . YEAR: This produces the year of the current date.
6apv | In the following example, we will use the floods data to determine the number of years that have elapsed since the last major flood. Most of the countries have had many floods and not just one. Therefore, we used the maximum value of Date Began, which is the most recent date in the data set, and compared it with today's date.
w9mq | We could have omitted the max from the Date Began, but for each country, Tableau Public would have then aggregated the elapsed time per country, and we really wanted to know how long it has been since the most recent flood, as shown in the following screenshot:
p2ic | Type conversions
dz65 | We will begin with type conversions because you cannot create properly functioning calculated fields without having the fields in the right format. For instance, aggregations work on numeric fields, string functions work on strings, and date functions work on dates. Tableau Public automatically identifies the type of field based on its contents, but this may not meet your needs to aggregate or create calculations. Publicly available data sources, such as the ones available at http://public.tableau.com/s/resources, often have issues with either the format or the quality of the data. This will make it necessary for you to convert fields into different types, and it is quite likely that you will need to strip bad data and identify replacement values as well.
4lxl | If you are familiar with relational database management, you are probably aware that there are many different field types, some of which are used to govern the field length within a database. Tableau Public focuses on the three primary field types, namely; string, which can be anything; numeric fields, which include integers and float fields; and datetime fields; which include the DATETIME, DATE, and TIME field formats.
iqju | You can convert a field to another type by creating a calculated field and wrapping it in the appropriate function. In case fields are of the same parent form or are interchangeable, you can right-click on the field name, select Change Data Type, and then choose the appropriate type. If you do need to change the format manually, you can use the following functions:
