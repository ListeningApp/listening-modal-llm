        "content": "m4cb | The digestibility of starch is an important factor in determining the availability of glucose in feed formulations. The enzyme alpha-amylase hydrolyses starch into maltose. Additional enzymes, maltase and isomaltase, then hydrolyse maltose further into glucose. These enzymes are present in the gastrointestinal tract of fish and shrimp but their activity and effectiveness vary between species. Data are limited for crustacean species but in fish, a reduction in digestibility is observed when the dietary level of starch increases, irrespective of the starch origin.\nm61y | According to Stone the reduction in the digestibility of carbohydrates when dietary levels increase may be the result of an overload on the digestive enzymes that become saturated with substrate. The threshold for enzyme saturation by substrate is unknown in crustaceans and it is not apparent in the data shown in Table Two.\nu2ob | Herbivorous species of fish have high activity and efficacy of starch degrading enzymes. Omnivorous species have moderate activity whilst carnivores have only a limited ability to digest starch.\n2gnm | Since cellulase is quite rare in the animal kingdom, it is generally believed that the source of cellulase in decapod crustaceans is exogenous - symbiotic organisms living in the hepatopancreas. Even so, Yokoe and Yasumasu found more cellulase activity in hepatopancreas extracts from Procambarus clarkii than shown by Gram-negative bacteria living in the digestive tract.\nemgw | Three point three. Lipases and esterases\nxaqt | Lipids, like carbohydrates and proteins, are cleaved by hydrolysis reactions. Otherwise, lipid digestion and absorption are fundamentally different because lipid is not water soluble and coalesces into large droplets in water. The low surface-to-volume ratio of a large lipid droplet is not conducive to effective digestion by lipases, and so emulsification is extremely important for lipid digestion. Emulsification stabilizes small lipid droplets in\n5rcb | aqueous solution by coating them with molecules that are partly hydrophobic (to dissolve in the lipid droplet) and partly hydrophilic (to dissolve in water).\n524j | Vertebrates produce bile in their livers, which flows into the small intestine. Bile salts are moderately effective emulsifying agents and become much more effective in concert with polar lipids such as monoglycerides (the digestive products of triglycerides) and phospholipids.\nxd3m | Invertebrates do not produce bile. Lipase enzymes attach to lipid droplets which form an emulsion and hydrolyse triglycerides to two-monoglycerides, some glycerol and free fatty acids. Phospholipids play a significant role in lipid emulsification in crustaceans.\n8qb6 | Lipases which are capable of hydrolysing triglycerides and phospholipids have been observed in several species of shrimp. Due to their function, lipases are commonly named esterases, although they almost exclusively hydrolyse carboxylic esters.\nwkbn | The presence of real lipases in the shrimp hepatopancreas has been a point of disagreement among specialists working on the physiology and biochemistry of these species, since most of the techniques employed in their study cannot establish whether the lipolytic activity found was due to real lipases or to non-specific esterases.\nftfg | Both triglyceride lipase and phospholipase have been observed in Litopenaeus vannamei. A comparison of substrate specificity of lipases from Litopenaeus schmitti indicated a strong preference for N-three (omega-three) and N-six (omega-six) fatty acids. Studies of lipases from Litopenaeus vannamei, Farfantepenaeus californiensis and Farfantepenaeus notialis, showed similar preferences. Note, with the exception of the land snail (Cepaea nemoralis) animals are incapable of de novo synthesis of fatty acids with double bonds in the N-six (linoleic series) and N-three (linolenic series) positions; only plants are able to synthesize these fatty acids de novo.\n7xi5 | Lipases and esterases are associated with the microvilli of R-cells as well as vacuoles of F-cells, the lumen of the hepatopancreas tubules and in intertubular connective tissue.\nw8r5 | Four. Changes in enzyme activity\nybik | Large changes in enzyme activity are observed during moulting (e.g. trypsin and chitinase). Chitinase digests the old exoskeleton so it can be resorbed and replaced by newly synthesized chitin. The production of digestive enzymes also seems to vary throughout the year and even within a species, depending upon the available nutrient resources or stage of development. The Caridean shrimp (Crangon crangon) has high trypsin activity during the summer and low activity during the winter.\ngii5 | Adjustments to diet composition for proteases, lipolytic enzymes and amylase have been shown for many species. The responses vary among species. In some species, responses are seen in proteolytic and amylase activity but not in lipolytic activity, but for other species, amylase and/or protease activity seem unresponsive. A high dietary starch content was found to increase the specific activity of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase in Litopenaeus vannamei. The same species has shown variation in trypsin and chymotrypsin activity with variation in protein level. The magnitude of the stimulation seems to depend on the species and the dietary protein source.\nq5eu | Digestive enzymes seem to be released from the hepatopancreas upon feeding. Passage of food from the midgut to the stomach has been found to induce additional synthesis and secretion of enzymes. The release of digestive enzymes by the hepatopancreas is influenced by the endocrine system. For example, crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone induces the release of proteases and amylases from the hepatopancreas; this organ is also responsive to a variety of vertebrate gastrointestinal hormones.\na7ao | Five.
