Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

gy8c | conservation of the metal ligands, is that the mononuclear copper center observed in the M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO crystal structure may not be conserved in pMMOs from other methanotrophs.8 A caveat to this discussion is that, although the EXAFS samples did not photoreduce during data collection, we cannot exclude the possibility of instantaneous photoreduction upon exposure to X-rays, which would complicate a comparison of EPR and EXAFS data.
y4mj | In the first scenario (scenario 1 in Figure 3), the dicopper center is occupied by EPR silent, antiferromag- netically coupled Cu"Cu" and the mononuclear copper site is CuII, giving rise to the type 2 signal. Upon reduction, the dinuclear site would be converted to Cu'Cu", explain- ing the increase in the Cu-Cu distance observed by EXAFS. However, the XANES spectra indicate the presence of CuI in the as-isolated pMMO, which would only be consistent with this model if the zinc site were loaded with Cu". If the mononuclear copper site is not present in all pMMOs, the spectroscopic data are not compatible with scenario 1. Another possibility (scenario 2 in Figure 3) is that the dicopper site is Cu'Cu" and the mononuclear copper site is EPR-active CuII. The zinc site could be occupied by either Cul or Cu". If pMMOs from other organisms have the dicopper and zinc sites and lack the mononuclear copper site, the zinc site would have to be occupied by Cul. One issue with this scenario is that the increase in the Cu-Cu distance upon reduction would have to be attributed to a change other than redox chemistry. Finally, the dicopper center could be a trapped valence CulCu" site (scenario 3 in Figure 3). The type 2 signal would then derive from the dicopper site, and reduction would result in the loss of the EPR signal as well as an increase in the Cu-Cu distance. Copper at the mononuclear and zinc sites could either be Cul or Cu". Because site-directed mu- tagenesis is currently not an option for pMMO, which is obtained directly from methanotrophs9 rather than from

a0mb | In Search of the Active Site
ki8m | Subunit Localization. Prior to the crystal structure, experiments using radiolabeled acetylene, a suicide sub- strate, were used to probe the active-site location. In three different studies, the 24 kDa pmoA subunit was labeled.24,36,37 Similar studies with the related enzyme ammonia mo- nooxygenase are consistent with this result, with a 28 kDa subunit acquiring the label.38,39 Some labeling of the 47 kDa pmoB subunit was also observed.24 The labeling is believed to derive from an activated acetylene intermedi- ate that covalently modifies residues in the active site or nearby.37 These data thus suggest that the active site is located in the pmoA subunit with perhaps some involve- ment of pmoB. According to the crystal structure, pmoA is the least involved in metal coordination, contributing only Glu 195 to the zinc site. If the zinc site represents the location of the active site, it is curious that pmoC, which contributes the other three ligands, is not modified. One way to explain the acetylene-labeling results is to consider a cluster of hydrophilic residues in pmoA adja- cent to the zinc site (Figure 4).8,14 These residues, which include His 38, Met 42, Asp 47, Asp 49, and Glu 100 as well as Glu 154 from pmoC, are highly conserved and could conceivably form a metal-binding site that was depleted during purification and/or crystallization. Label- ing of pmoB is easier to rationalize because both the mono- and dinuclear copper centers are located within this subunit.
km8w | The structural data offer an explanation for why pmoA and pmoB might both be labeled. Dalton and co-workers suggest that the side "holes" observed in the cryo-EM and

iwn5 | crystal structures represent a route for substrate entry.16 These openings are near the pmoB dicopper center as well as the zinc site and adjacent pmoA hydrophilic cluster. One possibility is that labeled acetylene products diffuse to the two locations, exploiting these "holes". Diffusion between these sites in pmoB and pmoA may be further enhanced by two adjacent cavities (Figure 5). The first is lined by several conserved hydrophobic residues, includ- ing Pro 94 from pmoB and Leu 78, Ile 163, and Val 164 from pmoC. The second includes some of the same residues and extends to the zinc site.14 Although these observations do not address the exact location of the active site, they do help solve the puzzle of the acetylene labeling data. A corollary to this argument is that the active site probably is not located at the pmoB mononuclear copper center because there is not an obvious path for diffusion of acetylene intermediates from this location to the pmoA subunit.
uooz | Active-Site Identity. Detailed knowledge of the identity, coordination environment, and oxidation state of the active site is critical to understand how pMMO activates O2. There are five possibilities for the active site: the pmoB mononuclear copper center, the pmoC/pmoA zinc center, the pmoB dinuclear copper center, the pmoA hydrophilic cluster, and the trinuclear cluster proposed by Chan and co-workers. At this juncture, the mononuclear copper site in pmoB seems unlikely because all of the ligands to the metal at this site are not conserved.8 Because no evidence for a trinuclear copper cluster was found in the crystal structure, we will not consider this option either, although methane hydroxylation at such a site has been investigated recently by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.40 There is currently no evidence for metal binding at the pmoA hydrophilic cluster either. The remaining two options, the pmoC/pmoA zinc center and the pmoB dinuclear copper center, warrant further discussion.
pxbq | O2 Activation at a Mononuclear Copper Center. Even though the pmoB mononuclear copper site has been discounted, the possibility of O2 activation at a mono- nuclear copper center remains if the pmoC/pmoA zinc center contains copper in vivo. In considering this site, it
jfsr | is important to note that the ligands will likely be different from those coordinating zinc in the crystal structure. For example, several potential copper ligands, such as Met 199 from pmoA, are in the vicinity. Binding and activation of O2 occurs at mononuclear copper centers in the enzymes peptidylglycine a-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM), which hydroxylates the Ca atom of a terminal glycine residue, and dopamine ß-hydroxylase (DBM), which con- verts dopamine to norepinephrine.41 In PHM, there are two noncoupled mononuclear copper centers, CuA and Cup, that are separated by 11 Å. Substrate and O2 bind at the Cup site, which is coordinated by two histidines, a methionine, and a solvent molecule.42 Crystals of PHM soaked with substrate analogues under reducing condi- tions show electron density at the Cup site that is best modeled as O2. Surprisingly, O2 binds with an end-on n1 geometry, with distances of 2.1 and 2.8 Å from the copper ion to the two oxygen atoms.43 This crystallographic model is consistent with biochemical and computational data, suggesting that Cu"-superoxide is the reactive species, 44-46 as well as with the recent characterization of an end-on 71 superoxo-Cu" complex that is able to hydroxylate and hydroperoxylate phenols.47
u15r | Could a similar species be important in pMMO? One difference is that the C-H bond dissociation energy in methane is 104 kcal/mol as compared to 87 kcal/mol for the PHM substrate.46 In addition, DFT calculations suggest that Cu"-superoxide cannot abstract a hydrogen atom from methane.48 On the basis of calculations using a model with two imidazoles and one acetate to mimic the pmoB monocopper center, Yoshizawa and Shiota propose a mechanism for methane hydroxylation involving a Cu1"1-oxo reactive species.48 According to their hypothesis, the initial reaction of Cul with O2 results in Cu"-super- oxide, which is converted to Cu"-hydroperoxide by hy- drogen atom transfer from a tyrosine residue in the active site. Abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a second tyrosine would then yield the Cu""-oxo species and a water molecule. The idea that tyrosine residues are involved derives from mechanistic proposals for PHM and DBM,46 which have actually been ruled out by mutagen- esis data.49 Yoshizawa and Shiota invoke participation of specific tyrosine residues near the pmoB mononuclear copper center. Their proposal could be modified to apply to the zinc site because two conserved tyrosines, Tyr 196 from pmoA and Tyr 178 from pmoC, are adjacent. At present, these ideas remain highly speculative.
lq35 | O2 Activation at a Dinuclear Copper Center. The case for the dicopper center as the active site is stronger than that for a monocopper center for several reasons. First, all of the ligands to this site are highly conserved. Second, the existence of the dicopper center is clear from both EXAFS29 and crystallographic data.14 In contrast, the pmoB monocopper center observed in the crystal structure may not be conserved, and the existence of a monocopper center at the crystallographic zinc site has not been established definitively. Third, a bis(u-oxo)dicopper core in copper-loaded zeolites has been demonstrated to oxidize methane selectively.50 Fourth, there is ample

a3td | precedence for O2 binding and activation at dinuclear copper centers. In tyrosinase and catechol oxidase, di- copper centers catalyze the hydroxylation of tyrosine and the conversion of catechols to quinones, respectively. The active sites in these enzymes differ from the pMMO dicopper center, in that the two copper ions are ligated by six rather than three histidines and the Cu-Cu distances are longer.51 In these enzymes, the active species is likely to be a side-on u-72:12 peroxo dicopper(II) complex.52,53 The isoelectronic species in which the peroxo O-O bond is cleaved to yield a bis(u-oxo)dicopper(III) complex has been characterized in model compounds, although not yet in biology. Interconversion between the bis (u-oxo)di- copper(III) and u-72:12 peroxo dicopper(II) cores has been observed for many synthetic systems and is the subject of several theoretical studies.54-56
ex5k | Could one of these moieties be involved in methane oxidation by pMMO? By analogy to the above enzymes and model complexes, O2 could react with a dicopper(I) center in pMMO to yield either a u-12:72 peroxo dicop- per(II) or a bis(u-oxo)dicopper(III) species. Injection of an electron might then generate the mixed valent bis(u- oxo) Cu"Cu"" complex, which has been suggested to be more reactive (Figure 6).30,57 Yoshizawa and Shiota have investigated this possibility by computational methods.48,58 Using a dicopper model ligated by three imidazoles and one acetate, their results suggest that the mixed valent species is more reactive than the bis(u-oxo)dicopper(III) species and better suited to activation of the C-H bond in methane. Although the mixed valent species is similar in reactivity to the mononuclear Cu(III)-oxo complex, its formation is energetically more favorable.48 One important caveat to these results is that the assumed starting model may not represent the dinuclear copper center accurately. In particular, residue Glu 35 is modeled as a ligand, although its side-chain oxygen atoms are >4 Å from the copper ions in the crystallographic model (Figure 2B). In addition, the Cu-Cu distance of 2.65 Å in reduced pMMO is significantly shorter than that the >4 Å Cu-Cu distance observed in reduced catechol oxidase and tyrosinase.51

A similar mechanism was computed for the bis (u-oxo)Cu"Cul" complex.48 Chan and co- workers have investigated the pMMO mechanism using M. capsulatus (Bath) membrane preparations. Hydroxy- lation of both chiral ethane59 and chiral butane60 proceeds with the retention of the configuration. These data combined with hydrogen/deuterium kinetic isotope ef- fects are consistent with a concerted, nonradical mech- anism.59,60 In other studies, the absence of a carbon kinetic isotope effect for propane oxidation was inter- preted as evidence of minimal structural change at the carbon center during transition-state formation in the rate-limiting step.61
