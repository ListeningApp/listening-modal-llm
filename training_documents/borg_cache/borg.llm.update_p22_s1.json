        "content": "f682 | interactions reflect the long-term goals and aims of a system. This in turn would result in a system which not only responds to the prompts it is given but which initiates interesting content-driven interaction on its own, displaying a kind of stability and consistency in its linguistic and non-linguistic actions that we might take to be reflective of having a point of view or character. Whether or not suitably extended LLMs could come to display this kind of behaviour is unclear, but I suggest that we should be wary in advance about whether it is behaviour we want to bring about. For a system which was able to interact with its environment including its human environment in this point-of-view driven way would surely be a system which was in the running for moral consideration. Rich embedding in an environment, the pursuit of long-term goals and the making of consistent judgements are not, I've suggested here, things which we should require of a system prior to treating its outputs as genuinely meaningful, though they are the kinds of capacities required prior to the attribution of properties like understanding and consciousness.\nli1k | Five. Conclusion\npbea | First, I think that LLM outputs are deserving of attributions of semantic content since they comprise well-formed sentences of meaningful human languages. As such they express type-level content, through a process of semantic deference and derived intentionality. Second, whether we take large language models to grasp the semantic content their outputs express will depend on what we say about the representational properties of the internal states of the system and the properties that are relevant for how the system manipulates those internal states. If all that matters for internal transitions turns out to be the distributional properties of expressions, then I think we should refrain from saying that LLMs represent semantic properties or have any level of understanding of meaning. The surprising fact will then be that a system which lacks any kind of linguistic understanding can behave as if it has linguistic understanding. On the other hand, there may be teleological or other accounts of content under which the internal states of LLMs can be understood as representing not merely distributional properties but also the semantic properties which give rise to the distributional facts. If such an approach proves successful, then we might want to claim that LLM outputs are meaningful and that LLMs themselves treat them as meaningful.\nccpt | Whether the internal states of an LLM can be understood as performing content-driven rather than merely statistics-driven computations remains extremely controversial but whatever stance we take on this question, I think, thirdly, that we should deny that LLMs are in the business of asserting the content which attaches to the expressions they produce. LLMs do not aim at the truth in the way that would be required for them to count as genuine conversational partners or as asserting or making claims. Fourth and finally, Sceptics are right to think that LLMs lack original or intrinsic intentionality. They are not agents and they are not conscious. This doesn't, I've argued, stop them from meaning things but it may mean that it makes no sense to talk of them as understanding or contra Turing thinking at least if thinking is held to involve original intentionality. Yet this is something we should be glad of, for the cost of the alternative would be a radical overhaul of our relationship with artificial systems.",
