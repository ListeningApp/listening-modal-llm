You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

90no | Conclusion
jt0y | Neither of the above theoretical approaches can function as a thoroughgoing explanation of gender representation in art or cinema. In today's global film industry, new theoretical models might emerge that are better suited to aid our understanding of how gender representations work within and upon social and economic power relations. From today's perspective, we could probably find a handful of exceptions to the patriarchal modes of representation described above. Berger and Mulvey may seem a bit dated, but many of their insights still resonate with readers, and can be found and studied in the products of past eras, if not in our own. These are, of course, only theories, and summarised ones at that. But we will look in the following chapters at some of the ways in which the male gaze/male look and the power of patriarchal narratives have influenced cinema then and now.
qb7o | Chapter Summary
oae5 | · This book does not assume that a decontextualised evaluation of cinema is an adequate one. Sex is here examined not just as biological fact, but as a public concept, or set of ideas, about men, women, biology, the 'natural', the 'normal', the 'perverse', etc.
s0fl | . Since films are human artifacts, film-makers cannot avoid relating their works to the social, political, historical and visual culture in which they are situated. Traditions, popular forms, trends and styles develop through the imitation and repetition of certain elements. These common modes of representation become conventional or generic.
43ia | · Although cinema generally attempts to imitate 'real life', it presents us with a constructed world, fabricated through a carefully selected set of representations. Students should be encouraged to interrogate the social functions of our stories and myths.
3g2y | · Discourse - Foucault introduced the idea that language, far from being neutral, creates meaning by the ways in which it is used, and in particular the ways that it is used to wield power. Discourse analysis allows students to recognise film language as a medium through which relationships of power between different groups are maintained, reinforced, exposed, subverted or re-negotiated.
gc7v | · Hegemony - Hegemonic discourses or ideologies are those that achieve ascendancy or domination within a global or international industry, economy or culture. Antonio Gramsci argued that control by one minority social/ political group or ideological system over its rivals need not involve force, since people can just as easily be lulled into compliance by a powerful set of messages, to which they consent in the belief that they are 'better off'.

fim0 | . Denotation is the 'common sense' definition or meaning of a word. Connotations, by contrast, are implicit or suggested meanings that are not a part of the literal meaning of a word. Students should be encouraged to reflect on the connotations of words like 'feminist' and 'director'. The word 'feminist' carries misleading connotations of womanhood, when this is not in fact part of the definition of the term. Similarly, the title 'director' has become a gendered term, associated with males. The film director's masculinity has become normalised or assumed.
ojro | · As a medium of re-presentation, film does not merely record reality, but constructs an image of reality through the use of codes, myths, conventions and signs. Feminists argue that media representations of gender perpetuate and reinforce the values of patriarchal society.
l6t9 | · The explicit message or interpretation is that which is consciously intended.
1ujy | · A film's implicit meanings are less stable, and may involve contested interpretations that go beyond the intention of the film-maker. These meanings are not literally written into the script, but they can be read out of its subtext. The subtext refers to the unstated message conveyed through the form of a book, film or picture.
qzor | · Sexuality has to do with anatomical differences between women and men. Sex is a given. Gender, by contrast, refers to those socially constructed ideas about 'boys' and 'girls', and the ways in which society perceives the differences between the sexes.
a0by | . The stereotypical role of the female in the traditional Hollywood film has not been that of an agent. Women have played very little part in constructing public images of femininity. Women tend to imitate an idealised and eroticised male construction of what women 'should' be. 'Woman' comes to represent not one person of the female sex, but a stereotype, a category defined by men and in opposition to men. Feminist critics point out that cinematic representations of women are mediated through the eyes and desires of the male director.
u1ky | . John Berger's Ways of Seeing was one of the twentieth century's most influential books on art. Berger's insights provide much of the groundwork for later feminist theorists.
htm9 | · Berger began by noting that the social presence of a woman is different in kind from that of a man. A woman is almost continually accompanied by her own image of herself. From earliest childhood, she has been taught and persuaded to survey herself continually. Her own sense of being in herself is supplanted by a sense of being appreciated as herself by another (male] spectator. The surveyor of women in herself is male.

l0a3 | . Berger looks closely at the visual conventions that inform the typical European oil painting, and in particular the female nude. Berger notes the ways in which the paintings were intended to flatter the male spectator- owner, for whom they were made, turning the female nudes into objects of sight for his pleasure. As in the conventional European oil painting, women are today depicted in quite a different way than men - not because the feminine is different from the masculine - but because the 'ideal' spectator is always assumed to be male.
u8nw | · Laura Mulvey's 'Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema' appropriated psychoanalytic theory, particularly that of Freud and Lacan, to demonstrate the ways in which unconscious forces in patriarchal society have structured film form. Drawing on Freud's descriptions of scopophilia, Mulvey argued that this impulse could explain one of the central pleasures of the cinema.
l2v9 | · Fetishistic scopophilia, says Mulvey, provides an avenue of escape for the male unconscious, which is threatened by the female figure insofar as it represents castration (the absence of a penis). By turning the female figure itself into a fetish, either through over-valuation or possessing her as an object of sight,' her appearance becomes reassuring rather than dangerous.
afbe | · The other avenue of escape for the male unconscious, says Mulvey, is voyeurism - investigating the woman, penetrating her privacy, uncovering and demystifying her mystery. Cinematic spectatorship, by its very nature, plays on voyeuristic fantasies. The whole experience creates the illusion of a privileged perspective, from which the spectator can safely look in on a private world, while no one looks back at him.
78r8 | · Mulvey identifies three voyeuristic/scopophilic kinds of look associated with the cinema:
320g | a. The look of the camera and crew as they record the action.
tp8g | b. The look between the characters on screen.
gxfd | c. The look of the audience watching the film.
s2v1 | · All three kinds of look are predominantly masculine or associated with the male.
jkp9 | . Mulvey claims that pleasure in looking has been ordered along an active/ male and passive/female divide.
z8tt | · Cinematic stimulation also produces narcissistic pleasures - the spectator identifies with the object seen. The spectator identifies with the main male protagonist, his screen surrogate, giving him a satisfying sense of omnipotence. Traditionally there are few instances of female characters actively driving the narrative and thus competing for the audience's
