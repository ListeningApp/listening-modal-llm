You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

uow2 | Does creatine lead to dehydration and muscle cramping? Speculation exists that creatine supplementation causes dehydration and muscle cramping [72, 73]. In the early 2000's, with limited data and based primarily on specula- tion, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommended that individuals controlling their weight and exercising intensely or in hot environments should avoid the use of creatine supplementation [74]. The physiological rationale suggesting that creatine supple- mentation may cause dehydration and muscle cramping is based on the premise that creatine is an osmotically active substance found primarily in skeletal muscle and may alter whole-body fluid distribution by preferentially increasing intracellular water uptake and retention, par- ticularly over the short-term [38, 75]. In situations of body water loss, such as severe sweating from exercise and/or increased environmental temperature, the bound intracellular fluid, in theory, may be detrimental to ther- mal regulation and lead to extracellular dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and muscle cramping or other heat-related musculoskeletal issues [44]. The initial load- ing phase of creatine supplementation (i.e. 20 g/day for 5-7 days) typically results in a 1-3 kg increase in body mass, mostly attributable to net body water retention [75, 76]. Some anecdotal evidence indicates that creatine users perceive supplementation to result in some adverse effects [77]. For example, in a survey involving 219 ath- letes, 90 participants reported using creatine with 34 of them (38%) reporting perceived negative effects such as cramping (27%) [77]. <LATEX>\mathrm { S i m i l a r l } _ { Y } ,</LATEX> in National Collegiate Athletic Association <LATEX>\left. \mathrm { N C A A } \right)</LATEX> Division 1 baseball and football players <LATEX>\left( N = 5 2 \right)</LATEX> using creatine, 25% reported in- cidences of muscle cramping and 13.5% reported symp- toms of dehydration. Importantly, these studies failed to control for the use of other supplements and the dosage of creatine ingested. Greenwood et al. [77] noted that 91% of participants exceeded the recommended creatine maintenance dose <LATEX>o f \quad 5 \quad g / d a y .</LATEX> However, these self-report surveys are in contradiction to experimental and clinical evidence. Greenwood et al. [78] monitored injury rates in Division IA NCAA collegiate football players <LATEX>\left( N = 7 2 ; \right.</LATEX> age: <LATEX>\left. 1 9 . 7 + 1 . 0 \quad y r s \right)</LATEX> where environmental conditions were hot <LATEX>\left( 2 7 . 3 \pm 1 0 . 9 ^ { 0 } C \right)</LATEX> and humid <LATEX>\left( 5 4 . 2 9 . 7 \right) .</LATEX> Par- ticipants chose to receive either creatine <LATEX>\left( n = 3 8 : 0 . 3 \quad g / \right.</LATEX> kg/day for 5 days; followed by 0.03 <LATEX>g / k g / d a y</LATEX> for 115 days) or a sport drink placebo <LATEX>\left( n = 3 4 \right)</LATEX> throughout the football season. Injuries treated by the athletic training staff were monitored. Creatine users had significantly less cramping <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { p } = 0 . 0 2 1 \right. ,</LATEX> heat illnesses and dehydration <LATEX>\left( p = 0 . 0 4 3 \right) ,</LATEX> muscle tightness <LATEX>\left( p = 0 . 0 2 0 \right) ,</LATEX> muscle strains <LATEX>\left( p = 0 . 0 2 1 \right) ,</LATEX> and total injuries <LATEX>\left( p < 0 . 0 0 1 \right)</LATEX> compared to non-users. Non-contact joint injuries, contact injuries, illnesses, missed practices due to injuries, and players lost for the season were not different between groups. In
iat7 | a clinical setting, haemodialysis patients <LATEX>\left( n = 1 0 \right)</LATEX> who fre- quently reported muscle cramping were provided creatine (12 g) 5 minutes prior to haemodialysis [79]. Creatine sup- plementation reduced the frequency of symptomatic muscle cramping by 60% [79]. These beneficial effects from creatine may be explained by fluid distribution and electrolyte imbalances, as previously discussed.
ywwr | In summary, experimental and clinical research does not validate the notion that creatine supplementation causes dehydration and muscle cramping.
0i6j | Is creatine harmful for children and adolescents?
87cq | Concerns regarding the safety of creatine supplementa- tion in children and adolescents (< 19 yrs) continues to be highly prevalent. The overwhelming majority of evi- dence in adult populations indicates that creatine sup- plementation, both short- and longer-term, is safe and generally well tolerated [2]. However, the question of whether or not this holds true for children and adoles- cents is relatively unclear. The physiological rationale supporting the potential ergogenic benefits of creatine supplementation in children and adolescents was first postulated by Unnithan and colleagues in 2001 [80]; which established a strong basis for future applications of creatine for younger athletes. More recently, in a comprehensive review examining the safety of creatine supplementation in adolescents, Jagim et al. [16] sum- marized several studies that examined the efficacy of creatine supplementation among various adolescent ath- lete populations and found no evidence of adverse ef- fects. However, it is important to note that none of the performance-focused studies included in the Jagim et al. [16] review provided data examining specific markers of clinical health and whether or not they were impacted by the supplementation protocols.
0qs3 | From a clinical perspective, creatine supplementation has been found to potentially offer health benefits with minimal adverse effects in younger populations. Hayashi et al. [81] found improvements in pediatric patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and reported no adverse changes in laboratory parameters of hematology, kidney function, liver function or inflammatory markers after 12 weeks of creatine supplementation. Tarnopolsky et al. [82] reported significant improvements in fat-free mass and hand grip strength in 30 pediatric patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy following 4 months of creatine supplementation. Importantly, the creatine sup- plementation protocol appeared to be well tolerated and did not adversely affect laboratory markers of kidney function, oxidative stress, and bone health [81-83]. In addition, Sakellaris et al. [83] reported significant im- provements in traumatic brain injury-related outcomes
