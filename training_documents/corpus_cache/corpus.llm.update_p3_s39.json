All statistical tests were two-tailed, and P is less than point zero five was considered significant.\nf682 | Three - RESULTS\nli1k | Of one hundred forty-five cases submitted by twenty-six centers, one hundred twenty-seven fulfilled the inclusion criteria (zero to fifteen per center). Eighty were males, and forty-seven were females. Age at epilepsy onset was zero to one hundred twenty months (median equals six, I Q R equals three point one two to twenty two point seven five). Etiology was genetic in thirty-one, structural/congenital in seventeen, structural/acquired in fifteen, and unknown or not reported in sixty-four. Dominant seizure types included atypical absence in eight, drop attacks (tonic or atonic) in one hundred two, generalized tonic-clonic in twenty-five, and focal with impaired awareness in fifteen, in addition to the mandatory tonic seizures. Duration of experiencing drop attacks before VNS was zero to fifteen years (median equals five, I Q R equals two point five to eight). Forty-eight children were reported to have severe, thirty moderate, and twenty-two mild or borderline intellectual disability. Three children had prior resective epilepsy surgeries, and forty-five were on the ketogenic diet.\npbea | Three point one Vagus nerve stimulation\nccpt | Age at VNS surgery was three months to fifteen years (median equals seven, I Q R equals four to ten). Children were on up to six ASMs (three point one plus or minus one point one) before VNS. Apart from two patients who had their VNS setting on one point five mA, all other patients were titrated to a minimal output current of one point seventy-five mA. Seizure outcomes following VNS, and as evaluated before CC surgery (at a follow-up of up to seventeen years, median equals three point three, I Q R equals two to six), are summarized in Table one.\n0fpw | Three point two Corpus callosotomy\ndqn8 | A total of one hundred twenty-seven children underwent CC surgery at two to eighteen years (median equals eleven, I Q R equals eight point seventy-six to fifteen), up to seventeen years following VNS (median equals three point three, I Q R equals two to six). Eighty-six underwent a complete callosotomy, and forty-one an anterior callosotomy\ncop0 | (forty were of the anterior two-thirds, and one of half the callosum extent). We did not collect data regarding the reason for the extent of disconnection. The surgical approach for a complete CC included an open anterior interhemispheric approach (n equals eighty-four) and endoscopic (n equals two). Of the forty-one anterior CCs, thirty-eight were performed via an anterior interhemispheric approach, and three used laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT).\nlhkq | Ten children underwent additional CC surgery, completing the posterior disconnection. The time from first to second CC surgery was two to eighty-six months (median equals sixteen point three, I Q R equals six point seven to thirty-four point three). Surgical approaches included anterior interhemispheric in six, posterior interhemispheric in three, and LITT in one. We were therefore evaluating the results following ninety-six complete CC procedures and thirty-one partial CC procedures, with a total of one hundred thirty-seven surgical procedures. The one hundred thirty-seven procedures included an anterior interhemispheric approach (n equals one hundred twenty-eight), endoscopic (n equals two), LITT (n equals four), and posterior interhemispheric\n82ju | (n equals three). Surgical complications were reported for eighteen of one hundred thirty-seven CC procedures. Following the one hundred twenty-seven primary CC procedures, complications included wound complications (four infections, two not specified), pneumonia (n equals two), neurological (a total of six cases, four transient, one pericallosal artery infarct, and one not specified), one noninfectious fever, one plate removal several years after surgery, and one general deterioration. Following the ten CC-completion procedures, only one wound infection was reported.\ny2qo | Three point three Follow-up and seizure outcome\n1piq | Follow-up after the primary CC was two to one hundred ninety-one months (median equals forty-two point four, I Q R equals sixteen to eighty-five). The number of ASMs at the last follow-up after the primary CC procedure was similar to that prior to CC (three point three plus or minus one point three after vs. three point three one point two before CC). Seizure outcomes are presented in Table two. Overall, eighty-three percent had at least a fifty percent reduction in drop attacks, and a sixty percent improvement.\n```",
