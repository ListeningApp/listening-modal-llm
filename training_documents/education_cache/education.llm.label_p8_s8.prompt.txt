You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

caos | The future of higher education in a disruptive world
qrvy | The story of universities in the previous section required generalization. Some jurisdictions will continue to support higher education more than others. Some institutions in those jurisdictions will be more successful than others because of hard work, inheritance, location or good fortune.
pn9j | There are, however, some major drivers of global change affecting us all and from which no institution could be completely immune. The fourth industrial revolution, a fusion of exponential technologies where silicon and carbon meet, 16 will prove to be as profound as the previous revolutions driven by steam, electricity and computing.
1pmc | Each of the earlier revolutions was accompanied by changes in the mode of education and the institutions that provided it. The school classroom, the worker's institute, the civic, technological and research university, can all be matched with the economic and social needs of their times. There is no reason to expect that the new revolution will be different, but we are at the early stages of thinking about the corresponding changes needed in education. In the view of this report's author, the ability to transform will be the critical one for all education institutions to cultivate, so they can shape and respond to a changing world of education.
5z6q | Demographic changes are also underway that influence everything deeply. Some jurisdictions have ageing populations, low fertility rates and a shrinking 'support ratio' of working age people 25-64 to those 65 and older. By 2050, the United Nations believes that 48 countries and territories are likely to have support ratios below two.17 By contrast, other jurisdictions have fertility rates well above the replacement rate of 2.1, huge young populations, and growing middle classes. Power and influence are shifting inexorably as a result, in what has been described as a global rebalancing between East and West. 18
yeoh | Universities have experienced this in various ways. Declining domestic enrolments in the US, for example, have been partly offset by growing international numbers. Australia and Canada, which also rely on immigration to maintain population growth, have aggressively promoted their universities as destinations that will strengthen a migration claim. The UK, leaving the European Union, has declared itself "open for talent," with longer post-study work rights as part of the inducement.
b8hf | Whatever the eventual impact of the pandemic, international student mobility will not last forever at these levels. China's domestic university system is improving rapidly, such that it is a study destination. India is investing heavily in its own post- secondary institutions. And we might be seeing a shift in demand internationally away from traditional university study towards more vocational, practical courses. Those universities in low fertility rate jurisdictions which have hitched their business model to international students will urgently need to re-visit their strategy and reduce their costs.
hntf | The potential implications of climate change pervade the whole world, as do the implications of policies designed to address global warming. We can expect enormous opportunities for research to enhance our understanding of the situation and the efficacy of policy. Similarly, technologies that will help us to live and work differently, ideally towards zero net emissions, will likely be based on discoveries by universities and research institutes.
99fo | But universities themselves, as public purpose organizations, will need to be exemplars, reducing their emissions from campus operations and doing things differently. International student physical mobility and conference attendance, for example, will be harder to justify when practical alternatives are becoming available. Frugality and cost- benefit thinking will move to center stage.
y5r7 | Finally, in this list of change drivers from which no one is immune is the era that Forrester Research calls the 'Age of the Customer '

hvhm | Universities in low fertility rate jurisdictions which have hitched their business model to international students will urgently need to re- visit their strategy and reduce their costs.
863b | The future of higher education in a disruptive world
fj24 | The idea of consumer sovereignty is not new, but its application in practice has been restricted. If consumers didn't know about better alternatives, or could not exercise them, or couldn't hear about other consumers' experiences, they stuck with what they knew and what was easily available. Now, with social media, abundant product information, online purchasing and the ability to switch preferences quickly, consumer sovereignty is becoming a reality.
uz3c | No business can ignore Customer Experience (CX). And the sector is starting to see this in universities, although KPMG education specialists also argue that this should be developed into a more complex idea of Student Experience (SX), which adds in Learner Experience (LX) and Personalized Experience (PX), so that:
d5bi | In the last two decades, many higher education systems have fostered competition between providers to create quasi-markets as those systems moved from elite to mass participation. But the choice of the student was typically constrained by resources, geography and information.
ba4l | Now these barriers to choice are being overcome. The next shift will likely be from mass face-to-face to mass digital learning. The modal way of engaging with learning is starting to flip.
ffx8 | 10
s6su | The future of higher education in a disruptive world
y219 | In recent years, there has been talk in the sector about blended and flexible learning, but the reality has been that online resources have supplemented the dominant mode of delivery, which was synchronous and in-person. Spurred by the pandemic, but probably coming anyway, is the reverse situation. Courses will be designed to be delivered through technology - 'digital first' - and supplemented by face-to-face, human support.
06ht | It is early days, but the written word is already being accompanied by video, mixed reality and simulations, with realistic holograms a possibility. Smart bots for every subject open up the possibility of personalized learning at scale, monitored by advanced learning analytics. And if the student does not have to leave home or work to experience this (unless they wish to), consumer choice finally opens up. The Age of the Customer is now hitting universities.
v3r2 | One might predict that some universities will deliberately promote a physical experience on campus as part of their value proposition. If they have the brand to keep attracting demand, they will always have their place - but they will become the minority. There is also a midway point between physical-learning and virtual-learning environments: the augmented-learning environment, where attendance at a place is overlaid with a much richer view, enabling a deep experience from modest premises.
nv42 | One thing is clear. The university that expects students to battle with traffic, find a parking place, go to a lecture, write examinations by hand, get a seat in a crowded library and then go home again will be riding its luck.
xags | Four building blocks for transforming and optimizing
jc47 | As mentioned earlier many higher-education institutions around the world are at or approaching a crossroads. This applies to strategy and to operating model.
ko3c | - Do they transform?
xek3 | Do they optimize?
bbpr | Do they do nothing and react later?
5zyf | - Do they do nothing and take the risk?
9own | KPMG education specialists advise against the fourth of these scenarios, except perhaps for the very few institutions with brands and resources that make the status quo a safer option than any of the known alternatives.
bqfb | The third scenario (reacting later) might be a reasonable strategy for a further minority which believe they have time on their side and the ability to pivot quickly if they need to. Being wrong about this could be costly, however.
wwdt | For the majority of institutions, the realistic choice likely falls between transforming their operating model, and all that goes along with this, in a reasonably short period, or achieving the same outcome over a longer period, spreading the expense and workload - that is, optimizing - while taking the risk of fresh disruption upending them in the meantime.
mn1r | Transform or optimize?
5vqw | Transformation
meyw | Operating model transformation is required where an organization has significantly changed its strategic ambition or requires a fundamental shift in its value proposition and business model
2e62 | Optimization
75y3 | Operating model optimization is where an organization needs to improve its organizational effectiveness and efficiency in order to improve performance to meet is strategic ambition and enact its business model
s2g2 | The key variables in deciding which is most likely are captured in the neighboring diagram, where the vertical axis deals with motivation considerations (is it about performance improvement, better alignment or dealing with disruption?) and the horizontal axis deals with readiness for change. Optimizers will be focusing mainly on performance improvement and be ready for only limited change. Transformers will have greater strategic ambition and be more focused on disruption.
q1q2 | 13
cb7r | The future of higher education in a disruptive world
68xu | Whether transformers or optimizers, the four building blocks are the same:
hd35 | 1. Strategy
2zpk | In relation to strategy, much depends on a view of the future, in one's own context. Building on earlier comments in this report, a plausible view of the future may have the following features:
epu7 | Fueled by the dislocation of workers due to automation and new ways of working, demand will be high for upskilling, reskilling and retraining. Some estimate that almost all growth in formal hours of learning within static populations will be with adult learners who are older than the typical graduate.
7od1 | Some universities may move towards a subscription model, whereby for a regular payment, people will have access to a range of programs, thus potentially retaining the loyalty of their students across their lifespan.
0bqy | Competing at scale
b780 | One of the extraordinary developments in today's economy has been the rise of the platform business. Seven of the 10 largest organizations in the world can be described in this way.20 The institution that can provide on-demand learning, at scale and personalized to the needs and wishes of the student, is the organization which can build resilience into its future.
ccmb | e
ma93 | We may now see new forms of business model which draw on the entertainment industry, whereby some universities relay and quality assure content and assessment that is actually provided by others, as well as offering their own programs.
c6hh | Lifestyle integration
y7ea | Although not necessarily reducing in absolute numbers, the cohort of young people seeking the immersive, rite-of-passage, full-time, on-campus, bachelor education will reduce as a proportion of the whole student body. More students will be working part-time, undertaking family responsibilities and wanting to integrate learning into their lives rather than interrupt their lives for an immersive experience.
nav4 | The future of higher education in a disruptive world
gem8 | 2.Capabilities
e8nr | In 2018, KPMG International commissioned Forrester Consulting to conduct a study on customer-centric strategy decisions across 17 industries.21 This research identified that organizations that make a moderate or significant investment in all eight of the following capabilities are 2.1 times as likely to deliver customer experiences that exceed expectations, successfully execute on one or more customer-centric objectives, and achieve return on investment on one or more metrics.
k78w | Eight critical capabilities of connected enterprises
g9du | 1 Insight-driven strategies and actions: The ability to harness data, advanced analytics and actionable insights with a real-time understanding of the customer and the business to shape integrated business decisions.
f682 | 2 Innovative products and services: The ability to develop compelling customer value propositions on price, products and services to engage the most-attractive customers and drive profitable growth.
li1k | 3 Experience centricity by design:
pbea | The ability to design seamless, intentional experiences for customers, employees and partners to support customer value propositions and deliver business objectives.
ccpt | 4 Seamless interactions and commerce: The ability to interact and transact with customers and prospects across marketing, sales and services, and achieve measurable results.
0fpw | KPMG International, also commissioned Forrester Consulting to survey universities in six jurisdictions for their self-reported investment in these capabilities and, because student centricity seems to be the key to thriving and surviving, we sought a particular focus on investment in customer-centric and related strategies.22
dqn8 | An online survey was completed in early 2020, before the pandemic broke, by 410 institutional leaders in higher education in the US, Canada, the UK, Germany, Australia and India. Participants were at departmental chair level or above, and 14 percent were either C-level executives or presidents (and the equivalent).
cop0 | The future of higher education in a disruptive world
lhkq | 5
82ju | Responsive operations and supply chain: The ability to operate the business with efficiency and agility to fulfill the customer promise in a consistent and profitable way.
y2qo | 6 Aligned and empowered workforce: The ability to build a customer-centric organization and culture that inspires people to deliver on the customer promise and drive up business performance.
1piq | 7 Digitally enabled technology architecture:
7fqw | The ability to create intelligent and agile services, technologies and platforms, enabling the customer agenda with solutions that are secure, scalable and cost-effective.
rhaz | 8 Integrated partner and alliance ecosystem: The ability to engage, integrate and manage third parties to increase speed-to-market, reduce costs, mitigate risk and close capability gaps to deliver on the customer promise.
wak1 | A reasonable mix of institutional types and sizes participated, with 49 percent saying they were predominantly face-to- face, 22 percent online and 29 percent blended. About half (49 percent) were teaching and research, 35 percent were teaching only and 15 percent were research intensive. Slightly more institutions were private (54 percent) than public (46 percent), but 63 percent were non-profit.
wtfz | Eight out of 10 reported that they were putting customer centricity front and center. Twenty-five percent of surveyed higher education decision makers counted their customer- centric strategy among their institutions' top priorities and 51 percent said they were making it a high priority. While institutions across surveyed jurisdictions were placing a similar priority on developing their customer-centric strategies, institutions in India (84 percent) were more likely than institutions in other places to be placing a high or top priority on this effort, while those from Australia (68 percent) were least likely to be placing this level of priority.
qy1i | Traditional organizational drivers are taking a back seat to more student-focused objectives. Customer-centric strategies are driven largely by objectives centering around the student, rather than by more traditional institutional drivers, such as an increase in grant/donation funding and cost cutting. Improving the student experience (42 percent), improving student trust in the organization (36 percent), and gaining in-depth student insights (35 percent) topped the list. These top drivers were largely consistent across all measured jurisdictions.
1k9e | The majority of institutions considered their customer-centric capabilities average at best. Over half of higher-education institutions rated their customer-centric capabilities as less mature (14 percent) or about average (42 percent), compared with similar higher-education institutions. Institutions in India (50 percent) were somewhat more likely to rate their capabilities as more mature compared with their counterparts in Canada (44 percent), the US (43 percent), the UK (42 percent), Australia (36 percent), and Germany (32 percent).
5bjs | Few are going above and beyond in delivering on the student experience. Just four out of 10 institutions reported that the experience they provide students consistently (9 percent) or even occasionally (28 percent) exceeded student expectations. Institutions in the UK, Germany and Australia lagged behind the other jurisdictions in the study, with just 29, 28 and 24 percent, respectively, indicating that student experience exceeded expectations.

k16v | "What priority is your institution placing on its customer-centric strategy?"
b2lm | The future of higher education in a disruptive world
ti7f | Many institutions have some distance to go in matching leading customer experience practices in other sectors.
oksu | The survey revealed that security, technology and people/process hurdles stand between institutions and the successful execution of customer-centric strategies. While higher-education institutions face numerous obstacles to success, their lack of qualified staff was listed as the number one barrier to the successful execution of customer-centric strategies, cited by 33 percent of respondents.
wtow | Barrier number two, cited by 29 percent of institutions, was students who "arrive lacking key academic and/or personal skills." It is, to put it mildly, unorthodox for a provider which actually selects its own customers then to say that some of them are the problem in executing a customer-centric strategy.
