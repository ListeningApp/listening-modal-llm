You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

s6hr | Now, if all this seems very weird, here's why: we often describe physical systems using infinitely many states, with a lowest possible energy but no highest possible energy. In this case the sum in the Boltzmann distribution can't converge for ß < 0, so negative temperatures are ruled out.
p6cq | However, some physical systems can be approximately described using a finite set of states (or in quantum theory, a finite-dimensional Hilbert space of states). Then the things I just said hold true! And people enjoy studying these systems, and their strange properties, in the lab.
99rc | It's good to look at a simple example, and work everything out explicitly:
n6d5 | Puzzle 25. Suppose a system has two states with energies E1 / E2. Compute the probabilities pi that it is in either of these states in thermal equilibrium as a function of the coolness B. Then express these probabilities as a function of the temperature T. Using these functions pi(T):
1kke | . Show that when 0 < T < +oo the system is more likely to be in the lower-energy state: P1(T) > p2(T).
zp0n | . Show that when -> < T < 0 the system is more likely to be in the higher-energy state: P1(T) < p2(T).
f9ca | · Show that
yidf | T->+00 lim pi(T) = _ lim pi(T) T -- 00
ysbk | so we can speak unambiguously of the probabilities p; at infinite temperature.
1cv5 | · Show that at infinite temperature the system has an equal probability of being in either state.
cst3 | · Show that as T approaches zero from above, the probability of the system being in the lower energy state approaches 1.
w2ec | · Show that as T approaches zero from below, the probability of the system being in the higher energy state approaches 1.
ov01 | INFINITE TEMPERATURE
bovo | If a system has finitely many states with energies Ei, in thermal equilibrium at temperature T the probability that it's in the ith state is
atnz | Pi & e BEi
85ak | where B = 1/kT and k is Boltzmann's constant.
gk8u | When 3 = 0 the system's temperature becomes infinite, and all states become equally probable!
dyg8 | The probability of finding a system in a particular state decays exponentially with energy when the coolness ß is positive. But for a system with finitely many states, ß can be zero. Then it becomes equally probable for the system to be in any state!
qoea | Zero coolness means 'utter randomness': that is, maximum entropy.
ed2n | Here's why. The probability distribution with the largest entropy is the one where all probabilities pi are all equal. This happens at zero coolness! When ß = 0 we get exp(-BE;) = 1 for all i. The probabilities pi are proportional to these numbers exp(-ßE;) = 1, so they're all equal.
3xp7 | It seems zero coolness is impossible for a system with infinitely many states. With infinitely many states, all equally probable, the probability of being in any state would be zero. In other words, there's no uniform probability distribution on an infinite set.
2hce | One way out: replace sums with integrals. For the usual measure on [0, 1], called the Lebesgue measure dx, we have fo dx = 1. So this is a 'probability measure' that we could use to describe a system at zero coolness, whose space of states is [0,1].
12p5 | But replacing sums by integrals raises all sorts of interesting issues. For example, there's a unique way to sum over a finite set of states, but an integral over an infinite set of states depends on a choice of measure. So a choice of measure is a significant extra structure we're slapping on our set of states.
s4t5 | We'll need to think about these issues later, since to compute the entropy of a clas- sical ideal gas we'll need integrals. But we'll encounter difficulties, which are ultimately resolved using quantum mechanics.
7ojm | Anyway: infinite temperature is really zero coolness, and at least for systems with finitely many states, the entropy becomes as large as possible at zero coolness.
x0cv | NEGATIVE TEMPERATURE
d5cm | If a system has finitely many states with energies <LATEX>E _ { i } ,</LATEX> in thermal equilibrium at temperature <LATEX>T</LATEX> the probability that it's in the <LATEX>i</LATEX> ith state is
cojo | <LATEX>p _ { i } \propto e ^ { - \beta E _ { i } }</LATEX> where <LATEX>\beta = 1 / k T</LATEX> and <LATEX>k</LATEX> is Boltzmann's constant.
lsvc | When <LATEX>\beta < 0</LATEX> the system becomes 'hotter than infinitely hot'. Its temperature is negative-but the higher the energy of a state, the more probable it is!
lfgp | A system with finitely many states can reach infinite temperature. It can get even hotter, but then its temperature 'wraps around' and become negative!
y6yk | The possibility of negative temperatures was first discussed by the physicist Lars Onsager in 1949, and they have been created in the lab with a variety of systems that-within some approximation-can be described as having finitely many states. In quantum theory, this happens for systems that have finite basis of 'energy eigenstates': states with well-defined energies <LATEX>E _ { i } .</LATEX> For example, the nucleus of an atom may have just two spin states, and if we put it in an magnetic field these will have different energies. The result is the system we studied in Puzzle 25.
477w | Here is a generalization with more energy states, all equally spaced:
u0zj | Puzzle 26. Consider a system with <LATEX>2 N + 1</LATEX> states labeled by an integer <LATEX>n</LATEX> with <LATEX>- N \leq</LATEX> <LATEX>n \leq N ,</LATEX> where the nth state has energy <LATEX>E _ { n } = \alpha n</LATEX> for some energy <LATEX>\alpha > 0 .</LATEX> Compute the Boltzmann distribution for this system at coolness <LATEX>\beta</LATEX> for all <LATEX>\beta \in \mathbb{R} .</LATEX> Compute the expected energy <LATEX>\langle E \rangle</LATEX> as a function of <LATEX>\beta .</LATEX> What is the qualitative difference in your result between the case of positive temperature <LATEX>\left( \beta > 0 \right)</LATEX> and negative temperature
lfp7 | <LATEX>\left( \beta < 0 \right)</LATEX> For more, try this:
afyz | ABSOLUTE ZERO: THE LIMIT OF INFINITE COOLNESS
mpnc | If a system with finitely many states having energies E; is in thermal equilibrium, the probability p; that it's in the ith state is propor- tional to exp(-ßE;) where ß is the coolness.
um9m | In the limit of infinite coolness, ? - > +oo, these probabilities go to zero except for the states of lowest energy, which all become equally probable.
q90z | The limit ? - > +oo is also the limit where T approaches zero from above, commonly called absolute zero.
