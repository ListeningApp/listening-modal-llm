You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

mpml | 4.4. Langevin dynamics - one-dimensional case. We present here the nu- merical results associated with the one-dimensional Langevin dynamics (2.18), where the potential energy function is the same as the one used for the one-dimensional overdamped Langevin dynamics case, namely (4.4), and the same observable (4.5) as in Section 4.2. The normalization constants <LATEX>a</LATEX> and <LATEX>b</LATEX> for <LATEX>\rho _ { 1 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 }</LATEX> are chosen to be
imnm | with Z the same normalization constant as in Section 4.2, defined in (4.6). The spatial domain T = [0, 1) was discretized using mq = 200 points, with uniform step size hq = 1/mq. The unbounded momentum space was truncated to [-Pmax, Pmax] with Pmax =
8na8 | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS
ul2a | 6.0, with Dirichlet boundary conditions at <LATEX>p = \pm p _ { \max } ,</LATEX> and then discretized into <LATEX>m _ { p } = 1 0 0 0</LATEX> points with uniform step size <LATEX>h _ { p } = 2 p _ { \max } / \left( m _ { p } - 1 \right) .</LATEX> The simulations were performed with <LATEX>\beta = \gamma = M = 1 .</LATEX> Note that when computing the response associated with the divergence-free vector field for large values of <LATEX>\eta ,</LATEX> as presented in Figure 5e, the momentum space is truncated to
4eaf | <LATEX>p _ { \max } = 1 0 .</LATEX> The results presented in Figure 5 correspond to the response curves for each of the synthetic forcings discussed in Section 3.2.3. Figures 5a and 5b correspond to the position and momentum components of the modified fluctuation-dissipation forcing presented in Example 3.5, respectively, namely
4b6k | <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { e x t r a } } = - \partial _ { q } ^ { * } \partial _ { q } , \quad \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { e x t r a } } = - \partial _ { p } ^ { * } \partial _ { p } .</LATEX> Figures 5c and <LATEX>5 d</LATEX> correspond to the position and momentum components of the Feynman-Kac forcing presented in Example 3.6, respectively, namely
hxiu | <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { e x t r a } } = \partial _ { a } ^ { * } = V ^ { \prime } - \partial _ { q } , \quad \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { e x t r a } } = \partial _ { p } ^ { * } = p - \partial _ { p } . ,</LATEX> Lastly, Figure 5e corresponds to the divergence-free forcing (4.8).
1ylw | For both modified fluctuation-dissipation forcings, Figures 5a and 5b, we see that <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star }</LATEX> does not preserve linearity for a large <LATEX>\eta</LATEX> regime, suggesting instead that <LATEX>\alpha _ { \star } \left( \varepsilon \right)</LATEX> is the better choice for practical applications; the same conclusion was drawn for the modified fluctuation-dissipation forcing for overdamped Langevin in Section 4.2. Among the two forcings, it seems better to modify the fluctuation-dissipation in <LATEX>p</LATEX> as the response remains longer in the linear response regime for the optimal value
waqw | <LATEX>\alpha _ { \star } \left( \varepsilon \right) .</LATEX> Both Feynman-Kac forcings showcase great potential in extending the linear regime. Once again, Figures 5d and 5f suggest that opting for the extra forcing in the <LATEX>p</LATEX> variable is the superior choice.
nf6a | Lastly, the divergence-free forcing greatly increases the linear regime, as seen in Figures 5e and 5f. This behavior, as well as the ease to implement it in Monte Carlo simulations, make it is the most appealing choice of forcing, allowing to substantially reduce the variance of the estimator (2.38), as discussed in Section 4.5. Although the Feynman-Kac extra forcing also demonstrates great potential in extending the linear regime, the challenges associated with its implementation render it an impractical choice.
5g96 | 4.5. Scaling of the variance. We discuss in this section the scaling of the variance <LATEX>\sigma _ { R , \eta } ^ { 2 } / \eta ^ { 2 } ,</LATEX> defined in (2.43), with the addition of synthetic forces, and in par- ticular numerically illustrate the potential of synthetic forcings as a tool for variance reduction. See Appendix B for details on the numerical computation of (2.43). We emphasize that the bias on the estimator (2.38), made precise in (2.40), is negligible when compared to the variance, hence we concentrate on the variance. We anyway want to remain in the linear response regime so, by construction, the bias should be small.
d1y5 | Recall from Section 2.3, and in particular in Proposition 2.4, that the estima- tor <LATEX>\widehat { \Phi } _ { \eta , t }</LATEX> defined in (2.38) has asymptotic variance of order <LATEX>\sigma _ { R , \eta } ^ { 2 } / \eta ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> Indeed, (2.42) suggests that this asymptotic variance is of the same order as the one associated with the equilibrium estimator, i.e. <LATEX>\sigma _ { R , 0 } ^ { 2 } / \eta ^ { 2 } ,</LATEX> up to a small bias of order
