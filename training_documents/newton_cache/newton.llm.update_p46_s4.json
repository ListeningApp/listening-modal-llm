This initialisation was found to result in nontrivial solutions, that is, visually reasonable low rank representations H to thirteen.\nysz7 | F point four. Simulations For Fast Local Convergence\nk5db | In Figures six and seven, we consider an extended version of the results in Figures one and two, respectively. Specifically, we plot the progress in each of the termination conditions seven. Part a of all figures depict the gradient norm on the inactive set. For Newton-MR TMP, this is the termination condition associated with the Newton-MR portion of the step. We see in both Figures six and seven that, for our method, the inactive set termination condition is steadily reduced until a point is reached where the convergence becomes extremely rapid. This is consistent with the theoretical predictions in Theorem three point one three and Corollary three point one four. We note that projected Newton-CG exhibits similar behaviour once it reaches Newton-CG step phase but to a lesser extent.\n7jzh | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimisation with Nonnegativity Constraints\nvm00 | F point five. Timing Results\n62qe | For completeness, in the following section we give results presented in Section four in terms of \"wall-clock\" time. As noted earlier, wall-clock timing results are implementation and platform dependent. In particular, results are unreliable for small time scales. However, we note that, over larger time scales, the wall-clock time results generally conform with the corresponding oracle call results.\nypz9 | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimisation with Nonnegativity Constraints\nmpml | Five times ten to the power of negative one, ten to the power of negative five, ten to the power of negative three, ten to the power of negative one, ten to the power of one, ten to the power of three, ten to the power of negative one Time in seconds.
