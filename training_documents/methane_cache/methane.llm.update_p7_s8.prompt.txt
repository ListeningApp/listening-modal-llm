You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0myz | A pMMO/MDH supercomplex would provide a direct pathway for methanol produced at the proposed dicopper active site in the pMMO pmoB subunit to the active site of MDH where it is oxidized to formaldehyde. In addition, such a complex could directly provide reducing equivalents to pMMO through the cytochrome <LATEX>c _ { \mathrm { L } } ,</LATEX> the electron acceptor of MDH.96,97,103-105 Another and perhaps more widely accepted electron source for pMMO involves ubiquinol generated by a type 2 NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (NDH-2).12, 12,106,107 In support of this pathway, NADH is an effective reductant for membrane-bound pMMO, but duroquinol is the only reductant that is effective after detergent solubilization.71,108 Duroquinol may mimic the function and redox potential of endogenous quinols, and it is known that methanotrophs produce a range of ubiquinones, but not menaquinone.1 110 Moreover, addition of NADH and NDH-2 to purified pMMO samples leads to a modest increase in propylene epoxidation activity.12 NDH-2 and pMMO can be copurified,12 but there is no evidence that they form a specific protein-protein complex. Finally, in M. capsulatus (Bath), a cytoplasmic hemerythrin protein increases the activity of pMMO, suggesting that hemerythrin facilitates oxygen delivery to pMMO. However, there is no evidence for a protein-protein interaction between pMMO and this hemerythrin.

syiw | Soluble MMO. The details of how sMMO activates dioxygen have been probed extensively by single turnover kinetic studies, resulting in the identification of transient oxygen intermediates, the kinetic and spectroscopic properties of which are detailed elsewhere. 14,19,112 First, the reduced diiron(II) MMOH reacts with <LATEX>O 2</LATEX> in the presence of 2 equiv of MMOB to form a species O in which <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> is bound, but not directly to the diiron cluster.77 Intermediate O is then converted to peroxo intermediates P* and P. For <LATEX>M .</LATEX> capsulatus (Bath) MMOH, <LATEX>\mathrm { P } ^ { \mathrm { s } }</LATEX> is observed to be a diiron(III) site that differs from the subsequent intermediate <LATEX>P</LATEX> only in ligand arrangement.113 However, recent studies of <LATEX>M .</LATEX> trichosporium OB3b MMOH utilizing a variant of MMOB that slows conversion of <LATEX>\mathrm { P } ^ { * }</LATEX> to <LATEX>\mathrm { P }</LATEX> indicate that <LATEX>\mathrm { P } ^ { * }</LATEX> contains a diiron(II) site similar in structure to the diiron(II) site in reduced MMOH. In this system, <LATEX>p ^ { * }</LATEX> is proposed to form by displacement of the <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O</LATEX> by <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> without electron transfer from the diiron(II) center.114 Thus, it remains unclear whether the two intermediates denoted <LATEX>\mathrm { P } ^ { * }</LATEX> are the same. The second peroxo intermediate, P, is a diiron(III) species, and spectroscopic comparisons as well as computational work suggest that <LATEX>a \mu - 1 , 2</LATEX> µ-1,2-peroxo bridge is likely.14,115 Formation of <LATEX>\mathrm { p }</LATEX> is pH-dependent and exhibits a kinetic solvent isotope effect in D2O, indicating that proton transfer plays a role.113,116 It is also possible to bypass the requirement for MMOB and MMOR in these steps by reacting the oxidized MMOH with H2O2 as source of both oxygen and

o9sc | Intermediate P is then converted to Q in a proton-dependent step 113,116 that results in O-O bond breaking. Intermediate Q is the species that reacts with methane to break the C-H bond. On the basis of Mössbauer spectroscopic data indicating the presence of two Fe ions in similar coordination environments and EXAFS data best fit with an Fe-Fe distance of 2.46 Å, Q was proposed to adopt a di(u-oxo) diamond core struc- ture. e 119,120 Difficulty reproducing this distance computation-
121u | ally121,122 'combined with the observation that a model complex with an open core terminal Fe=O unit can oxidize C-H bonds rapidly,123 although not those in methane, suggested Q might have an alternative structure. However, a recent time- resolved resonance Raman study reveals a vibration from Q that best matches vibrations observed for the diamond core in model compounds. Additional experiments with mixed isotopes of O2 further indicate that Q forms via homolytic cleavage of the O-O bond.63,124 Once Q is formed, there are several mechanistic possibilities for C-H activation, including both concerted and radical or cationic processes."" A range of approaches, such as the use of chiral alkane and radical clock substrates, the measurement of kinetic isotope effects, and computational analysis, have been used to investigate these options. After methane oxidation, Q is converted to the product complex T, which is proposed to have a mono-u-oxo bridged structure.63
zh03 | Particulate MMO. Mechanistic studies of pMMO are far behind those of sMMO, due to ongoing difficulties isolating highly active purified enzyme and uncertainty as to the atomic details of the active site (vide supra).9 Density functional theory (DFT) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/ MM) studies suggest that a monocopper Cu"-oxo species or a di (p-oxo)Cu"Cu" species could oxidize methane and that formation of the dicopper species is more favorable.126 Calculations using a dicopper active site model suggest that either a u-n1 :n2-peroxo Cu'Cu" or u-n2:n2-peroxo Cu"Cu" species is formed first and then is transformed into the more reactive di(u-oxo)Cu"Cu" species after O-O bond cleav- age.12
