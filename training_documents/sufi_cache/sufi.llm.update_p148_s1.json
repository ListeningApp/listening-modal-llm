        "content": "```otfg | TALE OF HATIM\naxch | When Hatim al-Asamm, of Balkh (now in Afghanistan) went to Baghdad, people surrounded him, saying:\nn45v | 'You are a non-Arab of halting speech, yet you silence everyone.'\nnjyh | He answered: 'Three things enable me to overcome my opponent. I am happy when he is right, and I am sad when he is wrong, and I try not to behave foolishly towards him.'\nr1t8 | Ibn Hanbal asked Hatim what things would save humanity from the world. He said:\n0ut9 | 'There are four things. Accept the ignorance of others and spare them yours; spare for them from your substance, and do not expect any of theirs.'\ntqo3 | The posture of honesty is not the same as its reality, as everyone knows. But how many people can tell whether they are honest or behaving as if they were honest?\nw1kw | A certain tale has been coined to give this important subject expression. In order to illustrate, it has been put into the mouth of two lunatics; which should not really make any of us feel that its equivalence could not occur among us marvellously normal people:\n2z6m | First lunatic religionist: 'God spoke to me!'\n5obr | Second ditto: 'I did no such thing!'\ndr7x | How can one method be as good as another?\nvkws | Q: What you have said about the same person, or the same group of people, being able to employ entirely different techniques to achieve the same object interests me. But how can one method be as good as another?\nu4ip | A: If a house is on fire, two ladders may be propped against one window. Both lead to the ground. The different colours of the paint on them may obscure the fact that they are ladders.\nq7mz | Q: But how do we know that either is a ladder?\ng124 | A: You know by learning to recognise a ladder when you see one.\nfrec | Q: How is that done?\n0mr5 | A: By familiarising yourself with ladders.\nam0p | Q: And climbing ladders?\n9lp9 | A: While you are learning recognition, climb them as a part of it.\nhobh | Q: But some people insist that there is only one ladder, their own.\nuxvz | A: They are right, if they are only saying that to focus attention on a specific escape-ladder as an instrument. If it works, it is equivalent to being the only true one. For practical purposes, it is.\nu6d8 | Q: Are they right under any other circumstances?\n76m8 | A: Seldom, because if they really were right they would teach not 'There is only this ladder', but 'Look at all these ladders; they can-or could-work. Ours, however, is applicable to you and to me.' Failure to do this reveals ignorance.\nh4ls | Remark: But they are short of time. Comment: So is everybody.\nno4l | Q: Are some ladders too short?\nkkij | A: Ladders are in all conditions: new, old, rotten, short, long, blue, green, weak, strong, available, in use elsewhere, and all the rest of the possibilities.\nzalq | Q: What should one do about all this?\nqcd0 | A: Try to conceive that the house is on fire. If you can do so without becoming obsessed or irrational about it, particularly without becoming suggestible through dwelling on this idea, you may get out. But while you are full of hope or fear, of sentiment or desire for social activity or personal prominence or even recognition, you will not be able to use a ladder, you may not be able to recognise one, certainly you should be spending your energies in circles which abound for the purpose of welcoming such tendencies.\nbdgg | People learn by methods which correspond with the kind and extent of their aspiration: this is the constant Sufi dictum.\nu1j3 | In the Anwar-i-Su√±aili it is said:\nevwi | Nobody found the way to ascend Until he found the step of aspiration. Seek the stage, to mount to the Moon: None drinks rain from a well.\nm3oy | Equally, of course, there are many people who cannot learn something at a given time, because they have some other expectation, some preoccupation, probably an emotional one. Reflect on this news item:\ne9vd | More than three thousand worshippers fled in near-panic from the famous Church of the Blessed Mary of the Rosary at Pompeii on Saturday night, when a bottle of Coca Cola exploded.\np6ik | Twenty-three Study Points\ngim2 | Twenty-Three Study Points\nkoun | Q: May I have any brief aphorisms or statements which I can register and study, which will help to progress on the Sufi path?\n5u7a | A: If you are not a viable unit in the ordinary world, you will not become one elsewhere. If you have a poor capacity for making human contacts, we cannot offer you the substitute of a community where 'we understand one another'. That belongs to play-life, what some, of course, generally call real life.\nugsh | If you are accustomed to being supported and kept going by social, psychological and other pressures in the everyday world, there is a sense in which you do not really exist at all. The people who collapse in the often unpressured-dervish atmosphere and who slack, become tiresome to others, or seek to attract or obtain attention: they will fall to pieces and one cannot help them.\n1ehs | Try to remember; and, if you cannot remember, try to become familiar with this idea:\nvzbz | Lots of people who imagine that they are with us because they are physically present, or because by the ordinary tests (feelings of loyalty, indoctrination) are ostensibly present, lots of those people are not effectively here at all. If you are one of those people, there is nothing we can do for you. If you are like an ordinary person: that is, if you have the tendency to 'be here' only for limited and primitive amusement, but have it only as a tendency and not a way of life: then we can perhaps make some progress.\nahfa | Remember that the human being is so intensely standardised\nnmac | that an outside observer, noting his reactions to various stimuli, need not infer an individual controlling brain in each person. He would be more likely to infer the existence of a separate, outside brain, and the people as mere manifesters of its will.\nxb49 | Register the fact that:\ngfj0 | Virtually all organisations known to you work largely by means of your greed. They attract you because what they say or do appeals to your greed. This is concealed only by their appearance. If you stop listening to their words and look at the effect, you will soon see it.\nnpil | Remember that greed includes greed for being not greedy. So, if someone says: 'Do not be greedy, be generous', you may inwardly interpret this in such a manner that you will develop a greed for generosity. This, however, remains greed.\nbzjv | There are some things which you have to do for yourself. These include familiarising yourself with study-materials given to you. You can only really do this-and thus acquire real qualities -if you suspend the indulgence of desire for immediate satisfactions.\nlu0k | All members of contemporary societies, with few exceptions, are in need of graduating from primitive morality to a higher one. The primitive one is the one which tells you, like a child, that honesty will make you happy, make you successful, get you to higher things. Honesty, you may now be informed, is essential as an instrument, not to be worshipped as a seldom-attained emotion-loaded ideal.\ne09i | Sufis have their own methods of deterring unsuitable people. You may only know one or two ways. Pay attention to the techniques which, for instance, deter by compelling people to conclude that they are worthless.\nbzn6 | What you may take to be attractive, or even spread out by us to be attractive to you, may well not be intended in this manner at all. That which attracts you, or others, about us may be that which is laid down by us as a tool which enables us to regard you (or others) as unsuitable.\n```",
