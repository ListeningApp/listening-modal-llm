You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

88ni | Those who say: 'You cannot make anything out of dried onions' - the equivalent of 'You cannot get anything from a book' -are wrong. Those who say: 'I will wait (or search) until I find fresh onions' are wrong. They are wrong because they do not realise that they would not recognise 'fresh onions' if they saw them. This has to be said, though reluctantly, because such state- ments are usually taken as challenging, when they are more often intended only to be descriptive.
id8b | Let us therefore postulate the statement: 'You can get some- thing from a book. That something may be so important as to lead you to the recognition of the real thing. It is therefore in many cases all-important.'
2mmu | INGREDIENTS
dz0a | But why should people imagine that there is nothing in a book of the same order as 'fresh' experience? Simply because they do
q510 | not know that specific circumstances (such as water added to the onion shreds) are needed before they can get anything. It is the Sufic purpose to help towards the provision of the water as well as the dried onion, so that in due time fresh onions may be presented.
v1pm | HUMILITY
4egp | One of the real reasons for the attempted inculcation of a really 'humble' attitude towards Ufe and learning in traditional teaching techniques is to try to enable people to adopt a point of view which will allow them to 'approach onions through whatever condition of onion is available'.
y2bg | Of course, such teachings in inept hands rapidly turn into moralistic ones. Instead of saying the above, people cast around for a logical prop to teach patience and humility. They soon find it: 'Humility is good for society. It makes people good, pure, etc' This, however, is the social level, not the metaphysical one. If you are 'humble', it may help you in ordinary life. If you are not, you will get nowhere in higher things.
a06d | If people cannot adopt a 'humble' attitude towards something which they are being invited to study, they are not able to study it at all. Therefore there is no such issue as is frequently supposed, where people ask: 'Why should I obey something which I do not know?' The question is invalid because whoever is at that stage cannot obey or disobey: he can only remain a fairly querulous enquirer. He is not master of the option, so there is neither any validity in the question nor any need for an answer, other than a description of his state. The hope lies in the possibility that he may recognise his condition through a description of it, and adjust his attitude accordingly.
78t1 | People, however, more often than not adopt secondary indica- tions as primary, and Sufi teachers have to take into account this tendency. Sometimes they provide deliberately contrived shocks to display the limited nature of the would-be student's thinking, to help him (or her) to gain a deeper understanding of themselves and hence to liberate a wider perspective enabling them to learn.
hww6 | Such a shock is contained in the tale told by Bayazid Bistami.
hd24 | IDOLATRY
zbcg | A man, he recounted, met him on the road and asked where he was going. Bayazid told him that as he had two hundred dinars, he was going on the Pilgrimage to Mecca.
jvtd | The man said: 'Circumambulate me seven times, and let that be your Pilgrimage, for I have dependents.'
08yy | So, continued Bayazid, he did what the man asked, and returned to his own house.
1d45 | More often than not, such an adjustment, because it involves admitting that previous thinking-patterns are inadequate, is not sufficiently welcome to him. He seeks something which will bolster the desire to feel that he is significant.
d6qk | He very easily finds such a creed, individual or institution: because almost all of the current ones specialise - whether they know it or not - in judicious flattery. Even if flattery is alternated with disapproval, it remains flattery.
3y4w | This is one reason why it is so important to understand one's personal motivation.
6shd | An important aspect of this theme of the value of intermediary materials as catalytic elements is to note that there is a form of learning by direct and provoked perception. This is distinct from learning through rote methods or by selective study where that study is planned by the student or by someone else who does not have a full perception of the student's needs.
r2xm | APPEARANCE AND FUNCTION
yosi | We speak here of function, not appearance. There is an interesting parallel in an event which I remember from a time when some literalists were questioning Sidi Abu-Yusuf on Sufi teachers. His answer both shows their mentality and how it fails to accord with reality:
qnky | The questions covered the claims made by or on behalf of Sufi exponents to be Supreme Chief of the Sufis.
ynfn | Abu-Yusuf said: 'This is a metaphor only and does not imply any rivalry. It does not encompass, either, any idea of hierarchy in formal organisation. Furthermore, it does not mean that each
5bgy | claims (or has claimed for him) to be Chief of All the Sufis. It only means that, for those who are following their instructions, Sufi teachers must be regarded as the chief and only source of wisdom. This role is no greater than that of any teacher whose pupils must maintain their concentration and learning ability by not dividing their attention to other subjects, such as - in this case -a hierarchy of teachers. The real chiefs of the Sufis exist and operate in a generally non-perceived realm and are never known in their higher functions; though these personages may present themselves as mere Sufi masters from time to time-as they may assume any other guise - to carry on their functions.'
i4fl | Background to 'Humility'
1tgm | BEFORE the period generally regarded as historical time, there has been an operation of a form of cognition linked with human development which is outside the current methods of acquiring and utilising information. The result of this effort has often been called 'wisdom': although the word wisdom has also often been applied to other fields.
9jcg | RELICS ARE NOT THE THING ITSELF
14nm | Many religious, mystical and other formulations are, up to a point, shrines for the relics of a completely or partially successful attempt to present and make available to various individuals and communities means for acquiring this knowledge. Like almost everything on earth, they are subject to deterioration or fossilisa- tion. They become both museums and exhibits, at one and the same time.
pfum | Because of the tendency to stress discipline and group-attention without contemporaneous adjustments of other factors, many such formulations (some of them called schools or cults) crystallised in the short or long term, and not infrequently they have claimed a monopoly of truth or effective ritual. This process, mirroring limited thinking-patterns, frequently goes so far as to lead to . virtual destruction of the dynamic of the formulation of the School. In practice, exclusivism and dogmatism, beyond a certain point, militate against certain necessities of flexibility. There is a continuing need for regeneration.
uipr | What appears to some people as the sum total of the human heritage of philosophy, metaphysics or even magical thinking can also be viewed, for the foregoing reasons, as heavily burdened with the wreckage or misinterpretation (through selective choice) of formulations previously operated by coherent Schools. The factor causing this state of affairs is endemic in the human community, and has often been unsuspected by large sections of whole rivilisa-
mlys | tions; though made the subject of close attention and rectification by specialists outside of mechanical and confined thought. Such specialists are those who can grasp internal principles and dy- namics : not those who merely rearrange.
