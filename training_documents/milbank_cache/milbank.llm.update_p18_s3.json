They may focus on \"law on the books\"-for example, examining the effect of states' passage of graduated drivers license statutes on rates of injury-causing crashes-or on legal practices, such as the effect of issuing restraining orders against perpetrators of domestic violence on future victimization. Intervention studies can be used to evaluate interventional health law but also to investigate the health effects of public health's legal infrastructure and the unplanned impact of what we have called incidental public health law. Intervention studies lie at the heart of PHLR, as they most directly address the core question of the field: What are the best legal tools to use to promote health?\nybik | Intervention studies can draw from an extensive methodological tool kit. The strongest designs are experimental or quasi-experimental designs with careful controls. Differences in how and when laws are implemented from jurisdiction to jurisdiction provide opportunities for quasi-experimental studies, although sophisticated methods may be required to account for other ways in which jurisdictions may differ from one another. Useful study designs and analytical methods for this purpose can be borrowed from the fields of econometrics and epidemiology. Real-world, randomized experiments are extremely rare but have been employed to study judicial-branch reforms such as specialized courts. Experimental studies can also be carried out using simulations, such as tabletop exercises. \ngii5 | We already have a substantial evidence base investigating the effectiveness of interventional public health law, ranging from single studies through literature reviews to meta-analyses and systematic reviews conducted by entities like the Campbell Collaboration and the United States Task Force on Community Preventive Services. We also have a rich, if less well organized, research literature on incidental public health law. For example, researchers have studied the unintended consequences of human immunodeficiency virus reporting laws on attitudes toward testing, time of testing, and willingness to be tested. Research on the health effects of infrastructural health law has been more limited.\nq5eu | Consistent with ecological models in public health, intervention studies may investigate how laws influence health by changing environments. For example, zoning rules, clean indoor air laws, and laws regulating the\na7ao | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health\n29a3 | condition of rental properties can directly shape residents' exposures to noise, environmental toxins, and stress, as well as their activity patterns, social connections, collective efficacy, and many other factors that appear to influence population health outcomes. Occupational health and safety laws affect workers' exposure to hazardous conditions on the job. Product regulations protect consumers from a range of hazards arising from the use of products, from herbal supplements to firearms.\nsb1e | Interventional research focuses not only on how the law changes physical environments, but also on how it may change the social environment in ways that affect health or health behaviors. Law may shape people's health knowledge and attitudes, the way they perceive the risks and benefits of different choices, the frames through which they view particular choices, and the social norms against which their health decisions are set. PHLR can measure any or all of these dependent variables, as well as changes in health behaviors. There are many examples: research on the effects of indoor smoking prohibitions on social expectations about exposure to secondhand smoke in public; the effect of laws requiring disclosure of calorie information on restaurant menus on consumers' awareness of calorie content and attitudes toward the role of calorie information in food purchasing decisions; and the effect of punitive laws concerning substance abuse during pregnancy on the prenatal care-seeking behavior of pregnant women, to name a few.\nw2yn | Finally, intervention research can illuminate policy choices under conditions of uncertainty. When problems or policy responses are new, there will naturally be little or no intervention research directly on point. Policymaking can still be informed by evidence about analogous policies or by an understanding of how law typically works to influence environments and behaviors, although all analogies are, of course, imperfect proxies for the situation at hand. An example is the area of legal restrictions on cell phone use by drivers. Although public health research recently has provided good evidence of the injury risk associated with this behavior, evidence of the effectiveness of different legal and policy approaches to the problem is not yet available. Until it is, lawmakers seeking to respond to what is clearly a significant health risk might be guided by the lessons learned about the design and enforcement of laws requiring seatbelt and helmet use and prohibiting driving under the \nap6l | influence of alcohol. Health impact assessment has also emerged as a useful way to use mixed methods to inform policy decisions with reliable data on possible effects, intended and unintended. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations, widely used in the field of decision science but rarely used in PHLR, offer an intriguing method for accounting for uncertainty about multiple parameters of importance to evaluating the likely effect of law.\niest | Mechanism Studies\ncox8 | To advance the field, we need not only more evidence of law's health effects but also a greater understanding of how law has the effects it has. This is important for many reasons. Evidence of mechanisms strengthens specific causal claims. Understanding how a particular intervention influences environments and behavior facilitates the identification of further interventions, or of alternatives to eliminate superfluous requirements or unintended side effects and strengthen the mechanisms that are working. The better we understand how law works, the better we can use it, replicate its successes across jurisdictions, and extend its approach to other kinds of health risks. Informed by theories of health behavior, PHLR can develop and test models to explain how public health law effectuates change in health behaviors and ultimately health outcomes.\nppqi | At the most basic level, laws encourage healthy, safe, and socially beneficial behaviors and discourage unhealthy, dangerous, and socially deleterious ones by shaping incentives (rewards) and deterrents (punishments). Though the theory may be simple, the process is not. Regulators have myriad levers and tactics that they can use to influence behavior directly or by manipulating the environment, and each choice in a regulatory system can and should be studied for its effectiveness, in both absolute terms and relative to less burdensome alternatives. Among the mechanisms are taxation and subsidies, changes in the information environment, changes in the built environment, and signals sent by tort litigation.\noxou | With respect to laws imposing outright prohibitions on particular behaviors, many of the key research questions relate to mechanisms of implementation and enforcement: What penalties are applied to violators of legal rules? What processes are used to detect violators? With what\n495n | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health",
