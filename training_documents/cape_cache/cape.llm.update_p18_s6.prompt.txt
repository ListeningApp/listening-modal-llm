You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ez9s | ii. How many papers did he submit for his application for the promotion to the rank of Senior Lecturer?
mqot | iii. What is the required number of papers for promotion from the rank of Lecturer to Senior Lecturer?
oc99 | iv. Did the Appointments and Promotions Board and Council take the pain to scrutinize the document or was it a deliberate attempt to favour the applicants?
gipz | V. Can it be concluded that the Directorate of Human Resource failed in discharge of its duty? Convocation needs answers.
b4wj | B. Undue Delays, Abuse of Process and Unfair Treatment in Relation to Promotion of Some Senior Members
5xlt | 1. Dr. Kofi Adeladza Amegah
9bz4 | a) Dr. Amegah applied for accelerated promotion to the rank of Associate Professor on 6th of July 2020.
yfv2 | b) The then Dean of the School of Allied Health Sciences, Prof. Emmanuel Abu, constituted a Special Appointments and Promotions Committee to consider his application. On 21st July 2020, this Special A&P Committee wrote to Dr. Amegah to inform him that his application could not be approved because his career profile rendered him ineligible to apply. Dr. Amegah contested this decision and asked the Dean to forward his application to the College which he duly obliged.
pujl | c) The Appointments and Promotions Committee of the College of Health and Allied Sciences returned Dr. Amegah's application document to him with a letter dated 24th September 2020 indicating that he had not served the required number of years to be eligible for accelerated promotion to that rank. The Committee's decision was reached after the then Acting Provost, Prof. Emmanuel Abu, had written to DHR for interpretation on Dr. Amegah's previous application.
3rqe | d) Dr Amegah, not satisfied with the decision, petitioned the Chairman of A&P on 13th January, 2021 but did not receive any feedback from the Vice-Chancellor. Later on 2nd December, 2021 (almost twelve months after the petition), the applicant sent a reminder to the Chairman of the Appointments and Promotions Board requesting to know the outcome of his petition.
nsi3 | e) While awaiting the petition's outcome, the applicant was due for regular promotion on 1st August 2021 and applied on 12th August 2021.
nil3 | f) However, the applicant was invited by two members of the Appointment and Promotions Board, Prof. J. N. Buah and Prof. Francis E. Amuquandoh, to advise him to withdraw the petition to pave the way for his regular application to be assessed. According to them, it was the wish of the Vice-Chancellor.
68a1 | g) Whilst the applicant was considering this advice by the two members of A&P Board, he was copied in a letter dated 6th December, 2021 written by the Provost of CoHAS to the Director of Human Resource withdrawing his regular application with the reason being that he is not prepared to let sleeping dogs lie with his petition.
seik | h) On 9th December 2021, DHR, wrote to the Provost returning Dr. Amegah's regular application document to the College. The applicant received the letter after the Christmas break even though the letter was dated 9th December 2021.
oq7c | i) Dr. Amegah withdrew the petition on 12th January 2022 on the advice of Professors Buah and Amanquandoh as directed by the Vice-Chancellor.
z4mi | j) On 27th January 2022, the Vice-Chancellor responded to Dr. Amegah's letter withdrawing the petition, indicating that a decision had already been taken on the application before his withdrawal letter was received. However, no such decision had been communicated to Dr Amegah.
hkft | k) On the same 27th January 2022, the Vice-Chancellor communicated the Appointments and Promotions Board's.decision on his petition submitted on 13th January, 2021 as follows: -
jai3 | i. The application from Assistant Lecturer to Senior Lecturer was, not due for regular promotion (sic) since you assumed duty as Assistant Lecturer on 12th June, 2012 and applied for promotion on 13th March, 2017.
p57i | ii. You were on full-time studies for two years and three months. This implies that you did two years and nine months as actual years of service out of six (6) years needed for regular promotion from Assistant Lecturer to Senior Lecturer.
u5ug | iii. Since you served for two years, nine months, your promotion to the rank of Senior Lecturer could not have been a regular mode (sic), but accelerated mode.
i9k5 | iv. The Board did not withdraw the promotion or give post dated promotion since that would have meant change in effective date of promotion which will imply a refund of all salaries paid to you before the effective date of promotion to Senior Lecturer.
20z2 | b. Prior to receipt of the letter dated 27th January 2022, Dr Amegah had been invited into a meeting with his Dean and HoD to have a discussion on his returned application. At the meeting, he was advised by the Dean to reapply without any letter to that effect from the A&P Board.
4cgs | Convocation, therefore, requests answers to the following question concerning Dr Amegahs promotion:
htre | i. How different is Dr. Amegah's accelerated promotion case from that of Prof Kyei?
da3c | ii. Is there anywhere in any minutes of A & P that Dr Amegah had accessed accelerated promotion before this time?
890q | iii. Why did it take the Appointments and Promotions Board twelve months to respond to the petition seeking clarification of the status of the previous promotions (whether regular or accelerated)?
jomo | iv. Does the Provost of the College have the right to order the withdrawal of Dr.
06fi | Amegah's regular application on the flimsy grounds that he was not prepared to let sleeping dogs lie with his petition?
hb4s | V. Did the Provost consult members of the College A&P Committee before writing to withdraw Dr. Amegah's application?
cqq2 | vi. Based on the Provost's reason given for withdrawing his petition, is Dr Amegah not being punished for holding onto a petition he believes in and for which the A&P board has a statutory responsibility to determine?
1ews | vii. What caused the over 1-month lag between the date DHR letter was written and when Dr Amegah received his copy? Was it a matter of someone in authority asking DHR to backdate the letter returning of his documents?
afyn | viii. Was it an A&P Board decision to return Dr. Amegah's regular promotion documents to him?
8sye | C. Wrongful and Capricious Interpretation and Illegal Application of a Committee's Recommendation to Override the University's Statutes and Promotion Criteria
r04h | i. In 2016, some persons were appointed to the ranks of Lecturer and Senior Lecturers at the fledgling School of Medical Sciences in accordance with the 2012 Statutes of the University. Some of the persons appointed as Lecturers were later upgraded to the rank of Senior Lecturer.
orpr | ii. In their appointment letters, no special criteria other than the promotion criteria would be applied to their next promotion. It was thus understood that promotion from the rank of Senior Lecturer to Associate Professor would require submission of seven papers, while promotion from Lecturer to Senior Lecturer would require submission of five refereed papers for assessment as was the normal requirements.
