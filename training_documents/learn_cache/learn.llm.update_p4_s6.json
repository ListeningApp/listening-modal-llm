        "content": "d5bi | While you are currently deep underground digging at what you know to be valuable intellectual or professional ore, your students are standing on the surface wondering why anyone in their right mind would be so far underground. To reach them, experts must retrace their intellectual steps and find questions that will capture learners' interest and ultimately pull them into a more advanced conversation. That's not easy\nba4l | to do. But it is the power of questions and problems that drives deep learning.\nffx8 | Any learner must remain highly motivated to stick with the arduous process of building a new paradigm and thinking about its implications and applications. To maintain such dedication, students must believe that their learning will make a difference to themselves and others. The change should have a purpose that satisfies intellectually and emotionally. People are most likely to attempt deep learning approaches when they are trying to answer questions or solve problems that they regard as important, intriguing, beautiful, or fun. Altruism, a concern for others, can play a powerful role in stimulating the hard work necessary.\ns6su | To learn deeply we must intend to do so. Humans are born with insatiable curiosities. But here's the rub. Our desire to do something will go down if we have the feeling that someone else controls us. Every effort to force students to pay attention and reexamine their existing paradigms will backfire. Extrinsic motivators (for example, grades) tend to suppress internal desires. Maybe we are just ornery creatures, but we don't like to lose what psychologists call a locus of control. We also don't like to do something when we believe we can't do it. One way of thinking about this process is that the motivation to learn has at least three components: purpose; a belief that we can learn; and the conviction that we control when, where, and what we decide to learn.\ny219 | In school not all students will even try to understand and to think about implications and applications, to theorize about possibilities. Many of them will focus instead only on passing the course (\"surface learners\") or making the highest grade (\"strategic learners\"), and neither of these types has the intention to learn deeply. Students become a particular type of learner because of conditioning, however, not as a result of their personalities or intelligence. Maybe they didn't have parents who invited a snake charmer to a first-grade birthday party or read to them every night. Maybe instead an aunt, uncle, or teacher hammered them about \"being smart.\" Perhaps a whole series of teachers fostered a focus on grades rather than learning. The conditioning occurs throughout our society. A barrage of movies, songs, television programs, economic pressures, and even friends can stimulate those surface or\n06ht | strategic approaches. The path students take isn't written into their DNA or a reflection of their abilities. Some highly capable humans can develop predominantly strategic or surface intentions with the wrong experiences in life.\nv3r2 | Schools make big contributions to this phenomenon. Some kinds of assessment can leave the impression that learning consists of recognizing correct answers on multiple-choice exams. Highly competitive emphasis on grades can deny students a sense of control over their own education and reduce their motivation to do the hard work of deep learning. Without deep intentions students resort to memorizing correct answers and procedures that will have little sustained, positive, or substantial influence on the way they will subsequently think, act, or feel.\nnv42 | Even when students build perfectly acceptable mental models, \"learning\" doesn't always produce good problem solving. When people learn some new information or ideas, they do not necessarily develop the capacity to use it in different kinds of situations. Medical students who memorize reams of information on the body and can even explain physical functions in gory detail cannot always use that knowledge to make a proper differential diagnosis or devise a novel and effective treatment for a complex ailment. This \"transfer problem,\" as learning scholars call it, can bedevil the most dedicated students. Knowing a body of information needed to solve a problem does not necessarily entail the capacity to unlock its puzzle.\nxags | It is, of course, easier to solve problems someone else has already mastered. We can go to school on their work, learning to apply standard answers to known types of difficulties. But we live in a world of rapid change with new kinds of trouble no one has ever seen. Back in the nineteen eighties some Japanese theorists saw two kinds of experts: routine ones who know many if not all the standard answers, and adaptive wizards who also know those common routines but have additional powers. They have both the ability and the attitude to recognize and relish the opportunity and necessity for invention. The adaptives like taking on those unique difficulties, and they are good at it.\njc47 | How then do people learn to become that kind of expert? Practice and feedback. Lots of opportunity to speculate with problems they have never encountered before.\nko3c | Imagine, for example, two math classes. In one, the instructor performs algebra in front of the students (that's what often happens in many math classes). The pupils take notes and then try to apply the procedures to equations they encounter on their homework and tests. In the second type, the teacher gives students conceptually rich and fascinating problems that are slightly more advanced than anything they've tried before and invites them to invent their own solutions, perhaps working in groups. They haven't encountered the problem, and no one is there to solve it for them. They are invited to become adaptive experts. The teacher becomes a guide by the side rather than a sage on the stage, ready to ask a question to help students think past some conceptual difficulty rather than performing the problem for them.\nxek3 | Manu Kapur, at the National Institute of Education in Singapore, discovered the secrets of what he calls \"productive failure.\" Students \"who engaged in problem solving before being taught,\" he concluded from an elaborate comparison study, \"demonstrated significantly greater conceptual understanding\" than did people who received \"direct instruction\" on how to do problems. Furthermore, the ninth graders who struggled to invent solutions, made mistakes and corrected them, could more easily solve \"novel problems\" than could \"those who were taught first.\"\nbbpr | All the learning we have discussed involves memory. But people are most likely to remember what they have used and maybe invented, not what they have had drilled into their heads. Marshall and Albert began learning French in the sixth grade, but six weeks into the fall semester, Albert's parents moved to Paris, taking the young boy and his sister with them. By the time he graduated from high school, Marshall had taken six years of French, memorizing vocabulary and usually acing the exams. His parents drilled him, using all the sophisticated procedures of spaced repetition. It doesn't take much imagination or insight, however, to guess which one of the two boys read, spoke, and wrote French with almost perfect fluency when they met for a reunion right before going off to college, and which one struggled to keep up with the chatter. People learn deeply by doing in authentic situations.\n5zyf | Students are more likely to remember what they understand. When we comprehend we make rich associations between ideas and information, and the network of connections we lay down in our brains\n9own | enhances our memories. If through speculation, someone has invented a solution, that person can more easily recall its steps and why you should take those steps than if the person had picked up the solution from watching someone else perform the process.",
