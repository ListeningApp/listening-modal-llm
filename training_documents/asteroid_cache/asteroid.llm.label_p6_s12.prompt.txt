You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1pmc | The mean <LATEX>\begin{array}{} { \text { eset. } } \\ { 2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / 2 0 6 p b } \end{array}</LATEX> age of the Stannern phosphates also recorded young metamorphism at <LATEX>4 1 4 3 . 0 \pm 1 2 . 5 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> (Fig. 4), sug- gesting that they experienced severe impact reheating at this time. In contrast to Juvinas, both the apatite and merrillite in Stan- nern yielded identical ages. This may be because the host rock of Stannern was reheated more homogeneously to the U-Pb re- set temperature. According to geochemical studies of the trace in- compatible element trends, the geological backgrounds of Stannern and Juvinas should be different, which means that they resided at different locations on Vesta (e.g., Barrat et al., 2007). Their identi- cal reheating ages of ~4150 Ma indicate that there were two (or more) impact events on Vesta during this period, where the re-

Moreover, the 207 Pb-206Pb age of the Stannern pyroxene and plagioclase also recorded this event at <LATEX>4 1 2 8 \pm 1 6 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> (Tera et al., 1997). The Stannern 40 Ar-39 Ar age was disturbed at ~4200-3800 Ma and did not present a plateau age (Kunz et al., 1995; Kennedy et al., 2019). Conversely, several radiometric chronologies place the early crystallization of Stannern at 4563 Ma (e.g., Lugmair and Shukolyukov, 1998; Touboul et al., 2015). Its zircon 207 Pb-206 Pb age recorded early thermal metamor- phism at <LATEX>4 5 5 0 \pm 1 0 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> (Ireland and Bukovansk√°, 1992). Therefore, the metamorphic history of Stannern can be summarized as fol- lows: (i) ancient crystallization at 4563 Ma, (ii) thermal crustal metamorphism at 4550 Ma, (iii) a reset of the U-Pb system in the phosphates and silicates at <LATEX>\sim 4 1 4 0 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> through intense impact reheating, and (iv) a subsequent weaker impact at sometime be- tween ~4500 Ma and <LATEX>\sim 3 6 0 0 \quad M a ,</LATEX> where the K-Ar chronometer was disturbed. Events (iii) and (iv) may indicate the same event.
b8hf | 5.3. Unbrecciated achondrites represent the initial cooling of asteroids
hntf | The U-Pb systems in the unbrecciated samples, Agoult and Ibitira, recorded significantly ancient events prior to 4.5 Ga. The model <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> age of the Agoult apatite, <LATEX>4 5 2 4 . 8 \pm 9 . 6 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> (Fig. 4), is identical to or slightly younger than the 207 Pb-206Pb age of its oxide fraction <LATEX>\left( 4 5 3 2 . 3 9 \pm 0 . 8 7 M a \right.</LATEX> and is significantly younger than that of the zircon <LATEX>\left( 4 5 5 4 . 5 \pm 2 . 0 M a \right.</LATEX> lizuka et al., 2015, 2019). The age differences between the different minerals may reflect the slow cooling of the Agoult host rock. It is likely that the rock was buried within the crust after its original crystal- lization and was subsequently heated by the hot interior of Vesta (Iizuka et al., 2019). The original internal heat source, a short-lived radionuclide (26Al; t1/2 ~0.7 Myr), had mostly decayed by this time <LATEX>\left( \sim 4 5 5 5 - 4 5 2 5 \mathrm { M a } \right) .</LATEX> However, according to a thermo-chemical evolution calculation (Neumann et al., 2014), the interior of the mantle of Vesta likely maintained a high temperature for <LATEX>> 1 0 0</LATEX> Myr after differentiation. The recrystallized textures of Agoult, with no apparent evidence of impact brecciation, further support this hypothesis of crustal thermal metamorphism. The <LATEX>4 0 \quad A r - 3 9 \quad A r</LATEX> plateau age of the Agoult plagioclase at <LATEX>4 4 9 6 \pm 8 M a</LATEX> (Iizuka et al., 2019) recorded the end of its subsequent slow cooling. To summa- rize, Agoult has the following thermal history: (i) ancient crystal- lization <LATEX>a t > 4 5 6 0 \quad M a ,</LATEX> (ii) high-temperature crustal metamorphism at 4555 Ma, and (iii) subsequent monotonic cooling with a low <LATEX>1 1 \pm 2 ^ { \circ } C / M y</LATEX> (lizuka et al., 2019) in the deep crust
99fo | The merrillite in Ibitira recorded an earlier event, with the model <LATEX>2 0 7 p b * / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> age of <LATEX>4 5 5 2 . 0 \pm 8 . 8 M a</LATEX> (Fig. 4). This value is indistinguishable from its pyroxene 207Pb-206Pb isochron age of <LATEX>4 5 5 6 . 7 5 \pm 0 . 5 7</LATEX> Ma (lizuka et al., 2014). The whole-rock Mn- Cr systems also recorded this age <LATEX>\left( 4 5 5 7 + 2 / - 4 \quad M a ; \right.</LATEX> Lugmair and Shukolyukov, 1998). Thermal metamorphism at ~4555 Ma is con- sistent with the records in the eucrites, even though Ibitira came from a different parent body. The <LATEX>4 0 A r - 3 9 A r</LATEX> age of <LATEX>4 4 8 7 \pm 1 5</LATEX> Ma for Ibitira is distinctly younger than those from the other chronometers (Bogard and Garrison, 1995). It is inferred that Ibitira experienced (i) ancient crystallization likely prior to 4560 Ma, (ii) high-temperature thermal metamorphism in the crust at 4555 Ma, and (iii) subsequent monotonic cooling until

lrry | Our study reveals that the U-Pb system in the phosphates in the three brecciated eucrites recorded multiple impact events prior to 4.15 Ga. The phosphates U-Pb ages of two other brecciated eu- crites, NWA 8009 and Bereba, also recorded the thermal events at
hvhm | ~4.25-4.1 Ga (Liao and Hsu, 2017; Zhou et al., 2011). Moreover, the silicate U-Pb systems in some eucrites recorded coincident timings (Galer and Lugmair, 1996; Tera et al., 1997). It is obvi- ous that the parent body, Vesta, suffered intense impacts at <LATEX>\geq 4 . 1 5</LATEX> Ga, during which the U-Pb systems in its phosphates and silicates were partially reset. Conversely, only the K-Ar system recorded the later bombardment on Vesta (or the V-type asteroids) at 3.85-3.47 Ga (Kennedy et al., 2019). The absence of ~3.85-Ga records in the phosphates U-Pb systems suggests that these later impacts were weaker than the earlier impacts (>4.15 Ga), resulting in lower re- heating temperatures.
863b | The closure temperatures <LATEX>T _ { c }</LATEX> of the U-Pb system in zircon and apatite, and of the K-Ar system in plagioclase are calculated using Dodson's law (Dodson, 1973): <LATEX>T _ { c } = E / R \ln \left( A R D _ { 0 } T _ { C } ^ { 2 } / a ^ { 2 } E T ^ { \prime } \right) ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>E = a c t i v a t i o n</LATEX> energy, <LATEX>R = g a s</LATEX> constant, <LATEX>D _ { 0 } =</LATEX> coef- ficient, and A is a dimensionless constant, with known diffusion properties of Pb and/or Ar (Cherniak and Watson, 2000; Cherniak et al., 1991; Cassata et al., 2009). For diffusion scale (a), we use typical grain sizes of the minerals in the basaltic eucrites. Cool- ing rate <LATEX>T ^ { \prime }</LATEX> is an unknown parameter. In high-temperature range <LATEX>\left( 1 2 0 0 ^ { \circ } C - 8 5 0 ^ { \circ } C \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>T ^ { \prime }</LATEX> for the basaltic eucrites is known to be as rapid as 4000¬∞C/Myr (Miyamoto and Takeda, 1977). By extrapo- lating this to the lower temperature range, <LATEX>T _ { c }</LATEX> becomes <LATEX>\sim 5 9 0 ^ { \circ } C</LATEX> for the U-Pb in apatite and <LATEX>\sim 3 0 0 ^ { \circ } C</LATEX> for the K-Ar in plagioclase. The detailed conditions for the <LATEX>T _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> calculations and their results are provided in supplementary Table S3. In case of impact-induced reheating and subsequent rapid quenching at the near-surface of the asteroid the closure temperatures are much higher. Assuming a rapid quenching <LATEX>1 ^ { \circ } C / d</LATEX> (or, <LATEX>\left. 4 \times 1 0 ^ { 8 } { } ^ { \circ } C / \mathrm { M y r } \right)</LATEX> after impact reheat- ing, <LATEX>T _ { c }</LATEX> becomes <LATEX>\sim 1 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }</LATEX> for the U-Pb in apatite, <LATEX>\sim 5 0 0 ^ { \circ } C</LATEX> for the K-Ar in plagioclase, and exceed the melting point of basaltic rock for the U-Pb in zircon (Supplementary Table S3). This means the U-Pb ages in the eucrite zircon may not be disturbed by impacts without extensive remelting and/or recrystallization, unless our as- sumption of the rapid quenching is incorrect.
fj24 | In Fig. 5, we compiled the literature data for the U-Pb and Hf-W chronologies of zircon, the U-Pb system of silicates and phosphates, and the K-Ar system of whole-rock or silicates (dated by the <LATEX>4 0 A r ^ { 3 9 } A r</LATEX> method) for various basaltic eucrites and mesosiderites. There seem to be three key age groups: (1) prior to 4.5 Ga, (2) prior to 4.15 Ga, and (3) near ~3.9-3.5 Ga.
uz3c | (1) The initial magmatic crystallization (4.56 Ga) and subsequent thermal metamorphism occurred prior to 4.5 Ga. The U-Pb ages of the various eucrite zircons reveal the timing of the ubiquitous thermal metamorphism of the initial basaltic crust of Vesta to be 4.55 Ga at a metamorphic temperature of ~900‚ÑÉ (lizuka et al., 2015). After an intensive initial differ- entiation at 4.56 Ga, the magmatism on Vesta lasted until 4.53 Ga, according to the Hf-W records of unbrecciated eucrite zir- con (Roszjar et al., 2016). In addition, the asteroid may have suffered a large basin-forming collision at this stage (Hopkins et al., 2015; Kennedy et al., 2019). The U-Pb, and Hf-W studies of mesosiderite zircons also provide a high-temperature re- heating age of 4.53 Ga (Haba et al., 2017, 2019; Koike et al., 2017) that is attributed to a catastrophic collision.
