You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

9uwy | Just for fun, try placing these words in a pyramid of lower to higher power. Don't think too much; use your intuition.
srly | When asked, most people rank these words from more powerful to less powerful as follows:
dl6i | By using the words toward the top of the pyra- mid, we can make many of our questions more robust. For example, consider the following sequence:
89ub | · Are you satisfied with our working relationship?
dhle | · When have you been most satisfied with our working relationship?
2nib | . What is it about our working relationship that you find most satisfying?
naev | . Why might it be that that our working relationship has had its ups and downs?
7h0h | As you move from the simple "yes/no" question at the beginning toward the "why" question at the end, you'll notice that the queries tend to stimulate more reflective thinking and a deeper level of conversation.
a64c | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
gi7n | That's what we mean by a powerful question-one that provokes thoughtful exploration and evokes cre- ative thinking.
3pn1 | However, a note of caution: Unless a "why" ques- tion is carefully crafted, it can easily evoke a defensive response, as people try to justify their answer rather than proceed in a spirit of inquiry. For instance, the questions, "Why can't you ever tell me exactly what you are thinking?" or "Why did you do it that way?" can cause someone to defend a given position or rationalize some past decision, rather than open new possibilities. In contrast, when a "why" question stems from genuine curiosity, such as "I wonder why that happened?" then the inquiry has the potential to cre- ate useful insights.
wjuz | Just because a question is situated near the top of the pyramid does not necessarily mean that it is more important or more relevant than its counterparts at the bottom. Depending on your goals, a "yes/no" question can be extremely important (particularly if you are clos- ing a large sale!). Likewise, a question that gets at the facts of who, when, and where can often be crucial, such as in a legal case. However, when you want to open the space for creativity and break- through thinking, questions construct- ed around the words at the top of the pyramid will have more strategic lever- age than those that use the words at the bottom.
3yxv | THE SECOND DIMENSION: The Scope of a Question
d8zj | It's important not only to be aware of how the words we choose influence the effectiveness of our query, but also to match the scope of a question to our needs. Take a look at the following three questions:
ywxn | · How can we best manage our work group?
uxhs | · How can we best manage our company?
ed6e | · How can we best manage our supply chain?
6qqm | In this example, the questions progressively broaden the domain of inquiry as they consider larg- er and larger aspects of the system; that is, they
onum | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
3iir | expand in scope.As you work to make your questions powerful, tailor and clarify the scope as precisely as possible to keep them within the realistic boundaries and needs of the situation you are working with.Avoid stretching the scope of your question too far. For example, compare the following question to the ones above:
7a0a | • How can we best manage the economy?
o1qp | While extremely interesting, this query is clearly outside the scope of most people's capacity to take effective action, at least in the short term. In many sit- uations, this would be a less strategic question than one for which those involved had the capacity to make a more immediate difference.
jrik | THE THIRD DIMENSION: The Assumptions Within Questions
xv78 | Because of the nature of language, almost all of the questions we pose have assumptions built into them, either explicit or implicit. These assumptions may or may not be shared by the group involved in the exploration; for instance the question, "How should we create a bilin- gual educational system in California?" assumes that those involved in the exploration have agreed that being bilingual is an important capacity for the state's students. However, some powerful ques- tions challenge everyone's existing assumptions. For example, ask yourself what assumptions the following question might challenge: "How might we eliminate the border between the U.S. and Mexico?"
sdks | To formulate powerful questions, it's important to become aware of assumptions and use them appro- priately. So, contrast the question, "What did we do wrong and who is responsible?" with "What can we learn from what's happened and what possibilities do we now see?" The first question assumes error and blame; it is a safe bet that whoever is responding will feel defensive.The second question encourages reflec- tion and is much more likely than the first query to stimulate learning and collaboration among those involved.
y8fb | It's often helpful to examine a question for any unconscious beliefs it may introduce to the situation. You can do so by simply asking your team, "What assumptions or beliefs are we holding that are key to the conversation we are having here?" and "How would we come at this if we held an entirely different belief system than the one we have?" Each of these questions invites an exploration into both conscious and unconscious assumptions and opens up the space for new possibilities to reveal themselves.
521q | By surfacing or altering assumptions, we can shift the context of a strategic inquiry and create new opportunities for innovation. Compare the following two questions:
yogo | • How can we compete with the Chinese?
2285 | · How can we collaborate with the Chinese?
ys0g | The second question changes the context by challenging our traditional busi- ness paradigm and the assumptions that underlie it. As a result, it opens up a new line of exploration and set of subsequent questions. The art of reframing questions in this way has important implications for not only shifting our assumptions, but also creating new possibilities for constructive action.
7zvp | By understanding and consciously considering the three dimensions of powerful questions, we can increase the power of the questions we ask and, as a result, increase our ability to generate insights that help shape the future.As with any new skill, the best teacher is experience, and the best coach is a thoughtful listener. We encourage you to experiment with increasing the power of your questions and see what impact you have.
ww6u | For example, in advance of an important meeting or conversation, spend a few minutes with a col- league and write down several questions that are rel- evant to the topic. Rate them in terms of their power. Referring to the three dimensions outlined above, see if you can spot why certain questions are more com- pelling than others. Experiment with changing the construction and scope, to get a feel for how doing so changes the direction of the inquiry. Be sure to exam- ine the assumptions that are embedded in your ques- tions and check to see if they will help or hinder your
hpi6 | exploration. Just a few practice sessions will greatly enhance your ability to engage in productive conver- sations stimulated by dynamic questions.
4uhb | Using Powerful Questions in Organizations
epyi | There are more and more examples of how the disci- plined use of compelling questions is making a differ- ence in organizational life. These changes often hap- pen in surprising ways, opening new avenues that people never considered before.
y51p | HP "for the World." Sometimes something as simple as changing a preposition in a sentence can have a dramatic impact on how an organiza- tion conceives of its mission and role. Consider how a small shift in the con- struction of a question led to major changes in the scope and context of strategic inquiry at Hewlett- Packard, resulting in effective innovation and targeted action. The director of HP Labs wondered why the organization was not con- sidered the best industrial research laboratory in the world. As he thought about it, he realized that he did not know what that designation really meant. He charged Barbara Waugh, a key staff member, with coor- dinating the effort to respond to the question, "What does being the best industrial research lab in the world mean?" Instead of looking for answers outside the company, Barbara encouraged the director to share his core question with all HP Lab employees around the world.
