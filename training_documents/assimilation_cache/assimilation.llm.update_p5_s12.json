        "content": "h8gv | F of x is proportional to exp of negative one half of x minus mu transpose sigma inverse x minus mu. The column vector Y equals Y two, Y three transpose of observations and the vector X of process variables are related by the equation Y tilde equals H X plus zeta two xi three transpose, where H equals zero one zero, zero zero one. Given a particular realization of the process variables, Y then has a multivariate normal distribution, Y given x follows N of H x, tau squared I, where I is the two by two identity matrix. All quantities can be computed from the gain matrix K, which will also be derived in the exercises.\nkwkp | It is instructive to compare the standard deviations of the prior and posterior distributions for X one (reanalysis) and for X three (filtering). These quantities are computed in Exercise four. It turns out that var of X one given y is less than var of X one which equals sigma squared and var of X three given y is less than var of X three which equals sigma squared alpha to the fourth plus alpha squared plus one, as expected. However, var of X one given y cannot be made arbitrarily small, even if z is small, while var of X three given y equals O of tau squared. Details are in the exercises.\nyj0m | Twenty point four - Sequential Data Assimilation\newfp | We now focus on reanalysis, filtering, and forecasting for time-dependent processes. The data arrive as a time series-a sequence of realizations of a discrete-time stochastic process.\noczy | Suppose the process variables are X of k, k equals zero, one, and the observations are Y of k, k equals one, two, and so on. A starting value X of zero for the process variables is allowed to incorporate a background state for which no observations are available. We use the notation X of zero to N for a sequence of X of k: k equals zero, one, through N of vector-valued random variables and x of zero to N for a sequence of its realizations, and similarly for Y. We are interested in estimating X of n, given Y of one to N (reanalysis), or given Y of one to n (filtering), or given Y of one to n minus one (forecasting).\n2ttg | Chapter Twenty - Data Assimilation\nhis3 | Joint P D F s (also called probability mass functions) and conditional P D F s are identified by suitable indices. For example, f of x from zero to n, Y from one to n of x from zero to n, y from one to n is the joint density function of the process variables X of zero, through X of n and observations Y of one, through Y of n, and f of x from two to n given Y from one to n minus one which is x from two to n is the conditional P D F for X from two, through X of n given observations y from one, through y of n minus one. The latter is a function of y from one to n minus one and x from two to n. Since observations arrive sequentially, one can try to find forecast and filter estimates also sequentially.\nm50z | Twenty point four point one - Filtering and Forecasting for Markov Chains\nme84 | Definition twenty point one. A discrete-time stochastic process X from zero to N has the Markov property if its P D F s satisfy\no56m | f of x from n to N given x from zero to n minus one of x from n to N equals f of x from n to N given x of n minus one of x from n to N, n equals one, through N, for all x from n to N. A discrete-time stochastic process that has the Markov property is called a Markov chain.\nslz6 | Intuitively, the Markov property says that, to predict future observations X from n to N of the stochastic process, it is sufficient to know the immediate past X of n minus one. Additional knowledge of the more distant past X from zero to n minus two does not change the predictions of the future. An induction argument shows that the joint distribution of X from zero to n can then be written as a product of conditional distributions,\n90k5 | f of x from zero to n of x from zero to n equals f of zero of x of zero times the product of f of x of j given x of j minus one, n equals one, two, and so on.",
