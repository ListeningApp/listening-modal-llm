They quantify phenomena and, when combined with human actions and emotions, can make them more memorable. When authors create public interest story elements with Tableau Public, readers can interact with the analysis, which creates a highly personal experience and translates into increased participation and decreased abandonment. It's not difficult to embed Tableau Public visualizations into websites and blogs. It is as easy as copying and pasting the JavaScript that Tableau Public automatically renders for you.\ni0lj | Using Tableau Public increases accessibility to stories too. You can view data stories on any mobile device with a web browser and then share it with friends via social media sites such as Twitter or Facebook using Tableau Public's sharing functionality. Stories can be told with text as well as popular and tried-and-true visualization types such as maps, bar charts, lists, heat maps, line charts, and scatterplots. Maps are particularly easier to build in Tableau Public than most other data visualization offerings because Tableau has integrated geocoding (down to the city and postal code) directly into the application. Tableau Public has a built-in date hierarchy that makes it easy for users to drill through time dimensions just by clicking on a button. One of Tableau Software's taglines, Data to the People, is a reflection not only of the ability to distribute analyses sets to thousands of people at once, but also of the enhanced abilities of nontechnical users to explore their own data easily and derive relevant insights for their own community without having to learn a slew of technical skills.\nfdab | Telling your story with Tableau Public\n07he | The Tableau Software was originally imagined in the Stanford University Computer Science department, where a research project sponsored by the United States Department of Defense was launched to study how people can rapidly analyze data. This project merged two branches of computer science - the understanding of data relationships and computer graphics. This mash-up was discovered to be the best way for people to understand and sometimes digest complex data relationships rapidly and, in effect, help readers consume data. This project eventually moved from the Stanford campus to the corporate world, and Tableau Software was born. The usage and adoption of Tableau has since skyrocketed. At the time of writing this book, Tableau is the fastest growing software company in the world and now, Tableau competes directly with older software manufacturers for data visualization and discovery, such as Microsoft, IBM, SAS, Qlik, and Tibco, to name a few.\nv1de | Chapter One\n7mej | Most of these are compared by Gartner in its annual Magic Quadrant.\njw4n | Tableau Software's flagship program, Tableau Desktop, is a commercial software used by many organizations and corporations throughout the world. Tableau Public is the free version of Tableau's offering, and it is typically used with nonconfidential data either from the public domain or the one that we collected ourselves.

There is no other software like it - powerful, free, and open to data story authors.\n9qfg | There are a few terms in this book that might be new to you.

One or more visualizations can be on a dashboard, which is where your users will interact with your data.\ndves | One of the wonderful features about Tableau Public is that you can load data and visualize it on your own. Traditionally, this has been an activity that was undertaken with the help of programmers at work.

The basic steps to create a Tableau Public visualization are as follows:\n3d6a | Gather your data sources, usually in a spreadsheet or a CSV file.\nli84 | Prepare and format your data to make it usable in Tableau Public.\ny06n | Connect to the data and start building data visualizations (charts, graphs, and other objects).\nsipr | Save and publish the data visualization to the Tableau Public website.\nyuxx | Embed your data visualization in your web page by using the code that Tableau Public provides.\ndbah | Tableau Public is used by some of the leading news organizations across the world, including The New York Times, The Guardian, National Geographic, the Washington Post, the Boston Globe, La Informacion, and Ã‰poca. In the following sections, we will discuss installing Tableau Public. Then, we will take a look at how we can find some of these visualizations out there in the wild so that we can learn from others and create our own original visualizations.\n4byb | Getting Started with Tableau Public\nu64j | Now, let's look at the installation steps for Tableau Public:\n4lha | One.
