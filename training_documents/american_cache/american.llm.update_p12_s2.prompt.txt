You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

rut3 | By taking the pictorial turn, American educators worked in the tra- dition of revolutionary linguistic movements dating back to the mid- seventeenth century. Following the Thirty Years' War and the English Rev- olution, European linguists and political theorists blamed much of the social violence on miscommunications resulting from the variety and ambiguity of national languages. After decades of political instability and the related loss of meaningful forms of signification, Europeans searched for an ideally prelapsarian or Adamic universal language. As the idea of a universal language became the common goal of linguistic reform, pic- tures in particular were tapped for their ability to transmit meaning con- cretely, unambiguously, and free from verbal interferences.17
m3cp | In the context of the post-Revolutionary United States it was thus not a surprise that American educators rediscovered the seventeenth-century philosopher Johann Amos Comenius, who created pedagogic schemes that first anchored the political order in the pictorial and only then turned to the written word. In his primer Orbis Sensualium Pictus: Visible World; or, A Picture and Nomenclature of All the Chief Things That Are in the World (originally published in 1659 and reissued in the United States as late as 1810), difficult abstract subjects, such as "Philosophy" and "Humanity" as well as geopolitical constructs like "Kingdom" and "Region," were represented through illustrations of material objects. "The Kingdom and the Region," for example, was established in a concrete and stable form through a woodcut with a neatly modeled landscape depicting the various elements of the early modern state (Figure 27). Through the picture, the student learned to read and comprehend the social order. The corre- sponding text is in the service of this image:
mq4s | Many Cities and Villages make a Region and a Kingdom. The King, or Prince, resideth in the chief-City; 1. the Noblemen, Lords, and Earls, dwell in the Castles 2. that lye round about it, the Countrey-people dwell in Villages. 3. He hath his toll-places upon navigable Rivers 4. and High-Roads, 5. where Portage and Tollage is exacted of them that Sayl, or Travell.
95el | The picture thus functions not only as a mnemonic device for learning a basic political vocabulary but also like a map, illustrating the spatial orga- nization of the state. The messy realities of human existence and com- plexities of political order vanish in the tidy graphic simplicity of the landscape overview.18
a0a5 | In American hands, picture primers assumed a dual function. First, just as in their European context, primers carried forth a latent ideology of universal language schemes. Second, and more particular to the post- Revolutionary order, pictorial primers worked to negotiate the repre- sentational tensions spurred by the Federalist debate; the picture, more powerfully than the word, was able to reconcile the political concepts of "union" and "states." But, while the pictorial primers like Comenius's were adopted because of their availability and status of promoting a uni- versal language, these primers' European heritage entailed historic and practical limitations. Although picture primers paved the way for the en- trance of the visual into America's language handbooks, the primer's tra- ditional representation of words and images relating geopolitical spaces like the "kingdom" was no longer applicable. The invention of a new type of nation-state with a precarious and experimental relationship of the parts to the whole could not, many feared, be given proper expression through the pictorially mediated letters of the English language. More- over, federalist educators feared that the sustainability of this new politi- cal form depended not so much on written decrees and charters and international treaties as it did on citizens' absorbing and comprehending the social relationships of this political hybrid.
gocl | Maps, themselves a hybrid form of word and image, provided primers with this language. Map images were not new to picture primers; after all, Comenius's Visible World contained maps showing the world as a
ob1z | "Terrestrial Sphere ... divided into 5 Zones" and Europe, containing "the chief Kingdoms." Eighteenth-century American primers and ABC books, following in Comenius's footsteps, incorporated the textual materials of the geographer into the display of alphabetized objects. For instance, primers such as The Child's Museum, Containing a Description of One Hun- dred and Eight Interesting Subjects, following the schoolbook definition that "a Map is a picture of the earth," included the picture of a globe (and the written subtitle, "A Globe") in the array of alphabetized objects (Figure 28). The seemingly arbitrary inclusion of the globe into the primer is a first comment on the materiality and availability of cartographic texts in the early American linguistic stock.19
m4cb | More than simply illustrating the alphabet, the figure of the map worked conceptually to teach abstract principles of literacy. This is sug- gested by the primer The Mother's Gift; or, Remarks on a Set of Cuts for Children (Figure 29). This primer presents the student reader with a pic- ture of a map, a subtitle spelling out the words, "A Map," and a narrative description: "MAP. As you get forward in the study of geography you will find great entertainment in maps. How pleasant is it to trace the progress
m61y | of a traveller of whom we read; and still more interesting where a friend is on a voyage or journey." Here, map literacy is taught as a reading skill and a life skill: maps are understood to inform the student's future geography lessons; they are considered textual companions of the leisured reader who consumes travel narratives and novels; maps provide the material link through which friends and families communicate with each other. As the titles of primers like The Mother's Gift suggest, alphabetic literacy was the product of a domestic ideology in which the child was the focus of alphabetic instructions provided by the ideal republican mother; in this context the map was introduced to the child reader by the most intimate member and designated disciplinarian of the early national household.20
