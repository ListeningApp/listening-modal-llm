You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

kd78 | · According to Joseph Grinnel, an American ecologist, Ecological Niche is defined it as "The ultimate distributional unit of a species"
896u | · Grinnel implied that niches do not overlap, but are disjunct. Species display their fundamental niches; hence there is no apparent competition among them.
o0si | . Charles S. Elton (1927), a British ecologist, went further by using a more functional view concept, and defined Ecological niche as: "The trophic position of a species in the biotic environment".
1fx8 | . Elton viewed the niche as a simplistic subdivision within the traditional trophic grouping as herbivores, carnivores etc., i.e. the mere feeding habits or dietary trait of a species.
tfms | . George Evelyn Hutchinson (1957), after 30 years, proposed the most comprehensive concept to date
pfv5 | "The n-dimensiona hypervolume or hyperspace of a species"
8gxa | · The Hutchinsonian concept implies the total range of environmental variables to which a species must be adapted, and under which a species population lives and reproduces indefinitely.
fsvi | . The Hutchinsonian concept therefore involves both habitat and functional aspects
068d | · The environmental variables include physical, chemical and biotic parameters
ysz7 | · These variables can be viewed as a gradient along which species utilize with different intensities, and each gradient is considered as an n-dimensional space. Adding up all these forms the niche hyperspace
k5db | . The niche can be viewed as an n-sided flexible ball that can take any form in an n-dimensional coordinate system and represents the responses of the species population to all environmental variables.
7jzh | . In multidimensional geometry with n-number of axes, the niche of an organism is graphically depicted, when all relevant environmental variables are included and these are independent of each other

imnm | v Informal Definition - "The ecological role of a species in the community"
8na8 | · Polechová & Storch (2008): "Ecological niche indicates the position of a species within an ecosystem, describing both the range of conditions necessary for persistence of species, and its ecological role in the ecosystem
ul2a | . The diversity of definitions illustrates to what extent the niche is perceived as a species or community property: Is the niche created by the species itself, or by its surroundings?
4eaf | . Or as a dynamic mutual interaction? Let us examine an example - The Beaver
4b6k | The Niche Concept - Dynamics
hxiu | . The Beaver (Castor Canadensis, C. fiber) creates dams by felling trees across fast-flowing rivers, hence creating a new environment of stagnant water in which they build their nests.
1ylw | . Hence beavers create their own habitat which is conducive both for itself and for many other organisms - i.e. beavers impact their habitat by virtue of a specialised niche of dam building.
