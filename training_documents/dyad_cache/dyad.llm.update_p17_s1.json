        "content": "wstc | a large-scale offensive, mainly against the four ROK divisions that were deployed with the Eighth US Army on the western peninsula and the X Corps on the eastern coast. The ROK First Division fell into a giant ambush by the CPVF Thirty-ninth Army. Its commander, Gen. Paik, who was considered the best ROK commander, immediately realized that the skilled soldiers his division met were Chinese. Shortly afterward, he personally interrogated the first Chinese POW and heard from him that twenty thousand Chinese soldiers were deployed nearby. The information was immediately reported through the Eighth Army's G-two to Gen. Willoughby in Tokyo. During the next four days, the ROK Second Corps, made up of three divisions, suffered thousands of losses and was driven back in disarray.\nba1e | Simultaneously, Gen. Almond's X Corps advancement was blocked by a strong Chinese force. A Chinese POW who identified himself as a soldier of the Fifth PLA Regiment of the Chinese Eighth Army said that another four thousand to five thousand troops were nearby. Additional POWs said in interrogations that they belonged to the One hundred twenty-fourth Division. Almond, who personally interviewed them, reported to MacArthur that PLA units were deployed in northeast Korea.\nen95 | At the end of October, the frontline commanders did not doubt that the Eighth Army and the X Corps had encountered powerful, organized elements of Chinese Communist Forces armies across a wide spectrum of extreme North Korea. By November first, as an American official history of the war concluded, the Chinese Communist Forces had driven back the ROK Two Corps, crippling it disastrously, and was south of Chongchon on the open right flank of Eighth Army. And disaster was also threatening in the center of the Eighth Army front of Unsan. It came a day later, as another official account described it: The climax of this early Chinese intervention came on the night of first to second November when the Eighth Cavalry Regiment, First Cavalry Division, was attacked by a full Chinese division in positions near Unsan and very roughly handled. Practically, the regiment lost more than half its men. It was the first major clash between American and Chinese forces and the first American defeat since the landing in Inchon. The outcome sent shock waves through the Eighth Army. Walker's G-two concluded that the Eighth Army now faced two PLA armies with improved tactical capabilities displaying an unusual capability to fight at night. The X Corps' G-two reached a similar conclusion: following a number of limited battles with the Chinese Peoples Volunteer Forces and after interrogating at least thirty POWs, he reported, on October twenty-ninth, Integral PLA have been committed against UN Forces. On November second, US Marine forces destroyed the PLA's One hundred twenty-fourth Division in a fierce battle that was supported by tanks. The destroyed division was immediately replaced by another one-a clear indication of the magnitude of the Chinese Peoples Volunteer Forces.\nl3do | Altogether, the Chinese First Campaign (October twenty-fifth to November eighth) took a high toll on UN forces. In October, the American losses were forty per day. They rose to three hundred twenty-six per day in the first week of November. By Chinese accounts, twelve thousand three hundred twenty-five South Koreans, three thousand five hundred eighteen Americans, and one hundred forty-seven other nationalities were killed, wounded, or captured during the campaign. The Chinese Peoples Volunteer Forces sustained ten thousand seven hundred casualties including MIAs.\nu9bo | Willoughby's reaction to the reports about the Chinese intervention was mainly denial. Shortly after X Corps soldiers caught the first Chinese soldiers, Almond told Willoughby about it and asked him to come and see them with his own eyes. Willoughby refused, saying that they were only a token force. Close to four weeks later, he did come, saw a number of the POWs, but insisted that they were North Koreans and not Chinese. In between, he passed on to Washington the information about captured PLA soldiers, accepting that organized Chinese units were in Korea, but denying what that meant:\n7avo | From a tactical standpoint, with victorious United States divisions in full deployment, it would appear that the auspicious time for intervention has long since passed; it is difficult to believe that such a move, if planned, would have been postponed to a time when remnant North Korean forces have been reduced to a low point of effectiveness.\nuzo6 | In the following days, Willoughby's reports labeled the Chinese forces in Korea volunteers. Even more importantly, the numbers of soldiers he reported did not reflect the magnitude of the threat. On November second, he reported that sixteen thousand five hundred Chinese soldiers were in Korea and a day later that their number had risen to thirty-four thousand, while an additional four hundred fifteen thousand were deployed in Manchuria. On November eleventh, he estimated that seventy-six thousand eight hundred Chinese troops were in Korea.\n89b4 | The figures provided by Willoughby, which were based on the information from the interrogated Chinese POWs, systematically decreased the size of the opposing force. This was accomplished by a selective use of the available data. On October twenty-ninth, for example, many reports based on POW interrogations indicated that a massive PLA crossing of the Yalu had taken place. Nevertheless, Willoughby's assessment cited only one report and estimated that only token forces from the Fortieth Army Headquarters and from each of its divisions entered Korea on October twentieth. Later, while admitting that elements of four Chinese armies were in Korea, he counted the specific units of the captured soldiers but not their parent units. Thus, when visiting the X Corps in November he estimated that probably only a battalion of volunteers of each division identified was actually in Korea. Justin Haynes rightly concluded: Due to this method of analysis Willoughby accounted for only one third of Chinese Communist troops inside North Korea at that time. In fact, on the eve of the Second Chinese Peoples Volunteer Forces Campaign, Willoughby accounted for less than a fifth of the Chinese power.",
