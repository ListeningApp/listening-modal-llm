You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

d6r4 | More than simply illustrating the alphabet, the figure of the map worked conceptually to teach abstract principles of literacy. This is sug- gested by the primer The Mother's Gift; or, Remarks on a Set of Cuts for Children (Figure 29). This primer presents the student reader with a pic- ture of a map, a subtitle spelling out the words, "A Map," and a narrative description: "MAP. As you get forward in the study of geography you will find great entertainment in maps. How pleasant is it to trace the progress

Here, map literacy is taught as a reading skill and a life skill: maps are understood to inform the student's future geography lessons; they are considered textual companions of the leisured reader who consumes travel narratives and novels; maps provide the material link through which friends and families communicate with each other. As the titles of primers like The Mother's Gift suggest, alphabetic literacy was the product of a domestic ideology in which the child was the focus of alphabetic instructions provided by the ideal republican mother; in this context the map was introduced to the child reader by the most intimate member and designated disciplinarian of the early national household.20
wcd0 | But the alphabetic lesson surrounding the map was not only the peda- gogic means of embedding the student inside a social network. The pic- ture primer's rationale also created a visual narrative in which individual bodies were circumscribed by cartographic signs. In The Uncle's Present: A New Battledoor (1809) the letter Z is depicted by a street peddler who is carrying different sized maps while calling "Zealand, or England, and a

pn9j | Map of the World" (Figure 30). While in this picture alphabet the map appears in the form of a consumer article, the map also ties the market economy to the anthropomorphized ABCS. As the human figure associates maps with the alphabetic sign, it establishes a somatic link between the reader's body, the alphabetic reading material, and cartographic writ- ings. Like the human alphabet, which instituted the notion that the body was subject to the authority and discipline of the written sign, in this example the alphabetized individual becomes intrinsically part of a largely commercial cartographic archive and expanded notion of geo- graphic literacy.21
1pmc | While American primers were establishing a deep structural nexus between alphabetic and map literacy, one of the more influential geogra- phy books consciously developed this nexus into a national form of print language. In the best-selling textbook Geography Made Easy (1784), the Federalist minister and geographer Jedidiah Morse tested the relation- ship between alphabetic and cartographic literacy. He pursued the ques- tion of how maps could aid the literary process of making the idea of

"Cal- culated particularly for the Use and Improvement of SCHOOLS in the United States," the textbook was the first in a series of books whose in- tended goal was explicit: "That our youth of both sexes, at the same time that they are learning to read, might imbibe an acquaintance with their own country, and an attachment to its interests." To demonstrate a possi- ble means for attaching youngsters to a national imaginary, Morse in- serted two kinds of maps in his first edition of Geography Made Easy, experimental word maps and a conventional national map.22

y5r7 | The word maps, advertised as "newly constructed Maps, adapted to the Capacities and Understanding of Children," demonstrate how Feder- alists like Morse imagined the geographic process of national unification as purely alphabetic (Figure 31). Each of these four maps, representing South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia, consists of a blank rectangular frame. Into this spatially delimited tabula rasa Morse spells out the names of existing nation-states, arranging the printed letters to indi- cate their geographic dimensions and relations. Having thus jettisoned the usual elements of map reading necessary for one's orientation and self-location-the geographic grid, local place names, and pictographic symbols-Morse represents each continent as the verbal approximation of political rather than geographical locales. In each continental map, the elaborately printed names of nations appear as synecdochic figures of actual places. Conversely, the geographical order of the world is up- held by the alphabetic construction of nations. More specifically, the word map subordinates the implied cartographic image to the machine- made appearance of the printed text, and the representation of conti- nents and geopolitical entities to the conventions of print typography. With these word maps, Morse's geography imitated a spatial order de- rived from print technology, an order according to which "typographic control typically impresses more by its tidiness and inevitability: the lines perfectly regular, justified on the right side, everything coming out even visually."23
lrry | Yet-and this is the dilemma that Morse's experimental maps demon- strate-for the nation to become the perfectly regular alphabetic environ- ment, the word maps had to reconcile a strain that lies at the heart of all cartographic representation: their formal arrangement had to negotiate the reader's imaginary freedom of movement offered by the hybrid tex- tuality of the map. By reading the map as a quasi-blank and verbally

863b | elastic text, the apprentice map reader was able to create a space of his or her own. Just as the alphabet enabled politicians to organize the world into political spaces, the unorthodox arrangement of Morse's letters un- dercut the fantasy of territorial control. The word maps established na- tional alignment as a ludic activity; just as the printer's apprentice shuf- fled the typeface inside the letterbox, Morse's students learned how to playfully scramble the verbal markers of political territories. Through a random shuffle, nations vanish or become reconstituted as a differ- ent word.
fj24 | In order to better control the reader's alphabetic literacy, Morse ex- ploited the pedagogic (and political) authority by which the mapmaker shaped the signification and interpretation of political geography. It is telling that at the historical moment of 1784, when language threatened to upend the new nation, the alphabet and alphabetic maps seemed to be insufficient tools for stabilizing the new American nation. Instead of adding a fifth word map that spelled out the constitutive names of the United States, Morse turns to the conventional map and the iconic outline of the new federal state as the dominant lesson signifying the union. Upon opening the textbook, the student readers were greeted with the first picture of the nation, A Map of the United States of America (1784) (Figure 32). This map by Amos Doolittle was one of the first national maps published in the United States immediately following the Peace of Paris. The map is thus designed to show exclusively the territory of the nation- state, tracing its international borders from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Mississippi River in the west, and from British Canada to the north and Spanish Florida to the south.24

Hovering in a swirl of billowing clouds, the female figure of Liberty (or perhaps Columbia), together with the American eagle, lifts a banner inscribed "Per Aspera ad Astra" in order to unveil the new nation's name (in bold print) while the land is strategically placed underneath (in a rough sketch). When considered in juxtaposition to the map image, the car- touche suggests that as long as they are viewed separately the two discur- sive modes of either word or image foster imaginings that are easily clouded and distorted. If used jointly, however-as the dual gesture of

y219 | unveiling the geographic name of the nation and by analogy of the map image itself indicates-the cartouche celebrates the mixed language of geography as the ideal literary means for representing the nation in clear and unambiguous terms.
06ht | The map bears out the cartouche's invitation to conceive map reading as a hybrid product of print literacy. Inside the map image, cartographic symbols compete with the letters of the alphabet for the reader's atten- tion. While pictographic dots, lines, and mountain symbols describe the nation's topography, an array of alphabetic names identify places from the locally specific ("Philadelphia") to the larger geopolitical unit ("Penn- sylvania"). These toponyms are typographically differentiated according to political significance: the names of states appear in large capitals, the names of cities in roman characters, and those of villages in a running hand. The map, however, contains the typographic tension between re- gional and local places through the structural evenness of the geographic grid and borderlines. While the written names of concrete places and abstract political territories are located within the grid, the map orients its east-west, north-south base lines along the "Meridian of Philadelphia." As cartographic and alphabetic signs become thus aligned with the na- tion's capital, the map's diversified symbolic code becomes a grammati- cal construct: it expresses American independence from England (and the meridian of Greenwich) by providing a new baseline for imagining the nation's geographic framework.25
v3r2 | At the same time, it was the map's small-scale projection (it shows a relatively large area without attention to local detail) that invited readers to view the nation as a picture rather than a product of writing systems. Thick washes of watercolor marked the territorial outline of the nation's constitutive states, creating schematic images of the various states simi- lar to today's didactic map puzzles in which color and shape rather than geographic content and location guide the student's memory. Some cop- ies of the book map even included a thick trace of color marking the nation's external border line, thus presenting the image of the nation-

xags | state in the form of an iconographic symbol or hieroglyph, similar to modern cookie-cutter shapes or commercial logos.26
jc47 | It was precisely the cartographic design of the nation's official bor- derline by which Morse imagined he could inscribe the student's visual memory and verbal literacy with the idea of the nation. Contemporane- ous formulations of national ideologies, especially those by the German Johann Gottlieb Fichte, looked to the borderline rhetoric of the national map in order to unite a fragmented society under the rubric of a collective imaginary. Writing at a time when Germany (even under Napoleonic rule) looked like a puzzle on the political map, Fichte argued in his Reden an die deutsche Nation (1808) that for a people to become a nation the "exter- nal frontiers" of the state (however loosely defined, as body politic, civic union, or bureaucratic institution) must become the "internal frontiers" of the citizen. According to this formulation, the nation-state always be- gan and ended with the cartographic line demarcating political bounda- ries. Through a self-fulfilling logic of dialectic reasoning, these boundary lines-once they were established-were deemed to be natural bounda- ries dividing traditionally established political territories. With the stroke of a mapmaker's pen, the line became a cognitive and disciplinary tool transposing local into national identities.27
ko3c | Like the Federalist language reformer Noah Webster, Morse sought to achieve a degree of national identity by aligning the overall practices of alphabetic training with geographical knowledge. Given the program- matic rethinking of elementary literacy instruction, the map became a product of alphabetic learning. Indeed, as the basic principles of literacy (the alphabet, representational sign systems, phonetics) became imbri- cated with basic principles of geography (notions of place, systems of measurement, taxonomic organization), the conventional words and ver- bal text were perceived through a geographic consciousness. By prefacing

bbpr | his textbook with a map of the new nation-state, Morse invariably coupled the map reader's desire for visual self-location to the textbook's otherwise verbal representation of political identities. Students following the read- ing protocol of the textbook map, then, learned not only to privilege the geographic dimension of the nation-state over representations of local places but also to superimpose the cartographic signs representing the union over the textbook's alphabetic notations describing the states. Thus, while Webster relied on the national map to Americanize the spell- ing and pronunciation of English words, Morse's map-reading lesson transformed the study of geography into a nationalistic spelling bee.28
