For example, creatine supplementation with carbohydrate or carbohydrate and protein has been reported to promote greater muscle glycogen storage than carbohydrate supplementation alone. Since glycogen replenishment is important for promoting recovery and preventing overtraining during intensified training periods, creatine supplementation may help athletes who deplete large amounts of glycogen during training and/or performance (i.e., sporting events) to maintain optimal glycogen levels. Second, there is evidence that creatine supplementation may reduce muscle damage and/or enhance recovery from intense exercise. For example, Cooke and colleagues reported that creatine supplementation during recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage promoted less muscle enzyme efflux and better maintenance of isokinetic muscle performance. Moreover, there is evidence that individuals supplementing their diet with creatine experienced less muscle damage, inflammation, and muscle soreness in response to running thirty kilometers as well as during four weeks of intensified training. Consequently, creatine supplementation may help athletes recover from intense exercise and/or tolerate intensified periods of training to a greater degree. Third, there is evidence that athletes who supplement with creatine during training experience fewer musculoskeletal injuries, accelerated recovery time from injury and less muscle atrophy after immobilization. Whether this is due to a greater resistance to injury and/or ability to recover from injury remains unclear. Fourth, creatine supplementation (with or without glycerol) has been reported to help athletes hyper-hydrate and thereby enhance tolerance to exercise in the heat. Therefore, creatine supplementation may reduce the risk of heat related illness when athletes train and/or compete in hot and humid environments. Finally, there is evidence from animal models that creatine supplementation is neuroprotective and can reduce the severity of spinal cord injury, cerebral ischemia, and concussion/traumatic brain injury. This evidence was so compelling that the International Society of Sports Nutrition recommended that athletes engaged in sports that have a potential for concussion and/or spinal cord injury take creatine for its neuroprotective effects. Thus, there are a number of reasons beyond the ergogenic benefit that all types of athletes may benefit.\nmagd | In summary, there is a variety of athletic events, not just resistance/power activities, which may benefit from creatine supplementation.\ntb74 | Is creatine only effective for males?\n8l69 | Creatine kinetics may vary between healthy males and females. Females may have higher intramuscular creatine concentrations possibly due to lower skeletal muscle mass. Potentially, the higher resting intramuscular creatine concentration in females (based on the upper limit of intramuscular creatine storage) may help explain some research showing diminished responsiveness and/or performance effects on females.\n1jyv | As a result of hormone-driven changes in endogenous creatine synthesis, creatine transport, and creatine kinase kinetics, creatine bioavailability throughout various stages of female reproduction is altered, highlighting the potential positive implications for creatine supplementation in females. The implications of hormone-related\nolce | changes in creatine kinetics has been largely overlooked in performance-based studies. Specifically, creatine supplementation may be of particular importance during menses, pregnancy, postpartum, perimenopause and postmenopause. Creatine kinase, as well as enzymes associated with creatine synthesis, are influenced by estrogen and progesterone. Creatine kinase levels are significantly elevated during menstruation, with CK levels decreasing throughout the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and with age. The lowest range of CK values have been reported during early pregnancy (twenty weeks or less), equating to about half the concentration found at peak levels (teenage girls).\nerx1 | Maternal creatine supplementation during pregnancy in pre-clinical animal studies have demonstrated a protective effect against fetal death and organ damage associated with intrapartum hypoxia. Reduced creatine levels in late pregnancy have also been associated with low fetal growth. There is additional data that metabolic demand from the placenta during gestation further lowers the creatine pool of the mother, which may be associated with low birth weight and preterm birth. Creatine supplementation during pregnancy has been shown to enhance neuronal cell uptake of creatine and support mitochondrial integrity in animal offspring, thereby reducing brain injury induced by intrapartum asphyxia. Although there are no human studies evaluating the effects of creatine supplementation during pregnancy, creatine could provide a safe, low-cost nutritional intervention for reducing intra- and postpartum complications associated with cellular energy depletion. This may be more important if the female is vegetarian, or unable to consume meat due to nausea or taste preferences (i.e., meat contains about zero point seven grams of creatine per six ounce serving).\nb3bt | Females have been reported to have lower levels of creatine in the brain (frontal lobe). Increasing creatine concentrations in the brain as a result of supplementation, particularly in females, may support the reported benefits of reducing symptoms of depression and ameliorating the effects of traumatic brain injury. Depression is about two times higher among females throughout the reproductive years and accelerates around pubertal hormonal changes. Altered brain bioenergetics and mitochondrial dysfunction have been linked with depression, particularly as it relates to CK, ATP, and inorganic phosphate. Creatine supplementation has been shown to significantly augment cerebral phosphocreatine and inorganic phosphate, particularly in females. The increase in cerebral phosphocreatine from ten grams of creatine supplementation was reported to be inversely related to symptoms of depression in adolescent females resistant to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. It appears that creatine supplementation may be\n0w8m | effective for supporting creatine kinetics, mood, and pregnancy/fetal outcomes.\n```",
