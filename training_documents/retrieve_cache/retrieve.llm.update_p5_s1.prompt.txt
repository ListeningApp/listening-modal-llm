You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ba4l | Because the two sets of leadership skills in a duality comprise opposite approaches, managers can experience tension between them or even see them as contradictory or incompatible. The challenge for the versatile leader is thus to meet what F. Scott Fitzgerald called "the test of a first-rate intelligence": to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function. That challenge is all the greater, given that most leaders will have to overcome their bias in favor of one of the ideas and against the other. This notion of versatility is not to be mistaken as moderation in all things. It simply denotes a wide and flexible range of behaviors, which can indeed include immoderate behavior when extreme circum- stances require it.
ffx8 | Versatility pays off. Our research found a close association between versatility, as measured by our 360-degree question- naire, and overall effectiveness. In every sample of senior man- agers we have studied, we found substantial correlations between ratings of effectiveness and versatility on both the forceful-enabling and strategic-operational dualities. These strong statistical relationships reflect the fact that versatile man- agers are consistently regarded as the most effective leaders in their organizations.
s6su | Our data also revealed that, in addition to versatile and lop- sided, there is a third, less prevalent leadership pattern: what might be called the "disengaged leader," one who underdoes both sides of a duality. Disengaged leadership is associated with the lowest ratings of effectiveness.11
y219 | The Root Causes of Imbalance
06ht | The fact that so many managers are lopsided on one or another duality raises the question: What throws off their behavior?
v3r2 | Uneven Skill Development Imbalance can be a function of some- thing as straightforward as overdeveloping one side (hypertro- phy) and neglecting to develop the other (atrophy). For example, when a manager is repeatedly given the same type of assignment because of his or her obvious strengths in that area, it can deprive that manager of the opportunity to round out his or her reper- toire. Also, the skills most critical to success on the lower levels of an organization - forceful and operational leadership - tend to be well developed in managers and are consequently overused as those managers rise to more senior levels.12 Similarly, the stra- tegic and enabling skills that can be crucial at in upper man- agement tend to be underdeveloped in freshly minted senior managers.
nv42 | Skewed Mental Models All managers operate on the basis of assumptions, beliefs, values and attitudes. When these notions are uninformed, untrue or otherwise distorted, they in turn dis- tort the leader's behavior.13 The least problematic case occurs
xags | when an executive fails to realize that the skills that earned her a senior-level position are not the same as those required in that position - that she is, for example, no longer responsible for actually doing research and development or marketing but for orchestrating the efforts of those who are.
jc47 | Overgeneralizations also tilt leaders toward imbalance.14 For instance, a manager who interprets his employees' need for autonomy as a mandate to be completely hands-off will often give his staff plenty of latitude to do their jobs but not make himself sufficiently available to provide technical assistance or emotional support; an executive with a core belief in "putting others first" may listen extraordinarily well but have a difficult time articulating her own views with the conviction that his staff is looking for; a manager with an exaggerated fear of overstep- ping bounds can be accommodating to his peers but inhibited from fighting for the resources that his or her unit needs.
ko3c | One-Sided Values An executive will tend to underemphasize cer- tain skills and approaches that he simply does not deem impor- tant or part of his job. We have seen many executives give short shrift to the operational aspects of their jobs because they char- acterize such attentiveness as being "consumed with details," whereas they envision that their mandate is dealing with strategic considerations. They believe they no longer need to follow up or follow through, and they have yet to discover that those functions simply take on a different character in higher-level positions.
xek3 | Executives also tend to overdo those things on which they place a premium. Those who are goal-oriented and focused sharply on hitting their targets see all too clearly how important it is to get things done, but they may overlook the strategic ques- tion of whether the right things are getting done. It is difficult for them to see how something they believe in deeply can be taken too far. It is only when they are asked to consider what goals and functions are being neglected because of their extreme behaviors that the problem begins to come into focus.
bbpr | Fear of Inadequacy A good deal of out-of-balance leadership results from the fear of being inadequate or incompetent even though, in our experience, most executives tend to underestimate their true abilities. Managers will avoid things they believe they are not good at, such as public speaking or dealing with technical issues such as information systems or even e-mail. We have seen executives isolate themselves because they are insecure about their ability to relate to other people, or they shy away from strat- egy because they fear they are intellectually inadequate.15 Of course, this sets up a self-fulfilling prophecy: Managers who avoid certain approaches because of self-perceived deficiencies forgo the opportunity to improve.
5zyf | Ironically, underestimating oneself can also lead to overdo- ing certain behaviors. Managers who privately underrate their
9own | Leadership Models and Measures as an Organizational Intervention
bqfb | Organizations regularly adopt leadership models to reinforce or change their lead- ership culture. If such a model is to send a message, it must be compact and clear, which the oft-used long lists of competencies - however worthy - are not. A list ought to be short enough to be remembered, and the desired leader- ship qualities should be significant enough to make an impression on man- agers. It also helps if the list is inte- grated. The unifying principle that we favor is versatility, the capacity to strike balances between opposite types of leadership. This has the added advan- tage of reflecting the real tensions and trade-offs that make the job of manage- ment a balancing act. What organization doesn't, for example, need to strike a balance between strategic leadership and operational leadership - between positioning the organization for the future and executing its short-term objectives? How many organizations are trying to be more customer-oriented and less internally oriented?
wwdt | In any of these or similarly paired objectives, imbalance, by definition, is doing too much of one of them. Compe- tency models, which are predicated on
mn1r | own competence, for instance, are liable to put pressure on themselves to demonstrate their value at every opportunity, depriving their staff of the chance to answer their own ques- tions or solve their own problems. Others who believe they are not well liked may ignore subordinates' performance prob- lems. Indeed, many of the excesses in managerial behavior are compensatory.
5vqw | The tendency to do too much is often linked to a concern about doing too little. Driven people, for example, lack objec- tivity about what is reasonable to expect of themselves and oth- ers. The literature on perfectionism is replete with insights into this phenomenon.16 Managers who take too much responsibil- ity are privately afraid that they will not take enough. Those who take too much power may harbor a mistaken sense of themselves as relatively powerless. Individuals who intimidate others intellectually are surprised to hear that said about them- selves, because they actually feel intellectually inadequate.
meyw | the idea of leveraging strengths but have no way of assessing overleverag- ing, simply cannot detect when a lead- ership strength is being corrupted through indiscriminate application. Yet organizations and individuals regularly fall prey to this problem. To determine how balanced (or out of balance) indi- vidual managers or an organization's management team may be requires a measure that can capture and express overdoing.
