You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

bfax | In the case example at the beginning of this chapter, the many nonverbal cues evident during the inter- action between Mr. Johnson and Rigel were significant moments during Mr. Johnson's commu- nication and may be interpreted as interpersonal events. Additionally, when Mr. Johnson mentioned to Rigel that it wasn't his fault that their interaction the day before was not productive, another inter- personal event occurred: an intimate self-disclosure. Mr. Johnson admitted to Rigel that he was respon- sible for the interaction having gone poorly.

qecd | During therapy, interpersonal events such as these may be precipitated by the following circumstances.
1o7p | A client's interpersonal characteristics or reactions to something inside or outside of the therapeutic context
cp13 | The therapist's behavior (e.g., the therapist makes a suggestion or asks a question that the client perceives as intrusive or emotionally difficult)
bgre | These examples are only a few of the myriad possible in- terpersonal events that occur during the course of occu- pational therapy (Fig. 3.6).
57lp | When interpersonal events of therapy occur, their interpretation is a product of the client's unique set of
ukth | interpersonal characteristics and reactions in the moment. Sometimes the event has a significant effect on the client, whereas at other times a client is unaffected or minimally affected. When such events occur, it is important that the therapist be aware that the event has occurred and take responsibility for responding appropriately. The therapist should not overreact or underreact to the event. Instead, the therapist should watch for any cues from the client and listen to anything that the client may say about the event that could prompt a certain type of response from the therapist.

4exe | Interpersonal events are part of the constant give and take that occurs during a therapy process. They are dis- tinguished from other events or processes in that they are charged with the potential for an emotional response either when they occur or later upon reflection. Con- sequently, if they are ignored or responded to less than optimally, these events can threaten both the therapeutic relationship and the client's occupational engagement. When optimally responded to, the events can provide opportunities for positive client learning or change and for solidifying the therapeutic relationship.

Chapter 6 describes and gives examples of interpersonal events that have been found from our observations to occur with a high level of frequency in occupational therapy. Because they are unavoidable in any therapeutic interaction, one of the primary tasks of a therapist practicing according to the IRM is to respond to these inevitable events in a way that leads to repair and strengthening of the therapeutic relationship.
lvae | The Therapist's Use of Self
o9sc | Within the IRM, the therapist is responsible for mak- ing every reasonable effort to make the relationship work through effective communication and interaction with the client. This requires a tremendous amount of self-discipline and empathy, particularly when clients are not at their best. Specifically, the therapist is responsible for bringing three main interpersonal capacities into the relationship.

vz32 | Let's revisit an example from the suboptimal inter- action between the occupational therapist, Erika, and her client, Vera, presented in Chapter 1. As you may recall, several interpersonal events occurred during that interaction, in rapid succession. Accord- ing to the IRM, this is referred to as an interper- sonal event cascade.
ncb0 | The first interpersonal event was boundary test- ing. Vera asks Erika numerous questions to test her credibility, including whether she has had personal experience with breast cancer. This was followed by an intimate self-disclosure on the part of the ther- apist, when Erika revealed to Vera that her grand- mother had pancreatic cancer. This disclosure was impulsive and not well planned. Instead, it repre- sented a reactionary attempt on Erika's part to prove to Vera her legitimacy as a cancer expert. Instead of quelling the situation, the disclosure prompted a nonverbal cue, followed by a power dilemma that ended poorly with an empathic break.
8mp0 | Boundary Testing
xjyk | Clients will certainly ask personal questions of their therapists, but they are not necessarily entitled to know the answers. Asking about a therapist's health history, for example, is confidential information. By doing this, Vera put Erika in an awkward position, leaving her with a few choices to respond-some therapeutic and others suboptimal.
mt0f | Therapeutic Responses
awab | One example of a therapeutic response involves making an educated guess, or a construal that gives words to Vera's troublesome behavior that includes pausing and sharing with Vera how she is experi- encing the questioning. Erika might say, "Vera, you have a lot of questions for me. I am wondering if you have concerns about whether I have enough knowledge and experience to understand your unique experience with cancer." Another therapeutic response that does not involve interpreting Vera's behavior may involve answering all Vera's questions about cancer except for her personal question. If Vera persists, Erika could set a limit, such as:
ixcc | "Vera, I appreciate that you would like to know about me and about any personal experience I have
8p6h | had with cancer. As a rule, I do not disclose this kind of personal information to the people I work with because I feel that the focus of my work should be on understanding your unique experience, rather than trying to relate any experience I or a loved one may have had to your experience."
pmgl | One may ask why Erika's refusal to answer Vera's question could be more therapeutic than what she actually did, which was to disclose her grand- mother's experience with pancreatic cancer. The reason that withholding this information would have been more therapeutic than disclosing it lies in three of the underlying principles of the IRM: Principle 2: Interpersonal Self-Discipline Is Fundamental to Effective Use of Self, Principle 3: It Is Necessary to Keep Head Before Heart, and Principle 4: Mindful Empathy Is Required to Know Your Client. These and the other 10 underlying principles of IRM are discussed in further detail at the end of this chapter. Suboptimal Response
90no | In the actual interaction, Erika engaged in another interpersonal event, an intimate self-disclosure, by responding to Vera's question with a brief personal disclosure that her grandmother had pancreatic cancer. This response was suboptimal for two rea- sons. First, from Vera's perspective it did not add to her credibility as someone with expertise in cancer. Erika's brief mention that her grandmother had pancreatic cancer really did not do justice to the hours she spent caring for and spending time with her grandmother as she was receiving treatment and also during her period of palliative care. Erika did not have the opportunity to share the range of painful emotions she experienced during her grand- mother's cancer experience, nor did she have the chance to explain the ways in which she gained ex- tensive knowledge about cancer, cancer treatments, and cancer rehabilitation. Importantly, Erika did not have the chance to explain how the experience of caring for her grandmother and sharing in her can- cer experience strengthened her character and gave her a new perspective about living as well as dying.
jt0y | At the same time, sharing all this information would have taken time out of the therapy session

oae5 | and would have taken the focus off of Vera and her unique experience of cancer. Therefore, the best responses would have been those described as ther- apeutic in the preceding paragraphs.
s0fl | Nonverbal Cue
43ia | An interpersonal event that took place follow- ing Erika's disclosure involved a nonverbal cue. Rather than saying something compassionate or empathetic, Vera was not satisfied with Erika's disclosure and, instead, stared blankly.
3g2y | Therapeutic Response
gc7v | At this point one example of a therapeutic response might have involved asking about the nonverbal cue. Knowing that one of Vera's central interper- sonal characteristics involves a high need for con- trol, Erika might have said, "I am wondering if my responses are not hitting the mark for you? I am wondering if there is anything else I can do to help understand your experience and to show you how I might be able to support your rehabilitation?" By venturing an interpretation of Vera's blank look and asking a question such as this, Erika would have reasserted her central goal, which was to understand Vera's cancer experience. Additionally, it would have allowed Erika to maintain an appropriate (and, in this case, necessary) leadership role within the ther- apeutic relationship, limiting the extent to which Vera could continue her excessive questioning.
wqfv | Suboptimal Response
j30a | Erika either did not recognize Vera's blank stare as a nonverbal cue or chose not to respond to it. This al- lowed Vera to continue to challenge Erika's credibil- ity and assume a more dominant position within the interaction. In many cases, it is desirable when our clients take charge within the therapeutic relation- ship. Participation and independence are among the core values of our profession. However, there are situations in which a client may assert dominance during an interaction in a way that is uncomfortable, condescending, or overly assertive. The interaction between Vera and Erika is one such circumstance.
7bdk | Power Dilemma
fim0 | Unabated, Vera continues questioning and con- fronting Erika whenever she feels that she is avoid- ing a question or does not have the correct answers
ojro | Chapter 3 A Model of the Intentional Relationship 63
l6t9 | about cancer treatment and rehabilitation. Erika tries to avoid openly arguing with Vera, but she now feels as if she is trapped within an uncomfortable interaction. The undercurrent to Vera's behavior is that she is angry and unhappy about the fact that her breast cancer and all the requisite treatments have interrupted her life and functioning. Because she has always felt in control of her own destiny and now feels out of control, Vera is having difficulty not lashing out at others around her.
1ujy | Therapeutic Response
qzor | At this point, Erika should attempt to stop the negative dynamic in order to avoid the occurrence of additional interpersonal events and the possible deterioration of a new relationship with her client. To do this, she might say something such as, "I am getting the feeling that my responses to your ques- tions are not aligning with your experience. I am wondering if there is anything else I can do to help understand your experience and better support your experience here?"
a0by | Suboptimal Response
u1ky | Erika thought she was being as kind and empathetic as possible with Vera by actively ignoring her overly assertive questions and provocative comments. Instead, Vera experienced Erika's behaviors as dis- missive, and her passivity only stoked Vera's need for control and dominance.
htm9 | Empathic Break
8hul | Having been pushed to the limits of her patience, Erika communicated an empathic break by in- troducing a research article touting the virtues of chemotherapy to Vera. She missed or ignored the fact that Vera did not respond and only learned that Vera did not appreciate the therapy session when her supervisor informed her that Vera had requested to work with a different therapist.
87vz | In summary, Erika missed several opportunities to interrupt the interpersonal event cascade that developed with Vera. Had she learned and practiced the skills and concepts of the IRM, she might have approached the interaction with a greater level of intentionality and a more therapeutic approach to developing an empathetic understanding of her client.

l0a3 | 64 Part 1 Theoretical Foundations and Guidelines for Practice
u8nw | Interpersonal Skill Base
l2v9 | The therapist's interpersonal skill base comprises a contin- uum of skills that are judiciously applied by the therapist to build a functional working relationship with the client. The perspective of the model is that, depending on the unique experiences, knowledge, and innate capacities of the ther- apist, some of these skills come naturally whereas others require significant effort and practice to develop.
afbe | These interpersonal skills are summarized in terms of nine categories.
78r8 | Therapeutic communication
320g | · Interviewing skills and strategic questioning
tp8g | · Establishing productive relationships with clients
gxfd | Working effectively with spouses, partners, families, social systems, and groups
s2v1 | Working effectively with supervisors, employers, and other professionals
jkp9 | Understanding and managing difficult interpersonal behavior
z8tt | Resolving empathic breaks and conflicts
9g22 | ·Professional behavior, including maintaining appropri- ate interpersonal boundaries, values, and ethics
41fx | · Therapist self-care and professional development
7um8 | The first category, therapeutic communication, involves activities such as verbal and nonverbal communication skills, therapeutic listening, assertiveness, providing clients with direction and feedback, and seeking and responding to client feedback. Interviewing skills comprise another skill set that involves being watchful and intentional about the way in which one approaches the process of asking a client questions. Strategic questioning is a specific ap- proach to questioning born out of cognitive psychology (e.g., Beck, 1995). It involves asking questions in a way that guides the respondent to think more broadly or dif- ferently. Establishing relationships with clients includes rapport building, matching your therapeutic style to the interpersonal demands of the client, managing a client's strong emotion, judicious use of touch, understanding the roles of spiritual and religious diversity in occupational therapy, and cultural sensitivity.

ywwr | aspect of occupational therapy practice. It includes using the guiding principles of IRM in combination with prom- inent systems theories to gain the collaboration of part- ners, parents, other family, and friends to serve the goals of therapy. It also involves understanding the structure, process, and interpersonal dynamics of group therapy.
0i6j | Another fundamental skill involves knowing how to work collaboratively with supervisors, employers, and other professionals. It involves knowing how to commu- nicate with other professionals about clients both in the presence and in the absence of those clients. Additionally, it requires understanding the power dynamics and value systems that underlie supervisor and student, as well as employer and employee, relationships. Understanding and managing clients' difficult behavior is another category of necessary interpersonal skills required in many practice situations. It involves knowing how to respond effectively to behaviors that involve manipulation, excessive depen- dence, symptom focusing, resistance, emotional disengage- ment, denial, difficulty with rapport and trust, and hostility. Responding effectively helps limit the extent to which this behavior disrupts the goals and processes of therapy.
