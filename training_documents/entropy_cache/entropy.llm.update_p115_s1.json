On the other hand, the expected energy part of the entropy per atom is two, coming from the atom's three momentum degrees of freedom. The total entropy per atom is thus\nj5ke | In A cubed plus one plus N A cubed\nxe0y | To impress our friends we can convert this to bits: we divide by ln two and get about\ngjl6 | zero point six nine three one five approximately twenty-one point seven zero zero\n81i9 | bits of unknown information per atom of helium.\nkgrb | I've kept only five significant figures in the later stages of these calculations, since that's how precise the experimental data is. Next let's compare the final result to experiment!\n6g0d | THE ENTROPY OF HELIUM: EXPERIMENT\nk9u1 | The entropy of helium at standard temperature and pressure has been measured to be one hundred twenty-six point one five joules per kelvin per mole.\nldrv | One bit of unknown information per atom corresponds to about five point seven six three one joules per kelvin of entropy per mole.\nli40 | Thus, each atom of helium at standard temperature and pressure carries about one hundred twenty-six point one five\nirr1 | approximately twenty-one point eight eight nine\nsvwi | bits of unknown information.\ncym3 | Experimentally, the entropy of helium at standard temperature and pressure is one hundred twenty-six point one five joules per kelvin per mole. Converting this to bits per atom we get twenty-one point eight eight nine, very close to our theoretical result of twenty-one point seven zero zero, but about zero point nine percent higher.\n7y4b | There are a couple of possible reasons for this slight discrepancy. First, while our theoretical calculation assumed that helium is an ideal gas of noninteracting point particles, this is not true. The helium atoms interact!\n421l | Second, our computation ignored quantum effects-except for using Planck's constant to determine the thermal wavelength. Even for an ideal gas, quantum effects become important when Volume over N A cubed ceases to be large. This happens at high densities Volume over N, low temperatures T, or for particles of small mass m. Helium has a low mass as molecules of gas go-and our ultimate goal, hydrogen, is even worse.\nart6 | Now let's tackle the final summit: hydrogen. This is a diatomic gas, so it works differently.\npsk5 | THE IDEAL DIATOMIC GAS\natv6 | In thermal equilibrium, a classical ideal diatomic gas of N indistinguishable molecules of mass m in a three-dimensional box of volume V has expected energy\n9ja4 | five times E equals kNT\nbl6w | and free energy\nrxoj | F equals negative kT ln N factorial A cubed N over V N\nb2rk | where A equals h over sqrt twenty-two pi mkT is the thermal wavelength.\npros | Its entropy S is E minus F over T, so E N A cubed plus two\ntlrm | negative k ln N factorial\n6gxm | and using Stirling's formula ln N factorial approximately equals (ln N minus one) N we get S as kN E N (ln A cubed plus three) over N A cubed\n7eaf | It's easy to repeat our computation of entropy for a diatomic gas if we recall that the tumbling of the molecules add two degrees of freedom to the three for position, giving E equals two kNT. Tracking the effects of this change we see the entropy is higher than for a monatomic gas. To be precise, the entropy of a classical ideal diatomic gas is\nt890 | approximately E N (ln A S plus two) over N A cubed\nnwqa | So, it has one more nat of Shannon entropy per molecule than an ideal monatomic gas! Let's see how this plays out for hydrogen.\nsewa | THE ENTROPY OF HYDROGEN: THEORY\n0tlp | Assuming hydrogen is a classical ideal diatomic gas, its entropy is\nbz3j | E N (ln A S plus two) over N A cubed\n14mv | which corresponds to\n75iu | ln N A cubed V plus seven\na82u | nats of unknown information per molecule. At standard temperature and pressure, this gives fifteen point one four four nats or\ntx0t | ln two fifteen point one four four\n2zty | approximately twenty-one point eight four eight\n63ho | bits of unknown information per molecule.\n32zi | A hydrogen molecule has m equals three point three four seven zero six times ten to the negative twenty-seventh kg, so at a temperature T equals two hundred ninety-eight point one five K its thermal wavelength is\n59si | six point six two six zero seven times ten to the negative thirty-fourth J s\ni30e | approximately equals two pi times three point three four seven zero six times ten to the negative twenty-seventh kg times one point three eight zero six four nine times ten to the negative twenty-third J per K times two hundred ninety-eight point one five K\ntvst | approximately seven point one two one five six times ten to the negative eleventh m.\nwrky | For a mole of an ideal gas at standard temperature and pressure, N equals six point zero two two one four zero seven six times ten to the twenty-third and V approximately zero point zero two four seven eight nine six cubic meters, so\n2my1 | approximately one hundred thirteen thousand nine hundred seventy-one N A cubed V approximately equals six point zero two two one four zero seven six times ten to the twenty-third times (seven point one two one five six times ten to the negative eleventh m) cubed over zero point zero two four seven eight nine six cubic meters\n8ql6 | We thus have\n07fv | ln N A cubed V approximately equals ln one hundred thirteen thousand nine hundred seventy-one approximately equals eleven point six four four\nkg0h | Thanks to our previous work we know this means that the logarithm of the number of accessible states of each molecule would be eleven point six four four if it were trapped in its own small box of volume V over N. There is also a correction to this simplified picture due to density fluctuations, which gives one extra nat of entropy. These add up to give the free energy contribution to the entropy per molecule: twelve point six four four nats. This is less than we got for helium. But the expected energy contribution to the entropy per molecule is larger: we again get two nats from the molecule's three momentum degrees of freedom,\npl1f | but now we get one extra nat due to its two extra tumbling degrees of freedom. The total number of nats of unknown information per hydrogen molecule is thus\nwavb | ln V over N A cubed plus one plus three halves plus one approximately equals fifteen point one four four. Finally, the number of bits of unknown information per hydrogen molecule is\nat1i | fifteen point one four four over zero point six nine three one five approximately equals twenty-one point eight four eight. This is slightly more than for helium, where the number was twenty-one point seven zero zero.\n4dbf | As a sanity check, let's do this calculation a different way. A hydrogen molecule is close to half the mass of a helium atom, so its thermal wavelength should be sqrt two times as large. In our calculation we're treating V over N as the same for both gases, so hydrogen's V over N A cubed should be two to the power of negative three-halves times as large as that for helium. Since ultimately we compute bits by taking a logarithm in base two, this reduces its entropy per molecule by three halves bits. However, hydrogen's two tumbling degrees of freedom increase its entropy per molecule by one nat, or one over ln two bits. We have\nnsky | negative three halves plus one over ln two approximately equals negative one point five plus one point four four three approximately equals negative zero point zero five seven. This suggests that each hydrogen molecule should carry zero point zero five seven fewer bits of unknown information than each helium atom. Why did our more careful calculation say hydrogen should have about\npa2d | twenty-one point eight four eight minus twenty-one point seven zero zero approximately equals zero point one four eight more bits of unknown information per molecule? What's the mistake?\n```",
