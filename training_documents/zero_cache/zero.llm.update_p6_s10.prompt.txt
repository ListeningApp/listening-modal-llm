You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

6z45 | 3.2 Admissible Action Parsing by Semantic Translation
20af | One issue arises when naively following the above approach to generate action plans: the plan expressed in free-form language often cannot be mapped to unambiguous actionable steps and thus is not executable by a robotic agent. Many reasons can cause such failures: 1) the output does not follow pre-defined mappings of any atomic action (e.g. "I first walk to the bedroom" is not of the format "walk to (PLACE)"), 2) the output may refer to atomic action and objects using words unrecognizable by the environment (e.g. "microwave the chocolate milk" where "microwave" and "chocolate milk" cannot be mapped to precise action and object), or 3) the output contains lexically ambiguous words (e.g. "open TV" should instead be "switch on TV").
huae | Instead of developing a set of rules to transform the free-form text into admissible action steps, we propose to again leverage world knowledge learned by language models to semantically translate the action. For each admissible environment action <LATEX>a _ { e } ,</LATEX> we calculate its semantic distance to the predicted action phrase <LATEX>\widehat { a }</LATEX> by cosine similarity:
rblh | <LATEX>C \left( f \left( \widehat { a } \right) , f \left( a _ { e } \right) \right) : = \frac { f \left( \widehat { a } \right) \cdot f \left( a _ { e } \right) } { \| f \left( \widehat { a } \right) \| \| f \left( a _ { e } \right) \| } \mathrm { w h e r e } f \text { is an embedding function. } .</LATEX> (2)
gl5i | To embed the output action phrase and environment actions, we use a BERT-style LM [10, 27] pre-trained with Sentence-BERT [41] objective, to which we refer as Translation LM3. The action embedding is obtained by mean-pooling the last layer hidden states across all tokens in that action phrase. While the set of admissible actions in our environment is discrete and possible to exhaustively enumerate, sampling or projection can be employed in larger discrete or continuous action spaces.
x0yg | 3.3 Autoregressive Trajectory Correction
mjt8 | Translating each step of the program after the entire program has been synthesized lacks consideration of achievability of individual steps and subjects to compounding errors. In practice, LLMs might output compounded instructions for a single step, even though it cannot be completed using one admissible action in the environment. To this end, we can instead interleave plan generation and action translation to allow for automatic trajectory correction. At each step, we first query Planning LM to generate <LATEX>k</LATEX> samples for a single action <LATEX>\left( \widehat { a _ { 1 } } , \widehat { a _ { 2 } } , \ldots , \widehat { a _ { k } } \right) .</LATEX> For each sample <LATEX>\widehat { a } ,</LATEX> we consider both its semantic soundness and its achievability in the environment. Specifically, we aim to find admissible environment action <LATEX>a _ { e }</LATEX> by modifying the ranking scheme described in Equation 1 as follows:
htcn | <LATEX>\arg \max _ { a _ { e } } \left[ \max _ { \widehat { a } } C \left( f \left( \widehat { a } \right) , f \left( a _ { e } \right) \right) + \beta \cdot P _ { \theta } \left( \widehat { a } \right) \right] \mathrm { w h e r e } \beta \text { is a weighting coefficient. } .</LATEX> (3)
86d4 | Then we append the translated environment action <LATEX>a _ { e }</LATEX> to the unfinished text completion. This way all subsequent steps will be conditioned on admissible actions instead of free-form action phrases generated by Planning LM. Furthermore, we can use Translation LM to detect out-of-distribution actions, those outside the capabilities of a robot, and terminate a program early instead of mapping to a faulty action. This can be achieved by setting a threshold <LATEX>\epsilon</LATEX> such that if <LATEX>\max _ { \widehat { a } , a _ { e } } C \left( f \left( \widehat { a } \right) , f \left( a _ { e } \right) \right) +</LATEX> <LATEX>\beta \cdot P _ { \theta } \left( \widehat { a } \right) < \epsilon</LATEX> at step <LATEX>t</LATEX> t, the program is terminated early. Since we now sample Planning LM for individual steps instead of an entire sequence, another termination condition we consider is when > 50% of current-step samples are 0-length (excluding leading or trailing non-English text tokens).
z7qp | 3.4 Dynamic Example Selection for Improved Knowledge Extraction
6t1g | So far in the text, we always give the same example in the prompt for all query tasks. However, consider the task of "ordering pizza". Prompting LLMs with this task may give the assumption that the agent is initialized in front of a computer, and the LLMs may guide the agent to search for a pizza store and click "checkout my cart". Although these are reasonable and feasible in the real world, such assumption cannot always be made as these interactions may not be supported in simulated environments. In fact, the closest series of actions that human experts give in VirtualHome may be "walking to a computer", "switching on the computer", and "typing the keyboard". Without being fine-tuned on these data, LLMs would often fail at these tasks.
cpls | To provide weak supervision at inference time, we propose to select the most similar task <LATEX>T</LATEX> and its example plan E from the demonstration set to be used as the example in the prompt. Specifically, we re-use the same Translation LM introduced in Section 3.2 and select <LATEX>\left( T ^ { * } , E ^ { * } \right)</LATEX> whose high-level task name <LATEX>T ^ { * }</LATEX> maximizes <LATEX>C \left( f \left( T \right) , f \left( Q \right) \right) ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>Q</LATEX> is the query task. This approach bears resemblance to several recent works [37, 13, 26, 43]. An example is shown in Figure 2 where "Shave" is the most similar to the query task "Apply lotion".
m50n | FINAL METHOD Combining the various improvement discussed above, we refer to the final method as Translated (LM) , where (LM) is replaced by specific language model used such as GPT-3.

bwsu | In this section, we first show that language models can generate sensible action plans for many high-level tasks, even without any additional training. Then we highlight its inadequacy when naively applied to embodied environments and demonstrate how this can be improved by again leveraging world knowledge learned by LLMs. Visualization of generated programs is shown in Figure 3.
