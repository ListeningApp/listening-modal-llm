Therefore, the expectation of C sub Ref according to the Negative Binomial mixture model is approximately\nks7m | w times C sub A l t times B A D plus open parenthesis one minus w close parenthesis times C sub A l t divided by B A D. The final A S B E S is estimated for S N Vs with aggregated significance either across T Fs or across cell types. The E S value is calculated as a weighted average of E S of individual S N Vs in aggregation, with weights assigned as negative logarithms of individual P values. E S is not assigned in the case if all individual P values are equal to one.\nw1w1 | S N V and A S B annotation\nh8gv | Genomic annotation. To annotate S N Vs according to their genomic location, we started with mapping S N Vs to FANTOM five enhancers and promoters. The remaining S N Vs were annotated with C H I P seeker with a hierarchical assignment of the following categories: promoter (less than or equal to one kilobase), promoter\nkwkp | (one to two kilobases), promoter (two to three kilobases), five prime U T R, three prime U T R, Exon, Intron, Downstream, Intergenic. For clarity, promoter (less than or equal to one kilobase) and five prime U T R categories were both tagged as \"promoter\"; promoter (one to two kilobases) and promoter (two to three kilobases) were both tagged as \"upstream.\"\nyj0m | Sequence motif analysis of A S Bs. For T F A S Bs, we annotated the corresponding S N Vs with sequence motif hits of the respective T Fs. To this end, we used models from H O C O M O C O version eleven core collection and S P R Y dash S A R U S for motif finding. The top-scoring motif hit was taken considering both Ref and Alt alleles, and, at this fixed position, the \"motif F C\" was calculated as the log two ratio of motif P values at the reference and alternative variants so that the positive F C corresponded to the preference of the alternative allele.",
