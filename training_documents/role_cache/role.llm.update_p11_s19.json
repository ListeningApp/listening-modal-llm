        "content": "awri | RNA-seq was performed to explore DEGs between phenotype types of flesh firmness and crispness retainability during cold storage. Apples of three hybrids (as three biological replicates) from each phenotype type, three, two, and one of flesh firmness or crispness retainability were respectively sampled at zero, six, twelve, and eighteen weeks of cold storage. Totally, seventy-two samples were collected. The Illumina HiSeq two thousand platform was used to generate one hundred base pair paired-end reads. Bioinformatic analysis of RNA-seq data was performed as previously described. DEGs were determined by using the false discovery rate less than zero point zero five and the fold change threshold greater than two point zero.\nbl28 | Candidate gene prediction\nd5bz | To develop potential diagnostic markers, candidate genes associated with flesh firmness and crispness retainability were predicted by using multi-omics data. Genes were downloaded from the intervals of the QTLs for flesh firmness or crispness retainability, respectively. SNPs and insertion/deletion variations in these genes were called using parental re-sequencing data. Of these genes, those with SNPs or insertions and deletions that did not affect the cis-element on the upstream sequence or the functional domain on the coding region were excluded. The genes which expression was not detectable, in addition to the genes with SNPs or insertions and deletions only in the promoter but that were not included in the DEGs, were excluded from further analysis.\nap5o | Genomic DNA extraction, RNA extraction and qRT-PCR assay\n7zvf | Genomic DNA of young leaves and total RNA of apple flesh or apple calli samples were extracted using the modified CTAB method as previously described. cDNA was synthesized using a c-DNA synthesis kit. The primers were designed according to the sequence on apple genome with premier software. The qRT-PCR analysis was performed using the ABI PRISM seventy-five hundred real-time PCR system. The gene encoding apple actin was used as the internal control. Three biological and three technical replicates, three times three, were performed. The primer sequences are listed in Table S16.\nmov9 | Functional validation of candidate genes\nks7m | GUS analysis\nw1w1 | To test whether the allelic variations upstream of MdERF3 and MdERF118 coding sequences may affect its promoter activity, two thousand base pair promoter fragments were amplified using PCR from the genomic DNA of 'Zisai Pearl' and 'Red Fuji'. After Sanger sequencing, the reporter constructs containing the promoter sequences of MdERF3 and MdERF118, two thousand base pairs upstream of the start, ATG codon, using restriction enzyme sites SalI and EcoRI, were prepared as previously described. The coding sequences of MdDof5.3 or MdRAVL1 was introduced into the pRI101 vector using restriction enzyme sites, SalI and BamHI for MdDof5.3, BamHI and XholI for MdRAVL1, to generate the effector constructs. The reporter and effector vectors were constructed and injected into tobacco leaves. After three days infection, the transgenic leaves were dyed using the GUS reporter gene staining kit in three biological replicates and four technical replicates. All primer sequences for vector construction are listed in Table S16.\nh8gv | Transient overexpression and VIGS\nkwkp | A six hundred ninety base pair MdERF3 and a one thousand thirty-two base pair MdERF118 coding sequences fragments were cloned from 'Golden Delicious' into the EcoRI/Xholl and EcoRI/KpnI sites of the pTRV2 virus vector as previously described. A. tumefaciens cells harbouring the resultant plasmids were suspended in infiltration buffer supplemented with one hundred fifty millimeter acetosyringone. The inoculum preparations were adjusted to O-D six hundred equals one point zero. A mixture of A. tumefaciens cells harbouring pTRV1 and pTRV2 derivatives, one to one ratio, was infiltrated into 'Golden Delicious' apple fruit, one hundred forty days after anthesis. The complete MdERF3 and MdERF118 coding sequences c-DNA sequences were amplified and individually cloned into the NdeI/EcoRI and SalI/BamHI sites of the PRI101 vector, followed by infiltration into 'Golden Delicious' apple fruit. The assays were performed with at least six fruit for each vector, and the experiments were repeated at least three times. The primer pairs used are listed in Table S16.\nyj0m | Apple calli transformation\newfp | To determine the impact of the allelic variations in the upstream regions of MdERF3 and MdERF118 on promoter activity, genetic constructs with the promoters of MdERF3 and MdERF118, and also their coding sequences, respectively, plus a GUS reporter, were prepared using the one-step seamless cloning kit. These included MdERF3 pro-F:GUS, Del three hundred twenty-three,\noczy | MdERF3 pro-F:GUS, del three hundred twenty-three, MdERF118 pro-Z:GUS, Del two hundred twenty-nine, and MdERF118 pro-Z:GUS, del two hundred twenty-nine. All constructs were transiently transformed into apple calli, from hypanthium of 'Orin' cultivar, using the method described by Jia et al. The complete MdERF3 and MdERF118 coding sequences c-DNA sequences were also amplified and cloned into the NdeI/EcoRI and SalI/BamHI sites of the PRI101 vector, respectively. Partial MdERF3 and MdERF118 coding sequences sequences were cloned using the restriction enzyme sites XbaI/ SalI, EcoRI/SalI, and XbaI/SalI, KpnI/EcoRI of the RNAi vector. The primer pairs used are listed in Table S16.\n2ttg | Y1H assay\nhis3 | The coding sequences of MdERF3 and MdERF118 were ligated into the PJG4-5 vector in restriction enzyme sites EcoRI/XholI. MdPME2, MdPGLR3 and MdACO4 were ligated into the Placzi vector in restriction enzyme sites EcoRI/XholI, KpnI/XholI, and KpnI/XholI, respectively. The coding sequences of MdDof5.3 and MdRAVL1 were ligated into the PJG4- five vector using restriction enzyme sites EcoRI/XholI. MdERF3 and MdERF118 were ligated into the Placzi vector, using restriction enzyme sites EcoRI/XholI. All primers used are listed in Table S16.\nm50z | EMSA",
