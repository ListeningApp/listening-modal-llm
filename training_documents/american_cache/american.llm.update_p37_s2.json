        "content": "kg3t | While the map thus answered Jefferson's authorial scruples in much the same vein as it did for the framers of the Constitution a few years later, it also enabled Jefferson to appropriate the greater discourse of cartography as the foundation of state representation. In Query thirteen, writing on \"the constitution of the state, and its several charters,\" Jefferson invokes the figure of the map as the state's original text. By citing the cartographically represented space of Virginia rather than history as the state's genealogical source of origin, he points to the language of cartography as the ideal agent of political mediation and representation. Moreover, when Jefferson concedes that the state's founding document was written at a time when \"we were new and unexperienced in the science of government,\" he is quick to add that it was due to cartographic writing that Virginians discovered \"very capital defects\" in the constitution.\nlvae | By the end of this query, the implied map image of Virginia, though invisible throughout the Notes as such, has fulfilled the demand of eighteenth-century national ideologies. Jefferson's rhetorical use of the map facilitated the narrative fusion of the state's external boundaries with those of the individual citizen. The implied map image had succeeded in dividing the state into local working units (counties); its writing system implicitly was preventing \"injury\" among the state's citizens; and, more important, it had laid the groundwork for depicting Virginia as a homogenous culture working the land collectively (a point Jefferson further elaborated in Query nineteen). Jefferson's Notes thus illustrates how during the early decades the very terms surrounding the idea of nation were flexible. For Jefferson, the semantic application of \"nation\" was as dynamic and constitutive a concept as that of \"state.\" Cartographic writing allowed Jefferson to keep alive this definitional uncertainty. As the word map of Virginia furthered Jefferson's sectionalist argument, it also prepared the argument for one of Jefferson's future political goals: the guarantee of autonomy for the individual state inside the proposed unified superstate.\no9sc | What neither Jay, Winthrop, nor Jefferson had foreseen was the fact that the national map as a specialized print form controlled its potential for divisiveness; it functioned like a proleptic device, asserting the primacy of the union while anticipating and containing the local desire for self-definition. During the period marked by the constitutional debate and the tumult over states' rights, commercial mapmakers as well as ordinary map readers developed the nation's cartographic image into a hieroglyphic sign consisting exclusively of the nation's territorial outline. Indeed, as I will show below, in the hands of American statesmen and students alike the national map became what Benedict Anderson has identified as an avatar of modern nationalism, the \"map-as-logo.\"\n121u | In the United States, one of the first examples showing the nation as a pure sign and logo appeared in William McMurray's wall map, The United States according to the Definitive Treaty of Peace Signed at Paris (seventeen eighty-four). In this map the nation's topographic image enters into a comparative dialogue with an inset map (on the lower right) showing the North American continent and its division into geopolitical units. The inset map distinguishes the new political nation-state from the continent by outlining its territory as a blank space bearing the bold print label \"UNITED STATES.\" While the inset map thus announces the map title in lieu of a cartouche, when placed in relation to the larger national map the dialogue shifts the reader's attention from the comparatively locative stance (how do I find myself on the map?) to the more competitive and possessive stance (this map shows my country!). Its blankness erases local knowledge, regional claims, and above all the fact that the national space was not fully under federal control (west of the Allegheny Mountains, Native American nations were still officially masters of their domains). Through the map's metanarrative between the geographic and the inset parts, McMurray illustrates the way in which the nation's bare, skeletal outline functioned in the sphere of politics as a signifier of reconciliation and containment: the map simultaneously maintained and closed the gap between the nation and the states.\nzh03 | While McMurray's map reached only a limited audience, the material proliferation of the national map vastly aided the dissemination of the United States map as a logo. In particular, the image of the logo map pervaded the self-representational culture of the educated middle class. Examining Ralph Earl's portrait of Mrs. Noah Smith and her family, a closer look reveals that the nation's outline becomes the direct prop of the young man holding the geography book.\n1mvw | the logo map, with its simultaneous integration into alphabetic and geographic training, is vividly exemplified in the needlework samplers created by American schoolgirls. Throughout the eighteenth century, formal alphabet lessons had been accompanied by needlework samplers reproducing the letters of the alphabet and didactic quotations. By the seventeen nineties, however, as American literacy lessons were increasingly taking a geo-\n6d4s | graphic turn, the samplers' thematic range was expanded to include the reproduction of maps. While pupils continued to embroider the alphabet, they also took up pen, brush, and needles to draw, paint, and stitch the United States map outline and place-names on paper and on silk.",
