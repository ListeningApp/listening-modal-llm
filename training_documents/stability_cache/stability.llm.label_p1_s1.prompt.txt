You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

v6sk | Stability and Change of Psychopathology Symptoms Throughout Childhood and Adolescence
1wj6 | Abstract
936l | Assessing stability and change of children's psychopathology symptoms can help elucidate whether specific behaviors are transient developmental variations or indicate persistent psychopathology. This study included 6930 children across early childhood (T1), late childhood (T2) and early adolescence (T3), from the general population. Latent profile analysis identi- fied psychopathology subgroups and latent transition analysis quantified the probability that children remained within, or transitioned across psychopathology subgroups. We identified four psychopathology subgroups; no problems (T1: 85.9%, T2: 79.0%, T3: 78.0%), internalizing (T1: 5.1%, T2: 9.2%, T3: 9.0%), externalizing (T1: 7.3%, T2: 8.3%, T3: 10.2%) and the dysregulation profile (DP) (T1: 1.7%, T2: 3.5%, T3: 2.8%). From T1 to T2, 44.7% of the children remained in the DP. Between T2 and T3, 33.6% remained in the DP; however, 91.4% were classified in one of the psychopathology subgroups. Our findings suggest that for many children, internalizing or externalizing symptoms encompass a transient phase within development. Contrary, the DP resembles a severe at-risk state in which the predictive value for being in one of the psycho- pathology subgroups increases over time.

dpv6 | Introduction
8r5j | It is widely known that children with symptoms of psycho- pathology in childhood and adolescence are at higher risk of psychopathology in adulthood [1-5]. Studying the stability and change of child behavior over time can elucidate those characteristics of psychopathology that are transient phases of development versus those that signal persistent psycho- pathology. Symptoms of psychopathology in children can be divided broadly into two domains; namely internalizing (e.g. anxiety) and externalizing problems (e.g. aggressive behav- ior). Additionally, there is a group of children with comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems. In the literature these children have been labelled as either a comorbid group or a group with the dysregulation profile (DP) [5-8].
2taz | Many studies have assessed the prevalence of psycho- pathology and the continuity of individual domains of psy- chopathology separately (e.g. depressive symptoms, aggres- sive behavior) [1, 9-11]. These studies provide evidence that overall stability decreases when the time interval between the first measurement and follow-up waves increases [9-11], and that externalizing behavior tends to be more stable than

5gui | internalizing behavior [9]. Additionally, stability in symp- toms of psychopathology has been shown to be higher in children who were older at initial assessment, suggesting that symptoms of psychopathology become more predic- tive of persistent psychopathology with age [1]. However, studying persistence and change of individual domains of psychopathology has two limitations. First, as internalizing and externalizing symptoms are highly comorbid [10], the continuity and change of the correlated domains will likely, to some extent, reflect the same underlying process. Second, when there is a reduction of symptoms in one domain, we do not know whether this reflects a decrease in overall symp- toms, or alternatively, a change only in those specific symp- toms (e.g. decrease in aggression coupled with an increase in attention problems).
82qc | An increasingly adopted method that identifies subgroups of children based on their continuous symptoms across domains of psychopathology is latent profile analysis (LPA). This data-driven approach minimizes the heterogeneity of comorbid symptoms and allows for a more integrated analy- sis of child behavior compared to assessing specific domains (e.g. depressive symptoms) separately. In a recent review, 23 studies that used LPA to study symptoms of psychopathol- ogy in 4-11 year-old children were compared [12]. Three of these studies analyzed symptoms across internalizing and externalizing domains in a population-based setting, of which two were performed at younger ages in the current sample [6, 13]. All studies identified four psychopathology subgroups; (i.) no problems, (ii.) internalizing, (iii.) exter- nalizing and (iv.) a comorbid or DP group [6, 7, 13]. Across all ages, approximately 2% of the population was classified in the DP with comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems. The percentage of children included in either the internalizing or externalizing subgroup differed substantially between the two studies, with prior work in early childhood showing higher rates of externalizing, but lower rates of internalizing symptoms compared to studies in later child- hood and adolescence [6, 7]. An internalizing subgroup was present in toddlers aged 3 to 4.5 years and children between 5 and 9 years of age, with 4.8% and 5.3% being included in the internalizing subgroup in these age ranges, respec- tively. An externalizing subgroup was present as early as 1.5 to 2.5 years of age, with 11.1% of the children exhibit- ing this profile. Further, between 3 and 4.5 years of age, 6.5% was included in the externalizing profile and between 5 and 9 years of age, the proportion of children included was 7.3% [6]. Within another sample, assessing children in late childhood (mean age 7.5 years) and early adolescence (mean age 14 years), respectively 16.1% and 13.9% of the children were included in the internalizing and 2.5% and 4.4% in the externalizing subgroup [7].

t8vv | transition analysis (LTA) can be applied. During develop- ment, children can either remain in the same subgroup over time, or transition between psychopathology subgroups. The former is typically referred to as homotypic continu- ity, which elucidates the predictive validity of children remaining in the same subgroup at each subsequent time point. Transitioning between psychopathology subgroups is referred to as heterotypic continuity, in which an earlier psy- chopathology subgroup can be an underlying risk factor for a child to transition to a different subgroup. Earlier work on the stability of symptoms of psychopathology in children has shown that stability increases with age [6] and that between mid-childhood and early adolescence, homotypic continuity is higher for the internalizing and externalizing subgroups than for the DP [7]. More specifically, from those children included in the internalizing subgroup in late toddlerhood, only 23% remained in this subgroup in early childhood [6] and from those identified with internalizing symptoms in late childhood, 61% exhibited internalizing symptoms in early adolescence [7]. Likewise for the externalizing sub- group, homotypic continuity was present for 31% between early and late toddlerhood, 39% between late toddlerhood and early childhood [6] and 62% between late childhood and early adolescence [7]. Regarding the DP, homotypic continu- ity did not consistently increase across age. Between early and late toddlerhood, late toddlerhood and early childhood, and finally between late childhood and early adolescence, homotypic continuity of the DP was present for 37%, 18% and 44% [6, 7].
qvnu | Our study addresses several knowledge gaps to further improve the understanding of stability and change in symp- toms of psychopathology from childhood into adolescence. First, prior work by Basten et al. within the current sam- ple, assessed the stability and change of psychopathology symptoms until early childhood [6], not yet covering late childhood and early adolescence. Studying the stability and change of psychopathology symptoms in this age period is crucial, given the rapid changes in behavior that occur dur- ing adolescence [14] and since many psychiatric disorders emerge during adolescence [15, 16]. Second, despite the fact that the two previous longitudinal studies applied similar analyses, they used different measures of psychopathol- ogy. Basten et al. used parent reported questionnaire data, assessing psychopathology as symptoms along a continuum, whereas McElroy et al. used a structured clinical interview, implemented as a parent reported questionnaire, generating binary variables for the presence of psychiatric diagnoses [6, 7]. Thus, it remains unclear whether the substantial dif- ferences in prevalence can be attributed to age differences or to differences in sample or methodology.
kggw | Within this context, it is the primary goal of this study to assess developmental trajectories of children with psy- chopathology symptoms as they progress into adolescence.

5746 | We evaluate which psychopathology subgroups are present in the general population at different ages and the probabil- ity that individuals remain within or transition between the observed psychopathology subgroups over time. Based on previous literature, we hypothesized that we would observe four psychopathology subgroups (no problems, internaliz- ing, externalizing and DP) in all age groups, and that the psychopathology subgroups become more stable with age, except for the DP group. We hypothesize that this group will begin to diverge during adolescence, transitioning to primar- ily either internalizing or externalizing subgroups.

a8ge | Child behavior was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The CBCL version 1.5-5 years consists of 99 items, with a three-point Likert scale (0= not true, 1 = somewhat true, 2 = very true). Seven empirically derived syndrome scales were calculated, being Anxious/Depressed, Aggressive Behavior, Emotionally Reactive, Somatic Com- plaints, Withdrawn, Sleep Problems and Attention Prob- lems. Similarly, the CBCL version 6-18 years consists of 112 items, of which eight syndrome scales were derived, Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn/Depressed, Somatic Com- plaints, Thought Problems, Attention Problems, Rule- breaking Behavior and Aggressive Behavior. Both versions are reliable and valid questionnaires for assessing behav- ioral problems [18, 19]. The primary caregiver completed the questionnaires, which was the CBCL v1.5-5 at T1 and CBCL v6-18 at T2 and T3 [20, 21]. Notably, given the age range included at T1, for some children the CBCL v1.5-5 and for other children the CBCL v6-18 would have been age appropriate. The CBCL v1.5-5 was used at T1 for all participants to keep the CBCL version consistent with earlier measurement waves of Generation R [20, 21]. T-scores of all syndrome scales were computed based on normative data for both the CBCL/1.5-5 and the CBCL/6-18 using ASEBA- PC [22].
h27a | Demographic Characteristics
pdjh | Sex was obtained from birth records. Maternal education and household income were assessed through questionnaire. Maternal education was categorized into low (no education, primary school), middle (high school, vocational training) and high (higher vocational training, university). Household income was scored low in Generation R when parents had less than 2000 euros a month and high when parents had more than 2000 euros a month. Child national origin was based on the birth country of the parents and categorized as western (Dutch, American western, Asian western, Euro- pean, Indonesian & Oceania) and non-western (African, American non-western, Asian non-western, Cape Verdean, Dutch Antilles, Moroccan, Surinamese & Turkish).

gy8c | psychopathology subgroups at T1, T2 and T3, using CBCL T-scores of all available syndrome scales as indicators, includ- ing Sleep Problems. Consistent with earlier work within Gen- eration R, we used five criteria to determine the optimal num- ber of profiles [6, 13]. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the bootstrapped likelihood ratio test (BLRT) were used to evaluate the fit of each model. The BIC is a measure of model fit considering the rule of parsimony, with a lower BIC indicating a better fit. The BLRT is a likelihood ratio for k classes versus k - 1 classes, with a p-value greater than 0.05 indicating that k - 1 classes are sufficient. Entropy of the models was evaluated with values closer to 1 indicating better classification. Moreover, all profiles obtained should include a minimum of 1% of the participants. Lastly, all profiles were inspected visually to ensure each additional profile had a dis- tinct severity or shape pattern.
