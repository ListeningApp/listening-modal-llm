You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

5lm9 | The Special Committee consulted some key stakeholders in the University, including some members of Convocation and also relied on documents received from colleagues. Some of the stakeholders consulted included the Provost of the College of Health and Allied Sciences as well as the Dean, Vice-Dean and Faculty Officer of the School of Medical Sciences.
wp2c | Documents consulted by the Committee included the University of Cape Coast Statutes (the current Statutes and its predecessors, i.e. 2012, 2003); Report of the Prof. Yankson's Committee on Grievances of UTAG UCC and other documents.
us5v | ISSUES RAISED DURING THE INTERACTIONS
rs2m | It was admitted that some individuals and Departments are the cause of delay in processing of promotion documents. The Faculty Members of the School of Medical Sciences, however, raised the following concerns regarding delays in processing of their promotion documents:
uz9y | 1. The time it takes to receive updates on assessment outcomes is too long; in some instances it has taken three to five years.
8ov0 | 2. There are ambiguities in communication to applicants regarding assessment results. An example of such communication is; "Two reports received to submit two new assessors", even when the names of assessors have been re-submitted countless times.
mj9m | 3. There are unexplained delays and lack of clarity on some decisions taken on the promotion of some colleagues at the Appointments and Promotions Board.
94h3 | 4. The requirement for acquisition of terminal degrees before some colleagues are considered for promotion to a higher rank is unfair and a demotivation to Clinicians in the School, particularly those with Fellowship qualifications who have contributed immensely to the University's achievements.
9jx1 | 5. The terms of A&P's implementation of assessment outcomes are not clear or fair and mostly communication regarding such outcomes unnecessarily delays ..
c3lz | The Provost of the College of Health and Allied Sciences identified the following factors that cause the delay:
8bwk | a) lack of cooperation from individuals when changes are suggested to be effected;
ez9s | b) unavailability of some individuals to make correction to the promotion documents;
mqot | c) some key administrators delay the processing of documents especially when they have to go on leave;
oc99 | d) difficulty in getting a response from possible assessors (abroad), especially in the case of promotion to professorial status, and at worse, from Ghana with regard to some disciplines;
gipz | e) difficulty in understanding reports and requests from the Directorate of Human Resource due to brevity and inadequate clarity.
b4wj | On the requirement that Clinicians should obtain Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees to warrant promotion to higher ranks, the Provost responded that it should not be a problem considering that Fellowship qualifications are deemed in many jurisdictions, even within the country, as parallel to a PhD.
5xlt | FINDINGS AND ISSUES FOR REDRESS
9bz4 | A. Breach of the Criteria for Appointments and Promotions of Senior Members
yfv2 | 1. Withholding the Promotion of Mr Kow-Kwegya Amissah Abraham
pujl | a) Mr Kow-Kwegya Amissah Abraham was appointed a Lecturer in the Department of Classics and Philosophy on 1st November 2015. With the requisite papers, he applied for promtion to the rank of Senior Lecturer and was promoted on the 1st August, 2020.
3rqe | b) On 14th April 2022, he received a letter from the Vice-Chancellor withholding his promotion to the rank of Senior Lecturer effective 1st August 2020.
nsi3 | c) The basis for withholding his promotion, as given in the Vice-Chancellor's letter, was the report of the Special Council Committee on the interpretation of a recommendation of the 2016 Ad hoc Committee on Grievances of UTAG UCC.
nil3 | Convocation, therefore, requests answers to the following questions:
68a1 | a) Will his promotion be backdated to the point it was withheld when issues are resolved?
seik | b) Was Mr. Kow-Kwegya Amissah Abraham informed of the decision of the Ad hoc Committee? If not, is it fair that he suffers at this time when he did not know the decision?
oq7c | c) How many appointment and promotion criteria does the University of Cape Coast have?
z4mi | d) Is an ad hoc committee report a promotion criteria or a substantive legislative instrument?
hkft | e) How many Senior Members has this been applied to?
jai3 | In our view, Mr Kow-Kwegya Amissah Abraham has been wrongfully dealt with considering that there are similar cases and examples.
p57i | 2. The Case of Appointment of Prof. Emmanuel K. Abu
u5ug | a) Prof. Emmanuel K. Abu was appointed as a Tutor on 24th November, 2010. Prior to that, he had been a Senior Research Assistant at the then Department of Optometry from 1st September, 2009.
i9k5 | b) At the time of the appointment, he possessed a Doctor of Optometry (OD) Degree. He later obtained a PhD in 2016.
20z2 | c) He was appointed as Tutor on 24th November, 2010. While paragraphs 1-3 of his appointment letter were about Tutorship, the 4th paragraph
4cgs | ----
htre | i) The promotion from Lecturer to Senior Lecturer was expected to be in accordance with paragraph 6.7.1, Schedule D of the 2012 Statutes which, inter alia, provides that candidate seeking promotion to the rank of Senior Lecturer must have engaged in university teaching, research and community as a Lecturer for at least four (4) years. Considering that Prof. Abu did not qualify and was not properly appointed as a Lecturer, the criterion was disregarded.
da3c | The findings from the foregoing are as follows:
890q | i. Prof. Emmanuel K. Abu did not possess a Master of Philosophy Degree and two years teaching experience to be appointed as Lecturer in 2010.
jomo | ii. The decision to convert Tutors to Assistant Lecturers clearly indicated that Tutors and Lecturers were not equivalent.
06fi | iii. The salary enjoyed by Prof. Abu as a Lecturer had no basis and should not have been used to equate his position as Tutor to Lecturer. Indeed, if the two ranks were the same, he would have been appointed directly to the rank of Lecturer.
hb4s | iv. The placement of Prof. Abu on the Lecturer's scale when he did not qualify to be there could have been done deliberately in our view; if it was in error, there were plenty of opportunities to correct this but it was not corrected.
cqq2 | 3. The Case of Prof. Samuel Kyei
1ews | a) Prof. Samuel Kyei was appointed as Tutor on 18th October, 2011.
afyn | b) Apparently Prof. Kyei had enrolled in a Masters Programme (MPhil Pharmacology) at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST). His CV indicates that he completed the MPhil Pharmacology programme in 2012.
8sye | c) The Academic Board, at its First Regular Meeting (2015/2016) held on 27th October, 2015 approved the recommendation from the Appointments and Promotions Board to upgrade the Tutors in the Department of Optometry who possessed MPhil degrees to the rank of Assistant Lecturer.
r04h | d) Dr. Samuel Kyei's designation was upgraded to the rank of Assistant Lecturer in accordance with the decision of the Academic Board with effect from 26th February 2016.
orpr | e) Professor Kyei obtained a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Optometry degree dated 14th April, 2016 from the University of Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa.
k36m | f) He was thereafter upgraded to the rank of Lecturer with effect from 1st April, 2016.
wnuz | g) Prof. Kyei was promoted to the rank of Senior Lecturer with effect from 1st February 2018, exactly two years after his elevation to the rank of Lecturer.
sy14 | h) Prof. Kyei was again promoted to the rank of Associate Professor effective 151 February, 2021 through the accelerated mode according to documents available to Convocation.
ghss | The findings from Prof. Kyei's case are as follows:
