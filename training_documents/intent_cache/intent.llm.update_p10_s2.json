Additionally, when Mr. Johnson mentioned to Rigel that it wasn't his fault that their interaction the day before was not productive, another interpersonal event occurred: an intimate self-disclosure. Mr. Johnson admitted to Rigel that he was responsible for the interaction having gone poorly.\nuc9x | Event\nzy7o | Expression of strong emotion\nkcar | Power dilemmas\n00aw | Nonverbal cues\n351p | Crisis points\nzzcb | Limitations of therapy\nmxnx | A client needs a piece of equipment that is unavailable within the therapeutic environment.\n11k8 | Contextual inconsistencies\ntwwy | The location of the therapy session changes.\nfyp8 | During therapy, interpersonal events such as these may be precipitated by the following circumstances.\nz994 | A client's interpersonal characteristics or reactions to something inside or outside of the therapeutic context\nvvqn | The therapist's behavior (e.g., the therapist makes a suggestion or asks a question that the client perceives as intrusive or emotionally difficult)\np6xg | These examples are only a few of the myriad possible interpersonal events that occur during the course of occupational therapy.\nbppc | When interpersonal events of therapy occur, their interpretation is a product of the client's unique set of\nilnw | interpersonal characteristics and reactions in the moment. Sometimes the event has a significant effect on the client, whereas at other times a client is unaffected or minimally affected. When such events occur, it is important that the therapist be aware that the event has occurred and take responsibility for responding appropriately. The therapist should not overreact or underreact to the event. Instead, the therapist should watch for any cues from the client and listen to anything that the client may say about the event that could prompt a certain type of response from the therapist.\nf3rc | Interpersonal events are:\nd7bx | Inevitable during the course of therapy\ngx97 | Ripe with both threat and opportunity\nppkp | Interpersonal events are part of the constant give and take that occurs during a therapy process. They are distinguished from other events or processes in that they are charged with the potential for an emotional response either when they occur or later upon reflection. Consequently, if they are ignored or responded to less than optimally, these events can threaten both the therapeutic relationship and the client's occupational engagement. When optimally responded to, the events can provide opportunities for positive client learning or change and for solidifying the therapeutic relationship. Chapter two presented a series of therapists' stories about particularly challenging moments of the Intentional Relationship.\n8br6 | of a significant interpersonal event. Chapter six describes and gives examples of interpersonal events that have been found from our observations to occur with a high level of frequency in occupational therapy. Because they are unavoidable in any therapeutic interaction, one of the primary tasks of a therapist practicing according to the IRM is to respond to these inevitable events in a way that leads to repair and strengthening of the therapeutic relationship.\n2kb3 | The Therapist's Use of Self\nlqcx | Within the IRM, the therapist is responsible for making every reasonable effort to make the relationship work through effective communication and interaction with the client. This requires a tremendous amount of self-discipline and empathy, particularly when clients are not at their best. Specifically, the therapist is responsible for bringing three main interpersonal capacities into the relationship.\n3h7w | An interpersonal skill base\nth5p | Therapeutic modes (or interpersonal styles)\nb7nk | Capacity for interpersonal reasoning\ncbb5 | This section provides a brief description of each of these interpersonal capacities. The first capacity involves development and application of a wide-ranging interpersonal\n5qcf | PRACTICAL APPLICATION three point four\n8u2c | Let's revisit an example from the suboptimal interaction between the occupational therapist, Erika, and her client, Vera, presented in Chapter one. As you may recall, several interpersonal events occurred during that interaction, in rapid succession. According to the IRM, this is referred to as an interpersonal event cascade.\nc1e3 | The first interpersonal event was boundary testing. Vera asks Erika numerous questions to test her credibility, including whether she has had personal experience with breast cancer. This was followed by an intimate self-disclosure on the part of the therapist, when Erika revealed to Vera that her grandmother had pancreatic cancer. This disclosure was impulsive and not well planned. Instead, it represented a reactionary attempt on Erika's part to prove to Vera her legitimacy as a cancer expert. Instead of quelling the situation, the disclosure prompted a nonverbal cue, followed by a power dilemma that ended poorly with an empathic break.\n7pez | Boundary Testing\nqs5t | Clients will certainly ask personal questions of their therapists, but they are not necessarily entitled to know the answers. Asking about a therapist's health history, for example, is confidential information. By doing this, Vera put Erika in an awkward position, leaving her with a few choices to respond-some therapeutic and others suboptimal.\nen4s | Therapeutic Responses\ncsb5 | One example of a therapeutic response involves making an educated guess, or a construal that gives words to Vera's troublesome behavior that includes pausing and sharing with Vera how she is experiencing the questioning. Erika might say, \"Vera, you have a lot of questions for me. I am wondering if you have concerns about whether I have enough knowledge and experience to understand your unique experience with cancer.\" Another therapeutic response that does not involve interpreting Vera's behavior may involve answering all Vera's questions about cancer except for her personal question. If Vera persists, Erika could set a limit, such as:\ni096 | \"Vera, I appreciate that you would like to know about me and about any personal experience I have\ntlzt | had with cancer. As a rule, I do not disclose this kind of personal information to the people I work with because I feel that the focus of my work should be on understanding your unique experience, rather than trying to relate any experience I or a loved one may have had to your experience.\"\n6iyf | One may ask why Erika's refusal to answer Vera's question could be more therapeutic than what she actually did, which was to disclose her grandmother's experience with pancreatic cancer. The reason that withholding this information would have been more therapeutic than disclosing it lies in three of the underlying principles of the IRM: Principle two: Interpersonal Self-Discipline Is Fundamental to Effective Use of Self, Principle three: It Is Necessary to Keep Head Before Heart, and Principle four: Mindful Empathy Is Required to Know Your Client. These and the other ten underlying principles of IRM are discussed in further detail at the end of this chapter.\no1nk | In the actual interaction, Erika engaged in another interpersonal event, an intimate self-disclosure, by responding to Vera's question with a brief personal disclosure that her grandmother had pancreatic cancer. This response was suboptimal for two reasons. First, from Vera's perspective it did not add to her credibility as someone with expertise in cancer. Erika's brief mention that her grandmother had pancreatic cancer really did not do justice to the hours she spent caring for and spending time with her grandmother as she was receiving treatment and also during her period of palliative care. Erika did not have the opportunity to share the range of painful emotions she experienced during her grandmother's cancer experience, nor did she have the chance to explain the ways in which she gained extensive knowledge about cancer, cancer treatments, and cancer rehabilitation. Importantly, Erika did not have the chance to explain how the experience of caring for her grandmother and sharing in her cancer experience strengthened her character and gave her a new perspective about living as well as dying.",
