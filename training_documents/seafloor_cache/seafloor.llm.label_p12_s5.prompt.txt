You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

lrry | Site C is a large volcanic cinder cone, rising to ~70 m above the seafloor and with a diameter of ~120 x 90 m (Figs. 2, 5C, D). Chimney complexes and mounds occur on the flank of this cone in the vicinity of a circular slump feature. TKAD032 intercepted unconsolidated volcaniclastic cover material to 1.8 m, followed by intensely altered volcaniclastic breccia to 6.9 m b.s.f. (App. Fig. A12). The altered sequence consists of monomict lapillistone with subrounded to subangular vesic- ular clasts but variable clay alteration. The uppermost lapil- listone is matrix supported with variable sulfate cement and veins and disseminated pyrite, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite (decreasing downhole). Several horizons are clast supported (up to 60% clasts), with angular monomict clasts, and appear to be autobreccias. One gypsum-rich interval occurs at 6.4 to 6.6 m b.s.f. TKAD033 was drilled at the edge of a small crater or collapse feature near the summit of the cone. The recov- ered rock types are similar to those in TKAD032, with a tran- sition between the volcaniclastic cover and the clay-altered footwall occurring at 1.1 m b.s.f. (App. Fig. A13). Variable alteration intensity gives this rock a polymict appearance.
hvhm | Site D is an irregularly shaped topographic high, ~70 Ã— 80 m in diameter, in the saddle between two cinder cones (Figs. 2, 5C, D). Chimneys occur on the north flank, where there is local venting of milky fluids from fractures near the base of the chimneys. On the northern side of the chimney cluster, TKAD017 intersected unconsolidated volcaniclas- tic cover material to ~1.4 m, separated from an interval of chimney talus by a layer of oxidized mud and chimney frag- ments (App. Fig. A14). The chimney talus extends to a depth of 5.2 m b.s.f. but is interrupted by a second layer of oxidized mud at depths of 2.6 to 3.3 m b.s.f. The altered footwall com- prises subrounded, matrix-supported, monomict lapilli-sized clasts with minor disseminated pyrite and patchy anhydrite + gypsum cement that increases downhole to a depth of 7.4 m b.s.f. A few subrounded fragments of chimneys are also found in the footwall. The upper oxidized layer between the cover sequence and the mineralized interval can be traced ~20 m eastward to TKAD030 (App. Fig. A15). The lower oxidized layer was not recovered at TKAD030; instead, a buried sphalerite-rich chimney was intersected. The drilled sphalerite-rich chimney is underlain by chimney talus, which appears to be continuous with material in TKAD017. Altered lapillistone to 5.3 m b.s.f. consists of several beds that are dis- tinguished by changes in grain size and proportion of clasts to matrix and by a higher proportion of sulfate cement. The two oxidized intervals encountered in TKAD017 were also traced 25 m to the south in TKAD031 (App. Fig. A16). The volcaniclastic cover sequence is absent in this drill hole, but
863b | a large chalcopyrite- and sphalerite-rich chimney block that likely came from a chimney complex located upslope to the south was drilled. The uppermost layer of chimney talus was similarly encountered here, extending to a similar depth (~5 m b.s.f.). The cover sequence is also absent in TKAD018 to the east. This hole started in oxidized chimney talus that is continuous with the uppermost oxidized interval in the other drill holes (App. Fig. A17). The chimney talus here is only ~0.6 m thick, grading to the clay-altered footwall at 1.2 m b.s.f. The clay-altered lapillistone at this location con- tains a higher proportion of fine-grained material (tuff). In the southeast, TKAD019 encountered only unconsolidated volcaniclastic cover material (to 6.1 m b.s.f.) that accumulated within a topographic low at the periphery of a chimney cluster (App. Fig. A18). Within the thick accumulation of cover mate- rial, there are several distinct intervals of intensely oxidized sediment, which may be continuations with the oxidized lay- ers in the other holes.
fj24 | Site E is on the southernmost cinder cone near several small craters (Figs. 2, 5E). TKAD005 is near an inactive chimney complex on the eastern margin of the northernmost crater; TKAD003 is on a small ridge south of TKAD005, near a scarp that may be a crater wall or slump and adjacent to a site of active venting. Both drill holes recovered moderately sorted, clast-supported, monomict lapillistone with weak grading and intense clay alteration. The matrix consists of anhydrite cement with minor disseminated sphalerite and pyrite that decrease in abundance downhole and are locally oxidized to hematite.
uz3c | Site F is located west of the main NS-trending fissure, where chimneys and mounds are aligned in a circular pattern, but con- structional volcanic features are absent (Figs. 2,5F). TKAD007 was drilled next to a site of active venting in a sequence of clast-supported, clay-altered monomict lapillistone character- ized by moderately sorted subangular clasts. The lapillistone is cemented by anhydrite, which increases in abundance down- hole and is locally fracture controlled. The breccia also con- tains minor disseminated pyrite and fracture-controlled patchy iron oxide. A few centimeter-wide pyrite-chalcopyrite veinlets associated with the most intense clay alteration occur at the top of the recovered core. Inactive chimney complexes and mounds surround the area of active venting and appear to be aligned along structural corridors (Fig. 2). TKAD008 is located along one of these NW-SE-trending structures, 102 m south of TKAD007, on a low-relief ridge with numerous inactive chim- ney complexes and mounds. The upper part is matrix-sup- ported lapillistone that grades downhole into a clast-supported lapillistone similar to that in TKAD008. Increasing clast size and angularity and decreasing alteration intensity downhole suggest that this drill hole may be at the periphery of the main hydrothermal upflow zone.

Unlike the subseafloor brec- cia facies, the seafloor chimneys contain only minor anhy- drite and gypsum. Different chimney types commonly occur together; however, higher-temperature Cu-rich chimneys are more abundant near sites A and <LATEX>\mathrm { D } ,</LATEX> and lower-temperature barite-rich chimneys are common at site B (App. Fig. A20). Mineralized volcanic breccia was recovered from the base of several chimney complexes, where the chimneys have over- grown volcaniclastic material.
y219 | The Cu-rich chimneys comprise abundant, massive, coarse- grained chalcopyrite with minor pyrite (Fig. 7A-C). Locally, minor Fe-poor sphalerite and barite line the chimney con- duits. In one sample, trace amounts of microscopic gold are present as inclusions in the chalcopyrite (sample GMA13- 048; Fig. 7C). Distinctly zoned chimneys have layers that are chalcopyrite, pyrite (Â± marcasite), and sphalerite rich (Fig. 7D-F). Both Fe-rich and Fe-poor sphalerite occur in differ- ent layers. The low-Fe sphalerite commonly has inclusions of fine-grained Pb-As-Sb sulfosalts (jordanite) and minor galena. Late-stage, coarse tabular barite, amorphous silica, and iron oxyhydroxides occupy open spaces.
06ht | The Zn-rich chimneys are most abundant and consist of dendritic sphalerite and barite with pyrite and marcasite (Fig. 7G-I). These chimneys lack clearly defined vent conduits but have alternating layers of low- and high-Fe sphalerite, similar to beehive chimneys that form by diffuse fluid venting (e.g., Koski et al., 1994). The low-Fe sphalerite commonly contains inclusions of jordanite and galena; fine-grained inclusions of chalcopyrite are present at grain boundaries but are rare. Late-stage tabular barite is followed paragenetically by minor amounts of amorphous silica and trace iron and manganese oxyhydroxides. The Ba-rich chimneys also form bulbous and beehive-like structures with variable amounts of amorphous silica filling or lining open spaces (Fig. 7J-L).
v3r2 | Chalcopyrite and pyrite show little compositional varia- tion, although As is relatively enriched in both pyrite (up to 1.42 wt %) and marcasite (up to 2.71 wt %) (App. Table A2). Mercury is also present above detection limits in pyrite, together with Pb and Sb. FeS contents of sphalerite range from 0.02 to 13.98 mol %, with more than 50% of the analyses reporting <2 mol % FeS (Fig. 8). The most Fe-rich sphaler- ite is in chalcopyrite-rich assemblages, and the widest range of FeS values occur in the dendritic barite-rich chimneys. Cadmium (up to 2.04 wt %), In (up to 1.31 wt %), Ga (up <LATEX>\left. t o \quad 1 . 0 3 \quad w t \right) ,</LATEX> and Hg (up to 1.28 wt %) are likely present in solid solution in the sphalerite (e.g., Cook et al., 2009). Cadmium concentrations in sphalerite decrease from an aver- age of 0.33 wt % in the chalcopyrite-rich chimneys (n = 16) to 0.03 wt % in the dendritic barite-rich chimneys <LATEX>\left( n = 7 9 \right) ,</LATEX> suggesting a strong temperature dependence, which is also reflected in the Fe content. Galena contains up to 1.23 wt % Ag, mainly in the barite-rich chimneys. The Pb-As-Sb sulfo- salts have up to 11.91 wt % As and 0.28 wt % Sb, which is close to those of the As end member of the jordanite-geo- cronite series (cf. Biagioni et al., 2016).
