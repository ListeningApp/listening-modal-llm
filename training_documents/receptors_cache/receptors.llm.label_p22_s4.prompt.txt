  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

w95z | GPCRs and Cancer Immune Evasion
0i1k | The immune system is intricately linked to cancer initiation and progression, and as such, cancer immunotherapy is now one of the fastest growing areas of translational and clinical research for cancer treatment. Indeed, the functional roles of GPCRs in inflammation, cell trafficking, and the

p2n3 | Chemokine receptors were initially discovered in the context of immune cell migration, where expression of chemokines in different tissues and/or in response to infection and tissue injury act to direct and recruit a diverse range of innate and adaptive immune cells225-227. This process can be hijacked by cancer cells that express chemokines such as CCL17, CCL22 and others, to attract immunosuppressive immune cells including T-regulatory cells (Tregs), which specifically express the respective receptor CCR4, to promote a tumor permissive environment and dampen immune recognition228-230 (Figure 1). This can create a potent feed-forward control system where immune suppressive cells, such as myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which are recruited by a host of chemokines such as CXCL8, CXCL1, and CCL2, can further inhibit T cell activation and migration to the tumor231,232. Together, these processes can polarize macrophages, to the M2, or tumor associated macrophage (TAM) phenotype, further dampening the tumor- immune microenvironment233.
ohh7 | In tandem, the infiltration of cytotoxic immune cells providing an anti-tumor response is also dependent on a repertoire of chemokines and chemokine receptors. The infiltration of CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells has been shown to have high prognostic value and it is mainly guided by CXCR3, which binds the CXCL9 and CXCL10 ligands in the tumor microenvironment234 (Figure 1). Additionally, conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), namely, Batf3+ cDC1s, have been shown to be the main DC subtype responsible for taking up dead tumor cells and cross-prime T cells, and their function largely depends on trafficking to the tumor by XCR1235,236. The exclusivity of XCR1 expression on cDC1s may make it an ideal target for boosting the dendritic cell antigen presentation response.
vbni | Many by-products of tumor cell metabolism are ligands that bind GPCRs, suggesting that they may also dictate the success of cancer immunotherapies. More specifically, studies have shown that lipid compounds, nucleosides (adenosine), and prostaglandins, some of the main products of ATP breakdown and inflammation, bind GPCRs to suppress cytotoxic function of immune cells237,238. As our understanding of normal and aberrant GPCR signalling deepens, assessing levels of bioactive GPCR ligands, in addition to chemokine and chemokine receptor expression could also help guide clinical strategies. For example, increased CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 are associated with improved survival, and are part of an interferon-induced gene expression

sk5m | Tumor-immune interactions are increasingly becoming the target of therapeutic agents intended to break the cross-talk that enables cancer progression. Currently, there are several therapeutics targeting chemokine receptors such CXCR4, CCR2 and CCR4, and the adenosine-binding A2AR receptor (ADORA2A) being explored for the treatment of cancer240,241 (Figure 1). For example, mogamulizumab, an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody targeting CCR4 is being used for the treatment of lymphomas as monotherapy and is being tested in combination with other treatments242. Targeting GPCRs for their immunomodulatory functions in cancer present an exciting and promising field that has the potential to revolutionize how cancer is treated in the future.
qws8 | GPCRs and Tumor Promoting Inflammation
877u | Chronic inflammation has been consistently linked to cancer. In particular, prostaglandins (PG) and specifically prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) are key mediators of inflammation, generated by cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes from arachidonic acid243,244. Binding of PGE2 to their cognate GPCRs, EP1-4 (PTGER1-4), induces inflammatory responses tightly linking GPCR-driven signalling to inflammation that is well established to contribute to tumor development and progression (Figure 1). COX2 mediated production of PGs, in particular PGE2 has been found to promote tumorigenesis in a broad range of cancer types, with a prominent role in gastrointestinal cancers245-247. In the context of colorectal cancer, increased expression of PGE2 has been found to drive polyp formation, proliferation and cell motility248. This has been suggested in part, to be due to PGE2-driven activation of ß-catenin, which may synergize with APC inactivation commonly found in colon cancer133,249,250. COX-2 and PGE2 driven expression of pro-angiogenic chemokines can further enhance the tumor growth and progression251,252. Chronic inflammation, via COX2 overexpression, can also lead to immune suppression and promote tumor growth (see above) 253-256
rzhj | ente
bfax | Overexpression of COX-2 itself has been shown to be sufficient to induce tumorigenesis and invasiveness in various models257,258. Conversely, there is strong epidemiological data linking decreased mortality for colorectal carcinoma patients taking NSAIDs, which are inhibitors of both COX-1 and COX-2132,259. Aligned with this, COX inhibitors are being explored in multiple human clinical trials for cancer prevention and as an adjuvant therapy, and have shown promising results in colorectal cancer and other cancer types 260-262.

o7qm | GPCRs and Cancer Metastasis
d52l | Migration and metastasis of cancer cells are highly coordinated processes that are tightly regulated by numerous signalling and transcriptional events263. Signalling through G protein- coupled chemokine receptors is central to many of these processes and consequently, has been widely implicated in driving several aspects of cancer metastasis. Upon binding of their chemokine ligands, chemokine receptors (CXCRs) can stimulate interaction, migration and trafficking of both immune and cancer cells within and between tissues in the body4,264. Both chemokines and bioactive lipids can also induce the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by tumor and immune cells to facilitate tumor cell extravasation 231,244,265-267
qlbb | Chemokine receptor-ligand dynamics locally within the tumor microenvironment and more broadly, in a systemic fashion can strongly influence tumor behaviour. These dynamics can drive dysregulated autocrine and paracrine signalling loops in cancer collectively referred to as oncocrine signalling52,264. Interestingly, chemokine receptors and ligands are often aberrantly expressed at common sites of metastasis, driving tissue tropism during metastatic spread268. This has been well studied in the context of breast cancer, where it has been found that the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR7 are overexpressed269 (Figure 1). Interestingly, their respective ligands, CXCL12/SDF-1 and CCL21 are highly expressed in the main sites of breast cancer metastasis, such as bone marrow and lung, driving the metastatic profile of this cancer269. Indeed, CXCR4/SDF-1 signalling, has been found to potently drive breast cancer migration and metastasis187,270-272 (Figure 1). This signalling axis is so potent that tumoral expression of CCR7 is one of the most prominent predictors of metastasis and poor prognosis in several different cancer types268. Numerous other chemokine and chemokine receptor dynamics have been found to impact metastasis in different settings, including CCR9, CCR10, and CXCR5, in addition to playing complementary and significant roles in driving inflammation in the tumor microenvironment52,273,274 (Figure 1).

hy0l | Targeting CXCR4/SDF-1 signalling using pharmacological inhibitors such as plerixafor, which is an FDA approved CXCR4 antagonist for the treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple myeloma, has shown to be effective in numerous cancer types, supporting the therapeutic potential of targeting this signalling axis275,276. In addition to the well-established role for CXCRs in metastasis, other classes of GPCRs have also been extensively shown to act as metastatic drivers, including PARs, LPAR, and S1PRs, and this list will likely expand as we gain a better understanding of GPCR-driven signalling networks 266,277-280

b7cq | Concomitant with this, there is mounting evidence supporting the role of GPCRs as mediators of the oncocrine signalling networks driving tumor growth and neural innervation, particularly in prostate and stomach cancers281,282. For example, activation of the ß2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) by adrenaline and noradrenaline has been found to promote secretion of nerve growth factor (NGF) by both cancerous and pre-cancerous cells283 (Figure 1). Release of NGF and other neurotrophins potently promote axonogenesis and subsequent tumor innervation, which establishes a paracrine signalling axis via the secretion of noradrenaline by nerves in the tumor microenvironment. This creates a dynamic feed-forward signalling mechanism by acting on cancer cells, in turn, stimulating their growth, promoting resistance to therapy, and reinforcing the expression of NGF284. The autocrine activation of muscarinic receptors is a similar oncocrine signalling axis in prostate and other cancers285,286. Enhanced secretion of acetylcholine leads to aberrant activation of the M3 muscarinic receptor (CHRM3), which has been shown to drive cancer cell proliferation and migration287,288. Aligned with this, amplification or gain of the M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors have recently been found to correlate with worse progression free survival in prostate cancer patients, and is more frequent in castration-resistant prostate cancers, which are significantly more challenging to treat compared to hormone-sensitive tumors289. Strikingly, activation of M1 and M3 signalling has recently been found to induce castration- resistant growth of prostate cancer cells, through the activation of a conserved FAK-YAP signalling axis289. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK was found to prevent YAP activation and castration-resistant growth, representing a promising therapeutic strategy against innervation- driven castration-resistance growth of prostate cancer289.

qecd | GPCRs and Tumor Angiogenesis
1o7p | Stimulation of angiogenesis is a key component of cancer progression for solid tumors. Angiogenic factors released by the tumor, including prostaglandins and thrombin, often act on GPCRs in the stroma and surrounding endothelial cells, such as S1PR (S1PR1-5), PAR1 (F2R), and CXCR4-7, to trigger stimulation of angiogenic mediators such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)290-295 (Figure 1). Thrombin-mediated stimulation of PAR2, for example, induces expression and release of VEGF, increased vascular permeability, and cleavage of fibrinogen to create a favourable environment for vascularization267,296-298 EP3 stimulation on endothelial cells in particular, can stimulate production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade extracellular matrix proteins, enabling neovascularization265. Release of chemokines such as CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5 can act similarly on the stroma in addition to recruiting immune cells to drive angiogenic growth226,244,268

bgre | In particular, interleukin 8 (IL8), encoded by CXCL8 and known to bind CXCR1 and CXCR2, is a potent pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory chemokine that can be released from the tumor, the stroma, and from neutrophils, which together can create a robust feed-forward mechanism to elicit angiogenesis228,299 (Figure 1).
57lp | These dynamics are typically fine-tuned processes with robust responses induced by minute expression of signalling factors. As such, it is no surprise that tumor cells must co-opt these complex signalling networks to stimulate vascularization and drive cancer progression. Anti- VEGF treatment using the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab is commonly incorporated into cancer treatment approaches300. Moreover, co-targeting the apelin receptor APLNR in addition to VEGF blockade has shown to be a promising strategy to improve antiangiogenic therapies, particularly in glioblastoma, where APLNR has been shown to have a proangiogenic role301,302 (Figure 1). The dependency of tumors on vascularization, and the centrality of GPCRs to several of aspects of angiogenesis have made them an attractive target for the cancer therapy toolbox303. Inhibition of PAR1, CXCR2, CXCR4, and angiotensin receptors AGTR1 and AGTR2 have shown promising results and are all under current investigation as antiangiogenic cancer therapeutics304 (Figure 1). Targeting GPCRs in combination with anti-VEGF drugs may be an effective strategy to extend the clinical efficacy of each treatment alone by preventing the development of drug resistance and bridging the gap for patients with refractory cancer types.
ukth | GPCRs and Genome Instability
kpvt | DNA damage and repair mechanisms underly the ability of cells to acquire genetic alterations that can drive cancer initiation and progression. One exciting emerging field suggests that GPCRs and their regulated signalling systems can functionally participate in DNA damage response and repair systems. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), for example, has been shown to mediate enhanced survival and mitigate chemotherapeutic and radiation-induced DNA damage in the intestinal epithelium via engagement of LPA1 (LPAR1), and LPA2 (LPAR2) receptors305. LPA2 in particular has a potent pro-survival effect against gastrointestinal radiation-induced injury by regulating DNA damage response and repair pathways306,307 (Figure 1). Damage to the intestinal epithelium is a frequent and dose-limiting complication of common chemo- and radio-therapies. While exogenous LPA is rapidly processed and metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract limiting its activity, synthetic and metabolically stable LPA mimetics may be used as protective agents to promote gastrointestinal integrity during chemo- and radio-therapy306.

d0ik | CXCR4, best-studied for its role in metastasis and modulation of the tumor microenvironment, has also been found to regulate cell survival in ovarian cancer. Blockade of CXCR4 with a small peptide antagonist was not only found to inhibit metastasis but induced ovarian cancer cell death by weakening DNA damage checkpoints and leading to mitotic catastrophe308. The CXCR4/CXCL12 signalling axis has also been shown to protect hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from oxidative stress injury by reducing mitochondrial reactive oxidative species (ROS) and subsequent genotoxic stress309.
