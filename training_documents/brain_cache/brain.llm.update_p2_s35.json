        "content": "uodj | of Massachusetts Medical School. The courses included physician- and self-referred individuals from across New England who were seeking stress reduction. Individuals were included in the study if they self-reported as physically and psychologically healthy and not taking any medications. Further inclusion criteria were as follows: no meditation classes in the past six months, no more than four classes in the past five years, or ten classes in their lifetime; twenty-five to fifty-five years old; no contraindications for MRI scanning (i.e., metallic implants, claustrophobia); commitment to attend all eight classes and perform the prescribed daily homework. Eighteen healthy, right-handed individuals were enrolled in the study, eight male and ten female, with a mean age of thirty-seven point eight nine years (S.D.: four point zero four years). Due to discomforts during the first MRI scanning session, two participants did not return for the second session. The resulting sample consisted of six male and ten female participants with a mean age of thirty-eight years (S.D.: four point one years). Ethnicities were as follows: thirteen Caucasians, one Asian, one African American, and one multi-ethnic. Participants had an average of seventeen point seven years of education (S.D.: one point nine years). Reimbursement for study participation was a discounted MBSR course fee.\nk16v | The control sample consisted of seventeen participants (eleven male and six female) with a mean age of thirty-nine years (S.D.: nine point two years) and an average of seventeen point three years of education (S.D.: one point eight years). Ethnicities were as follows: thirteen Caucasians, two Asians, two African American, and one Hispanic. The groups did not differ in age (t equals twenty-two point three equals zero point five six; P equals zero point five eight), or education (t equals thirty equals negative zero point five six, P equals zero point five eight). The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Massachusetts General Hospital and the University of Massachusetts Medical School, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. A previous publication that investigated neural correlates of changes in perceived stress included data from this sample.\nb2lm | Two point two. Intervention\nti7f | The MBSR program has been described extensively elsewhere. Briefly, it consists of eight weekly group meetings lasting two and a half hours each, plus one full day (six and a half hours) during week six of the course. Formal mindfulness training exercises aim at developing the capacity for mindfulness (awareness of present-moment experiences with a compassionate, non-judgmental stance) and include a body scan, mindful yoga, and sitting meditation. During the body scan attention is sequentially guided through the entire body, observing with non-judgmental awareness the sensations in each region and ending with an awareness of the body \"as a complete whole\". The mindful yoga typically contains gentle stretching exercises and slow movements that are often coordinated with the breath, with emphasis placed on bringing full awareness to the moment-to-moment experience and a non-harming attitude towards the body. Participants are encouraged to investigate what feels appropriate for themselves and to honor their body's limitations. Sitting meditation practices typically begin with awareness of the sensations of breathing, then evolve to include awareness of different modalities (such as sounds, sight, taste, other body sensations, thoughts and emotions). Later, emphasis is given to open awareness meditation, where the field of awareness is expanded to include anything that appears in consciousness, or a simple awareness of one's presence in the here and now.\noksu | Participants received audio recordings containing forty-five-minute guided mindfulness exercises (body scan, yoga, and sitting meditation) that they were instructed to practice daily at home. To facilitate the integration of mindfulness into daily life, they were also taught to practice mindfulness informally in everyday activities such as eating, walking, washing the dishes, or taking a shower. During classes, the formal mindfulness exercises were practiced, questions relating to the practice of mindfulness in everyday life were clarified and didactic instruction was given on using mindfulness for coping with stress in daily life. Historically, MBSR participants have reported a wide range\nwtow | of home practice compliance and for this reason study participants recorded the amount of time they spent engaged in mindfulness exercises each day.\no22k | Two point three. Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire\nnwfz | The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire is a thirty-nine-item scale to measure five factors of mindfulness: Observing (attending to or noticing internal and external stimuli, such as sensations, emotions, cognitions, sights, sounds, and smells), describing (noting or mentally labeling these stimuli with words), acting with awareness (attending to one's current actions, as opposed to behaving automatically or absent-mindedly), non-judging of inner experience (refraining from evaluation of one's sensations, cognitions, and emotions) and non-reactivity to inner experience (allowing thoughts and feeling to come and go, without attention getting caught up in them). Responses to the items are given on a five-point Likert-type scale (one equals never or very rarely true, five equals very often or always true). The five subscales have shown adequate to good internal consistency. Usable data from both time-points were obtained from fourteen MBSR and fourteen control participants.\nnvfy | Two point four.
