        "content": "ehya | Emotional Expectations\nj4z8 | Q: Why does a Sufi group go on, sometimes for years, reading books, meeting and apparently not getting anything done, without any measurement of its progress, and without a sense of how things are going?\npe03 | A: Such a group has to 'wear out' emotional expectations. It also has to provide circumstances in which the irrelevant and customary associations, characteristics brought in from other systems may be displayed and observed, so that everyone can see what is central and what is not. If the members of the group are not seeing these things, it is not a Sufic group at all. Much of its visible work is that of a 'preparatory group'. This does not mean that it might not be extremely important: for where else are you going to obtain this opportunity of living through and observing your reactions and those of others, outside of social groupings where the lessons are either obscured or twisted to provide superficial, tribal-type, conclusions?\n6yda | If you refer again to the published narratives which illustrate the coming-together of people, the effect of interchanges to show up unworthy or irrelevant behavior or the uselessness of facile interpretation, you will find the material against which you can check the behavior of people in such a group, if you are in one.\nq2fe | The main characteristic displayed by the questioner is that of a person who wants something ('progress', or 'a sense of how things are going') without carrying on an active observation and digesting of experience happening in and to the group. In traditional terminology familiar to people of all cultures (used in this instance not as a reproach but as a technique) we have here too much greed ahead of capacity, too much dissatisfaction due to greed and false premises, too much laziness which gives rise to a person being a potential victim of an exploiter who might appear and promise automatic progress without effort or right alignment.\n70pp | Anyone who seeks to escape from his inherited culture's moral\n60bu | demands need not think that they may have no function as exercises. He has to re-learn the other possible functions in traditional principles, and he can do this through more study of narrative and illustrative materials and in participation in very preliminary group work, through more of such activity, not less.\nvkzu | Finally, individual and sub-group progress is not always visible to all participants on demand.\nuynl | OBSESSED WITH THE WORLD\naz42 | Contrast this approach with that of the mechanical religionists, who merely cultivate obsession. Fariduddin Attar gives a tale of the great woman Sufi Rabia, when she was ill. A certain scholar came to see her and, as he sat beside her bed, he repeated again and again arguments about the evils of the world.\nj06k | But Rabia could see through this and told him that he obviously loved the world very much. People speak again and again of things which they love, whether they do so in pleasant or unpleasant terms. To be attached to something, favorably or otherwise, is the basic condition. If you had no truck with the world,' Rabia reminded the man, \"you would say nothing about it, favorable or otherwise.'\nx0fk | Jumping to Conclusions\n1wgb | ASSUMPTIONS can stand between the student and what he might learn, if these preconceptions are not correct or if they are not functional.\nfh0l | The assumptions that spiritual paths should take this or that form, should be followed by this or that type of person, should belong to certain kinds of recognizable institution, etc., these ideas not only block learning - they often transform it into a search for the expected diversion, and therefore, in reality if not in appearance, towards becoming a part of the entertainment industry.\n3jj5 | To connect with people at the outside edge, so to speak, Eastern sages have grown beards and worn turbans; to point up the jumping-to-conclusions syndrome, others have behaved like lunatics; to alert those who are most teachable, yet others have not compromised with expectation to any real extent. And frauds and adventurers, to exploit the only-too-obvious assumptions, have never been slow to accord with them-to tell people what they want to hear.\nak6r | If you cannot question your assumptions, you must stand up to be counted among the people of whom some may be right: but who include a large number of people, conditioned to bigotry, who must be wrong.\nyv80 | Perhaps worth thinking about is the illustrative test which was recently applied to over two hundred people who had been attracted to a certain spiritual teaching. They were given a number of statements and literary extracts and asked which of them were genuine and which not. Over eighty-five percent of these people got the answers wrong: they identified the spurious documents and statements as genuine.\nwkav | This indicated at least two things: (one) that these people, for the most part, had not been attracted to the teaching through any ability to discern its legitimacy; and (two) that since most of them had rejected the real materials, the likelihood was that they would eventually reject the teaching materials and procedures of the\nk141 | genuine school, since they displayed an overwhelming appreciation of the spurious as 'authentic'.\n18xq | One of the commonest assumptions among people who only imagine what a real teaching might be, is connected with 'initiation'.\n7ske | All over the world you will find people willing and anxious to initiate others into spiritual schools.\nfdgg | But, as the procedure is still preserved among the Sufis, initiation - the pledge of fealty to a teacher, only takes place 'several years after his admission to the Order of Dervishes'. This is because, until the student knows enough, and until he has learnt something, he cannot truly commit himself to the deep studies. To get him to engage himself to follow a path while he is still not capable of it is a real mark of ignorance or imposture.\nva8j | THE CHRISTIAN IN MECCA\nw7s7 | On the other hand, someone may be ready to learn and to understand when he is regarded by externalist tests as being quite unsuitable. The great Shibli one day made this very clear, in a story which contains several interesting features.\nxy9h | Shibli announced one day, in Baghdad, that he wanted a thousand dirhams, for shoes for the poor, for the Pilgrimage to Mecca. A certain Christian offered the money, providing that he would be allowed to accompany the caravan.\njuud | Shibli told him that only Moslems could make the journey. So the Christian offered to come as a pack-animal: from whom no affirmation of faith was required. So they set off, with the Christian in harness. At each stage he cleared the ground for the pilgrims.\nhnsd | When they arrived at the Great Mosque, Shibli told the Christian that he was not permitted to enter the precincts of the Kaaba. The Christian prayed that he might be allowed to enter. Then a voice was heard, inviting the Christian in ...\n972g | Jumping to conclusions is one of the greatest barriers to learning, though not to actions which make people imagine that they have verified something or made discoveries.\n1410 | HOW TO INCREASE SPEED\njw0n | Mulla Nasrudin went one day to a shipyard. Seeing a fire, which he had not expected to be associated with the sea, he asked a workman what it was for.\nnd8s | 'We make tar' said the other man, 'and cover the cracks in the underside of the boat. That makes the vessel go faster.'\nbv75 | The Mulla went straight home and made a bonfire. Then he tied up his donkey and melted some tar in a pan. As soon as he brought the smoking tar near the animal, it broke loose and ran like the wind.\nqbo6 | 'It works all right' said Mulla Nasrudin.\nkio0 | The Rosary and the Robe\ntxfz | Q: What is the origin of the belief that the 'holy man' is, for example, constantly practising austerities, should be dressed in rags, avoids contamination, and so on?",
