You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

5zyf | The genomics-predicted value (GPV) of flesh firmness retain- ability of 473 hybrids and GPV of flesh crispness retainability of 394 hybrids were shown in Tables S8 and S10, respectively. Relatively high prediction accuracy was obtained as 0.5712 and 0.6585 for the retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively (Figure 6b,c). The fivefold cross-validation exhibited an average prediction accuracy of 0.5541 and 0.6018 for flesh firmness and crispness retainability, respectively (Tables S12 and S13). In a simulative selection, when flesh firmness retainability GPV criterion was set as 5.0 months, the selection rate was 2.54% and the efficiency was 100% (12/12), which indicated that the observed phenotype value (OPV) of all the 12 selected hybrids was equal to or longer than 5.0 months (Table S14). When the GPV criterion for flesh crispness retainability was set as 5.0 months, the selection rate was 3.48% and the efficiency was 64.29% (Table S15).
9own | Discussion
bqfb | Flesh firmness retainability and crispness retainability are the critical properties affecting fruit cold storability. The heritability of flesh firmness and crispness retainability was as high as 83.85% and 83.64%, respectively, which was slightly higher than the estimate (70.0%) for firmness and crispness at harvest or after two month cold storage (Bink et al., 2014; Mckay et al., 2011). Flesh firmness and crispness retention can be prolonged if the initial values of firmness and crispness at harvest are high or if the flesh softening rates during storage are low, or both (Costa, 2015; Johnston et al., 2001; Nybom et al., 2013). In this study, unlike flesh firmness and crispness at harvest, the segregation of flesh firmness and crispness retainability did not displayed Gaussian distribution, a large proportion of hybrids lost accept- able flesh firmness and crispness one month post-harvest.
wwdt | According to the QTL effects in tomato, flesh firmness loss was not predicted by firmness at harvest (Aurand et al., 2012). The phenotype correlations between the initial flesh firmness/crisp- ness and their retainability were also relatively low in this study. In a two-year trial, apple fruit firmness after storage correlated positively with both firmness at harvest and changes in firmness during storage; however, no obvious correlation was observed between changes in firmness and the initial firmness at harvest (McClure et al., 2018). A major QTL for apple fruit firmness retention after storage was identified on chromosome 10; however, a gene encoding ERF (MDP0000855671) was predicted as the candidate rather than the frequently detected MdPG1 in other populations, indicating that the genetics of the trait firmness retention might differ from that of initial firmness at harvest (McClure et al., 2018). In a MetaQTL analysis, of the six MetaQTLs for apple fruit texture attributes, two (MetaQTL6.1 and MetaQTL10.1) were for both firmness at harvest and firmness after two months cold storage, one (MetaQTL10.2) for both softening and firmness after two months, and three for solely softening (MetaQTL5.1), firmness at harvest (MetaQTL15.3), and firmness after two months (MetaQTL15.1), respectively (Costa, 2015). This indicated that these three texture attributes were mutually related but partially independent. High initial flesh firmness or crispness is necessary but insufficient for long-term firmness and crispness retainability. In this study, several new

2e62 | The four functional markers, MdACS1, MdACO1, MdPG1 and an expansin gene, MdExp7, for fruit firmness and crispness in apple have been well studied to dissect phenotypic variability among cultivars and hybrids (Costa et al., 2005a, 2008; Harada et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2009). Unfortunately, the empirical predictive power of these four functional markers were limited, with 15% of the observed variation in initial firmness and 18% in softening rate; therefore, their large-scale use for MAS was doubtful (Nybom et al., 2013). The genotypes of commonly used markers on MdACS1 (MD15G1302200) and MdACO1 (MD15G1205100) did not segregate in the 'Zisai Pearl' x 'Red

RNA-seq data showed that the expression levels of MdACO1, MdACO2, MdACO3 and some ethylene response genes were higher in flesh firmness and crispness unretainable type I hybrids.
cb7r | Flesh firmness and crispness are usually measured simultane- ously; however, they should be two closely relevant but clearly distinct texture attributes (Nybom et al., 2013). One evidence for the close relatedness was that the phenotypic correlation coefficient between the flesh firmness retainability and crispness retainability was as high as 0.8024, which was inconsistent with the previous report (Hardner et al., 2016). Another evidence was that the overlapping QTLs on chromosomes 3 and 16 associated with flesh firmness and crispness retainability. The third evidence

hd35 | was that variations in MdERF3 and MdERF118 affected both flesh firmness and crispness. On the other hand, retainability of flesh firmness was likely a prerequisite for flesh crispness retainability. Additionally, many QTLs were identified independently for flesh firmness retainability and crispness retainability, which manifested the distinctness of these two flesh texture attributes.
2zpk | The majority of consumers prefer crisp apples to firm ones (Bonany et al., 2014; Hoehn et al., 2008; Hong et al., 2018; Yue et al., 2013). Apple cultivars with relatively high flesh crispness but low firmness, such as 'Honeycrisp', are currently commer- cially successful and are expected to remain so in the future (Mckay et al., 2011). The apple expansin genes, MdEXPDCA1, MdEXPA2, MdEXPA3 and MdEXPA8 were considered markers for flesh crispness retention during cold storage (Costa et al., 2005b; Trujillo et al., 2012). We observed that the expression of ß-Gal genes, MdBGLs and MdBGLU, was significantly high in flesh firmness and crispness unretainable hybrids, which was consistent with the results of a previous report (Wei et al., 2012). These data indicated that flesh crispness retainability is a more crucial fruit quality attribute than flesh firmness retainability and that genomics-assisted selection for good flesh crispness retain- ability may also inadvertently select for good flesh firmness retainability.
epu7 | Unlike the QTLs on chromosomes 10 and 15 for fruit firmness at harvest, chromosomes 3 and 16 were 'QTL hotspots' for apple flesh firmness and crispness retainability (Figure S5a,b), which is consistent with the results of previous reports (Bink et al., 2014; Di Guardo et al., 2017). The markers SNP26684680 and SNP34732032 on chromosome 3, and SNP38573461, SNP3059129, and SNP9127269 on chromosome 16 accounted for relatively large effects for both flesh firmness and crispness retainability (Figure S4; Tables S9 and S11).

ma93 | 2004; Gwanpua et al., 2014; Longhi et al., 2013; Wakasa et al., 2006). In addition to these functional genes, many ethylene receptors and signalling genes were involved in regulating fruit firmness, such as MdEIN3, MdERF1, MdERF2 and MdERF4 (Lee et al., 2012; Li et al., 2017). Here, we observed that several ethylene-responsive genes were up-regulated in firmness and crispness retainable apples (Figure S6). As expected, the allelic variations on QTL-identified MdERF3 and MdERF118 were detected and were validated to affect flesh firmness and crispness retainability (Figure 6a). These two allelic variations were consid- ered diagnostic markers, which is consistent with QTL-derived ERF genes for apple fruit firmness retention (McClure et al., 2018). MdERF3 contains an ethylene-responsive element-binding factor- associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif, and thus may function as negative regulator of MdPGLR3, MdPME2 and MdACO4 expression (Kagale and Rozwadowsld, 2011). MdERF118 also inhibited MdPGLR3 and MdACO4 expression by directly binding to their promoters; however, MdERF118 does not contain an EAR motif, which is similar to SlERF6 in tomato. SlERF6 negatively regulates fruit maturity and does not contain the EAR motif (Lee et al., 2012). The protein-protein interaction between MdERF3 and MdERF118 rendered the genetic variation network more complex (Figure 6d).
c6hh | GAP models for apple flesh firmness and crispness retainability were developed and were efficiently used in simulative selection. Fivefold cross-validation showed the prediction accuracy was 0.5541 and 0.6018 for the retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively. The predictability of these models was not only better than that of the activator-depleted substrate model (van der Sman and Sanders, 2012), but also better than that of pure GS by ridge regression BLUP, the accuracy of which was more than 0.4 for apple firmness after storage and was 0.08-0.45 for changes in fruit firmness (McClure et al., 2018). The improvement in predictability of the GAP models may be attributed to the taking into account non-additive allelic effects.
