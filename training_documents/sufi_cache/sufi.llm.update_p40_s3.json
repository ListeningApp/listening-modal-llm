There is even the circumstance that people who think that they can teach, are unconcerned about the learning side.\n2xj0 | HOW A LANGUAGE WAS TAUGHT\n567t | Only the other day I found a delightful example of this mentality when talking to a language teacher. He said: 'I have a marvellous system, all my own. I taught it to a man who enrolled as a private pupil. I taught him absolutely perfectly.'\nsk0p | I said, in the usual rhetorical way people use in general con- versations: 'So he knows the language very well now, does he?'\nvwq7 | 'Not a word,' said the teacher. 'I taught him perfectly, but he just would not learn,'\nbeyn | The Ceiling\njwlq | Q: Can you give me an example, in parallel or parable terms, of the area in which Sufi teaching operates, and how it is done?\nf8ht | A: Our teaching speaks of, and exists partly in, 'another world', a 'higher realm', a 'different dimension'.\nq2it | Here is a parallel of what this means, in one significant way, and what the object of the Teaching is.\npiqi | THE UNKNOWN CEILING\nmjsy | Suppose we have a house with walls, ceilings, floors, and we are inside that house. Let us say that through long-established custom, people can touch and deal with only the floors and walls. If someone were to walk in and say: 'Look at the ceiling,' the people would be incapable of doing so-rather like a child which often cannot see something, certainly cannot observe it, unless it has been demonstrated to it.\n01g9 | Suppose, further, that the custom of generations was to hang things on walls and not to have anything on the ceilings. Objects on the ceilings might then be 'invisible' to the people at large.\n7cm1 | So it is with our teaching. We frequently and abundantly assert that people do not think things through, that they make assump- tions (such as 'there is no ceiling') which they do not attempt to verify. But, like the intelligent man who would be trying to point out the existence of the ceilings, we do more than constantly draw attention back to the theoretical postulate ('there may be ceilings').\noyk6 | We provide, in instructional courses, meetings, contact with teachers, observation materials, exercises, call them what you like, the practical means to establish and maintain for the community which is being addressed the experience of the existence of 'ceilings'.\n3qp5 | WHERE TO FIND TRUTH\nguux | Careful preparation is necessary before people can perceive some- thing which is there all the time. Saadi of Shiraz rightly referred to this in poetic terms when he said: 'The Adept sees that same thing in a camel/as in the beautiful ones of China or Chagil.'\nfhkp | Again, by the application of a certain concentration capacity, some people induce others to externalise their inner thoughts, as a teaching method. These thoughts betray the character and opera- tion of the secondary self, the false personality which, although enabling people to handle many of the circumstances of life, has as its objective the maintenance of itself: and not the progress of the individual beyond quite narrow and shallow limits.\nur19 | WORKING ON THE 'COMMANDING SELF'\nytow | This Commanding Self (in Sufi classical literature styled the Nafs-i-Ammard), is manifested by reactions, hopes and fears and various opinions and preoccupations.\nozjl | By bringing its operation into view, its limitations, distortions and peculiarities can be observed, both by the individual himself and by observers. This 'self is actually largely what most people imagine to be their own personalities, their own and only selves; and it is interposed between objective reality and the real self, the essence, of the individual, whose realisation is the purpose of Sufi study.\nxux5 | Sometimes the manifestation of this self is characterised by ideas or behaviour attributed to other people, as can happen in a dream. One modern technician with knowledge of such things has remarked: 'It is as if the mental computer has been induced electronically to repeat a part of its programming ..\n53mt | The reverse effect is also possible, when the Teacher [Murshid] imparts to the mind of the disciple [Murid] concepts which can reach the essence and which therefore cannot be conveyed by the ordinary methods employed in communicating with the conven- tional self.\nowo1 | THE PRECIOUS PEARL\nzz70 | People have tried to cultivate this capacity for purposes of per- sonal ambition and, since this is indeed partially possible, its methodology is carefully protected.\nslcr | Such works as Ibn Arabi's Durrat al-Fakhha, 'Precious Pearl' give numerous instances both of this mechanism and of how it tends to be independent of what people customarily regard as systematic operation. It can, for example, arise unbidden. It works in people whom one would not immediately suspect of possessing it-because of our usual assumptions about any such capacity. It may not operate at all. Sometimes it is willed, sometimes not. On occasions it functions whether the faculty is being used for 'good' (socially acceptable) purposes or not. Traditionally, it can also work for what seem to be trivial purposes, as has been noted with similar extrasensory activity in more recent Western studies. These facts can make it all the more interesting, since such characteristics are not in accord with the usual folkloric beliefs about such matters and tend to lack inherent relationships with occultism, more directly resembling more modern communications phenomena, though in a very refined form.\nz9at | UNDERSTANDING WITH THE HEART\n7dov | The results of the encounter with the Sufi may or may not be at the time or place desired by the learner. They may or may not follow immediately. Other things may have to happen before the full benefit of the meeting can be perceived.\nznos | One of the more obvious factors at work in such relationships is pointed out in the tale in my book The Dermis Probe, entitled 'Pomegranates'.\nbngy | WORK AND WORK\nxja2 | Q: Why do Sufis expect people to do physical and mental work; why do they so often have establishments which have to be kept going by labour?\nb9a5 | A: I first came across this question in myself, when I was living in a Sufi settlement where everyone had to work. There were so many important and influential - and moneyed - people who visited the place that I used to wonder why our Teacher did not 'professionalise' things, and employ gardeners and so on, rather than having so many people doing things that some of them were manifestly not accustomed to doing.\nthi8 | I asked him one evening when he called for questions: There are people constantly offering large sums of money to us. Would it not give more opportunities for study if we used this money to run the establishment?'\nentm | DEVELOPING ONE'S OWN UNDERSTANDING\nknql | As is the custom among Sufis, he told me to go away and find the answers myself, and then to come back when I had them, to see whether I was only asking frivolous questions. So I spent three or four weeks on the subject.\nez57 | First I wrote down all the possible reasons I could think of, then I wandered about looking at the way in which things were being done, studying life through life, until I came up with the answers. They were these, and by giving them to you I am doing you no favour, since if you had worked them out yourself you would have gained more. As it is, I will have to give you the opportunity of learning something equivalent by some other pro- cedure :",
