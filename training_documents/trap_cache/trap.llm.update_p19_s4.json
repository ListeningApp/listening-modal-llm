Moreover, some politicians use forbearance (nonenforcement against informal practices such as squatting and street vending) as an electoral appeal, and those in the informal sector come to view these forbearance benefits as a significant part of their perceived \"welfare\" system. Forbearance is viewed by poor voters as a better indicator of the class sympathies of candidates than are promises of traditional welfare benefits (like education), and hence it further undermines the possibilities for constructing a programmatic upgrading coalition. The general point is that several different strategies can incorporate informal workers into electoral politics with promises of benefits not connected to upgrading and in ways that divide formal and informal workers. Dani Rodrik paints a vivid picture of the political consequences of a large, enduring informal sector:\n8qb6 | FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT\nwkbn | Sustained, cohesive support from a broad segment of big business is likely a necessary condition for high-cost, long-term investment in upgrading institutions. However, business in most MI countries is structurally fractured along a dimension that fragments interests on key issues related to upgrading policies, such as education. The cleavage-absent in all large earlier industrializers-is between foreign and domestic firms. The stock of foreign direct investment in large MI countries is not high when compared to the stocks in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries today, but the more relevant comparison is between MI countries in the twenty-first century (thirty-four percent of gross domestic product) and high-income countries in the twentieth century (four percent of gross domestic product for East Asia and nine percent gross domestic product for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development). The average percentages would have been even lower for high-income countries\nftfg | in the twentieth century, when they were making the transition to high-income. Moreover, multinational corporations are among the largest of big businesses in today's MI countries. In Latin America they usually account for a third to a half of the hundred largest firms. Multinational corporations are especially dominant in the manufacturing sectors of many MI countries, including in our two Southeast Asian cases, Malaysia and Thailand, where they account for thirty-four and thirty-one of the top fifty manufacturing firms, respectively. This typically translates into multinational corporation dominance of manufactured exports and contrasts with the cases of the East Asian high-income \"graduates,\" where domestic firms account for the majority of manufacturing exports. At a minimum, this multinational corporation dominance shuts the largest domestic firms out of manufacturing.\n7xi5 | Of course, market-seeking multinational corporations might be amenable to joining upgrading coalitions, but these firms have technology and marketing advantages derived from home markets that protect them from domestic competitors. Because of their market advantages, they can also afford to pay workers more and poach skilled workers elsewhere, thereby also creating a private solution to the skills problem. Efficiency-seeking multinational corporations operating in global production networks might have stronger interests in joining an upgrading coalition, but they also have other options: solving skills needs internally, relying on affiliated foreign suppliers, or simply moving higher value-added production to a country that already has the desired skills and infrastructure.\nw8r5 | On technology policy in particular, it is hard for foreign and do-\nybik | WORLD POLITICS\ngii5 | mestic firms to find common ground, especially for long-term, costly investments in building up the institutional infrastructure needed for innovation. Although some domestic firms might favor such a push, foreign firms typically do not, as they do most of their research and development in their home countries. When multinational corporations do invest in research and development in developing countries, as they do increasingly in India and China, it is often in the lower technology, more routinized elements of research and development. But multinational corporations invest very little in research and development of any kind in large MI countries and have little interest in paying for costly long-term upgrading for domestic innovation.\nq5eu | In terms of collective action and political engagement, multinational corporations are pretty deficient, as Albert Hirschman first noted decades ago. For one, multinational corporations regularly operate through more direct ties to relevant agencies, such as boards of investment. Multinational corporations also sometimes create separate associations, such as the ubiquitous American Chambers of Commerce, or split off separate associations in particular sectors (for example, mining in Chile or banking in Argentina). Moreover, some prominent associations exclude foreign firms. For example, in Mexico the exclusive Mexican Council of Business Men, a council of the top forty or so business groups, had no multinational corporation members, and in Turkish Industry and Business Association, the main association for big business in Turkey, less than ten percent of close to six hundred members were from multinational corporations. In turn, governments, when establishing councils to meet with business, often exclude foreign firms. Or multinational corporations opt not to participate in tripartite meetings, something that often occurs in Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries. In addition, multinational corporations usually have further incentives to disengage from politics because they want to maintain a low profile (and stay out of government crosshairs) and/or because expat managers may know little about how best to engage. In sum, even were they more interested, multinational corporations would make poor coalition partners.\n```",
