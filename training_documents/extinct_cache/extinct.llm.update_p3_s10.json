        "content": "xxr8 | He asked whether species or nature more broadly are valuable beyond their potential usefulness for humans. What Sylvan's famous case suggests is that the permissibility of extinguishing species - as he argued, allowed by traditional Western ethical systems that conceive of nature as something to be used by humans as they please - is an example of what he called 'human chauvinism', now\nrl4j | better known as 'anthropocentrism'. Sylvan's thought experiment has successively been modified and discussed by many other philosophers such as Mary Ann Warren and Robin Attfield. The latter engaged in this type of argument to scrutinise the possibility of human extinction in the context of nuclear armament and 'ecocatastrophe'. He aimed to show that non-sentient living nature such as trees has morally relevant interests and that causing their extinction by the 'last man' would be morally wrong, even if it would not affect any other humans.\nvz32 | Writing at the same time as Sylvan, Joel Feinberg addressed the ethics of species protection from a different argumentative angle. Because he argued that only human and nonhuman individuals with interests can have rights, he rejected the idea that species have a right to exist. Therefore, he claimed that humans have a duty to protect endangered species, but the ultimate addressees of this duty are future humans, not the species themselves. Likewise, Nicholas Rescher depicted species conservation 'as a quintessential humanitarian task' and John Passmore considered wanton eradication of species to be acts of vandalism.\nncb0 | In brief, very early on, there were opposing opinions about why human-caused extinctions are morally wrong, while there was largely agreement on the issue that anthropogenic extinctions are wrong. The similarity between these different views was that they regard extinction as a loss of value, either for humanity or for the universe as considered from a human-independent perspective. Independently of whether one endorses an anthropocentric, human-focused, or non-anthropocentric rationale for species conservation, both give rise to a range of resulting questions that were formulated in the literature of environmental ethics early on, such as: Are species individual entities or life processes that come to an end with extinction? What are acceptable costs for protection efforts, and relatedly, should all species, even the most harmful ones, be conserved? Are species as collectives more valuable than nonhuman individuals and does that therefore justify the culling of individuals that threaten the existence of native populations?\n8mp0 | Defining extinction\nxjyk | What constitutes an extinction is a complex subject matter. However, for the purpose of ordinary concerns about extinction and for how moral philosophers discuss its moral relevance, most theorists' primary concern lies with anthropogenic species extinctions - while treating 'extinctions' and 'species extinctions' synonymously. Moreover, while many theorists put an emphasis on extinctions on a mass scale, some theorists are also explicitly concerned with the extinction of individual species. Accordingly, there are four conceptual components found in many accounts of the ethics of extinction.\nmt0f | Firstly, there are different ontological positions on the meaning of 'species', that is what a species is, which then also have different\nawab | ethical implications. Moreover, because different kinds of species conservation practices change the genetic makeup of the target species via conventional breeding programmes or synthetic biology and influence their behavior, it is also necessary to consider whether the resulting population still belongs to the same species, which in turn influences whether we consider it extinct or not, and whether that matters morally. Thus, there are different conceptions of species and these impact how extinction is defined.\nixcc | Secondly, the term 'extinction' can also be understood in different ways, which is of ethical relevance because it frames what falls within the ethics of extinction and, in turn, the way extinction is constructed in controversial cases is in itself subject to ethical scrutiny. When speaking about extinctions as something morally problematic, many, not all, authors will refer to 'final' extinctions, if not specified further in works of practical ethics. Thus, an emphasis is put on 'global', all individuals of a species are gone, as opposed to 'local', loss of a population, extinctions. However, because a species can be extinct in several senses of the term, some authors also specifically problematize, for example cases where there still exist some, or even many, living individuals belonging to the species of concern. That is, it is not finally extinct, but it may be 'functionally' extinct. Drawing on the example of the whitebark pine as a case of a functional extinction, Christopher Preston argues in this regard that the concern with this type of extinction is not that you will never see individuals of the taxon again. The concern centers on the anthropogenic reordering of relationships. Not a loss of life, but a loss of arrangement. That is, regarding this type of extinction an emphasis is put on changing ecological relationships rather than on the circumstance whether some individual members of the species are still alive.",
