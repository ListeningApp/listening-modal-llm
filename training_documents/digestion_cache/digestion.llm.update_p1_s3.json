        "content": "ewfp | PG Diploma in Sustainable Aquaculture Module B L five eight zero one: Nutrition\noczy | Topic one - Feeding and digestion - invertebrates\n2ttg | Introduction\nhis3 | In this lecture we will examine feeding and digestion of the two groups of invertebrates that are the most significant in aquaculture: decapod crustaceans and bivalve molluscs. We will also examine the storage of digested nutrients: their composition, location and seasonal variations. The nutrient composition of food will be referred to, this forming a necessary part of understanding digestion and assimilation. These nutrients will be discussed in much greater detail in Topic three, so you may wish to re-read this lecture in the light of knowledge gained later.\nm50z | CRUSTACEANS\nme84 | The most cultured group of decapod crustaceans are shrimp. These can be filter feeders, scavengers and predators; they are classified as herbivores, carnivores and omnivores. In the wild, or in extensive and semi-intensive aquaculture, shrimp eat other species of crustaceans, annelids, molluscs, echinoderms, nematodes, fish tissue, insects, seeds, algae, macrophytes (an aquatic plant that grows in water) vegetable matter and detritus. In extensive and semi-intensive pond-cultured shrimp, the naturally available food organisms can dominate over the externally applied feed.\no56m | One. Feeding\nslz6 | The external feeding appendages, the pereiopods and the mandibles (jaws) are involved in feeding behaviour (Fig. one).\n90k5 | The antennae and antennules are used as feelers or sensory feelers. The maxillipeds are used to rip food apart before it is moved into the mandible where it is crushed and devoured.\n9m8s | Crustaceans detect chemicals produced by food using small cuticular sense organs called sensilla. Two types of sensilla are involved in this process: bimodal sensilla and unimodal sensilla called aesthetascs. Bimodal sensilla contain both mechanoreceptor and chemoreceptor neurones whose dendrites terminate in a pore at the tip of a seta. These organs are present on the body and all appendages. Aesthetascs contain numerous neurones whose branched dendrites fill the lumen of a tube-like seta. They are found only on the outer flagellum of the antennules and provide input into the olfactory lobes of the brain.\n893y | Once food has been identified remotely and the animal has moved adjacent to it, the pereiopods and the mouthparts locate the food via their own chemo- and mechanosensory setae and then grasp, manipulate, crush and transport it to the mouth. Postlarvae may also use their mouthparts to capture suspended particulate food.\nfavz | The sense of taste (gustation) is present in most, if not all, of the crustacean appendages. A substance is tasted by a hair-like hollow structure, the sensillum, that houses gustatory neurones. What distinguishes gustation from olfaction is that in the former, the material requires to be in direct contact with the sensory organ. The mouthparts provide the final check of food quality before ingestion since food that has been accepted by the pereiopods may be subsequently rejected after handling by the mouthparts.\n7szx | Food is masticated by the external, toothed maxillipeds and mandibles before being swallowed. It then enters the cardiac pocket of the stomach via peristaltic waves of the relatively short oesophagus.\nhx9e | Two. Digestive system\nywn2 | The alimentary canal of decapods is a tubular structure, which begins with an anteroventral mouth, runs dorsally along the body and terminates in the anus, located in the base of the telson.\na63r | The digestive system is divided into three distinct regions: foregut, midgut and hindgut. The foregut is lined with a thin cuticle and comprises the mouth, the oesophagus and the stomach. The midgut comprises the intestine and associated organs: the hepatopancreas (digestive gland or midgut gland) and the midgut caeca. The relative length of the midgut varies considerably between decapod groups. The hindgut, like the foregut, is lined with cuticle and forms a muscular rectum that leads to the anus.\ndqvj | Two point one The foregut\nr17u | When the sensory receptors within the oesophagus are stimulated, they cause a rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the oesophageal muscles which move the food into the anterior chamber of the stomach (the cardiac stomach or pocket). The cardiac stomach serves as a storage area, its relative size varying between species. Food is passed from this storage area to the masticating parts of the gastric mill.\n3c47 | The epidermis of the cardiac pocket is associated with the exoskeleton and participates in the periodic moulting process. The epidermis secretes sclerotized, cuticular structures which are often calcified. These structures are moved by individual muscles located outside the stomach wall and receive their own specific innervation. The gastric mill of the cardiac pocket grinds the food into a soup of fine particles. Particles are circulated and undergo further mastication until they are fine enough to pass into the pyloric stomach via the cardiopyloric valve.\ng345 | The pyloric stomach squeezes material through the more dorsal aspects of the pyloric filtering apparatus and final filtration is performed by the more ventral gland filters. This filtration ensures that the hepatopancreas does not become clogged by large particles. In the lobster, such particles need to be less than one micrometer in diameter.\nsvhz | The lining of the stomach, particularly in the pyloric region, is invaginated suggesting that some digestion may take place although transit time is short (under a minute). Macerated food is passed to the midgut where it is further digested and most nutrients are absorbed.\noaen | Two point two The midgut\n5u67 | The intestine of the midgut consists of a simple columnar epithelium which is folded longitudinally and its surface area is increased by the presence of microvilli. Three organs are associated with the midgut: the anterior and posterior midgut caeca and the hepatopancreas (or digestive gland). The midgut caeca consist of blind-ending tubules that connect to the lumen of the midgut. Decapod crustaceans usually possess a pair of anterior caeca that arise laterally, one on either side of the anterior midgut and a single posterior caecum that arises dorsally close to the junction between the midgut and the hindgut. These caeca appear to play only a minor role in digestion and osmoregulation although evidence has suggested that they are significant in the uptake of water during ecdysis. Recent evidence suggests that the caeca are involved in endocrine regulation of feeding behaviour.",
