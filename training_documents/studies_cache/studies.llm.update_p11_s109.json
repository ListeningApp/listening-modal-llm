        "content": "b7cq | A strong integration of SES research with societal issues affirms calls for the development of stronger science-society interfaces to guide research, knowledge cocreation, and decision making. However, as many researchers have recognized, taking a knowledge coproduction approach to understanding SES and supporting policy and decision making can be demanding. Aside from the time required to establish relationships with knowledge partners, particularly when operating in transdisciplinary teams that seek evidence from multiple knowledge platforms, challenges also arise from the inherent methodological pluralism that characterizes the SES research field. Furthermore, if we accept that seeking evidence from multiple knowledge traditions represents a more ethical approach to understanding SES, we have to be cognizant of the fact that much of our current academic knowledge for understanding SES has been generated in the Global North. This\n0b39 | highlights a more general need for developing academic voices from the Global South.\nqecd | Many different methods from a variety of disciplines inform SES research\n1o7p | That methods from many different disciplines are used in SES research is perhaps intuitive, but our study provides a strong empirical validation of this statement, and by virtue of our typology, an accessible overview of the kinds of methods that are used in the field. Our study identified three hundred eleven methods (reduced from an initial list of six hundred thirty-two) that we grouped into twenty-seven categories, or types, of methods that are commonly used in SES research, providing empirical support for the notion of methodological pluralism in SES research.\ncp13 | Within the place-based studies that we analyzed, we found that spatial mapping and analysis, historical profiling and reconstruction, interviews, and futures analysis were most commonly used. The use of these methods may be partly driven by the most common SES research topics, including policy, trade, conservation, adaptation, and land use change because they are the most common methods we found to be used to investigate these topics. Interestingly, interviews and participatory data collection were much more commonly used than ecological field data collection, but this may be because ecological field data collection methods are often not articulated in the abstracts of, for example, papers that assess land use change. Economic and other decision-support methods were also quite widely used, including impact analysis, livelihood and vulnerability analysis, and decision analysis. This provides further support for the importance of the increasing emphasis on the science-policy interface and knowledge coproduction in SES research. In contrast, state-and-transition analysis, systems scoping, and games were much more rarely used. These are methods that are particularly well suited to the study of SES, but may not have been as well-represented in our dataset on account of their categories containing fewer specific methods, a general limitation of our study.\nbgre | Our typology of methods spanning different disciplines can provide some orientation to early-career researchers to navigate the methodological pluralism that characterizes the SES field. For new researchers entering the field, a key challenge relates to knowing which methods could be used to investigate a particular SES research question. Our list of method categories offers researchers a manageable overview of potential tools they might employ in their research, and provides a foundation for scholarly engagement around methodological integration.\n57lp | Methods used in SES research account for the underlying characteristics of CAS to varying degrees\nukth | To gain deeper insight into the suitability of methods used in SES research in accounting for the CAS nature of SES, the authors used a thought exercise to map the different method typologies onto the six organizing principles of CAS, as identified by Preiser et al. There are obvious limitations to such an approach, most notably that our assessment was limited by the knowledge of the author team about different methods and the contexts in which they are applied. Nevertheless, the exercise yielded several insights that could be explored in future research on the nature of SES research.\nkpvt | A number of the methods highlighted in our review, such as network analysis and agent-based modeling, are particularly well suited to explore relationality in SES. Both network analysis and agent-based modeling are used extensively in SES research, and offer integrative frameworks that capture relations and connectivity, can help to develop rich pictures, and deal with heterogeneity and redundancy. Agent-based modeling and network analysis are process-oriented models that rely on decentralized control and automata to detect and create emergent patterns, and so do well to account for the adaptive and self-generating organizational capacities of CAS.\njie2 | Generally, the methods used in SES research have been sensitive to the context-dependency of SES challenges, probably helped by the notion that SES research has emerged from place-based local-scale studies. Many methods used in anticipatory future studies are adept at adapting frameworks to context, and specifically focus on anticipating adaptation and change. These methods, and other participatory research methods that gather multiple evidence-based knowledge can help with observer-dependent framing.",
