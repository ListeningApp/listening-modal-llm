You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

1ocm | Mid-Level Grounding Instead of grounding the LLM generation to low-level actions by using downstream data from a specific environment, we focus on high-level to mid-level grounding such that we evaluate raw knowledge of LLMs as closely and broadly as possible. Hence, we only consider the most prominent challenge in mid-level grounding that the generated plans must satisfy all common-sense constraints (characterized by executability metric). As a result, we assume there is a low-level controller that can execute these mid-level actions (such as "grab cup"), and we do not investigate the usefulness of LLMs for low-level sensorimotor behavior grounding. To perform sensorimotor grounding, such as navigation and interaction mask prediction, domain-specific data and fine-tuning are likely required.
527v | Ignorant of Environment Context We do not incorporate observation context or feedback into our models. To some extent, we approach LLMs in the same way as how VirtualHome asks human annotators to write action plans for a given human activity by imagination, in which case humans similarly do not observe environment context. Similar to human-written plans, we assume the plans generated by LMs only refer to one instance of each object class. As a result, successful plan generation for tasks like "stack two plates on the right side of a cup" is not possible.
lrri | Evaluation Protocol We measure quality of plans by a combination of executability and correctness instead of one straightforward metric. To the best of our knowledge, there isn't a known way to computationally assess the semantic correctness of the plans due to the tasks' open-ended and multi-modal nature. Prior work also adopt similar combination of metrics [38]. We report two metrics individually to shine light on the deficiencies of existing LLMs which we hope could provide insights for future works. To provide a holistic view, we report results by combining two metrics in Section 5.2.
5cl9 | We believe addressing each of these shortcoming will lead to exciting future directions. We also hope these findings can inspire future investigations into using pre-trained LMs for goal-driven decision-making problems and grounding the learned knowledge in embodied environments.
u7a3 | For each evaluated method, we perform grid search over the following hyperparameters:
w409 | For methods that use fixed example across evaluated tasks, we search over the following three randomly chosen examples:
m04y | Human evaluations are conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk. For each method, we generate action plans for all 88 high-level tasks. To account for the expressivity of the VirtualHome environment [38], we include action plans written by human experts from the VirtualHome dataset as references in our human evaluations. The evaluations are conducted in the form of questionnaires containing all action plans whose order is randomly shuffled and whose corresponding methods are unknown to the annotators. Human annotators are required to answer all the questions in the questionnaire. For each question, the annotators need to answer either "Yes" or "No" indicating if they believe the action plan completes the task. For each method, we report correctness percentage averaged across 10 participated human annotators and all 88 tasks. We further report the standard error of the mean across human annotators. Screenshot can be found in Figure 6.
