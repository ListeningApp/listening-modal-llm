The deposit is hosted by mafic (basaltic-andesitic) volcaniclastic rocks within a series of cinder cones along a single eruptive fissure. Extensive mapping and sampling by remotely operated vehicle, together with shallow drilling, provide insights into deposit geology and especially hydrothermal processes operating in the shallow subsurface. On the seafloor, mostly inactive chimneys and mounds cover an area of approximately seventy-seven thousand square meters and are partially buried by volcaniclastic sand. Mineralization is characterized by abundant barite- and sulfide-rich chimneys that formed by low-temperature (less than two hundred fifty degrees Celsius) venting over approximately five thousand six hundred years. Barite-rich samples have high SiO2, lead, and mercury contents; the sulfide chimneys are dominated by low iron sphalerite and are high in cadmium, germanium, antimony, and silver. Few high-temperature chimneys, including zoned chalcopyrite-sphalerite samples and rare massive chalcopyrite, are rich in arsenic, molybdenum, indium, and gold (up to nine point two six parts per million), locally as visible gold. Below the seafloor, the mineralization includes buried intervals of sulfide-rich talus with disseminated sulfides in volcaniclastic rocks consisting mainly of lapillistone with minor tuffaceous beds and autobreccias. The volcaniclastic rocks are intensely altered and variably cemented by anhydrite with crosscutting sulfate (plus minor sulfide) veins. Fluid inclusions in anhydrite and sphalerite from the footwall (to nineteen point three meters below seafloor; meters b.s.f.) have trapping temperatures of up to two hundred ninety-eight degrees Celsius with salinities close to, but slightly higher than, that of seawater (two point eight to four point five weight percent sodium chloride equivalent). These temperatures are ten to twenty degrees Celsius lower than the minimum temperature of boiling at this depth (one thousand seventy to one thousand two hundred four meters below sea level; meters b.s.l.), suggesting that the highest-temperature fluids boiled below the seafloor. The alteration is distributed in broadly conformable zones, expressed in order of increasing depth and temperature as montmorillonite/nontronite, nontronite plus corrensite, illite/smectite plus pyrite, illite/smectite plus chamosite, and chamosite plus corrensite. Zones of argillic alteration are distinguished from chloritic alteration by large positive mass changes in K2O (enriched in illite/smectite), magnesium oxide (enriched in chamosite and corrensite), and iron three oxide (enriched in pyrite associated with illite/smectite alteration). The delta eighteen O and OD values of clay minerals confirm increasing temperature with depth, from one hundred twenty-four to two hundred fifty-six degrees Celsius, and interaction with seawater-dominated hydrothermal fluids at high water/rock ratios. Leaching of the volcanic host rocks and thermochemical reduction of seawater sulfate are the primary sources of sulfur, with delta thirty-four S values of sulfides, from negative zero point eight to three point four, and those of sulfate minerals close to seawater sulfate, from nineteen point three to twenty-two point five.\n7avo | The mineralization and alteration at Tinakula are typical of a class of ancient massive sulfide deposits hosted mainly by permeable volcaniclastic rocks with broad, semiconformable alteration zones. Processes by which these deposits form have never been documented in modern seafloor massive sulfide systems, because they mostly develop below the seafloor. Our study shows how hydrothermal fluids can become focused within permeable rocks by progressive, low-temperature fluid circulation, leading to a large area (greater than one hundred fifty thousand square meters) of alteration with reduced permeability close to the seafloor. In our model, overpressuring and fracturing of the sulfate- and clay-cemented volcaniclastic rocks produced the pathways for higher-temperature fluids to reach the seafloor, present now as sulfate-sulfide veins within the footwall. In the geologic record, the sulfate (anhydrite) is not preserved, leaving a broad zone of intense alteration with disseminated and stringer sulfides typical of this class of deposits.\n89b4 | Introduction\n5f7e | Volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits have been classified according to host-rock lithology, bulk composition, and tectonic setting.",
