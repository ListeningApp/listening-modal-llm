You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

hjzj | 4.3. Multiple RNA Replication Complex Outputs: Genomic RNAs, Subgenomic Messenger RNAs, and Recombination
j79f | The RCs of most (+)RNA viruses host multiple processes such as replicating different RNAs of multicomponent genomes, genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis, and RNA recombination. Growing understanding of RC structure and compartmentalization enables more effective con- sideration of how these processes are regulated and whether individual RCs might be specialized for particular pathways or RNA templates.
6tbv | To express additional proteins from internal open reading frames, many (+)RNA viruses pro- duce subgenomic mRNAs corresponding to 5' truncated fragments of viral genomic (+)RNA. For BMV (Figure 2), and by inference other alphavirus-like viruses, in vitro and in vivo results show that subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized by (+)RNA initiation at alternate internal promoters on a full-length genomic (-)RNA template (98). While many regulatory questions remain, mutual interference between BMV genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis suggests that both pathways may proceed on a common genomic (-)RNA template in a single spherule RC (99).
xb13 | For nodaviruses and coronaviruses (Figure 2), subgenomic RNAs are generated by terminat- ing (-)RNA synthesis at interior sites on genomic (+)RNA templates, yielding truncated or in- ternally deleted (-)RNAs that become independent replicons (58, 59, 100, 101). For both viruses, subgenomic (-)RNA production depends on defined RNA sequences, structures, and long-range RNA interactions (58, 101). However, the precise conditions triggering premature termination of (-)RNA synthesis and regulating relative levels of full-length genomic and partial-length subge- nomic (-)RNAs remain poorly understood.
cxqi | It is also unknown whether individual coronavirus or nodavirus RCs contain only one or more types of genomic or subgenomic RNA templates. For coronavirus DMVs, the presence
qfmx | of multiple crowns per DMV and the apparently lower density of dsRNA intermediates rela- tive to spherules (65) (Figure 3c) suggest that individual DMVs might host multiple genomic and/or subgenomic RNA templates, with either transient or more durable associations with spe- cific crowns. For spherule RCs, volume measurements and the presence of a single crown suggest that most spherules contain a single dsRNA replication intermediate (26, 27) (Figure 3a). How- ever, nodavirus genomic RNA2 replication both requires and subsequently suppresses synthesis of subgenomic RNA3 from genomic RNA1 (100, 101). Thus, either some of these three replica- tively interdependent RNAs are produced in a single spherule or the templates and products of their replication must interact between RCs.
rut3 | (+)RNA virus RNA recombination, which is crucial for short-term adaptation and long-term evolution, appears to occur primarily by template switching during RNA replication (102) and thus within RCs. Accordingly, BMV recombination requires both parental RNAs to possess signals for recruitment into RCs, and recruiting two templates into a single RC may be the limiting factor for recombination (103, 104).
m3cp | 4.4. Connection of Virion Assembly to RNA Replication
mq4s | For many (+)RNA viruses, genome RNA synthesis shows close physical and functional links to virion assembly. For coronaviruses, for example, virion assembly and budding sites are usually closely juxtaposed with DMV RCs producing new viral genomic RNAs (56, 63, 105) (Figure 3c). Coronavirus RCs and encapsidation are further linked by interaction of the cytosolic domains of RC crowns with clustered densities similar to virion ribonucleoproteins (65) and by crown protein nsp3 binding of viral nucleocapsid N (68), implying that nsp3-N interaction might initiate encapsidation of progeny RNAs as they are released from crowns (59, 65).
95el | Flavivirus virions also assemble and bud near their genome replication sites (52) (Figure 3b). For both flaviviruses and hepaciviruses, multiple RC-associated nonstructural proteins are linked to virion assembly. In particular, flavivirus NS2A and hepacivirus NS2 are key organizers of virion assembly, promoting recruitment, localization, and function of multiple viral factors at virion as- sembly sites jointly associated with lipid droplets and ER (106-108). In addition to NS2A, fla- vivirus nonstructural proteins implicated in virion assembly include at least NS2B and NS3, while implicated HCV proteins include NS2 plus NS1/P7, NS3, NS4A, and NS5A, establishing mul- tiple potentially guiding connections between the machineries of progeny RNA and virion pro- duction (106, 108, 109).
a0a5 | In nodavirus infection, large arrays of unenveloped virions accumulate directly adjacent to infection-modified mitochondria bearing RCs (110), and several results illustrate functional cou- pling between these processes. First, nodavirus genomic RNA1 and RNA2 are only efficiently encapsidated by capsid protein translated from RNA2 synthesized by nodaviral RNA-dependent RNA replication in mitochondrial RCs, but not by capsid protein supplied in trans from non- replicating mRNA transcribed from baculovirus DNA (111). Moreover, an arginine-rich motif near the capsid protein N terminus is selectively required to encapsidate genomic RNA1 but not RNA2, largely because this domain localizes capsid protein to the mitochondrial sites of RNA replication (112). Thus, for all of these viruses, virion assembly and RNA replication are linked by multiple pathways whose mechanistic principles are still incompletely understood but promise to be quite enlightening.
gocl | 4.5. Opportunities for Improved Virus Control
ob1z | With genome replication at the heart of (+)RNA virus life cycles, RC assembly, maturation, and function are prime targets for antiviral strategies. Because natural (+)RNA virus infections
m4cb | typically start at low multiplicity, the incoming single-stranded RNA genome (Figure <LATEX>\left. l a \right)</LATEX> is highly vulnerable to normal cellular RNA turnover prior to RNA replication. Thus, merely slowing RC assembly can have dramatic antiviral effects. In addition to attractive potentials for targeting viral replication factor synthesis, stability, trafficking, and assembly, RC assembly might be inhibited by targeting relevant host factors. While space does not allow general review here of the myriad host factor requirements for <LATEX>\left( + \right) \mathrm { R N A }</LATEX> virus replication (e.g., 45, 113-115), some examples are instructive. Host pathways involved in lipid synthesis, modification, and trafficking are prominent illustrations of potential targets because most or all <LATEX>\left( + \right) \mathrm { R N A }</LATEX> viruses depend on and recruit such functions to RC assembly sites (116, 117). Similarly, RC generation by many <LATEX>\left( + \right) \mathrm { R N A }</LATEX> viruses requires host membrane remodeling factors such as ESCRT proteins, reticulons, and others (118-120). Because these and many other host pathways are used by numerous <LATEX>\left( + \right) \mathrm { R N A }</LATEX> viruses, targeting well-selected factors could provide valuable broad-spectrum antiviral effects.
