You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

usfa | For the duration of the therapy process, the therapist must engage in a process of interpersonal reasoning. In- terpersonal reasoning is the process by which a therapist consciously and reflectively monitors both the therapeu- tic relationship and the interpersonal events of therapy in order to decide on and enact appropriate interpersonal strategies. Chapter 7 discusses the interpersonal reason- ing process in detail.
dnjr | Intentional Relationship Model: 10 Underlying Principles
qser | The IRM defines the most critical components of the client-therapist relationship as it occurs in occupational therapy. In addition to its central elements and mecha- nisms, 10 fundamental principles underlie the concep- tualization of this model (Box 3.1). They are explained in the following sections. Each principle specifies unique assumptions about how the client-therapist relationship is approached. Collectively, the principles should be kept actively in mind anytime the model is applied during an interaction with a client.
8gam | Principle 1: Critical Self-Awareness Is Key to the Intentional Use of Self
z4db | Developing critical self-awareness involves having a work- ing knowledge of your interpersonal tendencies while interacting with clients of different interpersonal styles and under different conditions and circumstances. These interpersonal tendencies may manifest in one's emo- tional reactions to others and in one's verbalizations and
lw7l | BOX 3.1 Underlying Principles of the Intentional Relationship Model
2exi | 1. Critical self-awareness is key to the intentional use of self.
16py | 2. Interpersonal self-discipline is fundamen- tal to effective use of self.
m4ov | 3. It is necessary to keep head before heart.
9uqd | 4. Mindful empathy is required to know your client.
8szx | 5. Therapists are responsible for expanding their interpersonal knowledge base.
iwdc | 6. Provided that they are purely and flexi- bly applied, a wide range of therapeutic modes can work and be utilized inter- changeably in occupational therapy.
4vks | 7. The client defines a successful relationship.
uyaf | 8. Activity focusing must be balanced with interpersonal focusing.
d1qh | 9. Application of the model must be informed by core values and ethics.
nyqt | 10. Application of the model requires cultural sensitivity.
7odd | nonverbal behavior. Critical self-awareness also requires understanding how your interpersonal reactions and be- haviors change, become attenuated, or become amplified in awkward, tense, or stressful situations. Understanding yourself in these highly detailed and variegated ways is not easy to achieve. Nevertheless, this understanding is critical to developing interpersonal skills that are per- ceived as therapeutic by clients.
0le2 | The difficulty involved in achieving critical self-awareness is illustrated by research findings that ther- apists are usually not accurate in their self-estimation of the extent to which they convey an attitude of care and empathy toward their clients (Burns & Auerbach, 1996; Orlinsky, 1994). In studies of psychotherapy, empathy was linked to positive outcomes only if it was perceived by the client; therapist self-ratings of empathy were not associ- ated with positive outcomes (Burns & Auerbach, 1996).
5dw0 | Chapter 3 A Model of the Intentional Relationship 71
i4yq | Because therapists are not always accurate self-estimators of their own interpersonal capacities, merely considering oneself to be a caring and empathic therapist does not offer adequate assurance that an effective interpersonal process has occurred in therapy. Many of us have proba- bly had the opportunity to know someone whose caring behavior toward us was fully spontaneous, sincere, and heartfelt but nevertheless largely missed what we most needed at the time.
fj3g | Truly effective use of self hinges on ongoing criti- cal awareness of your interpersonal behavior and emo- tional reactions to clients. This includes a mindfulness concerning:
zuua | ·What you are communicating verbally (content, choice of words, types of questions asked)
elwn | · What you are communicating nonverbally (stance or sitting posture, positioning of arms and legs, angle of torso and head in relation to the client, gestures, extent and pace of body movements)
jnqv | · What you are communicating emotionally (tone, tenor, and volume of voice; facial expression; extent to which emotion is shown or shared)
unp3 | · What you are withholding, limiting, or otherwise not communicating and the implications of these kinds of noncommunication for the therapeutic interaction
v8vk | Principle 2: Interpersonal Self-Discipline Is Fundamental to Effective Use of Self
sr40 | Achieving critical self-awareness is necessary for effective therapeutic relationships, but it is not sufficient. Thera- pists must also have the courage to seek and respond to interpersonal feedback from clients in a manner that re- flects a dynamic, second-by-second recognition of what the client needs at any given moment. These abilities to anticipate, measure, and respond to the effects of ongo- ing communications with a client is most succinctly char- acterized as interpersonal self-discipline. Interpersonal self-discipline is fundamental to the use of self because it allows a therapist to develop stable, predictable relation- ships with clients. It allows a client to trust that the ther- apist has the ability to place his or her own interpersonal reactions and expectations aside to best fulfill what the client wishes to take from the relationship.
5zjj | A critical aspect of interpersonal self-discipline in- volves acting on your awareness of your reactions to interpersonally challenging clients whose interpersonal behavior does not meet your expectations or tends to be negative. These clients may be particularly emotional, hy- persensitive, defensive, demanding, critical, manipulative, difficult to manage, or otherwise vulnerable. Therapists differ among and within themselves regarding:
f56l | ·What kinds of client behaviors and emotions are expe- rienced as difficult
ar2z | The extent to which they feel comfortable managing these different types of difficult interpersonal behaviors
yad0 | Some therapists find it easier to work with an emotionally sad client than an angry client, whereas the opposite may be true for another therapist. Interpersonal self-discipline involves knowing the types of client and the situations that are most likely to test your interpersonal resolve and emotional perspective. Once you are familiar with your own vulnerabilities, you can more effectively prepare yourself emotionally and psychologically before interact- ing with these clients. In addition, you can more read- ily seek support, advice, and guidance from mentors and peers when treating difficult clients.
3g38 | Collectively, the actions you take toward self- preparation and self-management in the face of inter- personally difficult clients helps ensure that the ways in which you choose to interact with these clients will be optimally therapeutic. This decreases the likelihood that you will unwittingly act out your own negative feelings toward a difficult client. For example, a therapist once shared that she felt less guilty about precipitously chang- ing an appointment with a client in order to meet an out-of-town friend for lunch because the client tended to behave in demanding ways and had recently ques- tioned her approach. Changing an appointment with a client for a nonurgent matter is not a disciplined way of managing one's feelings toward a client. Moreover, changing the appointment with an already-difficult client may lead to increased tension in the relationship. Another example is the extent to which one may make special efforts on behalf of a client. It is generally easier to make these extra efforts for clients whom one likes and sees as investing a great deal in the therapy. How- ever, depriving the difficult client or the client who is not invested in therapy of one's extra effort is not justified ethically.
