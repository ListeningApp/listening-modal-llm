In this study, we built on existing conceptual and empirical literatures to specify and test a predictive model of voice that included several of the possible person-centered and situational antecedents of voice. Using a reliable measure of voice with initial construct validity support, our model explained seventeen percent of the variance in peer ratings of employee voice behavior assessed six months later.\ni9k5 | Overview of Results\n20z2 | The results of our study indicate support for the notion that voice is more than a function of satisfaction. Although\n4cgs | Table two Hierarchical Regression of Time two Peer Ratings of Voice Behaviors on Antecedents\nhtre | F equals five point four one. Zero equals manufacturing, one equals nonmanufacturing. Zero equals female, one equals male. Zero equals non-White, one equals White. Zero equals no college, one equals at least some college. Zero equals staff, one equals manager or professional. Zero equals traditional management, one equals self-management. Point one zero. P less than point zero five. P less than point zero one.\nda3c | P less than point zero zero one. Satisfaction with the group explained three percent of the variance in voice behavior six months later, it accounted for less than twenty percent of the total variance explained in our model. The variable self-esteem was also a marginally significant predictor of voice six months later. Individuals with high levels of global self-esteem were more likely to engage in voice than individuals with low levels of self-esteem. The situational variables also explained a significant amount of variance in peer-rated voice behavior. Consis-\n890q | tent with expectations, individuals in small groups engaged in more voice relative to individuals in large groups. Although the zero-order correlation was not significant, the regression analysis suggested that after several other variables were considered, there was a relationship between style of management and voice such that those in self-managed groups engaged in more voice than those in traditional groups.\njomo | In addition, our results demonstrated the importance\n06fi | of considering interactions between person-centered and situational factors as predictors of voice. Consistent with Brockner's behavior plasticity theory, the relationship between the situational variables and voice was stronger for individuals with lower self-esteem. Low self-esteem individuals were more responsive to situational stimuli that foster voice. Extending the general idea of behavior plasticity theory to satisfaction, we proposed that the relationship between the situational variables and voice would be stronger for individuals with lower satisfaction. Instead, we found stronger situational relationships for those individuals with higher levels of satisfaction.\nhb4s | Rethinking the Satisfaction-Contextual Factors Interactions\ncqq2 | Although we found significant interactions between satisfaction and contextual factors, the pattern of the relationships was the opposite of what we had predicted. Those with higher satisfaction were more responsive to the situational factors than those with lower satisfaction. This unexpected finding suggests the need to review the assumptions behind our hypotheses.\n1ews | High satisfaction implies high plasticity. We had assumed that those with high satisfaction with the group were fulfilling their values, in part, through the group and that this would cause them to be more attached to the group. We expected that their attachment to and dependence on the group for continued satisfaction would cause them to engage in voice regardless of contextual factors. That is, we did not expect voice to vary significantly across situations for highly satisfied individuals. The pattern illustrated by the plots in Figures three and four, however,\nafyn | reveals that the favorability of group conditions (i.e., small or self-managed groups) had a strong influence on the voice behavior of highly satisfied individuals. Highly satisfied individuals in large or traditionally-managed groups engaged in the same amount of voice as those who were less satisfied. However, when highly satisfied individuals were in small or self-managed groups, they engaged in more voice than those who were less satisfied. Kahn's research on \"personal engagement\" provides one possible explanation for this finding.",
