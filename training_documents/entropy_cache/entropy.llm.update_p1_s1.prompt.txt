You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

at1i | What Is Entropy
4dbf | Foreword
nsky | Once there was a thing called Twitter, where people exchanged short messages called 'tweets'. While it had its flaws, I came to like it and eventually decided to teach a short course on entropy in the form of tweets. This little book is a slightly expanded version of that course.
pa2d | It's easy to wax poetic about entropy, but what is it? I claim it's the amount of information we don't know about a situation, which in principle we could learn. But how can we make this idea precise and quantitative? To focus the discussion I decided to tackle a specific puzzle: why does hydrogen gas at room temperature and pressure have an entropy corresponding to about 23 unknown bits of information per molecule? This gave me an excuse to explain these subjects:
lf13 | · information
28e7 | · Shannon entropy and Gibbs entropy
ye9e | . the principle of maximum entropy
dyie | · the Boltzmann distribution
75gl | · temperature and coolness
wu5u | · the relation between entropy, expected energy and temperature
w7ga | · the equipartition theorem
l7xq | · the partition function
cqbg | · the relation between entropy, free energy and expected energy
hr2e | · the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator
zsya | . the entropy of a classical particle in a box
7dof | . the entropy of a classical ideal gas.
ykie | I have largely avoided the second law of thermodynamics, which says that entropy always increases. While fascinating, this is so problematic that a good explanation would require another book! I have also avoided the role of entropy in biology, black hole physics, etc. Thus, the aspects of entropy most beloved by physics popularizers will not be found here. I also never say that entropy is 'disorder'.
3hj2 | I have tried to say as little as possible about quantum mechanics, to keep the physics prerequisites low. However, Planck's constant shows up in the formulas for the entropy of the three classical systems mentioned above. The reason for this is fascinating: Planck's constant provides a unit of volume in position-momentum space, which is necessary to define the entropy of these systems. Thus, we need a tiny bit of quantum mechanics to get a good approximate formula for the entropy of hydrogen, even if we are trying our best to treat this gas classically.
oy25 | Since I am a mathematical physicist, this book is full of math. I spend more time trying to make concepts precise and looking into strange counterexamples than an actual 'working' physicist would. If at any point you feel I am sinking into too many technicalities, don't be shy about jumping to the next tweet. The really important stuff is in the boxes. It may help to reach the end before going back and learning all the details. It's up to you.
ti3v | In 2010, Chas A. Egan and Charles H. Lineweaver estimated the biggest contributors to the entropy of the observable universe. Mea- suring entropy in bits, these are:
ufwv | · stars: 1081 bits.
m0qi | · interstellar and intergalactic gas and dust: 1082 bits.
y63m | · gravitons: 1088 bits.
12af | · neutrinos: 1090 bits.
nznk | · photons: 1090 bits.
td48 | . stellar black holes: 1098 bits.
0tv0 | . supermassive black holes: 10105 bits.
1pei | So, almost all the entropy is in supermassive black holes!
at1e | In 2010, Chas A. Egan and Charles H. Lineweaver estimated the entropy of the observable universe. Entropy corresponds to unknown information, so there's a heck of a lot we don't know! For stars, most of this unknown information concerns the details of every single electron and nucleus zipping around in the hot plasma. There's more entropy in interstellar and intergalactic gas and dust. Most of the gas here is hydrogen-some in molecular form H2, some individual atoms, and some ionized. For all this stuff, the unknown information again mostly concerns the details, like the position and momentum, of each of these molecules, atoms and ions.
zpsj | There's a lot more we don't know about the precise details of other particles whizzing through the universe, like gravitons, neutrinos and photons. But there's even more entropy in black holes! One reason Stephen Hawking is famous is that he figured out how to compute the entropy of black holes. To do that you need a combination of statistical mechanics, general relativity and quantum physics. Statistical mechanics is the study of physical systems where there's unknown information, which you study using probability theory. I'll explain some of that in these tweets. General relativity is Einstein's theory of gravity, and while I've explained that elsewhere, I don't want to get into it here so I will say nothing about the entropy of black holes.
b75r | Quantum physics was also necessary for Hawking's calculation, as witnessed by the fact that his answer involves Planck's constant, which sets the scale of quantum uncertainty in our universe. I will try to steer clear of quantum mechanics in these tweets, but in the end we'll need a tiny bit of it. There's a funny sense in which statistical mechanics is somewhat incomplete without quantum mechanics. You'll eventually see what I mean.
buot | THE ENTROPY OF HYDROGEN
pb5c | At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen gas has an entropy of
h0uy | 130.68 joule/kelvin per mole
kqxy | But a joule/kelvin of entropy is about
3572 | 1.0449 . 1023 bits of unknown information and a mole of any chemical is about
mj6d | 6.0221 . 1023 molecules
osru | So the unknown information about the precise microscopic state of hydrogen is
7cej | 1.0449 · 1023 ≈ 23 bits per molecule!
9v21 | 130.68 . 6.0221 · 1023
t3ut | Egan and Lineweaver estimated the entropy of all the interstellar and intergalactic gas and dust in the observable universe. Entropy corresponds to information we don't know. Their estimate implies that there are 1082 bits of information we don't know about all this gas and dust.
blsg | Most of this stuff is hydrogen. Hydrogen is very simple stuff. So it would be good to understand the entropy of hydrogen. You can measure changes in entropy by doing experiments. If you assume hydrogen has no entropy at absolute zero, you can do experiments to figure out the entropy of hydrogen under other conditions. From this you can calculate that each molecule in a container of hydrogen gas at standard temperature and pressure has about 23 bits of information that we don't know.
c9it | You can see a sketch of the calculation above. But everything about it is far from obvious! What does 'missing information' really mean here? Joules are a unit of energy; kelvin is a unit of temperature. So why is entropy measured in joules per kelvin? Why does one joule per kelvin correspond to 1.0449 . 1023 bits of missing information? How can we do experiments to measure changes in entropy? And why is missing information the same as-or more precisely proportional to-entropy?
t29r | The good news: all these questions have answers! You can learn them here. How- ever, you will have to persist. Since I'm starting from scratch it won't be quick. It takes some math-but luckily, nothing much more than calculus of several variables. When you can calculate the entropy of hydrogen from first principles, and understand what it means, that will count as true success.
ddhd | See how it goes! Partial success is okay too.
e69f | WHERE ARE WE GOING?
q12e | The mystery: why does each molecule of hydrogen have ~ 23 bits of entropy at standard temperature and pressure?
vj9y | The goal: derive and understand the formula for the entropy of a classical ideal monatomic gas:
g0bb | S = kN (InkT + In ~+ r ) N V
k09q | including the mysterious constant y.
w30h | The subgoal: compute the entropy of a single classical particle in a 1-dimensional box.
4vcv | The sub-subgoal: explain entropy from the ground up, and compute the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator.
