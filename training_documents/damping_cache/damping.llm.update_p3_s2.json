        "content": "1k9e | Journal of Applied Mathematics\n5bjs | The rest of the paper is divided as follows. In the next section we investigate the long time behaviour of the solutions. Section three discusses the sensitivity of the obtained solutions with respect to nonlocal damping factor zeta. More precisely we characterize the limit problem for both high and small zeta. We conclude the paper in Section four by giving some comments.\nuodj | Two. The Limit as t Goes to plus infinity\nk16v | We investigate the long time behaviour of the solutions. More precisely, we study the w-limit set of the trajectories and characterize the at-limit points as solutions of a suitable stationary problem. We proceed as in Carbou-Fabrie.\nb2lm | Let M be a weak solution of one. We call w-limit set of the trajectory M the following set:\nti7f | omega left parenthesis M right parenthesis equals left brace m in double-struck H superscript one left parenthesis Omega right parenthesis comma exists t subscript n comma limit subscript n rightwards arrow plus infinity t subscript n equals plus infinity comma M left parenthesis t subscript n comma dot right parenthesis right brace.\noksu | - m in double-struck H superscript one left parenthesis Omega right parenthesis weakly.\nwtow | Consider a weak solution M of one. From the energy estimate twelve, the at-limit set omega left parenthesis M right parenthesis is nonempty. We denote by fraktur m a point of this set. There exists a nondecreasing sequence left parenthesis t subscript n right parenthesis subscript n comma such that t subscript n rightwards arrow plus infinity and M left parenthesis t subscript n comma dot right parenthesis right harpoon above m in widetilde Vdash l superscript one left parenthesis Omega right parenthesis weakly. Since Omega is a smooth bounded domain, then M left parenthesis t subscript n comma dot right parenthesis tends to m in double-struck L superscript p left parenthesis Omega right parenthesis strongly for p in left bracket one comma six left bracket comma text and right period right. extracting a subsequence, we assume that M left parenthesis t subscript n comma dot right parenthesis tends to fraktur m almost everywhere, so that the saturation constraint absolute value m equals one is satisfied almost everywhere. In addition, we remark that, for all n comma absolute value M left parenthesis t subscript n comma dot right parenthesis equals one almost everywhere, so that double-vertical-bar M left parenthesis t subscript n comma dot right parenthesis double-vertical-bar subscript L superscript infinity left parenthesis Omega right parenthesis equals one. By interpolation inequalities in double-struck L superscript p spaces, we obtain that, for all p less than plus infinity comma M left parenthesis t subscript n comma dot right parenthesis tends to m in double-struck L superscript P left parenthesis Omega right parenthesis strongly.\no22k | For s in left parenthesis negative one comma one right parenthesis and x in Omega we define for n large enough\nnwfz | m subscript n left parenthesis s comma x right parenthesis equals M left parenthesis t subscript n plus s comma x right parenthesis period.\nnvfy | We have the following convergence result.\nmror | Lemma four. The sequence left parenthesis m subscript n right parenthesis subscript n greater than or equal to one satisfies the following convergences:\nzlxc | m subscript n long rightwards arrow m quad in L squared left parenthesis left parenthesis negative one comma one right parenthesis times Omega right parenthesis strongly comma m subscript n right harpoon above m quad in L squared left parenthesis left parenthesis negative one comma one right parenthesis semicolon double-struck H superscript one left parenthesis Omega right parenthesis right parenthesis weakly.\nk0bw | Proof. Following fourteen, we have the estimate\naq5a | \nsc5y | one half Integral from negative one to one Integral from Omega absolute value m subscript n left parenthesis s comma x right parenthesis minus M left parenthesis t subscript n comma x right parenthesis absolute value squared d x d s less than or equal to Integral from t subscript n minus one to plus infinity Integral from Omega absolute value partial-differential subscript t M left parenthesis tau comma x right parenthesis absolute value squared d x d tau. partial-differential subscript t M lies in L squared left parenthesis R plus times Omega right parenthesis comma one gets\n0yab | limit subscript n rightwards arrow plus infinity one half Integral from negative one to one Integral from Omega absolute value m subscript n left parenthesis s comma x right parenthesis minus M left parenthesis t subscript n comma s right parenthesis absolute value squared d x d s equals zero.\nw95z | Since M left parenthesis t subscript n comma dot right parenthesis tends to m in L squared left parenthesis Omega right parenthesis strongly, m subscript n tend to m in double-struck L squared left parenthesis left parenthesis negative one comma one right parenthesis semicolon double-struck L squared left parenthesis Omega right parenthesis right parenthesis strongly.
