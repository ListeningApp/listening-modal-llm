This article analyses performance of the land market in several irregular settlements (colonias) outside Rio Grande City, Starr County, Texas. Specifically, it explores the impact upon land prices of a major title 'regularisation' initiative to clear property titles of very poor households undertaken by the Community Resources Group Receivership Program at the behest of the Texas State government between nineteen ninety-five and two thousand two. Land price data and trends are analyzed using a major Community Resources Group database of over fourteen hundred price records and files, complemented by a questionnaire survey of over two hundred sixty households applied by the research team as part of an evaluation of the Community Resources Group Program. The data show that prices are relatively 'flat' in real terms over time and that, while there was a spike in prices during the early nineteen nineties, there does not appear to have been any significant increase since regularisation. The data suggest that prices appear to be shaped more by socially determined criteria associated with the developers themselves, rather than by settlement characteristics, location, etc. Regularisation of land title appears to make little difference to land market performance and, while colonias are a vehicle for investment for low-income groups, the rate of return compared with other segments of the formal property market is very low. These findings are compared with similar work for less developed countries and also challenge those theories that argue in favor of land regularisation as a means to improve land market performance and integration of the urban poor.\n1o7p | Informal Land Markets and 'The Mystery of Capital'\ncp13 | Scholars and analysts who study rapid urbanisation in less developed countries are familiar with 'regularisation' programmes, understanding these as policy interventions to provide services and legal property titles to settlements that will often have developed illegally, either through squatting or by illegal land sales and development. In many\nbgre | contemporary Latin American cities, rapid population growth in the second half of the twentieth century led to anything between twenty-five and sixty percent of the built-up area having originated as irregular residential settlement. Today, such regularisation policies have attained conventional wisdom status throughout the region and come in two forms: first, those that focus upon extending\n57lp | essential infrastructure (power, water, drainage, public lighting, street paving, etc.) to areas that lack them; while elsewhere a second approach is to accord priority to legalising the illegal by converting de facto ownership into full de jure legal title. Sometimes the two programmes go hand-in-hand and, although full title has rarely been an absolute requirement in order to secure government intervention, it usually helps, if only because it brings people onto the property registry, providing a basis for ongoing cost recovery of service consumption charges and for the levying of property taxes, albeit at low and modest rates, thereby making urban development programmes more sustainable. Moreover, to the extent that planning controls can only be exercised effectively where the property market is formalised, title regularisation forms an increasingly important component in programmes to improve urban management and administration.\nukth | In Latin America, such policy scenarios are neither novel nor controversial, such that in the region today the principal questions usually hinge around two issues: first, how to recover the costs of regularisation without imposing an excessive burden upon the poor, inadvertently forcing their displacement. And, secondly, how best to prioritise programmes given the large backlog of service requirements in older settlements as well as more newly created ones that continue to proliferate, notwithstanding tighter government controls and greater political willingness to prevent developers from continuing their egregious land development and lot sales. Important background variables in the Latin American policy environment are democratization, together with economic liberalisation and greater global integration. Political and economic opening have had a profound impact not only upon socioeconomic conditions, but also upon the housing process and the nature of land market performance. Time-worn practices of patron-client links between politicians and the urban poor whereby settlement services and legal\nkpvt | recognition were a quid pro quo for party political or individual support are largely a thing of the past; as is the existence of an overarching patrimonial state seeking to provide a broad range of social benefits to the poor. Today's government bureaucracies are slimmer and programmes are more carefully targeted to those that need them most. Social services may also increasingly be contracted out to privately organised enterprises and to non-government organisations that have become a virtual arm of the state. The prevailing orthodoxy is that, wherever possible, the market should provide, such that the primary task of policymakers is effectively to 'prime' the market, or at the very least to make it work more equitably by generating jobs, cutting out red tape that frustrates entrepreneurial spirit, engaging the private sector in home-building programmes for the lower end of the market and providing serviced lots at affordable levels, etc. Thus, from the nineteen eighties onwards, the policy paradigm has changed: initially towards greater active sponsorship and support for self-help housing and informal settlement initiatives; and latterly to more effective regulation and improved administration that would reduce waste, enhance cost recovery and provide greater incentives for the poor to become a part of the marketplace and be better placed to fend for themselves.\njie2 | Notwithstanding a growing recognition of some of the positive elements of informality, for those wedded to the orthodoxy of formal urban land development, the very idea of informal title and property land markets remains anathema. Therefore, numerous arguments are rehearsed in favour of titling programmes. First, planners and public officials, for whom the formal legal system is the one that they know best and work towards, are often uneasy with 'plural' systems and alternative property rights that are unfamiliar and which threaten and jibe with the sanctity of private property. A second argument stems from the assertion that only within a formally organised property market can a true market\nd0ik | economy flourish. A third argument is the idea that legal title provides security against eviction and displacement, and provides the necessary incentives for home improvement and consolidation. As McLaughlin and de Soto argue\n0x0s | When people have formalized titles they feel their property is under their legal control and therefore have the incentive to invest their intelligence and work in improving it.\n4exe | They further add that when there is no formal title to provide security of tenure, planning horizons are shorter and there are no incentives to protect and improve property. Fourthly, it is argued that service providers cannot, or will not, introduce services until legalisation and full property entitlement are in place and secure. A fifth assertion is that tenure offers people a new source of collateral, thereby leveraging access to credit. Sixthly, there is an ideological component to regularisation, insofar as formal title 'integrates' the poor into the urban citizenry, inculcating a belief system that respects free markets, supports democracy and engenders respect for, and participation in, the tax and regulatory bases of city management.\n```",
