You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Provision of one reducing equivalent and O2 was sufficient to generate the same ensemble of products as those formed under multiple turnover conditions with surrogate redox partners (Figure 6B, Figure S19).
wtfz | DISCUSSION
qy1i | Steady-state analysis of product formation by AspB has revealed a significant inverse kinetic solvent isotope effect, implicating the use of an intermediate prior to CYP-I for the initiation of substrate dimerization. The competent formation of aspergilazine A under conditions when a second electron is omitted suggests that only a single reducing equivalent from a

Further support for the reactive nature of a ferric superoxide complex is provided through examination of the single-turnover KSIE of oxy-AspB decay, which reverts to a normal (i.e., kH/kp >1) value due to the suppression of available proton-linked uncoupling pathways.
uodj | Unlike analogous species in nonheme mono- and di-iron enzymes,4º the ferric-superoxide intermediate in CYPs has been largely considered catalytically inert47 and instead serves as the primary branchpoint between uncoupling via autox- idation and further reduction and proton-mediated O-O heterolysis. One notable exception is the CYP TxtE, which catalyzes the nitration of tryptophan." Transient absorption studies have shown that the ferric superoxide complex of TxtE reacts with nitric oxide (NO) gas to form a ferric peroxynitrite intermediate that subsequently undergoes a homolytic cleavage to form compound II (CYP-II) and release of an NO2 radical.48 Intriguingly, TxtE is also missing the conserved acid residue, which is replaced with a proline, underscoring the importance in the management of proton delivery in this process. Unlike AspB, the TxtE oxy-species is unreactive toward its substrate tryptophan but requires further "activation" by NO.49
k16v | The analogous oxy-species is used by the histidine-ligated heme enzyme family (recently designated as heme-dependent aromatic oxygenase (HDAO)50) that is historically defined by tryptophan 2,3 (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenases (IDO).51-53 TDO and IDO act on a very similar tryptophan substrate, and transient absorption experiments have shown that a ferric superoxide intermediate directly reacts with the substrate through a mechanism involving direct radical addition at the C2 position of the indole ring4 or epoxidation. The heterolytic O-O cleavage then furnishes a transient compound II species56 and a monooxygenated or epoxide product en route to dioxygenation.56,57 Thus, we also considered if AspB may initiate activation of cWP in a similar manner involving a cryptic monooxygenation, but such a mechanism is inconsistent with the normal KSIE for oxy-decay upon substrate N-H deuteration and the inhibitory nature of 3.
b2lm | The apparent reactivity of the AspB-oxy complex contrasts with synthetic heme-superoxo adducts, which are typically considered sluggish oxidants for HAT. The bond dissociation free energy (BDFE) of an indole N-H bond is estimated ~90 kcal/mol, and the DKP N-H is considerably higher. Numerous reports have demonstrated HAT on relatively weak O-H (BDFE ≤80 kcal/mol) substrates, -62 in accordance with the limited experimental data available of the resultant hydroperoxo species (OO-H BDFE ~70 kcal/ mol). Although the precise electronic origins for enabling HAT by AspB-oxy remain to be elucidated, it is likely that preorganization of the substrate in an optimized geometry is necessary to allow for such a reaction to occur and to thwart unwanted indole oxygenation.
ti7f | Based on the current findings, we propose a mechanism for AspB dimerization that is shown in Figure 7. The use of ferric- superoxide species as a primary oxidant may serve as a general stratagem to circumvent monooxygenation and forgo the nonproductive (and less controlled) oxidation of a redox-active substrate by compound I. Although the deuteration strategy employed here does not allow for precise assignment of the abstraction site (DKP vs indole N-H), the ferric-superoxide species may not have the sufficient oxidizing potential for abstraction of the DKP N-H group based on its higher bond

wtow | dissociation energy (BDE), consistent with the highly inhibitory nature observed upon substrate indole N-methyl- ation. Indole N-H HAT would then be envisioned to furnish a hydroperoxo species, bypassing the need for the I-helix acid residue for primary protonation. As we have shown that the I- helix alcohol residue (T244) is important for functional product formation in AspB, ensuing O-O heterolysis likely occurs to give rise to compound I and provide an additional oxidizing species for the downstream secondary activation required for subsequent dimerization. HAT by compound I would yield compound II, which would then need to auto- decay to regenerate the ferric water-bound resting state.
o22k | Our findings highlight a unique strategy that CYPs can use for selective diversification of natural products through C-C and C-N bond formation. This discovery not only expands the scope of CYP reactivity but may also prove valuable in leveraging these enzymes for chemoenzymatic DKP assembly. As both AspB and NzeB bypass the need for a second electron transfer step provided by a redox donor, more efficient turnover methods (e.g., light- or electrode-driven catalysis) can be envisioned to form high yields of these unique bioactive natural products.
