You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

p1l0 | Recent developments suggest that a-synuclein pathology spreads in a prion-like manner through synaptically connected regions in a manner consistent with Braak staging (Braak et al. 2003; Luk et al. 2012). The E-L system plays a prominent role in cell-to-cell transmission of preformed a-synuclein filaments, leading to the spread of phospho-a-synuclein pathology. Internalization of fibrillar a-synuclein occurs via endocytosis (as well as tunnelling nanotubules) and follows the neuronal endosomal pathway to lysosomal degradation (Rodriguez et al. 2018). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans, lymophocyte-activation gene 3, a3 isoform of Na+/K+ ATPase, and a few endocytic vesicle receptors are predicted to act as receptors for a-synuclein preformed fibrils (Holmes et al. 2013; Ihse et al. 2017; Mao et al. 2016; Shrivastava et al. 2015). In vitro studies suggest that internalized a- synuclein fibrils are localized in both early endosomes and late endolysosomes (Karpowicz et al. 2017; Lee et al. 2008b). The lipid bilayer of endosomes restricts cytoplasmic spillage, so most endocytosed a-synuclein is degraded by lysosomes. How a fraction of a-synuclein preformed fibrils escapes this barrier and goes on to initiate seeding is still unclear (Bieri et al. 2018). Studies of a-synuclein axonal transport predict that retrograde transport of a- synuclein preformed fibrils is mediated by endocytic vesicles and is twice as fast and more efficient than anterograde transport (Brahic et al. 2016). This strengthens the notion that PD pathology spreads retrogradely from the synaptic terminal to soma. The E-L system is also involved in exocytosis of fibrilized a-synuclein, facilitating its prion-like spread. An ER- bound enzyme with chaperone activity USP19 (Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 19) has been shown to deliver misfolded a-synuclein to late endosomes, which then fuses with the plasma membrane through a unique process called misfolding-associated protein secretion (Lee et al. 2016). Another recent study suggests that the DNAJ/Hsc70 complex could facilitate a-synuclein exocytosis (Fontaine et al. 2016). Overexpression of ATP13A2 and GBA is also noted to increase exocytosis of a-synuclein (Fernandes et al. 2016; Tsunemi et al. 2014). Together, these observations identify the E-L system as the primary conduit for the spread of a-synuclein-mediated pathology in PD.
1i8b | Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a multidomain large protein with both GTPase and kinase activity along with other domains for protein-protein interaction (Kett & Dauer 2012). Epidemiological, histopathological, and clinical investigations have all established LRRK2 gene mutations as the most common genetic cause of PD (PARK8, Table 1) (Paisan- Ruiz et al. 2004; Zimprich et al. 2004), with a considerable contribution to sporadic cases (Kett & Dauer 2012). Over 8identified LRRK2 mutations cause PD. The mutation at
5sfj | G2019S is the most common and is known to increase LRRK2's activity (Kett & Dauer 2012; Smith et al. 2006; West et al. 2005). LRRK2 functions have been explored through PD-related studies, in which increased G2019S kinase activity reveals its close association with the E-L system. LRRK2's role in vesicular trafficking, lysosomal homeostasis, and autophagy are well accepted. Phosphorylation by LRRK2 is essential for a subset of RAB GTPases' function of endolysosomal vesicular sorting and trafficking (Steger et al. 2017; Steger et al. 2016). In an overexpression system, RAB7L1 was noted to interact strongly with LRRK2 at the switch-II site (Steger et al. 2017), unlike as seen in in vitro kinase assays (Steger et al. 2016). Several LRRK2 mutations significantly affect RAB pathways, where variations in Rab7L1's interactions with LRRK2 have been identified to increase the risk of sporadic PD. In fact, recent GWAS identify RAB29 encoding RAB7L1 (PARK16, Table 1) as an independent risk gene for PD (Satake et al. 2009). Rab7L1 upregulation could attenuate LRRK2-induced toxicity in dopaminergic neurons (MacLeod et al. 2013). This is predicted to be functioning through VPS35 and VPS26 (Linhart et al. 2014). VPS35 also cooperates with LRRK2 to regulate SV recycling and dopaminergic synaptic release (Inoshita et al. 2017), thus suggesting a prominent role for the retromer complex in LRRK2- mediated PD pathogenesis.
vk4h | LRRK2 regulates lysosomal protein trafficking and morphology (Eguchi et al. 2018; Kuwahara et al. 2016). In LRRK2 mutants, perinuclear lysosomal clustering was noted, mediated by increased phosphorylation of RAB7 (Hockey et al. 2015). Two-pore channels are the calcium channels present on acidic vesicles of the E-L system and help in regulating their trafficking and fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes/endosomes (Calcraft et al. 2009). Abnormal lysosomal morphology and density seen in fibroblasts from patients with LRRK2 mutations could be reversed by inhibiting these two-pore channels (Hockey et al. 2015). Thus, these channels might be one potential mediator of E-L system dysfunction in LRRK2-associated PD. Lysosome-related proteins involved in PD such as Gcase1, Lamp2A and ATP13A2 are also downregulated in PD patients with LRRK2 mutations (Zhao et al. 2018), suggesting lysosomes are one of LRRK2's prime targets.
