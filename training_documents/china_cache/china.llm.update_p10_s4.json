        "content": "wak1 | Nonetheless, there were increased tensions between Hong Kong and Britain. The devaluation of the pound in nineteen sixty-seven had drastically affected public confidence in the British government. To add fuel to the fire, Britain's entry into the European Economic Community curtailed Hong Kong's textile exports to the British Isles under more restrictive quotas. London also increased Hong Kong's contribution to the maintenance of the British garrison from twenty-nine percent in nineteen seventy to seventy-five percent in nineteen seventy-eight. On the other hand, the nineteen sixty-seven riots had already demonstrated the significance of the 'China factor': a surge in Chinese nationalism could lead to violence and chaos, shattering political stability. Nationalism did not diminish but flourished in the early nineteen seventies, which could be observed from the emergence of patriotic social movements, such as the Chinese Language Campaign and the Senkaku Islands Movement. Given the uncertainty imposed by the end of the Cultural Revolution, the death of Mao and the fall of the Gang of Four after nineteen seventy-six, the state had to observe changing perceptions towards China. In this context, it was vital for the state to be fully informed of changing political attitudes and identities so that it could measure the success of its community-building project, continue fostering a sense of belonging among the community, and avoid any anti-colonial or British sentiments being exploited and turned into disturbances.\nwtfz | Attitudes towards colonial rule\nqy1i | The political culture in Hong Kong experienced changes in the nineteen seventies. Hong Kong Chinese used to be 'very cautious about saying anything adverse about the government in public'. Most complaints in newspapers tended to be anonymous. According to MOOD, such political inactivity could be explained by 'the persisting fatalism inherited from traditional attitudes formed by experience under successive Chinese governments', which discouraged people from contesting colonial policies and questioning misdeeds of the state. The perception that politics was dangerous and that ordinary people lacked capabilities to comprehend it could be found in a number of Cantonese proverbs, such as 'officials have two mouths' (a traditional saying which means that authorities could always find an excuse to justify their decisions), 'the poor should never attempt to fight the wealthy, or the wealthy to fight officialdom', and 'the governor of a prefecture can commit arson with impurity, but the people are not even allowed to light their lamps'. This attunes to the claims of scholars such as Lau Siu-kai, Kuan Hsin-chi, J. Stephen Hoadley, and Norman Miners, who asserted that administrative power was the prerogative of rulers in the history of China. However, when compared to the nineteen fifties, the public in the mid-nineteen seventies was 'much more prone to take issue with the government over what they consider to be unjust official action, believing that the incompetent, corrupt, or unfair officer should not, and will not, get away with his wrongdoings, in the face of\n1k9e | public exposure'. Knowing that the state was unlikely to suppress and arrest them, the grass-roots members of society started to 'speak up or stage protest actions'.\n5bjs | According to MOOD, popular political participation was the outcome of social development, emerging problems and challenges, and new policy responses to them. After the nineteen sixty-seven riots, the City District Officer Scheme was introduced to close the communication gap between the people and the government. Policies were publicized and explained to the public. Campaigns, such as 'Clean Hong Kong' and 'Fight Violent Crime', were launched to build up a positive image of the state. The Governor and high-ranked civil servants appeared in public more frequently to discuss policies and problems. People's confidence towards the government grew due to its responsiveness to public opinion in the Chinese Language Movement, the Godber affair, and the setting up of the Independent Commission Against Corruption in the first half of the nineteen seventies: 'many more people feel that the government is prepared to take a fair and honest attitude about its own failings and shortcomings'. As a result, not only was there an increase in public engagement in current affairs 'at all levels of society', but 'the traditional fear of authority or officialdom' had been 'greatly reduced'.\nuodj | Nonetheless, respondents still found the state's services and documents 'slow, time-consuming and complicated, difficult to understand', especially the colonial laws. While finding the staff in the City District Council 'largely unhelpful', they also believed that the high-ranked civil servants were 'adopting a rigid and unimaginative approach' in solving problems. The shift in political culture was not profound. Uneducated low-income earners were 'less aware of the essence of implications of the new style of open government'. Many still believed that the state was 'almighty' and only governed according to its interests. They remained 'largely indifferent to how Hong Kong is governed' as long as their lives were not affected. The working class paid little attention to issues outside their daily livelihood: 'subjects like the future of Hong Kong are too remote, and too much above them, to be of much interest'. It was also observed that there was 'no general public aspiration or pressure for constitutional reform' and ordinary people 'at large, are not interested in the mechanism or constitutional set-up of government'. According to MOOD, 'majority attitudes indicate a lack of enthusiasm about elections'.\nk16v | Shift of political culture led to tensions between the generations. Among the middle-aged and elderly, the period did not witness 'the creation of a new political and social climate'. Political conservatism persisted. To avoid 'rocking the boat', many of them advocated 'a style of strong government which should refrain from becoming too accommodating towards rabble-rousers'. The upper and middle classes were also 'staunch supporters of the status quo'. Many of them viewed political activism 'with dislike and concern' as they were worried that 'social order and discipline will inevitably be undermined' and perceived these informal means of political engagement as 'undignified and unbecoming of their status'. Although they often supported the state's policies publicly, in private, many expressed concerns over the increasingly 'liberal or accommodating' governing style, which they thought would 'give rise to escalating public aspirations' that were impossible to meet. The wealthy strata within the middle-aged and elderly groups conformed closest to Lau's description of 'utilitarianistic familism'. Rather than having strong emotional attachment to the colony, they stayed only because\nb2lm | 'living in Hong Kong offers many attractions'. The 'outward-looking' economy and its rising international status provided these people who possessed 'capital and entrepreneur qualities' with 'first class opportunities'. They could 'enjoy their wealth more cheaply, safely and freely' in the colony because of the low tax rate and social stability. Being in an 'overwhelming Chinese society', they had a higher social status through business and adopted the Chinese way of life while enjoying 'the full benefits of living in a cosmopolitan city'. Most of the professionals and middle-scale proprietors supported the existing social order because of instrumental concerns: 'they have by large succeeded in going some way up the social ladder, often through hard work and preserving effort, and do not wish to lose that position'.\nti7f | The young generation held 'significantly different, and largely less favorable, views of the government than their elders'. Many of them found the paternalistic type of government intolerable. MOOD predicted that some of them were going to demand more political participation and increased consultation, and become 'even more aggressive and presumptuous' towards the colonial government. Radicals among students argued that 'the government has become more enlightened and accommodating because it can see very well that there is no alternative'.",
