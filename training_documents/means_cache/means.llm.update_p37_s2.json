If it is for the covariate then this variable has a significant relationship to the outcome variable; if it is for the independent variable then the means (adjusted for the effect of the covariate) are significantly different across categories of this variable.\ng8rd | If you have generated specific hypotheses before the experiment use planned contrasts; if not, use post hoc tests.\nnns9 | For parameters and post hoc tests, look at the columns labelled Sig. to discover if your comparisons are significant (they will be if the significance value is less than zero point zero five). Use bootstrapping to get robust versions of these tests.\n9uwy | In addition to the assumptions in Chapter six, test for homogeneity of regression slopes by customizing the model to look at the independent variable times covariate interaction.",
