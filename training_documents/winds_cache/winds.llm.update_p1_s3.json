In October twenty twelve, jellyfish stranding on Cable Beach (density two point twenty Â±zero point forty-three ind. meters squared) was estimated at fifty-two point eight million individuals or fourteen thousand one hundred seventy-two tonnes wet weight along fifteen kilometers of beach. Reports of strandings after this period and up to two hundred fifty kilometers south of this location indicate even larger swarm biomass. Strandings of jellyfish were significantly associated with a two-day lag in conditions of small tidal ranges (less than five meters). More than ninety percent of strandings occurred two days after winds were blowing onshore, but with the small number of days when satellite wind data were available during the\njie2 | study period, this result was not statistically significant. Dedicated instrument measurements of meteorological parameters, rather than the indirect measures used in this study (satellite winds and modelled currents), may improve the predictability of such events and help authorities to plan for and manage swimming activity on beaches. We also show a high incidence of predation by C. mastigophora on bivalve larvae which may have a significant impact on the reproductive output of pearl oyster broodstock in the region.\nd0ik | Introduction\n0x0s | Jellyfish are a ubiquitous and readily observed component of marine plankton. They may exist in high\n4exe | densities as swarms (aggregations from local or distant sources usually brought together by oceanographic or behavioural processes) or blooms (high density, locally derived population). The different manifestations of high densities of jellyfish and how they are formed have been reviewed previously. However, there has been recent interest in using and understanding oceanographic processes to develop predictive capacity to forecast when jellyfish might swarm near the shore bringing them into contact with swimmers. The extent to which jellyfish biology and behavior can affect swarming and beach stranding has also gained recent attention. Jellyfish swarms at the coast cause other problems such as clogging power and desalination plant seawater intakes and fish mortality in aquaculture farms, and predictive capacity would assist in preparing for or preventing harmful and damaging effects of jellyfish swarms.\n0myz | Jellyfish swarms and blooms are natural phenomena, but their occurrence is increasingly being associated with anthropogenic disturbance and modification of the world's oceans and coastal seas. Climate change, overfishing, and coastal development have all been suggested as contributing to jellyfish swarms and blooms, although the evidence is often equivocal, and the evidence of a world-wide trend in jellyfish swarms and blooms is debated. The jellyfish swarms described in this study occurred in remote northwestern Australia, where anthropogenic impacts are regarded as being very low on a global scale, offering an opportunity to examine the drivers of swarms as well as their ecological, social, and economic significance.\nxh3i | The jellyfish Crambione mastigophora Maas nineteen-o-three is recorded from the eastern Indian Ocean and western Pacific. Despite its apparently common and sometimes abundant occurrence in north-western Australia (this study), Indonesia, the \"Malayan Archipelago\", Sri Lanka and the \"Truk Islands\" (Micronesia), there is little published information on C. mastigophora beyond the taxonomic texts. C. mastigophora is capable of forming large swarms in north-western Australia where they are a nuisance due to stinging swimmers. Hamner & Dawson categorised it as a putative bloomer on the basis that if they are fished commercially, they must be very abundant, at least seasonally. However, there have been no previous studies anywhere describing the nature, extent, and time course of C. mastigophora swarms. Similarly, there are no published studies on any aspect of the biology of C. mastigophora.\nkg3t | This study resulted from an unplanned opportunity which arose when very large swarms of C. mastigophora washed ashore in a small population center on the only regularly lifeguard patrolled beach in what is a very remote part of Australia in twenty twelve. The purpose of the paper is to record the incidence and scale of these, and earlier C. mastigophora swarms off the western coast of Australia, determine whether wind, currents, and tides play an influential and predictable role in beach stranding events of these jellyfish, and outline the likely socioeconomic and ecological implications of swarms of this species.\nlvae | Materials and methods\no9sc | Occurrence of swarms\n121u | Details on the occurrence of C. mastigophora swarms in nineteen seventy-six, two thousand, two thousand six, two thousand seven, two thousand ten, two thousand eleven, two thousand twelve, and two thousand thirteen were collated from a series of eye witness accounts by the authors and their associates in two thousand ten, two thousand twelve, and two thousand thirteen, and others as well as reports to the Western Australian Museum, the Western Australian Department of the Environment, the Broome Shire Council, the Eighty Mile Beach Caravan Park, and from news reports. For the period of detailed investigation on Cable Beach in two thousand twelve, daily records of jellyfish strandings were made by Cable Beach life guards, for the period from twelve August to thirty-one October.\nzh03 | Biomass of stranded jellyfish\n1mvw | To determine the biomass of jellyfish washed up on Cable Beach, we first sampled jellyfish offshore to determine the size and weight distribution of the jellyfish population. We then compared the size distribution of jellyfish on the beach with those offshore using a Mann-Whitney U test, and finding no difference, we applied the average weight of the jellyfish sampled offshore to counts of jellyfish washed ashore. A total of one hundred fifty-nine individuals of C. mastigophora were collected with a dip net offshore of Gantheaume Point on nineteen September twenty twelve at seventeen point nine seven seven six one four degrees south, one twenty-two point one seven three three zero zero degrees east from a six-meter boat, taking care to collect all individuals that could be reached from the boat in the top five hundred centimeters of water to ensure no bias in size selection. These were collected into buckets and then measured on shore for maximum\n```",
