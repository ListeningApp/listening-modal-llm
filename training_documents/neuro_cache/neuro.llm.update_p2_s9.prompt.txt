You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

8hul | The visual buffer is a set of topographically organized areas in the occipital lobe (see, for example, Felleman & Van Essen 1991; Van Essen 1985). These areas preserve, roughly, the spatial structure of images striking the back of the retina (and are therefore called retinotopically mapped areas), and have a key role in organizing visual input into perceptual units. The visual buffer serves both as a structure (as discussed below) and a process (by actively organizing input into perceptual units).
87vz | The attention window is a process that selects some localized portion of the visual buffer for more detailed processing (Cave & Kosslyn 1989; Posner & Petersen 1990; Treisman & Gelade 1980).
ym66 | The pattern selected by the attention window is sent along two major pathways for further processing. The object-properties-encoding system analyses object proper- ties (e.g. shape and colour) and runs from the occipital lobe to the inferior temporal lobe in the monkey; the human analogue seems to be the inferior temporal and/or middle temporal gyrus (see Haxby et al. 1991; Levine 1982; Mishkin et al. 1983; Sergent et al. 1992; Ungerleider & Mishkin 1982). There is good evidence that this system actually stores visual memories (reviewed by Kosslyn 1994). Input from the attention window is matched to these stored representations, leading to object recognition.
l0a3 | The second major pathway is the spatial-properties- encoding system, which encodes properties such as location, size and orientation, and runs from the occipital lobe to the posterior parietal lobe. There is considerable evidence that this system has a key role in guiding move- ments (see, for example, Goodale & Milner 1992). Not only are the areas in this system active when people or animals engage in spatial tasks, but also damage to it disrupts the encoding of spatial properties (see, for example, Andersen 1987; reviewed by Kosslyn 1994).
u8nw | The two pathways must converge somewhere in memory; this inference is dictated by the simple fact that one can recall where things are located (e.g. the furniture in one's living room, objects on one's desk), which requires the cross-indexing of object and spatial properties. The object-properties-encoding system stores modality-specific visual representations. However, much of our knowledge is not modality specific; we can access this knowledge by multiple routes. For example, we can identify a cat when we see it, hear its meow, or feel it snuggling against our shin. This underlines an important distinction: recognition occurs when an input matches a stored unimodal repre- sentation, whereas identification occurs when we access information associated with that stimulus. When we recognize something, we know only that we have perceived it before, that it is familiar; when we identify something, we know that it has a certain name, belongs to specific categories, is found in certain locales, and so forth. Seeing a face and knowing that you have seen it before but not knowing when, where, or the person's name or other particulars, is an example of recognition without identification.
l2v9 | Such reasoning led us to posit an associative memory, which we hypothesize to rely on the angular gyrus and Area 19 (largely on the basis of clinical findings (see Kosslyn 1994)). Representations in associative memory are amodal ('abstract') and multimodal, and store
afbe | associations to objects, scenes and events. These represen- tations are activated by converging input from the object- properties-encoding and spatial-properties-encoding systems.
78r8 | In situations in which an object cannot be recognized well (because the input does not match well any previously stored representations), the best-matching representation in associative memory is treated as a hypothesis about the identity of the stimulus. The information look-up process accesses stored information associated with the hypothesized object, and uses such information to guide a top-down search. The information look-up process essentially shunts information from one part of the brain to another.
320g | According to our theory, information stored in associa- tive memory is used during a top-down search not only to guide the mechanisms that shift attention (to look for a distinctive part or characteristic that should be present if the hypothesis about the stimulus' identity is correct), but also to 'prime' representations in the object-properties- encoding system. One of the more striking facts about the neuroanatomy of the visual system is that virtually all areas connected by afferent fibres are also connected by efferent fibres (i.e. the connections are reciprocal); there is an enormous amount of information flowing backwards in the visual system (see, for example, Felleman & Van Essen 1991). We conjecture that the efferent connections are used for 'cooperative computation', and that the sort of priming posited here is at the heart of such processing. This sort of priming facilitates the encoding of an expected part or property (possibly by lowering thresh- olds, or by increasing sampling rates). Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is critical in implementing the informa- tion look-up system (see, for example, Damasio 1985; Goldman-Rakic 1987, 1988; Luria 1980; see also Kosslyn et al. 1995b).
tp8g | Finally, there are processes that actually shift attention. These attention shift processes are implemented in several parts of the brain. Posner & Petersen (1990) distinguish between three different components of this system, one in the posterior parietal lobe that disengages attention from its current location; one in the superior colliculus, frontal eye fields and other neural structures that guides the attention window, as well as the eyes, head and body to a new location; and one in the thalamus that re-engages attention at a new location.
gxfd | Kosslyn et al. (1994) set out to discover whether this theory could be generalized to humans. In our view, a good neuroimaging experiment hinges on comparing two tasks that are minimally different. In most cases, it is best if only a single aspect of the task is varied at a time; if more than one characteristic is varied, the variables should be manipulated orthogonally (keeping everything else constant while manipulating each one). Thus, in this study we examined the same task, deciding whether words name pictures, but in two conditions: in one, the pictures were presented from canonical (typical) points of view, whereas in the other the pictures were presented from non-canonical (atypical) points of view. Counter- balancing over subjects ensured that the same pictures and words were used equally often in both conditions. Our reasoning was that the canonical views would match stored representations in the object-properties-encoding
s2v1 | system, and hence be recognized well, and then would be identified immediately. In this case, although all of the other processes would be running at the outset, they would not need to run to completion to perform the task. (Figure 1 is misleading in that it might suggest that each process waits for the products of the previous one before operating. On the contrary, there is good reason to assume that all parts of the brain are 'running' at the same time, and that what changes during task perfor- mance is how intensively each one is operating. When processing shifts over time, this is reflected by increased activity in areas that implement the relevant processes.)
