        "content": "wtow | abortion was similar to other studies examining medication abortion in the late first trimester and medication self-management after thirteen weeks using an accompaniment model. Those self-managing after ten weeks in our study also tended to have experienced shipping delays and some received modified instructions according to the World Health Organization protocol for medication abortion at twelve weeks and over and additional support from Aid Access. In addition, no ectopic pregnancies were reported after using the medications and indeed a small number were diagnosed quickly by the service at the time of initial contact.\no22k | This study has several limitations. The first is that abortion outcomes were self-reported by people who self-managed. However, since these abortions take place outside of the formal healthcare system, self-reporting is by definition the only possible method of follow-up. Moreover, a previous large randomized controlled trial showed that self-assessment of the outcome of medication abortion was non-inferior to clinical follow-up, indicating that people are capable of determining on their own whether or not their abortion has been successful. Since an examination of the outcomes of medication abortions taking place outside the formal healthcare setting cannot be dealt with by a randomized controlled trial or clinical trial, we have drawn on the best available \"real world\" data to answer these important questions.\nnwfz | Second, although the seventy percent follow-up rate in this study is incomplete, it is on par with or better than many clinical studies, since most outcomes are only recorded if patients decide to follow up with the clinic.\nnvfy | Moreover, we took a more conservative approach than most clinical studies in that we did not consider those for whom no outcome data were available as presumed successful abortions. Third, while self-reporting could be subject to recall or social desirability bias, the short time period between the abortion and the collection of follow-up information should minimize recall bias.\nmror | While treatment for serious adverse events was a rarely reported outcome in our study, rates were still higher than those reported in studies of abortions taking place in the clinical setting. We note, however, that we are not able to verify whether the treatment received by users of the service who did engage with the formal healthcare system was appropriate to their situation. For example, most of those who reported receiving surgical intervention also received antibiotics, which may have been given prophylactically or to treat an existing infection. Studies in other countries have shown that rates of intervention and additional treatment during clinical abortion follow-up are highly variable, especially in countries where hospital staff are not trained to care for abortion patients. While we did examine whether any deaths were reported to the service, we were of course unable to fully assess whether any deaths occurred in the group that did not provide follow-up information.\nzlxc | It is also important to consider the rates of self-reported adverse events shown in this study in the context of the other possible outcomes for people in the United States who cannot access in-clinic abortion care. Between two hundred thousand and one point two million unsafe abortions are estimated to have taken place per year in the United States in the nineteen fifties and nineteen sixties pre-Roe, with the resulting burden of morbidity and mortality falling disproportionately on racially minoritized people. While we do not expect the same prevalence of unsafe abortion today, we cannot assume that none will occur. Moreover, those forced to carry a pregnancy to term would also be at higher risk than those who self-manage using Aid Access. Rates of hemorrhage postpartum in the United States are over five times higher than those reported in this study, with Black women at disproportionately high risk.\nk0bw | The trajectory of highly restricted access to in-clinic abortion in the United States and the future possibility of full abortion bans in some states means that self-managed abortion is likely to become an increasingly used alternative. The FDA recently permanently suspended the in-person dispensing requirement on mifepristone, paving the way for expanded clinic-based telemedicine abortion services. However, at least nineteen states already have laws banning telemedicine for medication abortion and in these jurisdictions the FDA ruling will have little effect. These states are also the ones with the highest rates of requests to Aid Access. In the majority of United States states, self-management is not illegal, and clinicians who may provide follow-up care have no reporting obligation. It is important to note, however, that there have been\naq5a | Articles\nsc5y | cases of unjust prosecution for alleged self-management since two thousand, with populations already subject to increased surveillance and biased treatment, including people with low incomes and racially minoritized people, at highest risk. While legal risks remain, our findings demonstrate that self-management using medications provided through online telemedicine is a safe, effective, and acceptable option for people in the United States and thus it is both an important method of harm reduction and a means of preserving reproductive autonomy.\n0yab | Contributors\nw95z | ARAA conceived of the original research question.
