You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

gc7v | the mid-1980s, led to Pacific hake being declared overfished (i.e. below 25% of - average - unfished spawning biomass) in the United States in 2002. The strong 1999 year class was subsequently observed in the acoustic survey and fisheries, and a new assessment and abundance estimate led to the stock being declared rebuilt in 2004.
wqfv | The allocation issue was resolved with the development and eventual implementation of the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada on Pacific Hake/Whiting (the Treaty), which was signed in November 2003. The Treaty specifies a process for developing annual stock assessments and total allowable catch (TAC), including a default harvest rate of F40% and fixed allocations of 73.88% and 26.12% for the United States and Canada, respectively. The Hake Treaty established a Joint Management Commission (JMC) that decides the annual TAC. JMC decisions are guided by the terms of the Treaty and the JMC's three advisory bodies consisting of the Joint Technical Committee (JTC), the Scientific Review Group (SRG) and an Advisory Panel. The JTC conducts the annual stock assessment and develops potential yield amounts for JMC consideration. The SRG assures the technical integrity of the stock assessment and the assessment's potential yield estimates. The Advisory Panel is composed of hake industry participants from the United States and Canada, who provide their perspectives about the fishery.
j30a | Management of the coastal Pacific hake fishery is shared among the JMC, who recommends the annual TAC, the U.S. NMFS (NOAA Fisheries) and the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), which are responsi- ble for domestic management of their countries fisheries. In the United States, NOAA Fisheries receive advice from the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC), which recommends specific management and enforcement measures. Canada gives priority to domestic fisheries in allocating yield between domestic and joint venture fisheries.
7bdk | An Individual Vessel Quota (IVQ) system was implemented for the British Columbia trawl fleet in 1997, with allocation based on a combination of vessel size and landings history. Although vessels may deliver joint venture hake quota to domestic shore-side processors, they are not permitted to deliver domestic allocation to joint venture/processor operations at sea. There is no direct allocation of quota to individual shoreside processors. IVQ holders declare the proportion of their hake quota that will be landed in the domestic market, and shoreside processors must secure catch from vessel license holders (Devitt, 2009).
fim0 | In the United States, yield is allocated among coastal tribes and the three domestic sectors. Washington coastal tribes have a treaty right to request amounts of fish to conduct fisheries within their respective usual and accus- tomed fishing areas. The Makah tribe has been full participants in the hake fishery since 1996. Beginning in 2009, the Quileute tribe has been requested and allocated an amount but has yet to harvest any hake. The Quinault tribe has also expressed interest in the hake fishery.
ojro | A formal allocation structure for the U.S. non-tribal fishery sectors was developed by the PFMC and implemented by NOAA Fisheries in 1997. Each year, the non-tribal allocation is divided among the shore-based trawl sector (42%), the mothership sector (24%) and the catcher-processor sector (34%). This action stabilised the fishery and resolved a highly contentious allocation battle and alleviated the race to fish. The allocation provides each group with a relative amount of stability in business planning by reducing the excessive competitive pressures associated with an open-access, derby style fishery: it slowed the pace of the fishery and opened opportunities for the fishery to act more rationally, improve product quality and expand product forms.
l6t9 | Shortly after the 1997 allocation agreement, the companies licensed to operate in the at-sea catcher-processor sector of the U.S. Pacific hake fishery formed the Pacific Whiting Conservation Cooperative (PWCC) to promote rational harvest, optimal utilisation and minimal waste in the fishery. The PWCC fishing cooperative ended the race-for-fish in the catcher-processor sec- tor 14 years before the comprehensive rationalisation of the U.S. Pacific hake fishery. Their efforts resulted in decreased bycatch and waste, improved product quality and reduced fishing effort. The PWCC also sponsors scientific research, including stock assessment-related projects and bycatch avoidance programs. The cooperative model developed by the PWCC was later adopted in other fish- eries, such as the walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) fishery off Alaska.
1ujy | Management of the U.S. fishery transitioned in 2011 to a fully rationalised fishery, with an individual quota share program for the shoreside fishery and formal cooperatives for the mothership sector in addition to those for the catcher-processor sector. Bycatch of other groundfish species is strictly managed under the quota share system in the shoreside hake fishery, while sector-specific overfished rockfish species catch limits are used to ensure their minimal bycatch in the mothership and catcher-processor fisheries. Endangered Species Act listed salmonid impacts are managed under the aegis of a NOAA Fisheries Biological Opinion, for which specific measures include closed areas, seasonal fishery structure and overall limits on Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) bycatch.
qzor | Mid-water trawl nets are required in the U.S. hake fishery. These are four-seam nets designed to catch schooling fish such as walleye pollock and Pacific hake, whose schools tend to behave in unison. Bycatch of non-hake species in the Pacific hake fishery is generally quite low, as Pacific hake tend to aggregate in large acoustically recognisable schools in the pelagic zone and mid-water trawl gear is fished off the bottom minimising interactions with non-hake species. Nonetheless, bycatch of limiting rockfish species has occasionally been an issue. The U.S. non-tribal hake fishery sectors are held to hard bycatch limits that, if exceeded, can result in closure of non-tribal fisheries, to limit impacts on certain depleted rockfish species. Prior to 2009, the rockfish bycatch limits were not sector specific; that is, high bycatch in one sector could close the fishery for all the non-tribal sectors. In both 2007 and 2008, there were mid-season closures due to bycatch of limiting species, but the
a0by | Biology, fisheries, assessment and management of Pacific hake
u1ky | fishery was reopened later in the year once bycatch quota was reallocated from other fisheries. Despite these closures, about 90% of the U.S. hake TAC was achieved in both those years, similar to other recent years without closures. The bycatch limits were applied at the specific sector level beginning in 2009, minimising the potential for one sector to affect the other sectors. Under the trawl rationalisation program, bycatch in the shoreside hake fishery is now managed using a quota share system.
htm9 | The three U.S. non-tribal sectors track tow-by-tow catch and bycatch amounts using real-time catch information collected by fishery observers. When the rare high bycatch tow occurs, that information is shared with the rest of the fleet so that other vessels can avoid fishing in the area of high bycatch. The U.S. hake industry also works in partnership with NOAA Fisheries in testing newly developed bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) specifically designed for the hake fishery. Lomeli and Wakefield (2012) tested two open escape window BRD designs, with the goal of providing a tool to reduce the bycatch of Chinook salmon and rockfish in the hake fishery. The most successful design reduced bycatch by about 80% for Chinook salmon and 20% for widow rockfish (Sebastes entomelas).
