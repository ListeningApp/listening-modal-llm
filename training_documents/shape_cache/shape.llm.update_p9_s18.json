        "content": "xjyk | Statistical analysis\nmt0f | We undertook all statistical analysis with SPSS, with initial screening in Excel. Significance for all tests was determined at the P is less than or equal to point zero five level. We interpret effect sizes and power requirements in line with Cohen's widely accepted benchmarks.\nawab | Alternative measurement definitions\nixcc | We used Kappa Measure of Agreements to gauge the level of agreement between the FFIT categorical classifications under DS1, DS2, and DS3 measurement definitions, investigating hypothesis one. High agreement indicates high stability in the classification. Table two shows how many participants fit each of the FFIT's body shapes, according to differential measurement definitions. We selected the hourglass body as the reference shape because it was the most common in DS1: FFIT's 'standard' interpretation.\n8p6h | Alternative waist definition's measurement impact We used T-Tests to investigate the differences between alternative waist measurement definitions.\npmgl | test one - Association of Waist - investigates hypothesis two: the difference in waist measurements taken at the S o B plus four point zero centimeters and S o B plus six point three five centimeters regions. T-test two - Association of Waist Height - investigates hypothesis three: the difference in waist heights taken at the S o B plus four point zero centimeters and S o B plus six point three five centimeters regions.\n90no | Shoulder measurement's predictive capability\njt0y | We used Multinomial Logistic Regression to predict the FFIT body shape classification from shoulder measurements, investigating hypothesis four. Our model's dependent variable is the FFIT body shape classification. Our factors are shoulder-to-shoulder (horizontal), shoulder-to-shoulder (calliper), and shoulder girth (full). We used Hosmer-Lemeshow tests for each pair of shoulder measurements to assess Goodness of Fit to the multinomial logistic regression's model, using the same variables.\nqb7o | We used ANOVA to investigate whether the FFIT's categorical variables associate with alternative shoulder measurements (scale variables). Our ANOVA test's variable is Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal), with groupings: the FFIT body shape classification. We investigate Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal) with ANOVA because it is the most potent predictor of the FFIT's body shape classification according to our multinomial logistic regression model. As multiple comparisons in post hoc analysis increase the risk of Type One errors, we apply a Bonferroni adjustment to p zero point zero zero seven, mitigating Type One errors' risk.\noae5 | Post hoc power analysis\ns0fl | We conducted post hoc power analysis for parametric statistics - in conjunction with calculating sample size based on power calculations - to mitigate Type Two errors caused by underpowered samples. We used our statistical analysis' results - i.e. mean difference, standard deviation, and significance - with sample size as inputs for post hoc power analysis with G*Power. All post hoc power analysis tests showed adequate power Pi is greater than point eight under commonly accepted power guidelines.\n43ia | Results and analysis\n3g2y | Comparison of body shape classifications following the FFIT and SizeUK definitions\ngc7v | Investigating hypothesis one, a Kappa Measurement Of Agreement test revealed negligible agreement between the FFIT categorical classifications under different measurement definitions: DS1 and DS2\nwqfv | K (N equals one six seven nine) equals zero point three six nine, p is less than zero point zero one, DS1 and DS3 K (N equals one six seven nine) equals zero point four one zero, p is less than zero point zero one, and DS2 and DS3 K (N equals one six seven nine) equals zero point three five six, p is less than zero point zero one. Table three presents the inter-shape agreement for DS1, DS2, and DS3. Between twenty-one point nine percent and thirty-nine point six percent of participants are categorized into different body shapes, measured by disagreement between measurement definitions in Table three.\nj30a | While rectangle, inverted triangle, and top hourglass show a high level of shape classification agreement under different measurement definitions, hourglass, triangle, bottom hourglass, and spoon show low shape-classification agreement; below fifty percent.\n7bdk | We, therefore, accept Hypothesis one.\nfim0 | Association of waist measurement placement\nojro | Investigating Hypothesis two, a paired-sample t-test revealed waist measurements significantly decrease when taken within Size UK's S o B plus four point zero centimeters region M equals seventy-nine point three nine, S D equals twelve point six four compared to being taken within the FFIT's S o B plus six point three five centimeters region (FFIT) M equals seventy-eight point one three, S D equals twelve point six four, t equals thirty-two point zero three, p is less than zero point zero one (two-tailed). The t-test achieved one minus beta error probability equals one point zero, Effect size D Z equals zero point eight: satisfying our statistical power requirements. The mean decrease was one point two six centimeters, with a ninety-five percent confidence interval ranging from negative one point three three centimeters to negative one point one eight centimeters. The eta-squared statistic (zero point three eight) indicates a large effect size.\nl6t9 | Seventy point three percent of participants had a waist circumference smaller within the FFIT's S o B plus six point three five centimeters region than those whose smallest waist circumference lay within Size UK's S o B plus four point zero centimeters region. Waist measurements are, therefore, smaller when the 3D body scanner searched for the narrowest point within a larger waist region starting from the S o B.\n1ujy | We, therefore, accept Hypothesis two.\nqzor | Association of waist height\na0by | Investigating hypothesis three, a paired-sample t-test of the waist's height taken at the Size UK's S o B plus four point zero centimeters region",
