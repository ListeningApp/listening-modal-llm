You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

nvfy | lymphocyte count < 1.2 cells/uL x 103, which is the lower limit of normal at our institution, persisting beyond 72 hr after sepsis diagnosis [31]). Clinical outcomes included the delta-SOFA score (change in SOFA score based on laboratory studies and vital signs from the 24-hr period prior to the start of the intervention compared to score based on data from the 24-hr period after completion of the intervention), 28-day hospital-free days, 28-day ventilator-free days, acquisition of secondary infections, and 28-day mor- tality. Secondary infections were defined as new pos- itive cultures or new antibiotics started after 48 hours and documentation of a new confirmed infection by the treating clinical team.
mror | The safety outcomes of interest were vasopressor dose (expressed as norepinephrine-equivalent dose), HR, and respiratory rate.
zlxc | Immunological Testing
k0bw | Immunological testing was performed by laboratory technicians blinded to participant group allocation. Quantification of monocyte HLA-DR was performed according to the Demaret method (43), as previously described (28). Whole blood was incubated with BD Quantibrite anti-HLA-DR/anti-monocyte stain (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA), lysed using RBC Lysis Buffer (BioLegend, San Diego, CA), and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. Samples were acquired on a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson) with a five-color up- grade (CyTech, Fremont, CA). Flow files were acquired and analyzed in CellQuest Pro (Becton-Dickinson). Antibodies bound per cell (AB/c) were calculated by standardizing HLA-DR geomean fluorescent intensity of monocytes to BD Quantibrite-phycoerythrin beads (Becton-Dickinson).
aq5a | CD3/CD28-induced IFN-y production was deter- mined using an Enzyme-Linked Immunospot (ELISpot) assay, as previously described (44). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells harvested from whole blood plated at a standardized density, 5×105 cells per well, using the Vi-Cell counter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) in wells coated with biotinylated capture antibody spe- cific to IFN-y. Cells were incubated overnight with Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 media (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) containing anti-CD3/anti-CD28 (BioLegend). IFN-y was detected using a colorimetric reagent kit (Strep-AP and BCIP-NBT; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Images from the ELISpot plates
sc5y | (made by MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA; and ac- quired through Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) were analyzed on ImmunoSpot 7.0 plate reader and software (Cellular Technologies Limited, Shaker Heights, OH). The number of spots, representing cells producing IFN- y, and mean spot size were recorded. The means of two identically treated plates run in duplicate were calculated.
0yab | Sample Size Determination
w95z | To detect a difference in HLA-DR expression of 12,000 AB/c with a power of 80% using a two-sided a = 0.05, a total of 44 sepsis participants (22 patients per arm) were required. The detectable difference in HLA-DR expres- sion was the magnitude of the difference in patients with who did and did not experience an increase in body temperature of 1.5℃ within 24 hours of sepsis diagnosis in our preliminary data (41). Anticipating control group mortality of 20% prior to acquisition of the postintervention blood sample, enrollment of 56 participants was planned.
0i1k | Statistical Analysis
dqlg | Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis re- gardless of whether temperature goals were met in the intervention group. Descriptive statistics are pre- sented as counts, means, and medians, as appropriate. Temperature and care-associated variables were com- pared using t tests, repeated measures analysis of vari- ance (ANOVA), Mann-Whitney U tests, or chi-square tests as appropriate. The primary HLA-DR and sec- ondary serum IFN-y analyses were performed among participants who had nonmissing values for both the baseline and follow-up immune outcomes using re- peated measures ANOVA. Hospital-free days and ven- tilator-free days were compared using nonparametric tests. To ensure that any 28-day mortality difference observed was not attributable to confounding by illness severity, we conducted a post hoc multivariable logistic regression analysis, including predictors of both treat- ment group assignment and enrollment SOFA score. All analyses were conducted in Stata v.16.1 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX).

ohh7 | covariates at randomization. The most common source of infection was pneumonia (n = 29), and the most common reason for exclusion was concurrent immune suppression (Table 1).
vbni | The temperature in participants randomized to ther- apeutic warming during the study period was higher than those allocated to usual care (repeated measures ANOVA <LATEX>\left. p < 0 . 0 0 1 \right)</LATEX> (Fig. 1). Twenty-six participants (93%) in the warming group achieved target tempera- ture, with 18 (69%) reaching the target within 6 hours. The median time to target temperature was 3 hours (interquartile range, 2-4hr) in the warming group (Supplemental Table 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/ H32). Ten participants (36%) had warming terminated prior to 48 hours, with the most common reason being extubation during the intervention period <LATEX>\left( n = 5 \right)</LATEX> (Supplemental Table 2, http://links.lww.com/CCM/ H33). Two participants had missing immune bio- marker values, one due to death prior to sample being drawn and one due to misplacement of the sample (these cases were excluded from immune biomarker analysis). Corticosteroid therapy was administered during the ICU stay (after randomization) for nine control participants (32%) and eight intervention par- ticipants (29%).
dgcw | Immunological Outcomes
gvwz | HLA-DR expression at enrollment was similar be- tween the two groups (difference 63.8, AB/c; 95% CI, -3,336.8 to 3,464.4). For our primary outcome,
sk5m | there was no difference between treatment and control groups in monocyte HLA-DR expression following the 48-hour intervention period (differ- ence, -1,310.4; 95% CI, -4,537.5 to 1,916.8; Fig. 2). Overall, patients who died had lower HLA-DR ex- pression at enrollment (mean 6,522.4 vs 10,438.5;
qws8 | <LATEX>\left. p = 0 . 0 3 \right) .</LATEX> CD3/CD28-induced IFN-y production was similar between groups at baseline (difference, -231.1; 95% CI, -528.5 to 66.2), and no difference was observed at 3-4 days (difference, -38.0; 95% CI, -220.4 to 144.4). Persistent lymphopenia was similar between the groups (50% vs 43%; difference, -7%; 95% CI, -33 to 19; Supplemental Table 3, http://links.lww.com/ CCM/H34).
