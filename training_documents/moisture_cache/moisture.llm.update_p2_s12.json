Standardization activities and applications include both types of constructions.\n1o7p | MATERIALS FOR MOISTURE IMPERVIOUS SHEATHS\ncp13 | Plastic Coated Metallic Tapes\nbgre | For many years, a plastic coated aluminum product has been in widespread use as a moisture barrier in telecommunication cables and low voltage power, control and instrument cables. The aluminum is coated with a copolymer of polyethylene which forms a highly moisture resistant bond to the aluminum.\n57lp | The copolymer is adhesively compatible with low, linear low, medium and high density polyethylene jacketing materials as well as chlorinated polyethylene and the zero-halogen jacketing materials. These latter two materials are used when ignition suppression is required. As noted in the previous section, coated aluminum is the laminate of choice in combination with neutral wires or wire shields. The use of coated aluminum tapes minimizes the added cost for moisture barrier protection.\nukth | Plastic coated copper is the material of choice when the moisture barrier serves a dual role of both shield and moisture barrier. Coated copper offers several benefits as a moisture barrier. First it forms terminations having excellent electrical stability. Second, it offers corrosion resistance. Third, because of its conductivity, it allows the moisture barrier to be used as the neutral in many instances. The modified copolymer used on the copper forms a long term moisture resistant bond.\nkpvt | This copolymer is also compatible with the wide variety of polyethylene jackets in use by the industry as well as chlorinated polyethylene and the zero-halogen materials.\njie2 | A new family of coated aluminum, steel, or copper products has been developed which are adhesively compatible with polyvinyl chloride.\nd0ik | Cushion Layer\n0x0s | A cushion layer is used between the core and moisture barrier sheath to absorb the thermal expansion of the core during load cycling. One type of material is a non-woven textile tape which incorporates a swellable powder to achieve water blocking. A swellable powder is applied to a non-woven substrate and a very thin, porous, non-woven cover is laminated on top. Upon contact with water, the powder absorbs up to five hundred times its weight and swells. The swelling produces a jelly that exudes through the porous cover. This jelly forms a dam in the cable interstices that eliminates the longitudinal water flow under the moisture barrier. The intrinsic porosity of the non-woven textile allows immediate wetting of the powder and allows migration of the jellied powder to fill all interstices of the cable. If heat generated within the cable drives the water out, the jelly returns to powder form. It is reactivated when contacted again with water.\n4exe | The non-woven aspect of the tape also allows it to act as a cushion layer to protect the moisture barrier sheath from expansion and contraction of the insulation that occurs during electrical loading of the cable. These tapes are rated ninety degrees Celsius for continuous use and can withstand one hundred fifty degrees Celsius during short term emergency use. They can also withstand the two hundred thirty degrees Celsius or so exposure that can occur during cable manufacture. Non-woven tapes can be impregnated with carbon black to provide good semi-conducting properties.\n0myz | More recently, another type of cushion layer has been developed based on a semi-conductive cross-linked polyethylene foam.\nxh3i | Adhesives For Sealing\nsyiw | A hot melt adhesive is inserted into the overlap of the metallic moisture barrier to aid in the sealing of the overlap. The use of hot melt adhesives provides a reliable method of sealing the overlap during continuous cable production. The desirable characteristics of hot melts for use in moisture barrier cable include one, adhesive compatibility with the coated metal laminate used as the moisture barrier; two, compatibility with any lubricating oils used to facilitate forming of the laminate; three, moisture resistant bonds; four, bond stability; and five, low viscosity to allow uniform spreading within the overlap. Adhesion and cable performance studies have indicated that a hot melt based on a blend of polyamide and ethylene vinyl acetate are suitable for application in power cable.\nkg3t | Strand Filling Material\nlvae | A recent technological advance in materials for power cable has been the development of filling materials for the conductors. These materials are applied by an extrusion process or pumped into place during the stranding operation. The fillers block the longitudinal migration of moisture in the conductors. They prevent accumulation of moisture in the strand during cable manufacture, storage, installation and use. These materials have no adverse effect on splicing and termination procedures.\no9sc | Jackets\n121u | As noted in the section describing the coated metal laminates, it is most important that jackets for use on moisture barrier cable have adhesive compatibility with the coatings on the laminate. Another key requirement is the degree of ignition suppressance required for the cable. Polyethylene jackets in a variety of densities and types are chosen when flame resistance is not a consideration. Chlorinated polyethylene is selected when flame resistance and chemical resistance are required. Zero-halogen jackets are selected when there is a need to minimize the emission of smoke and corrosive fumes. Polyvinyl chloride jackets are chosen for general purpose applications where ignition suppression and lower cost are the main considerations.\nzh03 | STANDARDIZATION ACTIVITIES WITH MOISTURE IMPERVIOUS CABLE\n1mvw | Background\n6d4s | There are several industry groups working on standardization of moisture impervious cable. These activities are taking place during the introductory and developmental stages of moisture impervious cable, before widespread commercialization. The standards-making process is helping to shape the moisture impervious cable technology, rather than just reacting to the developing technology. The process is dynamic, coming from the top-down.\nmqah | IEC Activities\nxxr8 | International Electrotechnical Commission eight hundred forty, \"Tests for Power Cables with Extruded Insulation for Rated Voltages above thirty kilovolts up to one hundred fifty kilovolts\" was published in nineteen eighty-eight. At that time, the \"Water Penetration Test\" was under consideration. An International Electrotechnical Commission working group is defining this test. A draft document two zero A (C O) ninety-nine, under the six months rule, was published as a secretariat document under two zero A (Secretariat) one sixty-four. This document describes a water penetration test for those cables where barriers to longitudinal penetration have been included. The test is applicable to barriers applied over the core\nrl4j | and within the conductor. The water penetration test is applied after a length of cable has been subjected to the bending test. A fifty millimeter wide ring is removed from the center of the length including layers external to the insulation screen or, alternatively, the conductor. A tube at least ten millimeters in diameter is placed vertically over the exposed ring and sealed to the surface of the oversheath. Normally tap water is used to fill the tube. A period of five minutes is allowed for filling. The height of the water in the tube is one thousand millimeters above the center of the cable. The water is allowed to stand for twenty-four hours. The sample is then subjected to ten heating cycles. The conductor is heated until it reaches a temperature not less than five degrees Celsius or more than fifteen degrees Celsius above the maximum rated temperature of the insulation in normal operation. The heating cycle is eight hours on and sixteen hours off.\n```",
