You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ixfj | Intention: To enable as many people as possible, in due order, to achieve the understanding which will facilitate the higher (as well as the lower) effects of the Teaching to give the maximum develop- mental help.
n08k | Programme: To keep the group operating as a channel for the successively refined impulses from the Source, and to attune the members to be able to perceive these impulses.
mk3f | Characteristics: Enough serious-minded but not indoctrinated people; attitudes suitable for the transmission to act upon; an orientation suitable to accept and work with the materials provided or indicated by the Representative for the time being of the Teaching.
up8n | Modus Operandi: Meetings, reading, 'audition', performances, practices, theoretical and practical study, organisation of environ- ment.
2zga | Deterioration: Evidenced by the acceptance of simplifications, contraction of activity, messianic and panacea thinking, hierarchical behaviour patterns believed to be sacrosanct, literal acceptance of the figurative and vice-versa, hagiography, providing social and psychological stimuli and/or reassurances, offering scope for per- sonality-projection, assuaging desires for attention, substituting itself for diversions of a political, organisational, religious, psycho-
y6u5 | logical, social, academic, family and other groupings.
xm5s | Contrast this with the kind of group, that of the 'man of learn- ing' surrounded by others, of whom Al-Thauri says 'Be assured that he is an impostor and a fraud: because if he were to tell them the truth, they would hate him'.
c9kl | Prerequisites for a Student of Sufism
0wxt | Q: Can you give me an essential prerequisite for a student of Sufism? I think that it is to be misunderstood.
srft | A: One essential is that the student should not attempt to impose his own conditions of study or criteria of progress.
dnic | On understanding, a student should not think that he can under- stand just because he wants to.
1okp | A THOUSAND WILL CALL YOU AN UNBELIEVER
md0i | On being understood, it was the great Junaid of Baghdad who said:
l2xj | 'Nobody attains to the degree of Truth until a thousand sincere people have pronounced him an unbeliever.'
9n43 | But the sincerity he is talking about here is not real sincerity, absolute objectivity. It is the sincerity of people who imagine themselves to be sincere because they believe certain things, whether they know these things or not.
g6gt | The sincere act, reflecting the real sincerity, is defined by Abu- Yaqub al-Susi, in Kalabadhi's Taaruf:
n4u8 | 'The really sincere act is the one which is known by no record- ing angel, by no demon to afflict it, nor by the self, to become prideful of it.'
musv | This means that human beings have to become aware of their essence, the real part of themselves, which speaks when the other elements are silent.
kogj | THE INSECT
i7m9 | In Fiki ma Fihi, Rumi says that there is a minute insect in a field, which cannot be seen at first. But as soon as it makes a sound, people are alerted and see it. People, similarly, are lost in the field of this world, their surroundings and preoccupations. The human essence within is concealed by all this disturbance.
ffkj | THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME
thmt | A Chinese restaurant manager, asked in a London court to identify a man who was appealing against sentence for stealing chickens from a Chinese restaurant, said: 'All white men look the same to me.'*
4dmm | What is seen is not always understood in its qualities which may be relevant to a given perception, as with the Chinese and the white man. The Chinese, in Rumi's terms, is 'lost' in the field of his own world. The white man, in the expectation of the court, was in his appearance instrumental: that is to say, identification of his appearance would lead to certain facts. The description, though necessary, was secondary.
w1yv | The student should also regard such things as lectures as instru- mental, not descriptive, remembering what Faris relates that Abu- Abdullah Shikthal answered when asked why he did not lecture:
bhwq | 'Existence is not real, and it is wrong to speak of what is not real. Words cannot be used to describe the Real, so why should I speak?'
7kda | The student must be prepared for experience and intakes which do not affect the ordinary consciousness where words and emotions exercise their functions.
wdbn | Although 'the world' is not real, since what we perceive of it depends on our sense-perceptions which may be faulty, trained or changed: and it is hence not any kind of an absolute, the instru- mental function means that it can be employed for teaching pur- poses. This is why an 'essential prerequisite' which you ask for is certainly that this principle should be registered in your mind. As the Sufi Gharib-Nawaz puts it:
leeb | 'Every particle of dust is a cup wherein all the world can be seen.'
pvc6 | Some things in the world conduce towards understanding and some towards a greater involvement with the world and con- sequent lack of perception and false understanding.
vqqf | PARABLE OF THE TREE
keq0 | Sheikh Abdul-Qadir of Gilan, in his twenty-seventh address of the *Daily Telegraph (London) 25 January 1969, p. 23.
cnqd | Futuh al-Ghaib invites his hearers to think of good and evil as two fruits from the same tree. 'Approach the tree itself and become its guard and attendant servant and acquire knowledge of these two branches and of the two fruits and their neighbourhoods and remain near that branch which yields sweet fruit - then it will be your food and source of strength and beware lest you should approach the other branch and eat the fruit thereof and thus its bitterness should kill you ... and when these fruits are brought before you and the sweet cannot be distinguished from the bitter and you start eating them ... you may put the bitter one in your mouth.'
g4kx | In Step is out of Step
ojou | Q: Can you say something about the technical use of the term 'The Madman' for the Sufi?
ricu | A: There is a Persian saying: 'To a madman, it is enough to shout HOO!' (Diwana-ra HOOI bas ast). The repetition of the syllable HOO is a part of Sufi rites. Hence this saying indicates, to the intellectualist, that you merely shout this word and the well- conditioned disciple starts capering; and capering, as the uninitiated would think, without rhyme or reason. But the Sufi prides himself upon being, in the eyes of the uninstructed, 'a madman'; and so he uses the phrase himself to indicate that at a certain stage of initia- tion, the one syllable, once repeated, is enough to sustain him and produce in him the state which he desires.
2hgf | This brings us straight away to the difficulties of a practice which is inexplicable to one set of people, yet completely LIVED by another.
aog1 | The books that have been written by Sufis are partial ones; they have to be read at certain times, perhaps in conjunction with certain movements, or certain attunements, otherwise their meaning is but fragmentary like a great deal of other initiatory material which has been taken at its face value by 'outer' observers. It is as if a man were to lick the outside of an apple and pronounce it pleasant to the nose but seemingly devoid of nourishment.
x1e3 | Some people may say that they will not seek illumination or other-worldly truths if it involves their capering about. This is like saying that you will drive your car, providing that nobody is allowed to fill the fuel tank. Some say that they want something that they can understand before they will 'go into it'. This can be like saying that you will have to drive the train, or you will not travel in it at all.
dgol | It is this 'outer' attitude towards initiatory systems which gives rise to false cults which purport to give you 'secrets' that you can understand. Except that they do not, in fact, give you such
