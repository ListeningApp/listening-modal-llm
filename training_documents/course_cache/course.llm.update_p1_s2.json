Trophism\n59hi | · Plants only one trophic level; animals up to five to seven or more levels (Predators of sixth degree)\nua3p | . Algae - Copepod - Fish larvae (one) - Dragonfly larvae (two) - Tilapia (three) - Pied kingfisher (four)\n0a2t | · Grass - Locust - Preying mantis (one) - Lizard (two) - Cobra (three) - Mongoose (four) - Python (five) - Leopard (six)\nabow | · The relationship between competition and predation in community structuring is far more complex for animals as these can be both prey and predators at the same time (plants are normally only prey for herbivores and few are predatory - carnivorous plants e.g. Drosera spp.)\nqx6n | two. Mobility\np2bm | . Generally, all plants are immobile (except for a few algae) whereas all animals are mobile (except corals and barnacles)\ncxyx | · Field study of animals far more difficult due to seasonal movements, cryptic behaviour etc.\nw0aw | · Implications - challenges in assessing animal population dynamics (distribution, abundance, density and diversity)\nw41b | three. Ranges\nvokd | · Animals have larger ranges than plants, especially for migratory animals\nefir | · Spatio-temporal (circadian/circannual) variation in animal ranges poses challenges for describing community structure and interspecific interactions\nvjhs | four. Behaviour\nrcio | · Animals generally have more complex and diversified behavioural patterns (intra-/ inter- specific interaction, predation, reproduction)\n7qi5 | five. Reproduction\n9f5r | · Plants are immobile and reproduction is by fertilization agent (animals, wind or water)\nj3tt | . Many plants depend on animals for their reproduction. E.g. pollinators of pollen and dispersers of seeds\nzoz0 | · Mobile animals actively search for reproductive partners, engage in complex courtship behaviour (e.g. vocalization, body display, pheromone attraction, building of structures such as nesting sites, mating chambers) to initiate copulation\n3blu | · Immobile animals (e.g. marine corals and barnacles) reproduces in a way similar to that of plants (more passive fertilization modes)\nxv2l | six. Dispersion\nxt4k | · Plants depend on agents for dispersal whereas animals disperse by themselves by virtue of their mobility\nti78 | · Good dispersers include flying organisms as well as aquatic organisms that can tolerate a broad temperature range, or highly prolific species with high population turnover\nk5pk | Plant and Animal Interactions\nn093 | · Plants depend on animals and vice versa\n4khi | . Examples of animal dependencies on plants: Food (Herbivory), Building materials (Nests), Roosting and shelter (Protection)\n7fh2 | · Examples of plant dependencies on animals: Pollination, Seed dispersal, Protection (Predators on Herbivores)\n5isn | Different aspects of Animal Ecology\n5vry | · Evolutionary Ecology - Focus on how ecology and evolution are linked as inter-related processes. Ecology drives speciation/extinction which again affect community structure\n9w33 | · Behavioural Ecology - Focus on how ecology and behaviour is linked. Survival strategies such as Optimal Foraging and Reproductive strategies such as Semelparity/Iteroparity\njohv | . Population Ecology - Focus on how population grow, are regulated and interaction within and between different species (Competition, Predation, Mutualism, Parasitism)\n2olp | · Community Ecology - Focus on how communities of animals are structured with groups made up of taxonomical and ecological guilds\nzb7x | · Macro-ecology: Focus on large scale (global) patterns of animal communities, spatio-temporal patterns of distribution, abundance an diversity on the Earth\nuadf | ECOSYSTEM: Biotic and abiotic factors interacting in a specific area (Ghana's coastal woodland)\nwuf4 | Practical Implications\nlfk1 | · Understanding the relationship amongst niches, species, community structure and functioning;\nrwjw | *Land and water - Species-area relationship, habitat heterogeneity, island biogeography models\niazp | Crop pests: Predator-prey relations, anti-predator strategies, invasive species ecology\nksn3 | Design of conservation regions - Species diversity concentrations, gradients, endemic centres\n8xbx | Vector control of tropical diseases - Trophic organisations and food webs, predation, competition\naod5 | * World fish stock - Food webs, predator-prey relations, invasive alien species\nayqs | In Summary\njnpq | one. Animal Ecology is very complex. Plant-Animal interactions important for both\nr4w4 | · Trophism - Interactions - Mobility - Ranges - Dispersion - Behaviour - Reproduction - Communication\nsswz | two. Five major disciplines in the study of Animal Ecology\n0uoj | · Evolutionary ecology, Behavioural ecology, Population ecology, Community ecology and Macro ecology\n0c89 | three. Three major interrelated themes\n658v | · Species abundance, Distribution and Diversity (spatio-temporal)\n4gqa | four. Six major organisational/ Spatial levels\nmpgz | · Species/Niche - Population - Guild - Community - Ecosystem - Biome\ngf06 | Lecture two - Experimental Methods in Animal Ecology\n75hv | one. An introduction to the three major experimental methodologies in Animal Ecology:\ntbiu | Laboratory tests, Field Experiments, Natural Experiments\n413q | two. An overview of how ecologists use different field approaches to show that Competitive Exclusion Principle (Gause's Law) is real\n8wkl | three. A comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of experimental methodologies\nnext | four. An account of important ecological concepts related to Gause's Law - Niche overlap and Niche shift\n3dfm | Method\nhjmm | Laboratory Experiments\ns0s6 | Field (Manipulation) Experiments\ncxx7 | Famous Examples\nuzqc | · Diamond's island ground doves and honey eaters\ndqwn | Major Advantages\ng58m | Relatively good controls\nkf9u | Major Limitations\ntl2g | · Confounding factors can compromise validity of patterns\nxy74 | Laboratory Experiments\nq0se | Georgy Gause's Protozoa Cultures (Paramecium aurelia and P. caudatum)\ntz7u | .
