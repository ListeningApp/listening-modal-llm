In the first twenty-four hours, the drugs were administered intravenously, and then orally for six (dipyrone) or three days (meloxicam). Prostanoids thromboxane B two and prostaglandin E two concentrations served as indicators of COX activity and, with physiological variables and pain and sedation scores, were measured for twenty-four hours after first analgesic administration. Rescue analgesia (tramadol, two milligrams per kilogram intravenously) was provided if Glasgow feline composite measure pain scale greater than or equal to five. Laboratory tests included symmetric dimethylarginine and adverse effects were evaluated regularly up to seven and ten days after surgery, respectively. Parametric and nonparametric data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests, respectively (P less than zero point zero five).\nmqah | Results In the first half hour after analgesic administration, COX-one activity was close to zero and remained significantly lower than before drug administration for twenty-four hours in all groups. The inhibition of COX-two activity was significant for thirty minutes in all groups and up to four hours in group M. No\nxxr8 | alterations in laboratory tests or significant adverse effects were observed. Pain scores and need for rescue analgesia did not differ statistically among groups.\nrl4j | Conclusions Dipyrone at both doses and meloxicam provided a nonselective inhibition of COX-one and two activities and effective analgesia without causing significant adverse effects or laboratory tests alterations.\nvz32 | Clinical relevance Dipyrone at both doses provides equally effective analgesia without causing adverse effects in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy.\nncb0 | Introduction\n8mp0 | Dipyrone, also known as metamizole, is a drug used in some European and Latin American countries for its analgesic, antipyretic and spasmolytic effects. Although introduced in pharmacotherapy in nineteen twenty-two, the mechanism of action is not yet completely understood. Previous studies have reported its action on different receptors: stimulation of the arginine-NO-cGMP pathway; central action through inhibition of cyclooxygenase-three; endogenous opioid system; inhibition of COX-one and COX-two and endogenous cannabinoid system.\nxjyk | Dipyrone may be a safe choice compared with opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, dipyrone has been withdrawn from the market in several countries\nmt0f | because it has been associated with agranulocytosis in humans. Studies investigating this association are heterogeneous and some results carry significant biases, such as small sample size, presence of comorbidities and the combination of dipyrone with other drugs. The estimated mortality from agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, anaphylaxis and gastrointestinal complications after short-term dipyrone use is reported as similar to that of paracetamol and lower than that of diclofenac and aspirin.\nawab | In veterinary medicine, literature on this drug is sparse. Pharmacokinetics studies of dipyrone (twenty-five milligrams per kilogram) administered by various routes in cats and dogs have been published. Clinical studies have demonstrated analgesia efficacy from dipyrone in several scenarios in dogs. Only one published study was identified that used dipyrone for pain management in cats. In that study, dipyrone (twenty-five milligrams per kilogram every twenty-four, twelve or eight hours for five days) combined with tramadol (two milligrams per kilogram every eight hours) administered intravenously after ovariohysterectomy provided effective postoperative pain management with no significant adverse effects, biochemical alterations or erythrocyte oxidation.\nixcc | In domestic animals, there are no reports of significant adverse effects or laboratory tests alterations associated with dipyrone, and a study reported no renal, hepatic, bleeding time or bone marrow function alterations in dogs. Regarding gastrointestinal effects, no pathological changes in the gastrointestinal tract of control rats or rats with preexisting induced gastric ulcers were observed after dipyrone administration. In addition, there are reports of increases in gastric mucus and gastric prostaglandin E two and less gastric prostaglandin E two reduction than from piroxicam or celecoxib. However, the mechanisms of a protective effect by dipyrone on the gastric mucosa are still unclear.\n8p6h | The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dipyrone on COX-one and COX-two activities, to assess postoperative pain in cats undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy after intravenous administration of dipyrone or meloxicam during the first twenty-four hours and to identify any adverse effects occurring in seven or four days after surgery with dipyrone or meloxicam, respectively. Our hypothesis was that dipyrone may inhibit COX with few adverse effects and provide postoperative analgesia similar to meloxicam.\npmgl | Materials and methods\n90no | Experimental design\njt0y | This prospective, randomized, blinded, controlled study was conducted at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the School of\nqb7o | Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee and a written informed consent was obtained from the owners before inclusion of the animals.\noae5 | Animals\ns0fl | A total of thirty female domestic cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy were studied. All animals were deemed healthy and with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status one based on medical history, physical examination, complete blood count and serum chemistry tests. Acclimatization occurred in two visits at the hospital before the beginning of the study, when animals were also introduced to the environment, cage, observers and sedation and pain assessment tools. Exclusion criteria included excessive fear or aggressiveness, signs of pre-existing pain, pregnancy, underlying diseases and recent use of anti-inflammatory drugs.\n43ia | Anesthesia",
