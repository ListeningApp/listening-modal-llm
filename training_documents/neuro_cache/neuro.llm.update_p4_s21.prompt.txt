You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

a0by | In any event, the results of this sort of research, in my view, can only be viewed as preliminary. They provide some support for a structured set of hypotheses, but to be compelling each aspect of the overall system must be studied in more depth individually. However, the virtue is that these more precise and circumscribed hypotheses are not conceived in a vacuum, isolated from conceptions of the operation of the system as a whole. The theory outlined above treats each structure and process as part of an integrated system, and this seems highly desirable for questions about how the brain performs information processing.
u1ky | (b) Which areas implement 'simple systems' (linked operations)?
htm9 | A second kind of question focuses not on the operation of an entire system that underlies a particular function, but instead on a portion of such a system. The simplest subsystem is the interaction between two processes or between a process and a structure. For example, perhaps the most controversial aspect of the theory illustrated in figure 1 is the interpretation of the dorsolateral frontal function as being involved in information look-up, and of the angular gyrus or Area 19 areas as implementing associative memory. Kosslyn et al. (1995b) tested this
8hul | interpretation. We made use of a finding originally reported by Jolicoeur et al. (1984).
87vz | Jolicoeur et al. (1984) asked subjects to view pictures and to decide whether simultaneously presented words described the pictures appropriately. There were two important variables: first, the words were either at the 'entry' level (such as 'dog' for a picture of a cocker spaniel, or 'apple' for a picture of a Delicious apple), or were superordinate to that (e.g. 'animal' or 'fruit') or were subordinate (e.g. 'cocker spaniel' or 'Delicious apple'). The idea was that people spontaneously name objects at the 'entry' level, which usually corresponds to the 'basic level' of Rosch et al. (1976); this is the name that is as general as possible and that names as many similar objects as possible. So, for example, 'Delicious apple' is too specific because 'MacIntosh apple,' 'Granny Smith apple,' and so on look similar, but 'fruit' is too general because water- melons, grapes, bananas and so on are not very similar; 'apple' is about as general as one can get while still naming a set of similar objects. As expected, subjects could evaluate an entry-level term faster and more accu- rately than either a subordinate or superordinate term (see Smith & Medin 1981).
ym66 | Second, the pictures were presented for either 1s or 75 ms. We had two pivotal ideas. (i) If one names a picture spontaneously at the entry level, then one will need to process additional perceptual information to eval- uate a subordinate term (e.g. to check whether there are bumps on the bottom of an apple to determine whether it is a Delicious apple, or to see whether the dog has rounded floppy ears). If so, then it should be much more difficult to evaluate subordinate terms than entry-level ones when given only 75 ms than when given a full 1 s. This was in fact so. (ii) In contrast, and here is the crucial idea for present purposes, if one names a picture spontaneously at the entry level, then one will not need to process additional perceptual information to evaluate a superordinate term. In this case, the additional informa- tion need only be looked up in associative memory. For example, once one has named a Delicious apple as 'apple,' one needs only to search memory to discover that apples are indeed members of the category 'fruit'. If so, we reasoned, then the exposure time of the pictures should have comparable effects on one's ability to evaluate entry and superordinate terms, because one did not need to encode additional perceptual information after producing the entry-level name. In fact, this was true. Although subjects required more time to evaluate superordinate terms, they required the same amount of additional time compared with entry-level terms in the two exposure conditions.
l0a3 | Given these findings, Kosslyn et al. (1995b) reasoned that if we used PET to compare the additional activation when subjects evaluated superordinate terms compared with when they evaluated entry-level terms, we should find just the areas involved in looking up information from associative memory. Indeed, Kosslyn et al. (1995b) found only two areas to be more active during the superordinate condition than during the entry-level condition, namely the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the left angular gyrus. We expected only left-hemisphere activation because the subjects were evaluating words, and therefore the results make good sense in the context of the theory.
u8nw | These findings were very welcome, but they were not ideal. The specific loci that we found were not precisely the same as those found in the original experiment. However, these were different subjects, and different aver- aged data. Nevertheless, the locus of the dorsolateral prefrontal area was considerably different in this and the studies described above, which led us to expect activation consequent upon use of the information look-up process and associative memory. It simply is not clear what to make of this; the a priori predictions were clear-cut, and the results were close to the expected areas; but how close is close enough? A major advantage of fMRI is that it is possible to perform many experiments with the same subjects, and to analyse each subject's data separately. If the variability that we noted between the different PET studies was simply sampling error, then for a given person precisely the same dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior areas should have been activated in the original tasks (both picture-verification and imagery) and in this comparison between superordinate and entry-level terms.
l2v9 | It is important to recognize two important assumptions that underlie the logic of this sort of research. First, as noted above, changing the task in small ways can alter the strategy that subjects use, in which case different structures and processes might be used, and hence different areas might be activated. Even a small shift in the location of an activated area could reflect differences in the precise process being used (see, for example, Wilson et al. 1993). Second, note that this logic assumes that the same piece of tissue implements the same structure or process when it is embedded in different combinations of other processes. It is possible that some neural tissue is not dedicated to implementing a single process, and that different neural regions can implement more than one process. If so, the precise locus of activation that reflects the use of a given structure or process can shift, depending on what other structures or processes are used at the same time (for a more detailed discussion of this point, see the epilogue of Kosslyn & Koenig (1995)). We shall return to this general issue shortly.
