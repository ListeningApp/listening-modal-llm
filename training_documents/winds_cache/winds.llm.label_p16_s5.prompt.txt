You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

q1q2 | C. mastigophora is an edible jellyfish species, and a fishery has been established in Indonesia (Java south coast) based on export to Japan (Omori & Nakano, 2001; Kitamura & Omori, 2010). To avoid confusion, it is worth noting here, that Rumpet (1991) provides an excellent description of another sea-east Asian fishery for "red" jellyfish, but it is unlikely that this is <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora. Rumpet's (1991) report from the South China Sea (Sarawak, Malaysia) almost certainly refers to Rhopilema esculentum Kishinouye 1891 based on the description of fisheries for this species and Rhopilema hispidum (Vanhöffen 1888) (white) else- where in the South China Sea (Vietnam) by Nishikawa
cb7r | et al. (2008). The economic feasibility of a fishery for <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora has not been evaluated in Australia and maybe worthy of examination especially if swarms continue to have detrimental economic impacts.
68xu | Bivalve larvae, pteropods and invertebrate eggs dominated the prey items we found on <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigo- phora arms and 26% of all observed prey items were bivalve larvae. Nothing is known of the feeding rates of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora; however, at the population sizes we recorded the potential for them to deplete plankton from the water column must be considered. Some jellyfish species feed predominantly and selectively on bivalve mollusc larvae including other rhizostome jellyfish. For example, Larson (1991) found very high feeding rates by Stomolophus meleagris Agassiz 1862 on oyster larvae which made up 56% of prey items and Ballard & Myers (1997) found bivalve larvae made up more than 80% of the diet of Proboscidactyla stellata (Forbes 1846). In the southern Kimberley region where we observed significant swarms in 2006, 2010, 2011, and 2012, the silver lipped pearl oyster Pinctada maxima (Jameson 1901) forms the basis of Australia's pearl industry valued at A$120 million per year (Hart & Joll, 2006). P. maxima spawn in the spring beginning in September when the peak spawning occurs although the spawning season can extend through to April (Rose et al., 1990). The peak spawning period coincides with the same period that C. mastigophora swarms have occurred near Broome and Eighty Mile Beach which is the most important area for pearl oyster broodstock in north-western Australia (Condie et al., 2006), meaning that when they are dense, <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora might be a significant predator of pearl oyster larvae. Condie et al. (2006) showed how tidal currents dominate pearl oyster larval transport in the Eighty Mile Beach region meaning larvae are retained in the area. This would make them vulnerable to large swarms of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora which would be subject to the same transport patterns. Larson (1991) measured the feeding rate of the closely related <LATEX>S .</LATEX> meleagris and found a 325 g jellyfish would consume 6,000 prey items per day over half of which were oyster larvae. Based on these feeding rates, the population numbers of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora estimated in this study <LATEX>\left( > 5 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } \right.</LATEX> million, <LATEX>1 . 4 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 }</LATEX> tonnes) could consume upwards of <LATEX>3 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 1 }</LATEX> oyster larvae per day. It is important that a more in-depth study of the diet and feeding rate of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora be

2zpk | undertaken to determine its significance as a predator of <LATEX>P .</LATEX> maxima and other bivalve larvae as our data on diet represent just a snapshot in time.
epu7 | Studies on the planktonic system are also required to determine the relative abundance of oyster larvae and other plankton in the water column as well as in the diet of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora. The low C:N ratio (3.9:1) and <LATEX>8 C ^ { 1 3 } \left( - 2 0 . 8 \right)</LATEX> of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora tissue indicate a dependence on marine derived sources of carbon in its diet (Meyers, 1997). The <LATEX>\mathrm { C } : \mathrm { N }</LATEX> ratio is similar to that found in other jellyfish: 4.0:1 (Faganeli et al., 1988) and 3.1:1 to 4:2:1 (Cui et al., 2012). The <LATEX>8 C ^ { 1 3 } \left( - 2 0 . 8 \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>8 \mathrm { N } ^ { 1 5 }</LATEX> (8.1) isotopic signatures of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora are similar to that recorded for another catostylid jellyfish (Catostylus mosaicus (Quoy and Gaimard 1824), <LATEX>\left. 8 C ^ { 1 3 } = - 2 0 . 9 \text { to } - 2 2 . 2 \right)</LATEX> (Pitt et al., 2008) and a rhizostome jellyfish (8 <LATEX>C ^ { 1 3 } = - 2 2 . 0</LATEX> to -17.4, 8 <LATEX>N ^ { 1 5 } = 4 . 8</LATEX> to 10.6 by Cui et al. (2012) but lower than in Pelagia noctiluca <LATEX>\left( 8 C ^ { 1 3 } = - 1 8 . 8 \right)</LATEX> (Faganeli et al., 1988; Malej et al., 1993). Pitt et al. (2008) found that copepods and mysids were the most important com- ponents of the diet of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mosaicus based on compar- ative analysis of jellyfish and prey item stable isotope values. The use of stable isotopes can be used to infer the importance of particular food sources integrated over time as opposed to a snapshot in time in the case of prey items sampled from jellyfish arms (Pitt et al., 2009a). However, we can conclude little about the importance of different components of the diet of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora over the longer term given we lack stable isotope data for the prey items we found and the difficulties interpreting diet from jellyfish tissue isotopic signatures without adequate temporal, spatial, ontogenetic and between organ sampling (Pitt et al., 2009a).
7od1 | <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora have a water content on 95.8% which is almost identical to other species studied (Doyle et al., 2007). Dead jellyfish decay quickly (2-3 days) on tropical beaches (personal observations, see ESM Table 1) meaning that the organic carbon and nitrogen in their bodies indirectly derived from primary and secondary production offshore are made available in the nearshore coastal zone. Using our measurements of density of jellyfish in strandings, frequency of strandings and biomass of jellyfish, it can be calculated that this contribution was of the order of 44 tonnes of carbon and 11 tonnes of nitrogen in 2012. However, although we were able to provide some data on the biomass of stranded jellyfish that this is only a

ccmb | reflection of the total biomass as we do not know what percentage of the population is stranded at any one time. Other jellyfish species which undergo swarms have been shown to be important in delivering significant quantities of organic matter into coastal food webs (Pitt et al., 2009b; West et al., 2009).
ma93 | Kramp (1961) records C. mastigophora as reaching 400 mm in diameter, but our specimens were almost all less than half this size. There is no information on growth rates of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora, and it is not known if C. mastigophora in Australian waters grow to the size stated by Kramp (1961) whose records drew on studies in Malaysia. Extensive further study of the biology (especially growth and feeding and swarm size) along with better resolution of spatial and temporal occur- rence of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora is needed to evaluate the ecological and socioeconomic significance of this phenomenon and whether the frequency or intensity of swarms has changed recently.
