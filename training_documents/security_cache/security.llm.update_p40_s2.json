        "content": "9jx1 | In the event that a genuine crisis does occur, it will be the security team that will be expected to draw up immediate response plans, to explain these to the rest of the organisation, and to take responsibility for the delivery and management of these programmes in order to realise a successful conclusion to the situation. The success or otherwise of such solutions will depend on the development of previous crisis management plans that will allow appropriate options to be created and managed in the face of high-pressure, potential catastrophic losses, breakdowns in normal communication and lines of command, and possible total disruption of normal operating capabilities. Crisis management capability is something that is developed, maintained and improved over time, through training, exercises and a high level of personal connection between the significant stakeholders within an organisation. This is one area where the competent security manager can demonstrate real value to an organisation.\nc3lz | Eight point seven. Business Continuity Management\n8bwk | One of the clearest aspects of a security manager's function in relation to crisis management is to ensure that the organisation has the capability to maintain viable functionality even at the time of greatest disruption. Although this is not limited to the security management team, and will require genuine multi-division collaboration, it should be a function of the security managers to contribute their specialist expertise in terms of risk management, contingency planning and general project leadership. Business Continuity Management is widely recognised as being a significant indicator as to the general level of effective organisational management, and is one place where the security management team can rightfully claim to have a level of expertise unmatched in any other division in the company.\nez9s | Eight point eight. Education and Training\nmqot | Given that security awareness is something that should be an integral part of every aspect of an organisation's operations, it is clear that the security division has a role to play in developing both the appropriate corporate culture as well as specific skills and capabilities. It is the security manager's responsibility to ensure that everyone within the organisation is aware of their security role, how they can contribute to general organisational safety, and what specific steps should be taken in the event that potential threats are detected or actual incidents occur. Whilst it is easy for these up-skilling programmes to become tick box exercises, if they are seen as genuinely contributing to the development of a more effective organisation, then they will be valued as an integral part of the organisation's ongoing corporate development process.\noc99 | Eight point nine. Point of Contact\ngipz | As well as proactively raising the role of the security division, an effective security manager will develop the relationship with other divisions that will allow them to approach the security team for advice and guidance in areas where otherwise they might just have made a best guess and carried on. To a large extent it is a sign of a successful security management system if managers from other divisions feel comfortable dropping in to have a chat.\nb4wj | Eight point ten. Summary\n5xlt | You have now completed the first, introductory module of this programme. Rather than giving detailed analysis of the specific skills that are an integral part of an effective security manager's portfolio, which will be covered in the following modules, the purpose of this module was to provide a basic understanding of the fundamental concepts that are the foundation of any security management programme. The concepts covered here will come up time and again in the rest of the course material, often within different contexts or with slightly different labels. However, if you understand the relationship between risk and security, understand how to create an effective command structure, can interact with the other divisions within the organisation, and perhaps most of all, can clearly demonstrate the added value that you bring to any organisation that you might be associated with, then you can be confident that you will be able to play a full part in creating an effective security management system that will provide the appropriate level of protection for the people, assets and operations in your company.\n9bz4 | It may well be that as you go through this course there might be specific areas that take your interest. It could be in risk analysis, security auditing, overseas development, facilities management or crisis management. Whatever it might be, it is the duty of the modern security manager to be able to offer a level of knowledge,\nyfv2 | experience and professional capability that will be at least equal to the equivalent experts in every other division of the organisation.\npujl | In summary:\n3rqe | . In order to add value to the overall organisational management structure, the security manager must have the same level of personal and professional capabilities as any other senior manager of equivalent division.\nnsi3 | . To make an effective contribution to the organisations security, and long-term success, the security manager should be seen as part of the strategic decision-making process, rather than merely as part of the back-room support staff.\nnil3 | . In order to be valued, the security manager should be able to demonstrate that they are adding to organisational capability, and competitiveness, rather than being an unproductive cost.\n68a1 | . Security managers should be valued for the level of subject matter expertise that they offer, in the same way that the managers of other business divisions would be.\nseik | . Security managers should be seen as making a contribution to the success of every other division within the organisation, rather than being isolated as a separate, and relatively unimportant, adjunct to the organisation.\noq7c | Eight point eleven. Self-assessment exercises\nz4mi | Self-assessment one: Identify four other divisions within the organisation, and demonstrate how closer association with the security division could be to their advantage\nhkft | Self-assessment two: Write a report to be distributed to the heads of every other division within the organisation, explaining the importance of an effective Crisis Management capability, and explaining how this would be developed over the next six months.\njai3 | Self-assessment three: Prepare a PowerPoint presentation, about twenty minutes, that can be given to the General Board on the function of the security division, and how an expanded role will increase general effectiveness and capability across the organisation.",
