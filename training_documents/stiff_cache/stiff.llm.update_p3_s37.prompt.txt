You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

K _ { c } = K _ { 0 } \right)</LATEX> and histories <LATEX>\left( 1 \leq \mathrm { O C R } \leq \right.</LATEX> 3). In order to eliminate the effect of the difference of density on test results in these figures, the secant Young's modulus was normalized by dividing it by the following void ratio func- tions: Toyoura sand <LATEX>F \left( e \right) = \left( 2 . 1 7 - e \right) ^ { 2 } / \left( 1 + e \right)</LATEX> (Iwasaki et al. 1978), while for Quiou sand <LATEX>F \left( e \right) = \left( 3 . 8 2 - e \right) ^ { 2 } / \left( 1 + e \right)</LATEX> (Fior- avante et al. 1994a).
nwfz | In spite of a certain scatter observed at very small strain (&a <LATEX>\left. \leq 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \right) ,</LATEX> it can be seen that the small strain secant Young's modulus <LATEX>E _ { c }</LATEX> of Toyoura sand is virtually the same for the four tests <LATEX>\left[ E _ { 0 } / F \left( e \right) \approx 2 5 0 \mathrm { M P a } \right. ,</LATEX> that is, it does not depend on the <LATEX>K e ,</LATEX> the horizontal stress <LATEX>\sigma _ { b } ^ { \prime } ,</LATEX> or the OCR, being only a function of the axial consolidation stress. On the other hand, in the case of Quiou sand, the small strain secant Young's modulus of the OC specimens <LATEX>\left[ E _ { 0 } / F \left( e \right) \approx 6 0 \right.</LATEX> to 70 MPa] is higher than that of the NC specimens <LATEX>\left[ E _ { 0 } / F \left( e \right) \approx 4 0 \right.</LATEX> to 50 MPa]. In other words, for a clean sand, such as Toyoura sand, the <LATEX>E _ { c }</LATEX> value is a function of the effective axial stress and is quite independent of the radial effective stress and the stress history, as already shown by Flora et al. (1994), Kohata et al. (1994), and Lo Presti et al. (1995). In the case of sand con- taining crushable material, such as Quiou sand, although <LATEX>E _ { 0 }</LATEX> does not depend on the <LATEX>K _ { c }</LATEX> or the <LATEX>\sigma _ { h } ^ { \prime } ,</LATEX> it instead depends on the stress history (Lo Presti et al. 1995).
nvfy | On the other hand, at intermediate strain, it can be seen that the reduction of <LATEX>E _ { \mathrm { s c } }</LATEX> in NC specimens occurs for <LATEX>\mathcal{E} _ { a }</LATEX> larger than 0.001%. It can be also seen that the reduction of <LATEX>E _ { \mathrm { s e c } }</LATEX> in NC Quiou sand is much more pronounced than that observed for NC Toyoura sand; for example, <LATEX>E _ { \sec } / E _ { 0 }</LATEX> at <LATEX>\varepsilon _ { a } = 0 . 0 1 \%</LATEX> is about 0.55 in the NC Toyoura specimen and is about 0.45 in the NC Quiou specimen. In the case of <LATEX>\mathrm { O C }</LATEX> specimens, the sudden reduction of <LATEX>E _ { \sec }</LATEX> occurs for strain levels larger than about 0.05% for both sands. This experimental fact indicates that the amount of plastic deformation decreased for axial strain by as much as 0.05%, as a consequence of the mechanical overcon- solidation. It is said that the linear threshold strain increases according to the overconsolidation history, as reported by Jar- dine et al. (1984) and Tatsuoka and Kohata (1994).

sc5y | It has generally been recognized that the shear modulus of sand can be expressed by means of an empirical equation as a function of the void ratio, the confining pressure, and strain levels (Hardin and Richart 1963; Iwasaki and Tatsuoka 1977; Jamiolkowski et al. 1994a). For example, Iwasaki and Tat- suoka indicated that the shear modulus of clean sands obtained from resonant column and cyclic torsional tests can be ex- pressed by
