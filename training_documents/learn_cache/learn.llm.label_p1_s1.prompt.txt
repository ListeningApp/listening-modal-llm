You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1pjs | CHAPTER TWO
o2kr | How We Learn
v6sk | To understand the power of natural critical learning environments we must, first, explore the research on how people learn and what can go wrong. We often act as if learning is a simple process of remembering ideas and information, but it isn't that easy. Even if we toss understand- ing into the mix, we still haven't captured the complex undertaking in- volved in human learning. While the bold research on the brain and its function has offered fresh insights, even that mechanical exploration hasn't fully captured what it means to learn deeply. For more than a century, people have pieced together insight into what takes place. Let's take a quick tour through some of the most important discoveries. In that excursion we will begin to understand the nature and power of the Super Courses that are transforming higher education and are even re- shaping some corners of secondary and elementary schools.
1wj6 | Let's start with how our learning begins. When we are born, light, sound, touch, smell, and taste bombard our senses. They are our only contact with the outside world. We take that input and try to under- stand it, noticing patterns and building mental models of reality in the process. We then use those resulting models to understand any new sensory stimulations that come along later.
936l | Someone walks into a room, for example, and an electromagnetic field called light tickles the retina of that person's eyes. We label that sensation "seeing," but it isn't the electromagnetic field alone that in- forms. Rather the individual takes the sensory input and wraps it around some already existing models and understands the room in terms of
06yq | 18
dpv6 | those frameworks constructed years ago. The person already has a con- cept of tables and chairs, rugs and walls long before the light zings the eyeballs. Students hear a lecture or read a book and interpret the sounds and sights with some existing paradigm, comparing and contrasting the new information with what they already "know." The memories that humans hold shape what they see, hear, and learn.
8r5j | Thus, we understand the present in terms of some earlier experience, and that ability and habit serves us well. We can go somewhere we've never been and still make sense of the place. Otherwise, we'd live like Drew Barrymore's character in Fifty First Dates, always forced to start from scratch with each encounter. But that practice of depending on past experiences also proves to be our greatest challenge as learners and educators. Why? Because we often, especially in deep learning, want our students to build new models of reality, or at least have the capacity to question their existing ones. In the humanities we often say that edu- cated people realize the problems they face in accepting whatever they may believe. Our friends in the sciences will sometimes go further and encourage their students to abandon certain models-say, that the earth is the center of the universe-and form new ones. Either way, we are asking people to do something quite unnatural. Indeed, when Sam Wineburg wrote about the phenomenon in his own field, he called his book Historical Thinking and Other Unnatural Acts.1 While his discipline asks people to use evidence from the past to understand a former time, many will rely only on the mental models they have constructed about their own world.
2taz | By the time students arrive in middle school, high school, and col- lege, they have constructed thousands of models that will have more influence than anything a professor tells them. They may know nothing about a subject, but if they make any attempt to understand it, they will use something already constructed in their brains to do so. They will compare and contrast, looking for analogies and differences.
o3ya | Even if their current ideas are faulty, however, people find it quite hard to abandon an existing concept and build a new one. We can even become emotionally attached to our mental models, afraid to give them up because the unknown is a little scary and any changes suggest that
r5il | 19
5gui | we didn't do such a hot job in the first place. But those difficulties don't always show up in standard assessments. A story we told in 2004, at the beginning of the second chapter of What the Best College Teachers Do, illustrates the point.
82qc | In the mid-198os two physicists at Arizona State University asked this important question. Does my introductory course change the way stu- dents understand motion. If it doesn't, you have two possibilities. Either they didn't need to study that material because they already understood it, or the course had failed them.
ls7d | To grasp learning in their classes, Ibrahim Abou Halloun and David Hestenes devised an instrument to measure someone's conception of physical motion. They called their invention a Force Concept Inventory and administered it to approximately six hundred students coming into four different sections of an introductory physics course. On the front end, they discovered that most students began their study with what the Arizona professors called a commonsense theory of motion, "a cross between Aristotelian and 14th-century impetus ideas."2 Without going into the physics details, let's just say that if this were the primary way we understood motion today, we wouldn't be able to put a satellite in orbit or even build a highway around a curve without sending cars into a ditch.
tzt3 | But that's before students took the course. Once they had done so, Halloun and Hestenes gave them the Force Concept Inventory again to see how much their understanding of motion had changed. Guess what. For the overwhelming majority of students, the shift was small if any. Even people who made high grades in the course often kept their origi- nal mental models. When the researchers approached some of the stu- dents with additional questions, many of those pupils refused to change their view, argued with the researchers, and engaged in all sorts of mental gymnastics to keep from confronting a challenge to some deeply held paradigms.
t8vv | Those people had constructed a mental model of motion, using ev- eryday experiences, and they refused to let go. But this attachment to existing paradigms doesn't happen just in physics. It occurs in history and every other field where people study because it is a human habit.
qvnu | We will seldom rebuild major concepts unless we face repeated chal- lenges to our current models. Merely telling a class that their existing ideas are wrong will not usually turn the trick. Students must enter a space where their paradigms do not work and care that those models come up short. People can then begin to grapple with those pregnant moments and build new ways of looking at the world. We call those experiences "model failures." In the old days, we just called them "intel- lectual challenges," but the new term better captures what happens. Our brains anticipate something because of the models they hold, but they get a surprise instead.
kggw | It's tough to get humans to pay attention when any paradigm doesn't work because we face too many breakdowns to notice all of them. The model failures must be bold and a little shocking. They should spark concern, but not too much. So the successful learning environments often jolt students just enough to trigger their interest without plunging them into a cycle of worry, despair, anxiety, and depression. That is a delicate matter that makes teaching more like the art of playing the vio- lin than the science of mixing chemicals. The best teachers raise ques- tions that challenge but do not threaten-or, at least, not too much. They intrigue and fascinate, perhaps serving some need to know. Sur- prise, love, and mystery often fuel the emotions that motivate deep learning and any conceptual shifts.
xrd1 | Many teachers can't raise those good questions, however, because they suffer from what we call the "expert's curse." Think of it this way. As a scholar in your field, you are currently interested in certain ques- tions because you were once intrigued with another inquiry. You took up that previous problem after battling with a still earlier query, and so forth, back up through your own intellectual journey that may have begun when you first asked your parents, "Why?"
5746 | While you are currently deep underground digging at what you know to be valuable intellectual or professional ore, your students are stand- ing on the surface wondering why anyone in their right mind would be so far underground. To reach them, experts must retrace their intellec- tual steps and find questions that will capture learners' interest and ul- timately pull them into a more advanced conversation. That's not easy
7toz | 21
j346 | to do. But it is the power of questions and problems that drives deep learning.
v8uq | Any learner must remain highly motivated to stick with the arduous process of building a new paradigm and thinking about its implications and applications. To maintain such dedication, students must believe that their learning will make a difference to themselves and others. The change should have a purpose that satisfies intellectually and emotion- ally. People are most likely to attempt deep learning approaches when they are trying to answer questions or solve problems that they regard as important, intriguing, beautiful, or fun. Altruism, a concern for others, can play a powerful role in stimulating the hard work necessary.
x972 | To learn deeply we must intend to do so. Humans are born with in- satiable curiosities. But here's the rub. Our desire to do something will go down if we have the feeling that someone else controls us. Every ef- fort to force students to pay attention and reexamine their existing para- digms will backfire. Extrinsic motivators (for example, grades) tend to suppress internal desires. Maybe we are just ornery creatures, but we don't like to lose what psychologists call a locus of control. We also don't like to do something when we believe we can't do it. One way of thinking about this process is that the motivation to learn has at least three components: purpose; a belief that we can learn; and the convic- tion that we control when, where, and what we decide to learn.
cwrw | In school not all students will even try to understand and to think about implications and applications, to theorize about possibilities. Many of them will focus instead only on passing the course ("surface learners") or making the highest grade ("strategic learners"), and nei- ther of these types has the intention to learn deeply. Students become a particular type of learner because of conditioning, however, not as a result of their personalities or intelligence. Maybe they didn't have par- ents who invited a snake charmer to a first-grade birthday party or read to them every night. Maybe instead an aunt, uncle, or teacher ham- mered them about "being smart." Perhaps a whole series of teachers fostered a focus on grades rather than learning. The conditioning occurs throughout our society. A barrage of movies, songs, television programs, economic pressures, and even friends can stimulate those surface or
4i0e | 22
h2l3 | strategic approaches. The path students take isn't written into their DNA or a reflection of their abilities. Some highly capable humans can develop predominantly strategic or surface intentions with the wrong experiences in life.
dfzb | Schools make big contributions to this phenomenon. Some kinds of assessment can leave the impression that learning consists of recogniz- ing correct answers on multiple-choice exams. Highly competitive em- phasis on grades can deny students a sense of control over their own edu- cation and reduce their motivation to do the hard work of deep learning. Without deep intentions students resort to memorizing correct answers and procedures that will have little sustained, positive, or substantial in- fluence on the way they will subsequently think, act, or feel.
u6ty | Even when students build perfectly acceptable mental models, "learning" doesn't always produce good problem solving. When people learn some new information or ideas, they do not necessarily develop the capacity to use it in different kinds of situations. Medical students who memorize reams of information on the body and can even explain physical functions in gory detail cannot always use that knowledge to make a proper differential diagnosis or devise a novel and effective treat- ment for a complex ailment. This "transfer problem," as learning schol- ars call it, can bedevil the most dedicated students. Knowing a body of information needed to solve a problem does not necessarily entail the capacity to unlock its puzzle.
awvu | It is, of course, easier to solve problems someone else has already mastered. We can go to school on their work, learning to apply standard answers to known types of difficulties. But we live in a world of rapid change with new kinds of trouble no one has ever seen. Back in the 198os some Japanese theorists saw two kinds of experts: routine ones who know many if not all the standard answers, and adaptive wizards who also know those common routines but have additional powers. They have both the ability and the attitude to recognize and relish the opportunity and necessity for invention. The adaptives like taking on those unique difficulties, and they are good at it.3
on9b | How then do people learn to become that kind of expert? Practice and feedback. Lots of opportunity to speculate with problems they have never encountered before.
a8ge | 23
h27a | Imagine, for example, two math classes. In one, the instructor per- forms algebra in front of the students (that's what often happens in many math classes). The pupils take notes and then try to apply the procedures to equations they encounter on their homework and tests. In the second type, the teacher gives students conceptually rich and fascinating problems that are slightly more advanced than anything they've tried before and invites them to invent their own solutions, per- haps working in groups. They haven't encountered the problem, and no one is there to solve it for them. They are invited to become adaptive experts. The teacher becomes a guide by the side rather than a sage on the stage, ready to ask a question to help students think past some con- ceptual difficulty rather than performing the problem for them.
pdjh | Manu Kapur, at the National Institute of Education in Singapore, dis- covered the secrets of what he calls "productive failure."4 Students "who engaged in problem solving before being taught," he concluded from an elaborate comparison study, "demonstrated significantly greater concep- tual understanding" than did people who received "direct instruction" on how to do problems. Furthermore, the ninth graders who struggled to invent solutions, made mistakes and corrected them, could more easily solve "novel problems" than could "those who were taught first."
xmgs | All the learning we have discussed involves memory. But people are most likely to remember what they have used and maybe invented, not what they have had drilled into their heads. Marshall and Albert began learning French in the sixth grade, but six weeks into the fall semester, Albert's parents moved to Paris, taking the young boy and his sister with them. By the time he graduated from high school, Marshall had taken six years of French, memorizing vocabulary and usually acing the exams. His parents drilled him, using all the sophisticated procedures of spaced repetition. It doesn't take much imagination or insight, however, to guess which one of the two boys read, spoke, and wrote French with almost perfect fluency when they met for a reunion right before going off to college, and which one struggled to keep up with the chatter.5 People learn deeply by doing in authentic situations.6
bd9h | Students are more likely to remember what they understand. When we comprehend we make rich associations between ideas and informa- tion, and the network of connections we lay down in our brains
m047 | enhances our memories. If through speculation, someone has invented a solution, that person can more easily recall its steps and why you should take those steps than if the person had picked up the solution from watching someone else perform the process.
