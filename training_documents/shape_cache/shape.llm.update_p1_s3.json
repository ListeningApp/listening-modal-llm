Ergonomic researchers consider the Female Figure Identification Technique a 'gold standard' body shape classification system to describe variation in a population's three dimensional profile. Nevertheless, researchers use FFIT without a scientific basis or considering their ergonomic suitability. This paper rigorously evaluates FFIT, focussing on ergonomics, garment construction, and scientific research applications. Through analysing one thousand six hundred seventy-nine three dimensional body scans, we assess the level of agreement between the FFIT's body shape classification when measurements placed following FFIT's or SizeUK's guidance. We establish how different interpretations of FFIT's measurement placement cause the same body to be categorised into different shapes - in up to forty percent of cases. FFIT omits shoulder measurements that have little relationship to body shape yet are vital in garment construction. Using FFIT with different datasets and definitions, therefore, leads to inconsistent conclusions about shape differences.\nwkbn | Abbreviations: three dimensional body scanning; female figure identification technique; three dimensional\nftfg | Introduction\n7xi5 | Despite garment construction practices ignoring current body shape classifications, body shape underpins how ergonomists, practitioners, and researchers understand the human form. An increasing number of clothing ergonomics academics are embracing the Female Figure Identification Technique developed by Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan. In using the FFIT, clothing ergonomics academics assume its suitability for scientific research,\nw8r5 | including nationality-based body shape comparisons, body shape based health estimations, and consumer's perceptions of their body's shape. Body shape is also essential for online fashion retail's virtual fit and garment size prediction tools. For these scientific and retail applications to be reliable, their underpinning body shape classification system must be indisputable. An indisputable\nybik | system is when assessment categorises a person into the same shape every time. Consistent categorisation requires dependable definition with a system like FFIT, something which is problematic when the system and its definition need careful analysis to understand.\ngii5 | Given FFIT's prevalence and influence within body shape research for apparel, researchers may assume Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan developed a system that consistently defines body shape. The FFIT, developed using a TC2 body scanner, uses six girth measurements - bust, waist, hip, high-hip, stomach, and abdomen - which is an advance on more traditional two dimensional width-based classifications. Width-based analysis was necessary in the FFIT development because of limitations of knowledge, but they made a clear advancement in circumferential definitions â€“ relating shape more clearly to clothing; The FFIT then defines nine body shapes among American women (hourglass, bottom hourglass, top hourglass, spoon, rectangle, diamond, oval, triangle, and inverted triangle; see Figure one) which is again an advance on traditional systems. The mathematical descriptors of body shapes that the FFIT proposed were based on logic: developed from literature, experts' tacit knowledge in apparel design, and visual analysis of the segmental proportions in the female body's bust-to-hips zone - excluding the shoulder-to-bust zone. However, the FFIT only provides general guidelines on how a practitioner should take its six measurements. The practitioner also needs familiarity with the TC2 scanner because FFIT is grounded in the TC2 scanner's software definitions. Furthermore, practitioners need careful reading of FFIT's supporting texts to ensure consistency of measurements used. Those reporting on using FFIT apply common names for\nq5eu | measurements with multiple definitions (e.g. waist), potentially leading to significantly different measurements and then different shapes.\na7ao | Careful analysis of FFIT shows it uses measurement definitions different from those used in significant European body scanning surveys, particularly the United Kingdom National Sizing Survey: SizeUK. The SizeUK survey is the United Kingdom's first national survey of the population since the nineteen fifies, capturing three-dimensional shapes of the population, using the same three dimensional body scanners as FFIT instead of tape measures. SizeUK's goal was to support United Kingdom retailers to amend their size charts and provide a data source for scientific research, including medical, health, transport, and product design. SizeUK provides a database of anthropometric measurements for industry's use, and it not a body shape classification system. Nevertheless, Size UK influences how industry understands human measurements and their placements. Ergonomists and researchers may combine SizeUK's measurement definitions with the FFIT's body classification process. Combining measurement definitions is clear in Yim Lee et al.'s work, showing brief consideration is given to consistency of measurement definition or capture device.\n29a3 | The FFIT defines the hip in TC2 software as the largest circumference in the crotch-to-waist region. Size UK, in contrast, uses the buttock prominence to define the hip. Both the FFIT and Size UK, however, use the nomenclature hip to classify their measurement. This highlights the complexities of using scanning technologies and varied measurement definitions, complicated further as some standards related to scanning.\nsb1e | Standards provide foundational support for research comparing measurements. Nevertheless, ISO seven two five zero does not have a hip circumference definition. Without a hip circumference definition, ISO seven two five zero has little applicability to the FFIT, and this paper, as the FFIT relies upon the hip.\nw2yn | While the FFIT and SizeUK use a three dimensional body scanning system by TC2, the lack of standardisation in methods meant three vital measurements were incompatible at the hip-girth, the waist, and the seat. Without standardisation of definition, the same tool leads to a practitioner taking a different measurement placement than the FFIT intended. SizeUK, however, uses TC2's seat measurement for its hip. TC2's seat measurement corresponds to the Hip definition of International Organisation of Standardisation: the body's horizontal girth\nap6l | measured at the hip - the greatest projection at the body's back; see Figure two.\niest | The FFIT's waist measurement is set as Small of the Back plus six point three five centimeter, while SizeUK situates the waist as Small of the Back plus four point zero centimeter. These slight differences are problematic as the narrowing of the female form towards the rib cage can locate a much smaller circumference outside where a practitioner may designate the waist region. Altering hip and waist measurement placement significantly changes the measurements' size. Suppose a practitioner uses alternative definitions of measurements within an FFIT body classification exercise. In that case, the impact of different measurement placement on body shape classification is uncertain, yet potentially damaging to the FFIT's between-studies comparisons.\n```",
