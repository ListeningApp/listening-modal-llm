You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

c9it | Say X is a set where each point i has an 'energy' E; E R. Its partition function is
t29r | Z = De-BEi iEX
ddhd | where B E R is the coolness.
e69f | The partition function counts the points of X-but it counts points with large energy less, since they're less likely to be 'occupied'.
q12e | If ( = 1/kT, points with energy E; >> kT count for very little.
vj9y | But as T -> +oo, all points get fully counted and Z -> | X|. In physics we call Z the number of accessible states.
g0bb | Say we have a system with some countable set of states X. In thermal equilibrium at temperature T, the probability that the system is in its ith state is proportional to exp(-BE;), where E; is the energy of that state and ß is the coolness. Thus, physicists say the partition function
k09q | Z = Le-BEi iEX
w30h | is the number of accessible states: roughly, the number of states the system can easily be in at temperature T, where ß = 1/kT.
4vcv | This is a funny thing to say, because being 'accessible' is not a yes-or-no matter. A more precise statement is that the partition function counts states weighted by their accessibility exp(-ßE;). States whose energy is low compared to kT are highly acces- sible, or probable, because exp(-BE;) is close to 1 if E; < kT. States of high energy are more inaccessible, or improbable, since exp(-BE;) is close to 0 if E; >> kT.
iphf | Calling the partition function the 'number of accessible states' emphasizes how it generalizes the cardinality | X| of an ordinary set X, meaning its number of points. Let's make this precise! Let's call a set X with a function E: X -> R an energetic set. I will write it merely as X, so you need to remember it comes with an energy function. I will call its partition function Z(X):
jdf8 | Z(X)=Le-BEi iEX
59yt | If X is finite we don't have to worry about the convergence of this sum. My main message is this:
e2hn | The partition function Z (X) does for energetic sets what the cardinality | X | does for sets.
gojw | For example, just like the cardinality, the partition function adds when you take disjoint unions, and multiplies when you take products! Let's see why.
f57y | Puzzle 35. The disjoint union X + X' of energetic sets E : X -> R and E' : X' -> R is again an energetic set: for points in X we use the energy function E, while for points in X' we use the function E'. Show that the partition function obeys the law Z(X+X')= Z(X) + Z(X'), at least for finite energetic sets.
jlv5 | Puzzle 36. The cartesian product X x X' of energetic sets E : X -> R and E' : X' -> R is again an energetic set: define the energy of (x, x') € X x X' to be E(x) + E(x'). This is how it really works in physics. Show that the partition function obeys the law Z(XXX')=Z(X) Z(X'), at least for finite energetic sets.
zw42 | Puzzle 37. Show that if X is a finite energetic set, its partition function Z(X) ap- proaches its cardinality | X | as T -> +00.
zgr4 | The key virtue of cardinality is that two sets are isomorphic that is, there exists a one-to-one and onto function between them-if and only if they have the same car- dinality. This generalizes to energetic sets if we use the partition function instead of the cardinality! Let's say two energetic sets with energy functions E: X -> R and E' : X' -> R are isomorphic if there is a one-to-one and onto f : X -> X' which is compatible with their energy functions, meaning
ocdz | E'(f(x)) = E(x)
0ii3 | for all x E X.
2gqg | Puzzle 38. Show that two finite energetic sets are isomorphic if and only if they have the same partition function. (Hint: the key is to show that the functions exp(-E/kT) for various energies E E R are linearly independent. As a step toward this, show that a finite linear combination
i4a8 | can only be zero if ci = 0 for the smallest energy Ej.) i Ci exp(-E;/kT)
fupn | Puzzle 39. Make up a category of energetic sets, where morphism are maps that are compatible with their energy functions. Prove that it is a category.
8yo3 | Puzzle 40. Show the disjoint union of energetic sets is the coproduct in this category. Puzzle 41. Show that what I called the cartesian product of energetic sets is not the product in this category.
lm4p | Puzzle 42. Show that what I called the 'cartesian product' of energetic sets gives a symmetric monoidal structure on the category of energetic sets. So we should really write it as a tensor product X & X', not X x X'.
mpm5 | Puzzle 43. Show this tensor product distributes over coproducts: X ® (Y + Z) ~ XØY+XOZ.
stwt | We can go even further and define not only a partition function for energetic sets, but also an expected energy, free energy, and entropy, using the formulas we've seen earlier. These obey a bunch of rules like this:
pcec | Puzzle 44. Define the entropy of an energetic set by
jqe8 | S(X)=k-InZ(X) +BInZ(X))
urkt | Show that
0dx9 | S(X®Y)=S(X)+S(Y).

x96u | ENTROPY COMES IN TWO PARTS
3txt | The entropy of a system in thermal equilibrium is always the sum of two parts:
qe3d | 1. The free energy part:
od26 | − F T = k ln Z
l4k6 | This is Boltzmann's constant times the logarithm of the number of accessible states.
y4a0 | 2. The expected energy part:
bnif | (E) T
q018 | This equals InkT if the system has n degrees of freedom and its energy is a positive definite quadratic form.
jbak | Before we dive into examples, it's good to think one last time about the entropy of a system in thermal equilibrium. We've seen that this entropy is always the sum of two parts, which we could call the free energy part -F/T and the expected energy part (E)/T. But there are various ways to think about this. One is simply that it follows from F = (E) - TS: the free energy is the expected energy minus the useless energy. But here is another way to think about it.
e9cp | In his early work, Boltzmann said the entropy of a system is k times the logarithm of the number of states it can occupy. This is true if all these states are equally probable. But typically some states are more probable than others. We could try to address this by replacing the number of states with the number of accessible states
94lh | Z = Le-BEi iEX
jxk1 | Here we count states weighted by their accessibility exp(-BE;). If we try to follow Boltzmann's prescription with this adjustment we get k ln Z = F/T. This is the free energy part of the entropy.
wgvf | In many situations this is close to the true entropy. But this clearly can't be all there is to it. After all, suppose we add the same constant c to the energy of each state. Then the probability of each state in thermal equilibrium is unchanged, so the entropy must stay the same! But the accessibility of each state gets multiplied by exp(-ßc), so we have to subtract kfc from the free energy part of the entropy. There must be some compensating term-and this is the expected energy part of the entropy, (E)/T. When we add c to the energy of each state, this goes up by c/T = kBc.
