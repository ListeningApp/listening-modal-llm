        "content": "5vqw | Let us bend down over another enchanted world. Let us examine at length, holding our breath, Fouquet's Hours of Etienne Chevalier. Do we find here, caught beneath the frost of a miraculous execution, absurdly perfect figurines rendered with minute strokes according to workshop rules by an exceptionally acute observer? Far from it. Here is one of the highest expressions of that sense of monumental form which is the characteristic trait of the French Middle Ages. One can enlarge these figurines a hundredfold without their losing in power of projection or in fundamental unity. They are like church statues, whose sisters or descendants they might well be called. The hand that drew them belongs to a dynasty formed by centuries of sculpture. It retains, if one may say so, the bent and the force of sculpture even in the tiniest bas-reliefs, dark and gilded, and painted like optical illusions, which sometimes accompany the manuscript illumination and which are likewise treated with exquisite breadth. Thus do two worlds come together, as in the circular mirror that Van Eyck hung at the back of the Arnolfini portrait: the world of living giants, cathedral builders and image carvers, and the magical world of the infinitely small. In one world, the hand works with mallet and chisel on a block of stone propped up on a trestle; in the other, it works over a square of parchment in which fine instruments fashion the most precious rarities of the design. I do not know whether one senses it, or if everything is done to make us forget it; but the hand is there, making its presence known in\nmeyw | the joining of the limbs, in the energetic calligraphy of a face, in the profile of a walled city blue in the atmosphere, and even in the gold cross-hatchings that model the light.\n2e62 | Nerval relates the story of a hand laid under a curse and which, severed from its body, journeys over the world to do a work of its own. As for me, I separate hands neither from the body nor from the mind. But the relationships between mind and hand are not, however, so simple as those between a chief accustomed to obedience and a docile slave. The mind rules over the hand; hand rules over mind. The gesture that makes nothing, the gesture with no tomorrow, provokes and defines only the state of consciousness. The creative gesture exercises a continuous influence over the inner life. The hand wrenches the sense of touch away from its merely receptive passivity and organizes it for experiment and action. It teaches man to conquer space, weight, density and quantity. Because it fashions a new world, it leaves its imprint everywhere upon it. It struggles with the very substance it metamorphoses and with the very form it transfigures.\n75y3 | Trainer of man, the hand multiplies him in space and in time.\ns2g2 | The Life of Forms in Art, nineteen thirty-four",
