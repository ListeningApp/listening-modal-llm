You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

k5r6 | 3.1.2 Focused question 2 |
z9v9 | A total of 12 studies (Aimetti et al., 2020; Baumer et al., 2020; Cortellini et al., 2020; De Wet et al., 2018; Graetz et al., 2020; Jiao et al., 2017, 2018; Nibali et al., 2017, 2020; Saleh et al., 2021; Saydzai et al., 2022; Sonnenschein et al., 2017) including 1190 subjects had a minimum of 5 years of follow-up in SPC and were included in the qualitative and quantitative analyses (Tables 1, 3 and 4). Eight studies including 869 subjects had complete site-level data and so were used in the analyses assessing the relationships between 'stable periodonti- tis' and 'endpoints of therapy' and subsequent tooth loss. Ten studies followed conventional APT. Five studies reported on periodontitis- related tooth loss, and so this data were used when available. Studies without two arms (i.e., zero subjects or teeth when assessing tooth loss in relation to successfully or unsuccessfully reaching the end- points) were subsequently not included in the corresponding meta- analyses when analysing the WWC 2017 (De Wet et al., 2018; Jiao et al., 2018) and PPD ≥ 6 mm (Aimetti et al., 2020).
gpu9 | 3.1.3 | Prevalence of stable and successfully treated periodontitis subjects at the start of SPC
u5ws | Table 2 and Supplemental Material S4 display the prevalence data of each of the 15 studies at the subject and tooth level for achieving the endpoints.
onkh | Subject-level data
8t55 | Of 12,563 subjects who had complete site-level data, 1.35% (n = 169) fulfilled the criteria of 'stable periodontitis' and 11.00% <LATEX>\left( n = 1 3 8 2 \right)</LATEX> met the 'endpoints of therapy'. 'Controlled periodontitis' was achieved in 34.62% <LATEX>\left( n = 4 4 6 0 \right)</LATEX> of the 12,884 subjects, while PPD < 5 mm and PPD < 6 mm were achieved in 6.70% (n = 863) and 30.45% (n = 3923) of subjects, respectively. Achievement of end- points varied greatly across studies. The prevalence of reaching each of the five subject-level endpoints increased when studies following conventional APT were analysed (9.43% fulfilled the criteria of 'stable periodontitis', 27.6% met the 'endpoints of therapy', 52.42% achieved 'controlled periodontitis', while 21.08% and 49.76% achieved PPD < 5 mm and PPD < 6 mm, respectively).
7imw | Tooth-level data
lf1t | Of 323,111 teeth, 314,963 teeth had complete site-level data. A total of 54.69% and 73.55% of teeth met the composite measures described in 'stable periodontitis' and 'endpoints of therapy', respectively, and 68.52% and 87.32% of all included teeth had <LATEX>P P D < 5</LATEX> mm and PPD < 6 mm, respectively. Maxillary molars achieved tooth-level end- points least frequently (24.18% and 47.20%, respectively, for 'stable
tze7 | periodontitis' and 'endpoints of therapy'), closely followed by mandibular molars (Supplemental Material S5). As per WWC 2017, there were 11.36 and 11.51 'diseased' teeth per patient after APT among all 12,563 subjects and 12,394 'unstable' subjects, respectively. This reduced to 4.79 and 5.29 'diseased' teeth in all 732 subjects and 663 'unstable' subjects, respectively, from studies following conventional APT.
