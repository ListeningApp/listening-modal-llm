You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

us5v | (ILVs) (Wollert et al. 2009). Early endosomes derived from CME, if not sorted, follow a recycling pathway to the plasma membrane (Figure 1A) (Saftig & Klumperman 2009). ILVs are enveloped inside multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which mature into late endosomes. These late endosomes deliver their luminal contents either by forming tubular extensions or by fusing with pre-existing lysosomes to form endolysosomes (Luzio et al. 2007). These may be considered the final compartment of the endocytic pathway, where hydrolases degrade endocytic cargo and the membranes of ILVs for reuse (Klumperman & Raposo 2014; Saftig & Klumperman 2009). In addition, there is retrograde transport of receptors (such as M6P, Lamp2a, etc) from endosomes to the TGN for reuse through the retromer complex, comprised mainly of VPS35, VPS26 and VPS29 (Saftig & Klumperman 2009) (Figure 1A). Proteins that are meant for secretion follow a secretory pathway from the TGN (Saftig & Klumperman 2009; Klumperman & Raposo 2014). Selective capture and elimination of a cell's damaged organelles and misfolded proteins happens through a process called macroautophagy (termed hereafter as autophagy) (Ohsumi 2014), an integral part of the E-L system. Double membrane vesicles called autophagosomes encapsulate unwanted/ toxic cytosolic constituents including aggregated proteins and deliver them to the lysosome for degradation (Figure 1A) (Kawamata et al. 2008; Mizushima 2007). Non-selective autophagy also occurs during starvation, through which cells can recycle proteins and reuse amino acids for the synthesis of basic proteins essential for cell survival (Ohsumi 2014). Therefore, autophagy plays a pivotal role in housekeeping and maintenance of neuronal homeostasis.
rs2m | Customization of the E-L system for neurons mainly happens in axons (Figure 1B) and synapses (Figure 1C). At presynaptic terminals, vesicle precursors are delivered from the cell body and undergo vesicle cycling to form functional synaptic vesicles (SVs). However, delivery of new vesicle precursors cannot match the number of SVs undergoing exocytosis to achieve neurotransmission at an active synapse (Saheki & De Camilli 2012). This deficit is solved by highly responsive CME, recapturing fused vesicular membranes from the presynaptic membrane to form CCVs, which are in turn converted back to SVs through clathrin uncoating (Figure 1C) (Heuser & Reese 1973; Morgan et al. 2000; Saheki & De Camilli 2012). Less understood clathrin-independent bulk endocytosis (Holt et al. 2003; Wu & Wu 2007) and the "kiss and run" mechanism (Fesce et al. 1994) are also parts of the synaptic endocytic repertoire. In addition, there are dense-core vesicles (DCVs) derived from the TGN that are transported down the axons. Unlike SVs, DCVs do not participate in SV recycling and are primarily used to secrete long-acting neuropeptides (Nurrish 2014). While these processes are mostly confined to the presynaptic compartment, the E-L system's postsynaptic compartment contributes to membrane trafficking pathways primarily aimed at receptor, transporter, and ion-channel recycling (Rosendale et al. 2017).
uz9y | Though this complex E-L system allows a neuron to function far away from its site of protein synthesis, the neuron is beholden to anterograde transport of proteins and membranes synthesized and modified in the soma for maintenance of axons and the synapses (Maday et al. 2014). Furthermore, constant synaptic activity, especially in continuously firing neurons like SNpc dopaminergic neurons may result in considerable build-up of damaged organelles, membranes, and misfolded proteins. These need to undergo encapsulation by an autophagosome or endosome (Figure 1C) and retrograde transport to the

These spatial challenges to address a unique structural geometry, high metabolic demand, enhanced responsiveness to chemical/electrical stimulation, and the requirement for longevity due to their postmitotic nature, place a tremendous burden on the E-L system. Nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons have an additional burden in terms of long and highly branched axons, larger surface area, selective transporters for external toxins, large fluctuations in free Ca2+, less buffering capacity, and higher oxidative stress, reducing their threshold for degeneration (Surmeier et al. 2017; Vidyadhara et al. 2019; Vidyadhara et al. 2016; Vidyadhara et al. 2017). These vulnerabilities are further exacerbated with aging. Faced with environmental and genetic risk factors, disease pathogenesis abounds.
