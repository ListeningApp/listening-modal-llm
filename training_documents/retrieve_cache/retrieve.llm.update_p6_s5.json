        "content": "2e62 | Motorola Inc. has adopted such a model and measure, which we helped to develop. The model consists of five leadership requirements: envision, energize, edge, execute, and ethics and character. The first four requirements, which we had no hand in choosing, amount to the two dominant dualities we have identified in our research. \"Envision\" and \"execute\" are synonymous with strategic leadership and operational leadership, respectively. \"Edge\" is the equivalent of forceful leadership and \"energize\" has properties of enabling leadership. The fifth requirement, ethics and character, refers to the individual's core values and is the base on which the other four requirements rest. The per-\n75y3 | Senior managers who take too much credit or are arrogant are actually among the least sure of themselves.\ns2g2 | The tendency to polarize human beings' inherent tendency to see choices as either/or scenarios feeds into the psychology of overdoing and underdoing. When presented with a pair of opposing virtues, most people tend to choose one over the other, though in fact they may not even realize they are making a choice. For whatever personal, historical or organizational reason, they adopt a principle, a truth about leadership and do not realize they are forsaking its complementary truth.\nq1q2 | Take the case of an executive who excels at treating people well. She listens attentively and creates an atmosphere in which people feel comfortable speaking up in meetings. She empowers people and supports them when they need help. She is soft-spoken and nonthreatening. She believes in this way of leading and strongly identifies with it. The problem is that she has turned\ncb7r | Performance measure that we developed for Motorola employs two rating scales designed to detect imbalance. Using the two scales, subordinates and superiors rate a target manager on thirty-three specific behaviors. On the first scale, raters are asked to evaluate the manager's effectiveness on each behavior from one, ineffective, to five, extraordinarily effective. On the second scale they rate how the manager should change his behavior to become more effective - that is, from \"do a lot less\" a rating of negative three to \"do a lot more\" a rating of positive three.\n68xu | A leadership model of this sort, organized around basic dualities germane to an organization, equips that organization to better analyze job requirements, assess individuals, make staffing decisions, plot development plans and reward people - in other words, it helps form the basis of a talent-management system designed to build the desired leadership culture.\nhd35 | Her back on power and self-assertion, on telling people what they may not want to hear - for example, that she is not satisfied with their performance or is unhappy about a missed deadline. This is a nearly pure case of polarizing. The individual has formed a blind attachment to the enabling side of leadership because she can find practically no fault with it. She has misgivings about the forceful side because she focuses only on its negative aspects and excesses. The side she turns away from becomes her blind side and compromises her performance.\n2zpk | How Managers Can Improve Themselves\nepu7 | An out-of-balance leadership style almost always rests on the shaky foundation of distorted beliefs about leadership, as well as associated fears. The duality-oriented model of leadership is useful because it naturally calls attention to the beliefs and feelings that underlie a manager's approach. The resulting self-awareness puts managers in a stronger position to increase their versatility and, thereby, boost their effectiveness.\n7od1 | The first step toward correcting imbalance is to see it in oneself. Our data show that executives have difficulty with this: Their reading of their versatility or lack thereof was often inaccurate. Self-ratings were barely related to coworker ratings - on versatility, on effectiveness or on the link between the two. Yet superior, peer and subordinate ratings showed substantial convergence with one another. What's more, self-ratings of versatility bore virtually no relationship to self-ratings of overall effectiveness. It seems that everyone sees leadership imbalances and their link to ineffectiveness except for the person in question.\n0bqy | Whether a manager overdoes or underdoes something, he tends to look upon it as the proper response to the task at hand. Because he overdoes what he's good at, he places a high value on it and has a difficult time seeing how one can do too much of a good thing. Because he underdoes what he does not value, he has trouble seeing the problem with neglecting what he deems valueless behavior. It is no wonder that performance problems don't get corrected easily.\nb780 | Strengthening the Weak Side If they're not careful, managers can fool themselves into thinking that making up a versatility deficit is merely a matter of acquiring a skill. But reversing an imbalance requires internal work - contending with a misconception, a bias, a prejudicial attitude or a fear. The easiest internal change is simply to recognize what the job requires. It is relatively easy to make that intellectual adjustment, but the emotional and behavioral adjustments are not nearly as straightforward.\nccmb | It can be equally challenging to put a highly personal modus operandi into perspective. A manager who, for instance, values her own autonomy and self-sufficiency and operates best that way\nma93 | Must nevertheless recognize that her staff's needs may be quite different and that she must adjust her style to meet those needs.\nc6hh | Harder still for a manager is overcoming an inhibition or fear of what he would become if he were to strengthen his neglected side. Forceful managers, for example, worry that they will become weak. Overly enabling managers worry that they will become mean, abrasive or power-mongering. Looking across the dividing line, they see not the virtues of the other side but the worst excesses, and they recoil. These fears cut straight to the heart of managers' sense of who they are. The more out of balance the manager, the more polarized the mind-set and the stiffer the emotional challenge.\ny7ea | Complicating the task, otherwise objective managers have difficulty gauging how much of the new behavior they are exhibiting and, afraid of exhibiting too much, they regularly overestimate. As one shrewd fellow said, \"I'm learning that when I think I'm coming on like a ton of bricks not to worry about that because my sensors are bad and so my data are unreliable.\" Knowing this, he has taken to asking others for their reading.\nnav4 | Moderating the Overused Side To stop overdoing it, managers also need to do some internal work, although of a somewhat different character. Rather than strengthening muscles they have allowed to atrophy, they have to undertrain muscles developed to the point of hypertrophy. That kind of work involves learning to place less value on, and identify less with, a particular skill or personal quality such as operational competence or tough-mindedness. Underneath these exaggerated values or distorted beliefs often lie unacknowledged needs or fears. Managers whose fear of not being responsible enough leads to a debilitating sense of responsibility, or whose anxiety about not adding enough value causes them to strain to prove themselves at every opportunity often cannot allay such anxieties on their own. They can, however, be greatly aided with positive feedback about their competence in general or in the particular respect that they fret about - if they can internalize the feedback.\ngem8 | The key to moderating strengths that have been taken to an extreme is for managers to learn to be more nuanced in their application. When managers contemplate easing up, they tend to worry that they will lose all of the capability they rely so heavily upon. Unconsciously, they treat any modulation as binary. They need to see the control mechanism not as an on-off switch, but rather as a dial, one that they simply can turn down a notch or two. They don't have to give up their gift; they can instead make more discriminating, and therefore more effective, use of it.",
