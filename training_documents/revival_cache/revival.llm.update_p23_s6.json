        "content": "zhvt | Is he now free to transgress God's law? Says Paul: \"Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\" \"How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?\" And John declares: \"This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments: and His commandments are not grievous.\" In the new birth the heart is brought into harmony with God, as it is brought into accord with His law. When this mighty change has taken place in the sinner, he has passed from death unto life, from sin unto holiness, from transgression and rebellion to obedience and loyalty. ...\nyv1q | Sanctification-Who Does the Work?\nu7jx | Erroneous theories of sanctification, ... springing from neglect or rejection of the divine law, have a prominent place in the religious movements of the day. These theories are both false in doctrine and dangerous in practical results; and the fact that they are so generally finding favor, renders it doubly essential that all have a clear understanding of what the Scriptures teach upon this point.\n03u9 | True sanctification is a Bible doctrine. The apostle Paul, in his letter to the Thessalonian church, declares: \"This is the will of God, even your sanctification.\" And he prays: \"The very God of peace sanctify you wholly.\" The Bible clearly teaches what sanctification is and how it is to be attained. The Saviour prayed for His disciples: \"Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is truth.\" And Paul teaches that believers are to be \"sanctified by the Holy Ghost.\" What is the work of the Holy Spirit? Jesus told His disciples: \"When He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth.\" And the psalmist says: \"Thy law is the truth.\" By the word and the Spirit of God are opened to men the great principles of righteousness embodied in His law. And since the law of God is \"holy, and just, and good,\" a transcript of the divine perfection, it follows that a character formed by obedience to that law will be holy. Christ is a perfect example of such a character. He says: \"I have kept My Father's commandments.\" \"I do always those things that please Him.\" The followers of Christ are to become like Him-by the grace of God to form characters in harmony with the principles of His holy law. This is Bible sanctification.\n8sqd | This work can be accomplished only through faith in Christ, by the power of the indwelling Spirit of God. Paul admonishes believers: \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\" The Christian will feel the promptings of sin, but he will maintain a constant warfare against it. Here is where Christ's help is needed. Human weakness becomes united to divine strength, and faith exclaims: \"Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.\"\nvlyz | The Scriptures plainly show that the work of sanctification is progressive. When in conversion the sinner finds peace with God through the blood of the atonement, the Christian life has but just begun. Now he is to \"go on unto perfection;\" to grow up \"unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.\" ...\n5034 | No Room for Boasting\n9lvu | Those who experience the sanctification of the Bible will manifest a spirit of humility. Like Moses, they have had a view of the awful majesty of holiness, and they see their own unworthiness in contrast with the purity and exalted perfection of the Infinite One.\nuy7a | The prophet Daniel was an example of true sanctification. His long life was filled up with noble service for his Master. He was a man \"greatly beloved\" of Heaven. Yet instead of claiming to be pure and holy, this honored prophet identified himself with the really sinful of Israel as he pleaded before God in behalf of his people: \"We do not present our supplications before Thee for our righteousnesses, but for Thy great mercies.\" \"We have sinned, we have done wickedly.\" He declares: \"I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people. ... \"\nlqs6 | When Job heard the voice of the Lord out of the whirlwind, he exclaimed: \"I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.\" It was when Isaiah saw the glory of the Lord, and heard the cherubim crying, \"Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts,\" that he cried out, \"Woe is me! for I am undone.\" Paul, after he was caught up into the third heaven and heard things which it was not possible for a man to utter, speaks of himself as \"less than the least of all saints.\" It was the beloved John, who leaned on Jesus' breast and beheld His glory, that fell as one dead before the feet of the angel.\nri4s | There can be no self-exaltation, no boastful claim to freedom from sin, on the part of those who walk in the shadow of Calvary's cross. They feel that it was their sin which caused the agony that broke the heart of the Son of God, and this thought will lead them to self-abasement. Those who live nearest to Jesus discern most clearly\n2j8o | the frailty and sinfulness of humanity, and their only hope is in the merit of a crucified and risen Saviour.\nqrl1 | Counterfeit Sanctification-Is It \"Only Believe\"?\nuvvk | The sanctification now gaining prominence in the religious world carries with it a spirit of self-exaltation and a disregard for the law of God that mark it as foreign to the religion of the Bible. Its advocates teach that sanctification is an instantaneous work, by which, through faith alone, they attain to perfect holiness. \"Only believe,\" say they, \"and the blessing is yours.\" No further effort on the part of the receiver is supposed to be required. At the same time they deny the authority of the law of God, urging that they are released from obligation to keep the commandments. But is it possible for men to be holy, in accord with the will and character of God, without coming into harmony with the principles which are an expression of His nature and will, and which show what is well pleasing to Him?",
