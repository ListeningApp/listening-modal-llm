        "content": "0b39 | Additional synthetic utility of enediyne thirteen D bearing ethynyl and M E two N groups at the ortho-position of a benzene ring was illustrated by electrophile-induced cyclization twenty-seven that led to two-triazolyl-three-iodoindole sixteen.\nqecd | Sixteen seventy-four. In summary, an efficient and convenient one-step approach toward one-substituted four-ethynyl-five-iodo-one, two, three-triazoles was developed based on CuAAC of one-iodobutadiynes with organic azides using a C u I P Ph three three two six catalytic system. The reaction is tolerant to various functional groups and allows alkyl, aryl, hydroxyalkyl, ethoxycarbonyl, and dialkylamino functional groups to be introduced into different positions of target triazoles. Four-ethynyl-five-iodo-one, two, three-triazoles were demonstrated to be useful building blocks for the synthesis of triazole-fused enediyne systems and five-aryl-four-ethynyltriazoles, which are of great interest because of their further synthetic utility.\n1o7p | EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\ncp13 | General Information and Methods. Solvents, reagents, and chemicals (two-methylbut-three-yn-two-ol, iodoarenes) used for reactions were purchased from commercial suppliers. Catalyst Pd P Ph three four was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Solvents were dried under standard conditions, and chemicals were used without further purification. Catalysts C u P Ph three three I twelve and CuCI(IPr), chloro[one, three-bis(two, six-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-two-ylidene]copper(I), were synthesized by known procedures without any modification. Benzyl azide (eight a),\nbgre | one-(azidomethyl)-four-methoxybenzene (eight b), five-(azidomethyl)-one, two, three-trimethoxybenzene (eight c), ethyl two-azidoacetate (eight d), one-(azidomethyl)-four-nitrobenzene (eight f), six-azidohexan-one-ol (eight g), one-azido-four-methoxybenzene (eight h), one-azidohexane (eight i), two, seven-dimethylocta-three, five-diyne-two, seven-diol (one), buta-one, three-diyn-one-ylbenzenes (four d, five d), methyl(p-tolylbuta-one, three-diyn-one-yl)silane (six a), (((four-methoxyphenyl)buta-one, three-diyn-one-yl)trimethylsilane (six b), six-(trimethylsilyl)hexa-three, five-diyn-one-ol (six c), one fifteen trimethyl(penthyl)silane (six d), and methoxymethyltrimethylsilane six e were synthesized using previously reported procedures.\n57lp | Evaporation of solvents and concentration of reaction mixtures were performed in vacuo at thirty-five degrees Celsius on a rotary evaporator. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on silica gel plates (Silica gel sixty, UV two fifty-four) with detection by UV or staining with a basic aqueous solution of KMnO4. Melting points (mp) determined are uncorrected. Proton and Carbon thirteen{Proton} NMR spectra were recorded at four hundred and one hundred MHz, respectively, at twenty-five degrees Celsius in CDCl3 without the internal standard. The Proton NMR data are reported as chemical shifts (delta), multiplicity (s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br, broad), coupling constants (J, given in Hertz), and number of protons. The Carbon thirteen NMR data are reported as the chemical shifts (S) and type of carbon (p, primary; s, secondary; t, tertiary; q, quaternary) determined from DEPT experiments with coupling constant J C-F for F-containing compounds. Chemical shifts for Proton and Carbon thirteen are reported as delta values (ppm) and referenced to a residual solvent delta equals seven point two six ppm for Proton; delta equals seventy-seven point one six ppm for Carbon thirteen. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were determined using electrospray ionization (ESI) in the mode of positive ion registration with a TOF mass analyzer. High-resolution mass spectra of compound seven e (methanol solution) were recorded on a Bruker maXis Q-TOF instrument equipped with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization ion source in positive ion mode. IR spectra were recorded for tablets with KBr. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies were carried out on a diffractometer at one hundred Kelvin using Cu Ka radiation (one equals one point five four one eight zero Ã…). Using Olex two, the structure was solved with the Super flip structure solution program using Charge Flipping and refined with the ShelXL refinement package using least-squares minimization.",
