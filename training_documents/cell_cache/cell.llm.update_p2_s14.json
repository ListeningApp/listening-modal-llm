        "content": "dgcw | It is important to highlight that mammalian OET needs only a few replication cycles for ZGA to reprogram embryonic cells to pluripotency. This contrasts with the time and large number of replication cycles needed for artificial establishment of pluripotency in cultured cells. In fact, it has been noted that the number of cell divisions is a key parameter driving epigenetic reprogramming to pluripotency. As mentioned above, other animals (whose development is often deterministic) have multiple cleavages in a short time prior to ZGA while mouse zygotes undergo major ZGA after the first cleavage. Mammalian cell biochemistry is presumably not much different from that of invertebrates. Thus, the \"a few days, a few cleavages\" mode of OET in mammals appears to be a unique mode of the initiation of development. Only by better understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms can we hope for further improvement in our ability to reprogram cell-fate. Of importance are the replication-dependent and independent chromatin changes in one-cell and two-cell mouse zygotes.\ngvwz | Four. Chromatin dynamics during ZGA in mice\nsk5m | While there is a complex relationship between chromatin structure, transcription, and post-transcriptional processing, reprogramming gene expression is a matter of the ability of RNA polymerase two to access promoters, which is based on chromatin structure and available transcription factors. Chromatin is extensively remodeled between the one-cell and two-cell stages. Importantly, both parental genomes remain separated in female and male pronuclei that do not fuse in the one-cell zygote. Instead of fusing, nuclear envelopes of pronuclei break down during the first cleavage and embryonic nuclei accommodating both parental genomes form in two-cell blastomeres. Reviewing\nqws8 | in detail the contribution of chromatin to OET is beyond the scope of this work, which will focus just on two key aspects of chromatin structure: the protamine/histone exchange after fertilization, and dynamics of chromatin on the eve of ZGA.\n877u | Four point one. Protamine/histone exchange\nrzhj | In contrast to the maternal genome, which maintains nucleosome-based chromatin structure with global histone modification patterns similar to those of somatic cells, paternal chromatin undergoes major remodeling because the elementary protein component of the sperm chromatin are protamine molecules. Consequently, paternal histone modifications are essentially erased together with the nucleosomal chromatin structure during spermatogenesis in a process of protamine/histone exchange. Importantly, one to ten percent of histones are retained in the mouse and human spermatozoa, respectively. These residual histones carry specific modifications and their retention does not appear random. The H three K four me two (active) mark was found in promoters of genes involved in spermatogenesis and cellular homeostasis, while the H three K twenty-seven me three (repressive) mark was associated with developmental promoters. It was proposed that residual histones contribute to paternal heterochromatin formation in human zygotes. However, other studies suggested that nucleosome retention is predominantly associated with gene deserts and not developmental promoters. Therefore, the significance of nucleosome retention for OET remains unclear.\nbfax | Upon fertilization, protamine/histone exchange takes place in reverse in order with help from the histone chaperone HIRA to establish nucleosome chromatin structure of the paternal genome. The consequence of the protamine/histone exchange is that the paternal genome initiates its journey at the beginning of development with \"na√Øve\" nucleosome chromatin structures. This correlates with the bulk of initial RNA synthesis in mouse zygotes which takes place in the male pronucleus.\nf2y8 | Four point two. Chromatin dynamics\no7qm | Chromatin dynamics is a broadly used term covering changes of covalent modifications of DNA and histones as well as DNA accessibility and higher order chromatin organization into chromatin domains (topologically associating domains - TADs). Because this review focuses on transcriptional aspects of the genome activation, it will only highlight selected aspects of chromatin dynamics.\nd52l | The most common covalent mammalian DNA modification is five-methyl cytosine (five m C). It is a classic epigenetic mark that does not alter DNA sequence, but can carry heritable information. While there is an ongoing debate regarding causes and consequences of DNA methylation with respect to regulation of transcription, DNA methylation has been generally associated with transcriptional silencing and genome maintenance through repression of parasitic sequences.\nqlbb | DNA methylation in the mammalian germline undergoes two reprogramming events, in which existing DNA methylation is largely eliminated. In mouse zygotes, maternal and paternal genomes show two distinct demethylation patterns upon staining with a five m C-recognizing antibody. The paternal genome rapidly loses five m C signal (six to eight hours after fertilization) while the maternal genome gradually reduces methylation during cleavage-stage development. The overall loss of DNA methylation is associated with reduction of repressive chromatin. The molecular mechanism of five m C loss entails oxidation into five-hydroxymethyl cytosine (five hm C) by TET dioxygenase and base excision repair. Active paternal DNA demethylation in the zygote is found in many mammals, but is not entirely conserved and is incomplete. Apart from imprinted loci, which retain their parent-of-origin methylation pattern in imprinting control regions, intracisternal A-particle (IAP), an active murine endogenous retrovirus also remains methylated despite global demethylation.",
