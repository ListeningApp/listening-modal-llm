You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

2hsv | VALUE OFFER: THE THOUGHT PROCESS
7s7l | "If at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again."
uwdf | THOMAS H. PALMER, TEACHER'S MANUAL
jjgp | I want to do an exercise with you right now. I want to show you the difference between convergent and divergent problem solving. Why? So that you can actually create the Grand Slam Offer that will become the cornerstones of your business.
df4g | Convergent & Divergent Thinking
qc2j | In simple terms, convergent problem solving is where you take lots of variables, all known, with unchanging conditions and converge on a singular answer. Think math.
x3oh | Example:
fqvx | You have 3 salespeople who can each take 100 calls per month each.
viae | It takes 4 calls to create one sale (including no shows).
p8u9 | You need to get to 110 sales . . .
49ky | How many sales people must you hire? Deduced Information:
p5wo | 1 salesperson = 100 calls
74rp | 4 calls = 1 close
oolg | 100 calls/4 calls per close = 25 Closes Per 100 Calls
3ewf | 25 closes per rep
5iea | Goal: 110 sales total / 25 sales per rep = 4.4
62l5 | Since you can't hire 4.4 reps, you decide you must have five.
shub | ANSWER: And since you have 3, you hire two more.
zjn5 | Math problems are convergent. There are lots of variables and a single answer. We are taught all our lives in school to think this way. That is because it's easy to grade.
w8ia | But life will pay you for your ability to solve using a divergent thought process. In other words, think of many solutions to a single problem. Not only that, convergent answers are binary. They are either right or they are wrong. With divergent thinking, you can have multiple right answers, and one answer that is way more right than the others. Cool right?
4vej | Here's what life presents us for divergent thinking: Multiple Variables, Known & Unknown, Dynamic Conditions, Multiple Answers.
8ut1 | As such, I want to do an exercise with you that will engage the part of your brain that you will need to use in order to make something magical.
6o35 | I call it the "brick" exercise. Don't worry, it'll only take 120 seconds.
8r63 | y
qze0 | The Brick Exercise
o3m2 | Right now, I want you to set a timer on your phone for 120 seconds. What you need to do: Think of a brick. Write down as many different uses of a brick as you can possibly think of. How many different ways could a brick be used in life to provide value.
kro9 | Ready? Go. It's okay to write in the book.
i438 | Alright - stop. Now before I show you my list, did you consider the following . . .
yr7b | . . . How big is the brick? A tab of gum, <LATEX>3 - 5 / 8 ^ { \prime \prime } \times 2 - 1 / 4 ^ { \prime \prime } \times 8 ^ { \prime \prime }</LATEX> (Standard), 2 ft x 2 ft x 6ft? What is the brick made of? Plastic, Gold, Clay, Wood, Metal? . .
60hk | .. . How is the brick shaped? Does it have holes in it? Does it have divots for interlocking?
5djf | Now as you think about that, can you think of even more uses for the brick than you probably wrote down? Here's my list:
hem5 | · Paper weight
vfd9 | · Door stop
jkgk | · Building things
8nom | . Home for a fish in a fish bowl
vsjd | · Plant holder with dirt in the holes (holed brick)
tucm | · As a trophy (painted brick)
prly | · Rustic decoration
2epy | · To break window
v55t | · Make a mural (tiny bricks painted)
53fa | · A weight for resistance training
nnb3 | · A wedge under uneven platform
s943 | · Pen holder (holed brick)
o7zd | · Children's toy (lego bricks)
thxo | · Floatation device (plastic brick)
b67w | · Payment for goods (gold brick)
hoze | · Stabilizer for leaning something against
hd71 | · Retainer of value (gold brick)
eix9 | · Holder for flagpole (holed brick)
h4p4 | · A seat (jumbo brick)
asp2 | Every offer has building blocks, the pieces that when combined make an offer irresistible. Our goal is to use a divergent thought process to think of as many easy ways to combine these elements to provide value.
8d1n | So if I were selling a brick, I would find out what my customer's desire was, and then devise how many ways I could create value with my "brick."
559s | Now let's do it for real.

zoz0 | W hen I started my gym, I struggled. I wanted so deeply to be successful, prove my dad wrong about my decision to start my own business, and prove to myself that I was worth something. But try as I did, I couldn't even sell people into a $99/mo bootcamp. People would say, "LA Fitness is $29/mo. This is expensive." I even tried getting people to start for free. They said they wouldn't bother because $99/mo afterwards was still too much, and they didn't want to start something they wouldn't continue with.
3blu | It's a new level of frustration when you can't even give your services away for free to people. I felt worthless, and I didn't know what to do. Thankfully, during this time, I was in groups with other gym owners, and I started hearing about marketers and books. I devoured everything I could. And as soon as I stumbled on Dan Kennedy's books, I was hooked.
xv2l | In his books, he talked about making "irresistible offers." Again, this theme of "making an offer so good people would feel stupid to say no" kept re-appearing. But this time, remembering what TJ had told me, I decided to go all in on this concept, rather than just do what everyone else was doing.
xt4k | But how? Everyone else was selling $99/mo bootcamps. How was I going to compete? So I decided to look at what we did differently. I thought - what do they really want? No one wants a membership; they want to lose weight.
ti78 | Step #1: Identify Dream Outcome
k5pk | I had heard of weight loss challenges, so I started there.
n093 | · Lose 201bs in 6 weeks.
4khi | · Big dream outcome - lose 201bs.
7fh2 | · With a decreased time delay - 6 weeks.
5isn | Note: I wasn't selling my membership anymore. I wasn't selling the plane flight. I was selling the vacation. When you are thinking about your dream outcome, it has to be them arriving at their destination and what they would like to experience.
5vry | Step #2: List Problems
9w33 | Next, I wrote down all the things people struggled with and their limiting thoughts around them. When listing out problems, think about what happens immediately before and immediately after someone uses your product/service. What's the "next" thing they need help with? These are all the problems. Think about it in insane detail. If you do, you will create a more valuable and compelling offer as you'll continually be answering people's next problem as it manifests ..
johv | So, let's go ahead and list out the problems from a prospect's perspective as you think about them. What points of friction exist for them? I like to think in the sequence that the customer will experience each of these obstacles. Again, channel insane detail (the more problems the better!).
2olp | Example Problem List: Weight Loss
zb7x | First thing they must do: Buying healthy food, grocery shopping
uadf | 1. Buying healthy food is hard, confusing, and I won't like it
wuf4 | 2. Buying healthy food will take too much time
lfk1 | 3. Buying healthy food is expensive
rwjw | 4. I will not be able to cook healthy food forever. My family's needs will get in my way. If I travel I won't know what to get.
iazp | Next thing they must do: Cooking healthy food
ksn3 | 1. Cooking healthy food is hard and confusing. I won't like it, and I will suck at it.
8xbx | 2. Cooking healthy food will take too much time
aod5 | 3. Cooking healthy food is expensive. It's not worth it.
ayqs | 4. I will not be able to buy healthy food forever. My family's needs will get in my way. If I travel I won't know how to cook healthy.
jnpq | Next thing they must do: Eating healthy food
r4w4 | 1) Etc ...
sswz | Next thing they must do: Exercise Regularly
0uoj | 1) Etc ...
0c89 | Now we're gonna go full circle here. Each of the above problems has four negative elements. And you guessed it, each aligns with the four value drivers as well.

3dfm | 1. Dream Outcome-> This will not be financially worth it
hjmm | 2. Likelihood of Achievement-> It won't work for me specifically. I won't be able to stick with it. External factors will get in my way. (This is the most unique and service-specific of the problem buckets).
s0s6 | 3. Effort & Sacrifice-> This will be too hard, confusing. I won't like it. I will suck at it.
cxx7 | 4. Time-> This will take too much time to do. I am too busy to do this. It will take too long to work. It won't be convenient for me.
uzqc | Now, go ahead and list out all the problems your prospect has. Don't let these buckets, which are just meant to get your brain going, constrain you. If it's easier for you, just list out everything you can possibly think of.
dqwn | What I showed here isn't just four problems, though. We have 16 core problems with two to four sub problems underneath. So 32 to 64 problems total. Yowza. No wonder most people don't achieve their goals. Do not get overwhelmed. This is the best news ever. The more problems you think of, the more problems you get to solve.
g58m | So, to recap, just list out each core thing that someone has to do. Then think of all the reasons they wouldn't be able to do it, or keep doing it (using the four value drivers as a guide).
kf9u | Now we get to the fun part: turning problems into solutions.
tl2g | Step #3: Solutions List
xy74 | Now that we have our dream outcome and all the obstacles that will get in someone's way, it's time to define our solutions and list them out.
q0se | Creating the solutions list has two steps. First, we are going to first transform our problems into solutions. Second, we are going to name these solutions. That's it. So let's take a look at our list of problems from earlier. What we're going to do is simply turn them into solutions by thinking, "What would I need to show someone to solve this problem?" Then we are going to reverse each element of the obstacle into solution-oriented language. This is copywriting 101. It's beyond the scope of this book to get into, but simply adding "how to" then reversing the problem will give most people new to this process a great place to start. For our purposes, we are giving ourselves a checklist of exactly what we are going to have to do for our prospects and what we are going to solve for them.
tz7u | Once we have our list of solutions, we will operationalize how we are actually going to solve these problems (create value) in the next step. And I want to be 100 percent clear. You will solve every problem. We'll explore how together, in the next step.

l01c | PROBLEM: Exercise Regularly
yphh | . is hard, confusing, and I won't like it, and I will suck at it -> Easy to follow exercise system that everyone enjoys ... .etc.
3yor | Okay, whew. That's a lot of problems (and a lot of intuited solutions courtesy of divergent thinking). You'll also notice that a lot of them are repetitive. That's totally normal. The value drivers are the four core reasons. Our problems always relate to those drivers, and our solutions provide the needed answer to give a prospect permission to purchase. What's even crazier: is that if only one of these needs is missing in a solution, it can cause someone not to buy. You would be amazed at the reasons people do not buy. So don't limit yourself here.
f9sc | Brooke Castillo is a friend who runs an enormous life coaching business. To give you a different take on the problems- solutions list, Brooke sent me her list as she was going through this book to make a Grand Slam Offer for a 90-Day Relationship course. Take a look to see this process through a totally different lens. The main takeaway, though: Don't be fancy. Just get all the problems down then turn them into solutions.
o5l0 | Regardless of whether the offer you're creating is around fitness (like the example), a relationship course (like Brooke), or something wildly different (like ear aches), we now know what we need to do. Step four is the how (and how to do it without breaking the bank).
c1wq | If you want to walk through the process with me live, go to Acquisition.com/training/offers then select "Offer Creation Part 1" to watch a short video tutorial. As always, it's absolutely free. I also have a Free Offer Creation Checklist for you that you can swipe and immediately deploy in your business. Enjoy.
