        "content": "6qqm | A novel performance-based plastic design methodology for EBFs was proposed by Chao and Goel in two thousand five. The method, which uses an energy-balance criterion and provides a design base shear for a given hazard level, global yield pattern, and target drift, is a direct method in the sense that it does not require any assessment after the initial design. A procedure for the height-wise distribution of this lateral force was also proposed based on the results of extensive nonlinear dynamic analyses. The results revealed that the EBFs designed using the new approach can satisfy expected performance objectives and perform better than those designed using conventional methods, without any notable increase in material usage. It is worth noting that an application of a performance-based approach for the design of a ninety-seven point six meter tall EBF system located in the United States was reported by Sabol and Nishi in two thousand eleven.",
