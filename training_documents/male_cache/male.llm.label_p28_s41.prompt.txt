You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

a0by | 10) Sperm Anatomy and Motility (see Figures 16, 17)
u1ky | a) Head - The genetic material transported by the spermatozoa is located in the nucleus of the head region. The nuclear chromatin is densely packed and homogeneous. Sperm nuclei contain either the X or Y chromosome. It is therefore the male gamete that determines the sex of the offspring. The head region also contains the acrosome, which covers a large portion of the nucleus like a cap. The acrosome contains hydrolytic enzymes that, upon release (the acrosome reaction), function in the penetration of the cumulus and zona pellucida surrounding the egg and facilitate fertilization. The absence of the acrosome (a genetic defect) is termed "round-headed sperm" or globozoospermia (See Chapter 14 for details).
htm9 | b) Neck - also called the connecting piece. At the base of the nucleus is the proximal centriole (CEP135 is a gene encoding a key protein in this structure), followed by an atypical distal centriole and the axoneme, which are all located in the connecting piece.
8hul | c) Midpiece - contains the mitochondria (mitochondrial sheath), which is the main machinery for trapping, conserving, and supplying the energy needed for motility. Also, the beginning of the axoneme, which makes up the flagellum.
87vz | d) Principal Piece and End Piece - The flagellum of the tail of the spermatozoon. It is surrounded by a dense fibrous sheath.
ym66 | 11) Sperm Motility Characteristics
l0a3 | a) The sperm tail beats approximately 10 times/sec. In seminal plasma, the sperm velocity ranges from 10-60 micrometers per second (top speed of 13,400 m.p.h .! ). The average motility for a normal male is approximately 50%-60% within 0.5-1 hour of ejaculation.
u8nw | Tobacco, sexual lubricants, saliva, alcohol, and drugs may decrease sperm motility. Genetic defects can also impact sperm motility.
l2v9 | b) Axonemal Structure of Sperm Tails and the Sliding Microtubule Theory (Figure 9): The microtubule structure of the human sperm tail is the same as that of most plants and animals. The axoneme, or central core of the sperm tail, originates within the mitochondrial sheath and extends the length of the sperm tail (Amelar et al., 1980). The axoneme consists of two central microtubules surrounded by nine microtubule doublets, which has been referred to as the "9+2 configuration" (Figure 17). Each axonemal doublet is composed of two subfibers, A and B. Subfiber A is a complete microtubule while subfiber B is a "C-shaped" microtubule which is
afbe | 4.29
78r8 | attached to a subfiber A (Figures 16, 17). Radial spokes, or arms, composed of dynein extend from each subfiber A to the adjacent subfiber B.
320g | When powered by ATP hydrolysis, the microtubule doublets "walk along" each other by means of their dynein arms. Given the shear resistance within the axoneme, as the microtubule doublets walk along each other bends form in the tail and propagate in such a way as to produce the characteristic movements of the sperm tail (Amelar et al., 1980). This propagation of movement due to the sliding of microtubules along each other is called the "Sliding Microtubule Theory" (Amelar et al., 1980).
tp8g | The presence of the dynein arms is crucial for proper flagellar movement, as are the other structures shown in Figure 16 and 17 and described in more detail in Chapter 14. If these dynein arms are absent, sperm will display complete asthenozoospermia (no motility). For example, Kartagener syndrome (also called immotile sperm or immotile cilia syndrome) is a hereditary condition characterized by ciliary immotility due to the absence of dynein arms (Aitken, 1983). Men with this syndrome will suffer infertility due to immotile sperm. The condition is also associated with other abnormalities due to immotile cilia, such as bronchiectasis and chronic sinusitis. However, in this case, the sperm are not dead, just immotile. Eosin vital staining (a dye exclusion test) can differentiate between dead sperm (or necrozoospermia) and severe asthenozoospermia.
gxfd | 12) HORMONAL CONTROL OF SPERMATOGENESIS: The proper hormonal environment is essential for spermatogenesis. The hormones testosterone, FSH, and possibly growth hormone are involved directly with the developing germ cells. In addition, FSH, LH, and prolactin may be involved indirectly.
s2v1 | 13)
jkp9 | a) The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Testicular Axis:
z8tt | As discussed earlier, the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is a closely integrated series of closed loop feedback systems involving the higher centers in the central nervous system, the hypothalamus, the pituitary, and the testicular endocrine and germinal compartments.
9g22 | The endocrine and exocrine functions of the testis are under the control of the pituitary through its secretion of the gonadotropins LH and FSH (Figure 18). The hypothalamic secretion of the LH- releasing hormone gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), in turn, regulates the anterior pituitary. Steroids secreted by the testis under the influence of the gonadotropins can feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary and modulate their secretions. The interrelationships between the hypothalamus, pituitary, and testis, therefore, represent a fine-tuned control mechanism for hormone secretion.
41fx | The hypothalamus secretes the decapeptide GnRH, which is responsible for stimulating the release of pituitary gonadotropins. The secretion of GnRH is episodic rather than constant and results in episodic release of LH.
7um8 | The rate of testosterone synthesis and secretion by the Leydig cells is primarily dependent upon the amount of LH secreted. The secretion of LH is reciprocally controlled by the action of testicular steroids on the hypothalamus and pituitary. When either androgen or estrogen concentrations

ywwr | increase in the blood circulation, LH levels decline (negative feedback). This action of testicular steroids can occur at the hypothalamic level, reducing the amount of GnRH secreted, or at the pituitary level, modulating the sensitivity of the pituitary to GnRH. When gonadal steroid levels decline, LH levels increase. These interactions result in a delicate balance between pituitary and testicular function.
0i6j | Secretions from the Sertoli cells modulate the pituitary in much the same way that testicular steroids do. The Sertoli cell produces and secretes inhibin, which can selectively modulate the release of FSH from the pituitary.
87cq | There are two forms of inhibin: inhibin A and inhibin B, which are formed from three subunits. Inhibin A is made up of one « subunit and one BA subunit. Inhibin B is made up of one o subunit and one BB subunit. Human males only produce inhibin B.
0qs3 | b) Direct Hormonal Control
z8f7 | The transformation of the primordial germ cells to the primitive type A i) spermatogonia may require testosterone during the ontogeny of the fetal testis.
7w7j | 4.31
51vd | ii) The initial division to type B spermatogonia and the subsequent steps to pachytene spermatocytes do not require gonadotropins or gonadal steroids, but may require retinoic acid and perhaps growth hormone.
baj1 | iii) The process of reductive division (primary to secondary spermatocytes) requires testosterone.
n1wo | iv) Early stages of spermiogenesis do not require hormonal control.
5bq3 | v) Spermiation requires testosterone action.
ezla | c) Indirect Hormonal Requirements
rsbu | i) FSH binds to the Sertoli cells and elicits its effect via the cAMP signal transduction pathway.
magd | ii) Androgen receptors are present in Sertoli cells. Testosterone action on the developing germ cells is mediated by the Sertoli cell.
tb74 | iii) LH is the gonadotropin responsible for the regulation of testosterone biosynthesis. LH binds to receptors on the Leydig cell and results in the activation of the enzymes involved in the conversion of cholesterol to testosterone. Therefore, LH indirectly affects spermatogenesis by stimulating sufficient levels of androgens to be produced.
8l69 | iv) Prolactin synergizes with LH to stimulate testosterone production. Leydig cells have receptors for prolactin. Prolactin causes an increase in the numbers of LH receptors on Leydig cells and may function in this way to potentiate LH action.
1jyv | v) Retinoic acid acts directly on the germ cells to stimulate their entry into the meiotic pathway and also to affect Sertoli cell cyclicity
olce | vi) Thyroxine regulates Sertoli cell numbers during development
erx1 | 14) TEMPERATURE REGULATION OF THE TESTIS
b3bt | a) The testes in humans are located outside the body and are contained in a sac-like structure called the scrotum. The scrotum is a highly specialized structure which is designed to keep the intratesticular temperature at a constant 34℃, which is several degrees cooler than normal body temperature. This cooler temperature is absolutely crucial for maintaining normal spermatogenesis.
0w8m | b) In order to ensure proper intra-testicular temperature, the cremasteric muscle in the scrotum raises the testes closer to the body when the ambient temperature is low and relaxes to lower the testes away from the body when the ambient temperature is hot. The
vcu3 | 4.32
hjzj | scrotum also has sparse hair and is rugose ("wrinkled"), which serves to increase surface area allowing further cooling of the testes.
j79f | c) The pampiniform plexus (see Figure 1) is a network of interconnected veins, which drain the blood from the testes. The pampiniform plexus plays an important functional role in maintaining testicular temperature in the appropriate range for sperm production by cooling blood in the testicular artery before it enters the testes. Abnormalities of the pampiniform plexus, such as seen with a varicocele (varicose veins in the spermatic cord of the scrotum), can have adverse effects on spermatogenesis by interfering with the cooling mechanics of the plexus. It can also negatively affect spermatogenesis through a variety of other poorly understood factors.
6tbv | 15) MALE GENITAL TRACT
xb13 | a) The Epididymis: The efferent ducts fuse to form the ductus epididymidis of the epididymis. The epididymis is characterized by a scalloped outline. This is a single highly coiled tube (4-6 m in length). This canal is surrounded by connective tissue and blood vessels. It is lined with pseudostratified columnar epithelium (rounded basal cells and columnar cells). The cells are supported by smooth muscle cells characterized by peristaltic contractions that move the sperm along the duct. The surface of the epithelium is covered by microvilli called stereocilia (these cells absorb fluid) and ciliated cells that contribute to the transport. The epididymal duct system is about 20 feet long while the vas deferens is about 18 inches in length. The glandular portion of the vas deferens is called the ampulla (see Figure 1). The ampulla contributes a small amount of fructose to the ejaculate. The secretions from these glands are the third in sequence to be expelled during ejaculation and contain the spermatozoa.
cxqi | b) Functions: The epithelium uptakes and digests the residual bodies remaining after spermatogenesis. During transit through the epididymis, the sperm acquire the ability to be motile (progressive motility required for fertilizing capacity). There are three regions: the head or caput, the body or corpus, and the tail or cauda. The height of the epithelium varies in thickness depending upon which portion of the epididymis is examined (increasing thickness from head to tail). Sperm epididymal maturation requires approximately 10 days. Thus, the period of time from the initiation of spermatogenesis to the release of mature sperm into the lumen of the tubules (64 days) plus the time required for sperm to migrate to the head of the epididymis (10 days) is approximately 74 days.
qfmx | The epididymis (Figure 19) is comprised of several ductuli efferentes that empty into a single, highly coiled ductus epididymidis, which ends as the straight ductus (vas) deferens. The epididymis is divided anatomically into the caput (head), the corpus (body), and the cauda (tail). Sperm transport through the epididymis takes approximately 16 days in humans. This amount of time added to the 74 days defined above suggests that a total of approximately 90 days is required from the time of initiation of spermatogenesis to the time when mature sperm are ready for ejaculation. Therefore, the adverse effects of any insult to the testis (fever, etc.) that results in damage to spermatogenesis may not be seen in the ejaculate for as long as 3 months.
rut3 | 4.33
m3cp | During the time of epididymal migration, spermatozoa undergo maturation, gain the capability of motility, and gain the capacity to fertilize. The sperm are then stored in the cauda epididymis and the vas deferens. Depending on the frequency of ejaculation, there is equilibrium between the breakdown of aged spermatozoa and the fullness of the epididymis.

ob1z | c) The epididymis serves several functions in the male:
m4cb | i) Maturational Changes of Spermatozoa: As spermatozoa emerge from the testis and appear in the caput epididymis, they possess no progressive motility and have no in vivo fertilizing capacity. Sperm acquire these two properties gradually during transit through the epididymis. Maturation may involve deposition of specific glycoproteins on the sperm surface. Additional changes include a change in net sperm surface charge; alterations in sperm-lectin binding properties; changes in immunoreactivity and iodination characteristics; acquisition of an increased capacity for glycolysis; modification of adenylate cyclase activity; alterations in cellular phospholipid and phospholipid-like fatty acid content; formation of disulfide bonds within the nucleus and tail and oxidation of sperm membrane sulfhydryl groups; and an increased ability to adhere to the zona pellucida. Full fertilization capacity and motility of spermatozoa is probably not achieved until they reach the cauda epididymis. The motility and fertilization capacity of epididymal sperm is regulated by androgens.
m61y | d) Release of Spermatozoa: The release of spermatozoa during ejaculation is mediated by short, adrenergic contractions of the cauda epididymis and vas deferens. Spermatozoa are then mixed with the secretions of the accessory glands (see below).
u2ob | e) Elimination of Aged Spermatozoa: Although the epididymal environment is favorable for survival of sperm, they are not preserved indefinitely and gradually age and lose their viability:
