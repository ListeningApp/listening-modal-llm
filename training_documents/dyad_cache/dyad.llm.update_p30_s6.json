        "content": "x0yg | Willoughby's record as an estimator, which is more relevant for our subject, was less bright. By Campbell's analysis, he \"made nine badly flawed estimates in the Pacific War, which he later tried to cover up, whereas he was correct in only four key estimates.\" No wonder then that Willoughby's colleagues thought that he had \"the best hindsight of any intelligence officer in the army,\" or that he was \"a better historian than an intelligence officer.\"\nmjt8 | While Willoughby's record as an intelligence estimator in World War Two was dubious, three tendencies that he exhibited during his service are relevant to understand his mistakes in November nineteen fifty. The first was his tendency toward centralism, as evidenced by his attempts to gain organizational monopoly over the intelligence process and his practice of personally handling the process of making intelligence estimates. Shortly after becoming MacArthur's G-Two, he dismissed Australian intelligence summaries (which proved to\nhtcn | be correct), and throughout the war he prevented the OSS from operating in his theater of operations. After the war, he boasted that this was a major achievement. On the eve of the Korean War, he dismissed South Korean warnings that the KPA was preparing an attack. After war began, he lessened his tight centralistic policy, allowing the CIA a limited freedom of action, but he later prevented its agents from interrogating Chinese POWs for fear that they would produce estimates different from his own. His centralistic tendencies were also exposed in the way he estimated intelligence. Earlier in Bataan, he did the estimate while Akin was in charge of Sigint, and Sutherland, MacArthur's chief of staff, decided which intelligence would be passed on to MacArthur. After that, with the exception of MacArthur, there is no record of any collective intelligence estimation process under Willoughby's command. Almond testified that Willoughby \"was not receptive to alternative analysis or ideas.\" Personal monopolization explained his personal involvement in producing the Daily Intelligence Summary. Sometimes, when MacArthur rejected his estimates, he took it as a personal insult.\n86d4 | In November nineteen fifty, Willoughby's tendency toward centralism led him to exclude any organization or person -apart for MacArthur himself- from interfering with the intelligence process. As a result, MacArthur, either because of wishful thinking or because of Willoughby's influence or both, underestimated the magnitude of the Chinese threat.\nz7qp | Willoughby's second tendency was toward mirror imaging, that is, the inclination to estimate the opponent's policy through the prism of one's own culture, logic, and prejudice. Drea, who claimed that Willoughby often made mirror-imaging estimates, regarded it as one of his \"cardinal sin.\" In April nineteen forty-two, Willoughby reached the conclusion that the rational target for the coming Japanese attack would be northern Australia. His naval counterpart, Edwin T. Layton assessed, on the basis of the same intelligence information, that it would be Port Moresby in New Guinea. The May nineteen forty-two battle of the Coral Sea, the first major naval engagement since the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor, showed that Willoughby \"rationale\" was mistaken and Layton was right. Similarly, during the Battle of Hollandia in the summer of nineteen forty-four, Willoughby misjudged, despite the excellent available intelligence information, the target and the timing of the Japanese counterattack. As he later admitted, the enemy had carried out the attack \"regardless of the odds against him.\" Then, during the invasion of the island of Leyte in the Philippines in October nineteen forty-four, he\n6t1g | assessed Japanese intentions according to what he would do and concluded that they would avoid reinforcing their army due to American air-superiority.\ncpls | Willoughby learned nothing from these mistakes. His persistent estimates, despite intelligence evidence to the contrary, that the PRC would avoid a massive intervention in Korea were based on a military logic that asserted that the best time to intervene was prior to the Inchon landing. This way of thinking did not take into account the possibility that the Chinese strategy was based on other factors- such as the reluctance to intervene at too early a stage, when the UN forces were still far from Manchuria and did not constitute a viable threat to Chinese territory. Willoughby's refusal to accept that massive Chinese forces had crossed the Yalu also reflected a belief that such a move could not take place without significant Sigint indications. He did not take into account that, unlike the American army, the CPVF was poorly equipped with wireless sets, that it was well-trained in maintaining radio silence, and that it used primitive but efficient means of communication, such as runners or dispatch riders.\nm50n | Willoughby's third relevant tendency involved his need for cognitive closure. While most descriptions portray him as an authoritarian type and, hence, a person with a high need for closure, this was not always the case. Very much like Stalin during the battle for Moscow in late nineteen forty-one, Willoughby was consumed by fear of invalidity at the beginning of his career as MacArthur's G-Two. This was mainly the product of his lack of intelligence experience, the humiliating defeat MacArthur suffered in the Philippines, and the high cost of being mistaken at this critical stage of the war. These pressures led him, especially in nineteen forty-two, to avoid fast and persistent freezing. Sometimes he even went to the other extreme, reversing major interpretations\neztf | overnight without apparent reason. In addition, when he presented his assessments to MacArthur, he used to include in them all possible courses of action available to the enemy.\nbwsu | This was not the situation in the fall of nineteen fifty. By then, Willoughby was an experienced (though not necessarily appreciated) intelligence officer. He effectively supported his chief in the conduct of the brilliant Inchon landing, which was carried out against the opinion of many others. And now his admired boss wanted to reach the Yalu as soon as possible in order to end the war by Christmas. By this stage, Willoughby exhibited the main symptoms of a person with a high need for closure: his thesis that the Chinese lost their opportunity to intervene and therefore would avoid such a move was clear, orderly, and coherent. His intelligence-making process, which lacked any form of brainstorming, reflected a highly authoritarian leadership style, reluctance to listen to different perspectives, and no tolerance for any pluralism of opinion. His high level of confidence was exhibited by his \"knowledge\" (rather than estimate) that the Chinese would not intervene. It was enhanced by a similar confidence on the part of MacArthur. Willoughby, moreover, refused to consider novel information that was inconsistent with his thesis, and denied undisputed facts, as seen for example in his claim that the captured Chinese soldiers were North Koreans. As one officer had put it, \"None of this [evidence for a possible large-scale Chinese intervention] was going to affect Willoughby. The Chinese were not going to come in. He knew it. And he was never wrong.\"\noqod | The combination of an intelligence officer who monopolized the intelligence process, estimated the enemy according to his own logic, and exhibited the symptoms of a high need for closure and an unshakable faith that MacArthur could not be wrong provides, then, another explanation for one of the worst American intelligence fiascos in the post-World War Two era.",
