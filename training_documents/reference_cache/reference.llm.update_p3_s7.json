For example, reference tools traditionally provided in print reference resources and housed in libraries are now readily available in bundled digital collections. The digitization of millions of print books in mass digital collections provides twenty-four seven direct access to scholarly resources-saving mass amounts of shelving space. The creation of a staggering amount of new web and digitized content over the last two decades has resulted in the rise of massive online repositories, such as the Digital Public Library of America. Additionally, library access to print reference resources came to a complete halt when most\nrl4j | Information Intermediation and Reference Services\nvz32 | libraries physically closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the line distinguishing reference tools from other types of online resources has become increasingly blurred, digital reference sources can still be defined as tools routinely used to locate discrete pieces of information that can usually be retrieved online.\nncb0 | Although the line distinguishing reference tools from other types of online resources has become increasingly blurred, digital reference sources can still be defined as tools routinely used to locate discrete pieces of information that can usually be retrieved online.\n8mp0 | Recommending and interpreting print and online information sources continues to play a pivotal role in reference work in the twenty-first century, but intermediators of all types need to understand the information ecosystems with which they work so they are better able to help users locate needed information. Information professionals use this knowledge to develop and maintain subject guides, pathfinders, LibGuides, and more. These types of aids, for example, were instrumental in providing information on demand about COVID-19 when the pandemic first struck. Similarly, school librarians and media specialists developed Bitmoji virtual libraries as a fun and visual method of optimizing discovery tools to aid their students in locating needed information for class assignments when school libraries were closed.\nxjyk | Virtual Reference Tools\nmt0f | The pace of technological change in the last quarter century has increasingly diversified and decentralized the ways that information services are offered; and this has only accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic. Reference help that was first only provided in person and then by phone can now also be delivered via email, chat, text, social media, and more. Additionally, access to information has become easier with the use of personal devices and software solutions such as smartphones and tablets, cloud computing, and app technologies. Users and information intermediators can also access a variety of new reference tools, including algorithm-based search engines, database search features, and citation tools to help answer questions.\nawab | Because information is more accessible to the public, digital reference sources no longer necessarily require information intermediation. Powerful online tools like search engines provide easy access to everything from web-based images and books to maps, videos, patents, and even computational knowledge. As a result, ready reference questions, such as the resale value of a full-size two thousand fifteen Ford F-One Fifty pickup truck in the Kelley Blue Book or content for a fifth-grader's class project on California missions, can now be easily obtained twenty-four seven online. These new tools assist patrons and information professionals alike by also providing value by finding answers to more complex questions. However, this has also resulted in a self-service society where people with internet access routinely conduct their own unmediated online searches.\nixcc | Expanded access to online information has had two unintended consequences. First, easy access to online tools has resulted in the decline of reference\n8p6h | questions in general and ready reference questions in particular. Secondly, people on the other side of the digital divide have become increasingly informationally disadvantaged and disenfranchised, which became critically apparent when many people's access to the internet was restricted due to school and library closures in two thousand twenty during the pandemic. End users without access to the internet continue to face challenges to accessing reliable and appropriate information to meet their formation needs.\npmgl | On a different note, the advent of seamless and multimodal virtual reference tools has provided users with multichannel points of entry to hubs of information. Virtual reference services, sometimes called digital or mobile reference services, have extended the reach of traditional reference services by offering users synchronous and asynchronous computer-mediated reference services via email, chat/instant messaging, texting/short message service, voice chat and cloud-based videoconferencing, and more. Web-based applications on smartphones and other mobile devices provide users with additional mobility, and the global reach and twenty-four seven anytime/anywhere point-of-need access of these tools mean that reference services are not place bound. These tools proved invaluable to information intermediators for providing reference services at a distance during the pandemic.",
