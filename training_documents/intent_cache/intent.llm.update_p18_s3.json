This relationship is enduring, and it occurs outside of any unusual circumstances or stressors (macro level).\ncpls | The therapeutic relationship process that is influenced by interpersonal events of therapy or the stressors or highlights that have the potential to challenge or enrich the relationship depending on how they are responded to and resolved (micro level).\nm50n | The therapeutic relationship is a socially defined and personally interpreted interactive process between the therapist and a client. It is socially defined in that the therapist and the client are engaged in an interaction within publicly understood roles. The therapist is recognized as bringing a certain kind of expertise, ethical guidelines, and values into a relationship. The client is recognized as a person receiving service to address a particular need. The relationship is understood to exist for the sole purpose of achieving improvement in the client's situation.

Moreover, they are interrelated. That is, the nature of the therapeutic relationship has an influence on how the client interprets and how the therapist responds to interpersonal events; and, in turn, interpersonal events and their resolution either enhance or detract from the therapeutic relationship.\no5ts | In some cases, the two scales of interaction are difficult to differentiate. For example, some therapy relationships last only one or two sessions. In these cases, a therapist must work to respond to a client and to interpersonal events with much more vigilance and self-control because a more stable underlying therapeutic relationship does not yet exist.
