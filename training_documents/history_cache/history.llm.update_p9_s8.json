        "content": "jt0y | The scientific history of hyperactivity was characterized by reports of brain damage in children presenting with abnormal behavior. Following the lectures of Sir George Frederic Still in nineteen zero two, the assumptions of Tredgold in nineteen zero eight, and the reports of the epidemic encephalitis from nineteen seventeen to nineteen twenty-eight, several cases of children with behavior disorders were depicted who suffered from \"gross lesions of the brain and a variety of acute diseases, conditions, and injuries that presumably had resulted in brain damage.\" This indicated the growing notion that brain damage was the cause of hyperactive behavior. Further research in the nineteen thirties and nineteen forties supported the idea of a causal connection between brain damage and deviant behavior. Children with a history of head injury were found to develop behavior disorders similar to the postencephalitic behavior disorder, while studies of birth trauma discovered a causative link between birth injury and mental retardation in children. Infections, lead toxicity, and epilepsy were also found to be associated with various cognitive and behavioral problems. In the nineteen thirties, several researchers found a striking similarity in behavior between hyperactive children and monkeys with a frontal lobe ablation and \"experiences with brain-injured soldiers in particular have taught us that many a symptom considered psychogenic may be due to an organic cause.\" Rosenfeld and Bradley gave an account of typical behavior sequelae in children who suffered asphyxiant illness in infancy. They reported,\nqb7o | a fairly uniform overt behavior pattern in maladjusted children who have experienced asphyxiant illness in infancy. Six cardinal behavior characteristics make up this syndrome and may be listed as follows: One. Unpredictable variability in mood. Two. Hypermotility. Three. Impulsiveness. Four. Short attention span. Five. Fluctuant ability to recall material previously learned. Six. Conspicuous difficulty with arithmetic in school.\noae5 | The notion of a physiological explanation of behavior disorders was remarkable. This led to the concept of \"brain damage\" and the idea that hyperactivity in children may be caused by damage to the brain. The new\ns0fl | concept of \"minimal brain damage\" was based on several considerations. First, Tredgold had stated that mild forms of brain damage in infancy, although unnoticed at the time, could lead to behavioral sequelae, which became first apparent at school. Second, possible variations of brain damage in extent, locus, or type of lesion were discussed. Third, the concept of \"a continuum of cerebral damage ranging from severe abnormalities, such as cerebral palsy and mental deficiency, to minimal damage\" was introduced by Knobloch and Pasamanick.\n43ia | This new concept was characterized by the assumption that minimal damage to the brain, even when it cannot be demonstrated objectively, causes hyperactive behavior and, in turn, \"that even when brain damage could not be demonstrated it could be presumed to be present.\" Under the influence of the work of Strauss and Lehtinen and Strauss and Kephart, it became general practice to infer brain damage solely from behavioral signs without any neurological evidence of damage. In brain-injured and non-brain-injured mentally retarded children, Strauss and his colleagues identified a number of behavior patterns, on the basis of which they could distinguish these two groups. In particular, they considered the symptom of hyperactivity as a sufficient diagnostic sign of underlying brain damage. Minimal brain damage was therefore supposed to be clearly associated with a specific syndrome. Most symptoms described in this context meet the current DSM-IV-TR criteria, and the concept of minimal brain damage can be regarded as a historical antecedent to ADHD. Laufer et al. describe the following characteristics of the syndrome:\n3g2y | It has long been recognized and accepted that a persistent disturbance of behavior of a characteristic kind may be noted after severe head injury, epidemic encephalitis and communicable disease encephalopathies, such as measles, in children. It has often been observed that a behavior pattern of a similar nature may be found in children who present no clear-cut history of any of the classical causes mentioned. This pattern will henceforth be referred to as hyperkinetic impulse disorder. In brief summary, hyperactivity is the most striking item. This may be noted from early infancy on or not become prominent until five or six years of age. There are also a short attention span and poor powers of concentration, which are particularly noticeable under school conditions. Variability also is frequent, with the child being described as quite unpredictable and with wide fluctuations in\ngc7v | performance. The child is impulsive and does things \"on the spur of the moment,\" without apparent premeditation. Outstandingly also these children seem unable to tolerate any delay in gratification of their needs and demands. They are irritable and explosive, with low frustration tolerance.\nwqfv | Minimal brain dysfunction\nj30a | The hypothesis that minimal brain damage may lead to behavior disorders became well established. In the nineteen sixties, however, many critics emerged who criticized the tests commonly used in the assessment of brain damage and challenged the argument that every child presenting with abnormal behavior was to have minimal brain damage, even if this could neurologically not be demonstrated. Laufer et al. regarded it as a problem that there were \"children who present the hyperkinetic impulse disorder without having any of the classic etiologic traumatic or infectious factors in their historical backgrounds.\" In their study, they found that \"children with the hyperkinetic impulse disorder, regardless of whether or not their history contains clear-cut evidence of any agent causing injury to the central nervous system\" had a lower threshold for clinical responses in EEG to the administration of metrazol than children without the hyperkinetic syndrome. Following the administration of amphetamines, however, the threshold was similar to that of children without evidence of the syndrome. Laufer and his colleagues supposed a dysfunction of the diencephalon to be the cause of the hyperkinetic syndrome. Their results suggested a functional disturbance rather than damage to the brain as the cause of the characteristic syndrome. In nineteen sixty-three, the Oxford International Study Group of Child Neurology held a conference and stated that brain damage should not be inferred from problematic behavior signs alone.",
