You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

pbea | The plant ideally wants a visitor that is cheap to feed, alighting only briefly, moving on rapidly to an- other plant, and being faithful to its chosen plant spe- cies; so ideally, the forager should be chronically un- derfed and continuously on the move. But (again ideally) the animal would prefer to be as well fed and lazy as possible, getting as much food as it can from one flower with minimum energy expenditure, being relatively sedentary, and then moving on to any other nearby flower with copious nectar, whatever its spe- cies (although we already noted that some degree of fidelity may improve its foraging efficiency).
ccpt | Hence, although there are obvious benefits to both partners, there are potentially clear costs as well. The plant has to invest in attractants (its carbon and nitro- gen resources are used to make flamboyant petals, pig- ments, and chemical scents), as well as mere rewards. If the plant reduces its rewards too far, the animal may not get enough food and will give up on that species. The plant generally also has to compete with other plant species for pollination, to obtain a share of the "good" pollinators, so it cannot afford to skimp on its offerings too much if it is growing within a reasonably diverse plant community. Many plants also have to
0fpw | offset the additional costs of animal exploiters: those visitors who take rewards without pollinating (thereby cheating, chapter 24) and the flower eaters (florivores) or foliage herbivores also attracted by the pollination cues (chapters 25 and 26). For the animals, there may be costs linked to carrying the pollen they have inad- vertently picked up (sometimes it is very unwieldy and can interfere with their wings or legs or sense organs), which may favor animals trying to cheat, and there may be costs also from the potential risks of predation or parasitism at flowers, since enemies can use them as a place to find prey or hosts reliably (chapter 24). There are also costs arising from the tendencies of the plants to cheat (chapter 23) by offering no real reward and sometimes by trapping the animal.
dqn8 | 6. Why Is Pollination Worth Studying?
cop0 | Pollination ecology can provide almost unparalleled insights into evolution, ecology, animal learning, and foraging behavior (fig. 1.2). It is perhaps the best of all areas to see and understand some basic biological pro- cesses and patterns; studies that deal exclusively with pollination biology have often had major impacts on general ecological and evolutionary theory.
lhkq | Pollination interactions often show us evolution by natural selection in action almost before our eyes and provide some very clear-cut examples of adaptive ra- diation and, perhaps, of plant speciation. They are particularly useful for studying coadaptations (co- evolution), because such interaction often involve rel- atively few organisms interacting with relatively high interdependence and incorporating the most funda- mental of phenomena (reproduction for the plant, food supply for the animal). There are selection pressures on each side of the partnership, offering hopes that ef- fects at the basic level of male and female gene flow can be quantified, sometimes (in crop pollination espe- cially) on a time scale that can be detected within one scientist's period of study.
82ju | In terms of ecology, the study of pollination sheds light on how different organisms interact and affect each other, especially the competitive effects of plants upon each other, and on the various levels of interac- tions of plants with pollinators, including resource al- location, competition, exploitation, and simply cheat- ing. In the last two decades there has been an increasing stress on community-level interactions in pollination
y2qo | biology, now seen as an especially useful (because highly quantifiable) arena for more general work on community structures (J. Thomson 1983); so this book inevitably considers the community ecology of polli- nation, especially in later chapters.
1piq | Pollination biology also gives exceptional insight into the ecology of reproductive strategies and the complexities of sex and reproduction. Flowers usually are hermaphrodites, but they have many ways of orga- nizing their sex life sequentially or spatially to maxi- mize their reproductive output and fitness. This book contains rather little coverage of plant reproductive strategies beyond the basics, because the field has now become dominated by theory and modeling, and the topic has also been extensively and recently reviewed in other works (e.g., Harder and Barrett 2006).
7fqw | In the realm of animal behavior some key influ- ences can be especially easily measured and manipu- lated with flower visitors, and it is no accident that much of the key work on visual discrimination, learn- ing behaviors, and above all optimal foraging has used pollinators, especially bees. Optimal diet theory can model how animals should behave in an environ-

wak1 | ment offering different proportions of alternative prey as potential food items of differing value (also taking into account factors such as conspicuousness and dif- ferent variances). The theory predicts that a range of outcomes from complete specialization on one kind of prey item to complete generalization on all possible items is to be expected, even from the same animal, as the prey parameters are varied. Substituting "flower" for "prey item" (and with the immense advantage of very easily quantified caloric rewards from nectar), it is not unexpected that pollinators similarly turn out to show almost the full range of possible foraging behav- iors. Furthermore, they have proved ideal subjects with which to develop foraging models that can take into account different constraints on the foraging animals, whether from different physiological limits or from different cognitive skills. Learning ability is especially needed where resources are of intermediate predict- ability (Stephens 1993): that is, too unpredictable over one or a few generations for fixed behavior patterns to be favored, but not so greatly unpredictable that an in- dividual cannot track the changes. This exactly applies to floral resources, so that we should expect flower
wtfz | visitors from any taxon to be good learners. Fortunate- ly this is also readily tested with real or model flowers where just one trait at a time can be varied or associa- tions of traits compared; again, social bees are ideal animals to work with, reliably emerging from their nests and traveling straight to the flowers provided, then displaying clear choices between alternative flowers.
qy1i | For all these reasons, and with the added concern over human-induced effects on pollinator services in rela- tion to biodiversity and to crops, interest in pollination ecology has burgeoned in the last ten to fifteen years, and the subject is attracting strong interest beyond the traditional academic centers of the developed world, giving us valuable insights into more varied habitats in Asia, Africa, and South America and into a greater di- versity of interactions. Increasingly these systems are being modeled, and our preconceptions (of these and of other kinds of mutualisms) are being challenged. But
