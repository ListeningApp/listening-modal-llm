You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

cox8 | Ersner-Hershfield, Mikels, Sullivan, & Carstensen, 2008; J. T. Larsen et al., 2001), certain types of music (Hunter, Schellenberg, & Schimmack, 2008), evocative pictures (Schimmack, 2001, 2005), and bittersweet advertisements (Williams & Aaker, 2002) can also make people feel happy and sad at the same time.
ppqi | The debate over mixed emotions hinges on the actual experience of emotion (see Russell & Barrett, 1999), which is best indexed with self-reports (e.g., Wilson, 2003), but facial expressions have also provided evidence for mixed emotions. Griffin and Sayette (2008) found that nearly one quarter of heavy smokers smiled and frowned simultaneously for at least 300 ms while they watched a burning cigarette. Moreover, those who smiled and frowned si- multaneously were more likely to be ambivalent about smoking, which was indexed in terms of whether they had had difficulty quitting in the past. These findings provide convergent validity for self-report evidence for mixed emotions.
oxou | Alternative Interpretations
495n | Despite considerable research, whether the experience of va- lence is irreducible (e.g., Russell & Carroll, 1999) or whether positivity and negativity are separable in experience (e.g., Cacioppo & Berntson, 1994) remains unclear because all available evidence that people can feel happy and sad at the same time is open to alternative interpretations. For instance, Griffin and Say- ette (2008) did not measure self-reported emotional experience, so it is unclear whether smokers' smiles and frowns reflected mixed emotions of happiness and sadness, as opposed to other positive and negative emotions. Here we outline several alternative inter- pretations for studies in which self-reports were collected and explain them in more detail as we present studies designed to address them.
awri | One pair of alternative interpretations involves limitations in how researchers have measured happiness and sadness (e.g., J. T. Larsen et al., 2001; Schimmack, 2001; Williams & Aaker, 2002). First, although subjects were asked to report how they felt at one particular moment, they may have instead reported summaries of their emotional experience over time (Barrett & Bliss-Moreau, 2009; Beebe-Center, 1932; J. T. Larsen, McGraw, Mellers, & Cacioppo, 2004). If so, they may have reported mixed emotions when they had in fact merely vacillated between happiness and sadness. We addressed this possibility in one set of studies (Studies 1-3) by placing some people in bittersweet situations and collect- ing continuous, as opposed to static, measures of emotions. Sec- ond, subjects in previous studies completed closed-ended measures of emotion (e.g., "Do you feel happy?"), which raises the possi- bility that those subjects who reported mixed emotions only be- cause they were explicitly asked whether they felt happy and whether they felt sad. We addressed this possibility in a second set of studies (Studies 4-6) by placing some people in bittersweet situations and asking open-ended questions (e.g., "How do you feel right now?"), as opposed to closed-ended questions.
bl28 | Another pair of alternative interpretations for evidence for mixed emotions involves subjects' expectancies. First, demand characteristics (Orne, 1962) may have led subjects to report mixed emotions because they thought that we expected them to do so. To address this possibility, we led some subjects to believe that we did not expect them to report mixed emotions and collected continuous measures of emotion (Study 2) or open-ended measures of emotion
d5bz | (Study 5). Second, subjects may have reported mixed emotions only because they held the lay theory that people can feel happy and sad at the same time. To address this possibility, we collected continuous measures (Study 3) or open-ended measures (Study 6) from individuals who did not believe that people can feel happy and sad at the same time.
ap5o | Subjects in all studies were told that they were participating in a study of foreign language comprehension and then watched one of two clips from the English-subtitled version of Life Is Beautiful. The bittersweet clip was 19 min 43 s long (1,183 s). During the clip, a character named Guido uses humor to keep his son, Joshua, alive and unaware of their plight while his wife, Dora, is impris- oned elsewhere in the camp. In the final 5 min of the clip, Guido loses his own life to ensure Joshua's survival and Joshua is reunited with Dora. The control clip was 19 min 40 s long (1,180 s). It begins with Guido and Dora's lighthearted courtship and joyful scenes from Joshua's childhood. It then transitions abruptly to the family's imprisonment, where it paints an unambiguously dreadful picture of their plight and ends with Dora fearing that Joshua is dead.
7zvf | Part 1: Vacillation
mov9 | Emotions can be fleeting (e.g., Ekman, 1992). As noted above, this raises the alternative interpretation for earlier evidence for mixed emotions that subjects merely vacillated between happiness and sadness and, when prompted, reported summaries of their emotions (e.g., Barrett & Bliss-Moreau, 2009). Determining whether people can feel happy and sad at the same time and, by extension, whether valence is irreducible requires tests of this vacillation hypothesis.
ks7m | Schimmack (2005) noted that if people in bittersweet situations merely vacillate between happiness and sadness, they should re- port less mixed emotions when they rate their happiness and sadness closer together in time. His subjects viewed a series of pleasant and unpleasant pictures and then rated the extent to which they were feeling pleasure, displeasure, and 12 other emotions, all of which were presented in a unique random order for each subject. Schimmack's finding that the number of items between the plea- sure and displeasure items had no influence on the intensity of subjects' reported mixed emotions provides initial evidence against vacillation.
w1w1 | Carrera and Oceja (2007) tested the vacillation hypothesis more directly by collecting continuous measures of subjects' emotional reactions to a bittersweet clip from a film entitled The Son of the Bride (Campanella, 2001). The clip depicted a wedding that was both heartwarming and heartbreaking because the elderly bride had Alzheimer's disease and could not recognize anyone, includ- ing the groom. After watching the clip, subjects completed static emotion ratings. Those who reported mixed emotions then drew two curves to chart their recollection of how the intensity of their happiness and sadness changed over the course of the 6-min clip. Carrera and Oceja quantified simultaneously mixed emotions in terms of whether both curves exceeded zero at any point in time. Subjects who watched the bittersweet clip were more likely to report mixed emotions with static ratings (76%) than they were to recall that their happiness and sadness occurred simultaneously (47%), but they were nonetheless more likely to recall simultane- ously mixed emotions than those who watched a control clip
