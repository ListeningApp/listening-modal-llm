        "content": "b7cq | According to Kramer and Pollnow, the most obvious symptom of children with hyperkinetic disease is a remarkable motor activity, which appears to be very urgent. These children cannot stay still for a second, run up and down the room, climb about preferring high furniture in particular and are displeased when deterred from acting out their motor impulses. This description is very similar to the current characterization of hyperactivity, one of the main symptoms of ADHD. The American Psychiatric Association describes children with ADHD to leave their seats when \"remaining seated is expected\", to \"run about\" and to be often \"on the go\". Excessive climbing is also an explicit hyperactive symptom of ADHD mentioned by the American Psychiatric Association. The urgent character of the children's motor activity is reflected in the depiction of children with\n0b39 | ADHD as being \"driven by a motor\". Kramer and Pollnow furthermore consider the observed motor activity as being characterized by a conspicuous lack of purposefulness. Children with hyperkinetic disease indiscriminately touch or move everything available without pursuing a goal. They often do not use objects according to their function, but regard them as stimuli inducing activity. These children switch the light on and off, move chairs around the room, climb the table, the cupboard or the windowsill, jump around in their beds, turn keys in the keyhole, rip paper, go round in circles, throw objects out of the window, or beat their toys rhythmically on the floor without any purpose. This aimlessness of action exemplified by quickly changing activities is possibly due to a distinct distractibility by new and intensive stimuli, which is another symptom mentioned by Kramer and Pollnow. The children described by Kramer and Pollnow often cannot complete a set task or do not answer to questions. They are unable to concentrate on difficult tasks, which may cause learning deficits and make it difficult to assess their intellectual abilities. These descriptions comply with the second main symptom of ADHD, i.e. inattention. The DSM-IV-TR depicts children with ADHD as being \"easily distracted by extraneous stimuli\" and as having \"difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities\". Together with the fact that children with ADHD are known to have difficulties in planning and \"organizing activities\", their playing can suggest a lack of purposefulness as described by Kramer and Pollnow. In addition, Kramer and Pollnow's observation of unresponsiveness in children with ADHD is reflected in the notion that a child with ADHD \"often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly\". Patients with ADHD typically have problems to concentrate and \"to give close attention to details\". It is also common for patients with inattention to leave work or activities uncompleted and to \"fail to finish chores\". This symptom is also described by Kramer and Pollnow as a further characteristic of the hyperkinetic child. According to these authors, hyperkinetic children show no perseverance in their activities, e.g. they play no game for more than a few minutes. However, Kramer and Pollnow also noticed that the children were able to persevere at some activities of their interest for hours.\nqecd | Both a lack of perseverance and the ability to concentrate on certain tasks can be observed in children with ADHD. Kramer and Pollnow describe furthermore that the children are unstable in their mood. They observed an increased excitability, frequent fits of rage, and a tendency to become aggressive or to burst into tears for marginal reasons. These are characteristic signs of impulsivity, and all main symptoms of ADHD are therefore present in the record of Kramer and Pollnow.\n1o7p | The description of the hyperkinetic disease also meets another criterion of ADHD. The American Psychiatric Association states that for a diagnosis of ADHD to be made, symptoms must cause \"significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning\". Kramer and Pollnow describe that hyperkinetic children are often disobedient and cause severe educational problems. At school, they may cause confusion or disturb the class. They often have difficulty playing harmoniously with other children and are generally unpopular among peers. As mentioned previously, the presence of symptoms before the age of seven is an additional important diagnostic criterion in the DSM-IV-TR. This criterion is also met by the cases of Kramer and Pollnow, since they reported an age of onset of the hyperkinetic disease as early as three or four years and a peak at the age of six. In many cases of Kramer and Pollnow, the abnormal behavior occurred following a feverish disease or epileptic convulsion, which suggests an organic cause. Kramer and Pollnow describe that the characteristics of the disorder, especially the motor restlessness, decline in intensity by the age of seven, and in most cases, the children recover in the subsequent years, so that Kramer and Pollnow considered the disorder a \"hyperkinesis of childhood\". Although more than fifty percent of children with ADHD retain symptoms into adulthood, the signs of hyperactivity decline with age in most cases of ADHD. Since Kramer and Pollnow considered abnormal motor activity as the most characteristic symptom of the disorder, they possibly regarded affected children as recovered when, regardless of other symptoms, this sign receded. However, Kramer and Pollnow recognized that the disorder can have implications into adulthood.\ncp13 | In summary, the descriptions of Kramer and Pollnow on a \"hyperkinetic disease of infancy\" meet all three main symptoms of ADHD and two additional DSM-IV-TR criteria.
