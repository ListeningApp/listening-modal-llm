A further key issue in the design of a clinical trial is ensuring there are sufficient numbers of patients.\nybik | The aim of a trial should be to provide reliable evidence of the effectiveness and safety of a treatment. To achieve this, enough patients are needed in our trial to give a good chance of detecting a clinically important treatment difference if such a difference exists, while being able to reasonably conclude that no such difference exists if our results do not show it.\ngii5 | Given the importance of sample size there are several approaches that can be taken to answer the question \"How many patients do we need?\". For example:\nq5eu | One Statistical and scientific approach. This approach is concerned with determining how many patients are needed to get firm evidence of a treatment difference if it exists, and to estimate any difference precisely.\na7ao | Two Economic and pragmatic approach. In reality, other constraints will impact on the ability to recruit the numbers required from a purely statistical approach. For example, how many patients are available, and how much time, effort and cost is involved?\n29a3 | Three Ethical approach. In many clinical trials decisions need to be made as to how long it is ethical to continue a trial. The question that might be asked here is \"How soon can we stop a trial to avoid some patients getting inferior treatment?\". This will be dealt with in detail in session four: \"Data Monitoring\".\nsb1e | Four Credibility. If a trial is very small, its results may not be seen as providing believable evidence.\nw2yn | Three point one\nap6l | In determining the required size of a trial all of the above approaches are usually considered, but this session is mainly concerned with one the statistical approach. The compromises to be made between purely scientific objectives and practical constraints, and the implications of trials which are too small will also be considered.\niest | In order to appreciate the impact of sample size for interpreting trial results consider the table below showing the results from two placebo-controlled trials assessing the impact of streptokinase for reducing mortality in patients who have experienced a myocardial infarction MI.\ncox8 | P is less than point zero zero zero one Risk ratio equals zero point seventy-seven, ninety-five percent confidence interval zero point seventy to zero point eighty-four. The estimated treatment effect is very similar in the two trials. Further, the proportions of patients who die in the two trials are also very similar. However, while the ISIS-two trial provides very strong evidence of a treatment effect with P is less than point zero zero zero one and a tight confidence interval, the first Australian trial is unconvincing with P equals zero point thirty-two and a wide confidence interval. Even though more than five hundred patients were recruited, the trial was too small in these circumstances.\nppqi | Three Key factors in determining the required sample size\noxou | The previous section indicated the impact the size of a trial can have on the interpretation of results. In particular, trials which are too small lead to results which are inconclusive. There are a number of key factors that determine the required size of a trial and in particular there are five key questions that need to be asked. In order to illustrate these factors, the UK PACE study in fitting a dual chamber versus single chamber pacemaker for patients with atrioventricular block is used.\n495n | Note that while questions two and five are more technical these are fairly standard whereas questions three and four are perhaps the most important and difficult to address. The answers to these two questions will have the most impact on the required size as will be shown later in the session.\nawri | One What is the principal outcome measure of the trial?\nbl28 | In designing a trial, a suitable primary outcome measure is chosen to reflect the main purpose of conducting the trial. The sample size requirements need to be based on this outcome measure in order to reliably address the prime purpose of the trial.\nd5bz | For example, in the UK PACE trial the purpose was to assess whether dual chamber pacing could reduce mortality compared to the more usual single chamber by comparing mortality at four years.\nap5o | Three point two\n7zvf | Two How will the data be analysed to detect a treatment difference?\nmov9 | Some thought should be given to the appropriate analysis for the outcome being measured. For example, is the outcome the occurrence of some event such as death or a continuous outcome such as blood pressure. In addition, the level of statistical significance that will be accepted as indicating evidence of a treatment difference should also be considered. This is usually set at five percent i.e. if the final p-value is less than zero point zero five then this would be accepted as there being some evidence for a real treatment effect.\nks7m | For example, the simplest analysis for the UK PACE trial is a comparison between the groups of the percentage of patients who die within four years of randomisation using a Chi-squared test. A five percent significance level was used.\nw1w1 | Three What results are expected in the control group?\nh8gv | Clearly the results that will be observed in the control arm will not be known. However, there may well be information from previous trials or observational studies as to what might be expected.\nkwkp | For example, in the UK PACE trial it was expected that twenty-four percent of patients would die by four years in the single chamber group.\nyj0m | Four How small a treatment difference, if it exists, is important to detect?\newfp | This is perhaps the key decision that needs to be taken in determining sample size. If a very large treatment difference exists, then this can be detected with relatively few numbers. For example, in the UK PACE trial if the dual chamber pacing reduced mortality by three-quarters i.e. from twenty-four percent to six percent then relatively few patients are needed in fact less than two hundred. Of course, such a difference is unlikely and, more importantly, a difference much smaller than this would be clinically very important to detect if it were true.\noczy | It could be argued that any difference would be important to detect but this is unrealistic as huge trials would be required an example of this will be given later. What needs to be decided upon is the smallest clinically relevant difference that would be important to detect if it were true.\n2ttg | For example, in the UK PACE trial it was decided that a one quarter reduction i.e. from twenty-four percent to eighteen percent would be clinically important to detect.\nhis3 | Five What degree of certainty is needed to be able to detect the treatment difference in four?\n```",
