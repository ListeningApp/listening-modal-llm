        "content": "7ce8 | Solo Polyamory: An approach to polyamory that emphasizes personal agency. Individuals do not seek to engage in relationships that are tightly couple-centric or financially and/or domestically entwined. People who identify as solo poly emphasize autonomy, the freedom to choose their own relationships without seeking permission from others, and flexibility in the form their relationships take. It is a common misconception that people practicing solo polyamory are either more casual or less committed in their relationships, but this is not necessarily the case. Solo poly folks can be deeply emotionally involved and committed in their relationships, but they typically choose not to take on the traditional roles that some partners assume like living together, having shared bank accounts or doing each other's laundry (at least not as a relationship obligation). One principle of solo poly that I think everyone can benefit from is the notion of being your own primary partner and prioritizing your relationship with yourself first and foremost.\nqrtv | Relationship Anarchy: This type of consensual non-monogamy falls at the very end or even off this chart completely. The term was first coined in two thousand six by Andie Nordgren, who applied political anarchist principles to interpersonal relationships. Relationship anarchists seek to dismantle the social hierarchies dictating how sexual and romantic relationships are prioritized over all other forms of love, and so people who identify as relationship anarchists make less distinction between the importance or value of their lovers over their friends or other people in their life, and they do not only reserve intimacy or romance for the people they have sex with. Upper Right Quadrant\na7z0 | Poly Intimates: I've started to use this term for people who are sexually exclusive\n7dsi | with one partner, but who are not emotionally exclusive with that partner in ways that a traditional monogamous relationship would typically disallow, be suspicious of or characterize as emotional cheating. Poly intimates might share varying degrees of romance and emotional intimacy with more than just the person they are sexually exclusive with. Poly intimates might be nonsexual partners who live together, travel together, raise children together or share other aspects of life, where the level of investment and involvement does not fit the conventional notion of friendship.\niax1 | Polyamorous and Asexual: People who identify as asexual do not experience sexual attraction to others and they do not engage in sex with others, but they still experience romantic attraction to people, and there are asexual people who are romantically polyamorous.\n61w7 | In this chapter, I acknowledged that nonmonogamy is not a new form of relationship, but that it is currently becoming more common. I examined the reasons why people engage in nonmonogamy based on survey research and what I've also seen in my own psychotherapy and coaching practice. I also covered the different ways that people can express being nonmonogamous based on how sexually exclusive or sexually nonexclusive they are intersecting with how emotionally exclusive or emotionally nonexclusive they are. After reading this chapter, which of the reasons for being nonmonogamous resonate with you? Do you have reasons for being nonmonogamous that weren't mentioned here? In looking at the different types of nonmonogamy, what did you learn about yourself or your partners? And are there other ways that you would define your version of nonmonogamy?\nnllv | CHAPTER FIVE ATTACHMENT AND NONMONOGAMY\nbsru | ATTACHMENT RESEARCH AND RESOURCES for consensually nonmonogamous relationships are scarce. It is safe to say that the field of attachment theory is highly mononormative. The overwhelming majority of research conducted to understand adult romantic attachment is undertaken with monogamous couples, and advice about how to establish a secure attachment either assumes monogamy or outright prescribes monogamy as a necessary precondition for establishing safety and security. Moors, Conley, Edelstein and Chopik state that \"attachment theory presumes that healthy, satisfying relationships are, by definition, dyadic.\" Authors on attachment theory will assert that being pair-bonded is the prototype for attachment in adulthood, that couples need to create a couple bubble around them in order to ensure security, and that your partner needs to be the one, single or main person that you emotionally depend on. I question if these criteria are even healthy from a monogamous standpoint (a considerable amount of the mono-romantic ideal can actually be codependency in disguise), but at the very least we can see how these ideas and assumptions within the field of attachment are excluding people in consensually nonmonogamous relationships.\n7ylr | What attachment researchers say about the relationship between sex and attachment creates another mononormative problem for people in consensually nonmonogamous relationships. Attachment literature unquestionably has important insights into how the different attachment styles experience and relate to sex. Differences in motivation and experiences are to be expected and are not inherently a problem, but some behaviors such as casual sex, one-night stands, sex outside of marriage, multiple sexual partners, partaking in bondage, voyeurism, exhibitionism and even sexting are all associated with insecure attachment. The problem gets even bigger when people then take these research findings a step further and conclude that since these sexual behaviors are the types of behaviors that non-monogamous people participate in, then nonmonogamy must in and of itself be an expression of\ns7xm | insecure attachment. Just to be clear, I am not saying this and, as you will see below, the current research on consensually nonmonogamous relationships does not support this, but many of my clients have unfortunately heard previous therapists equate being consensually nonmonogamous with attachment insecurity and pathologized them for their lifestyle and sexuality. In such cases, it is important to distinguish between the intentions behind specific sexual behaviors instead of just looking at the sex act itself. If someone is pursuing multiple partners to avoid intimacy or using sex in an attempt to secure intimacy when they feel insecure, then in those cases such behaviors can be seen as an expression of insecure attachment. But many people engage in these very same behaviors from a secure place, where they are able to have multiple sex partners, one-night stands or BDSM play in intentional, highly attuned, connected and meaningful ways.\n5bgk | When we start to dig into the current research on consensually nonmonogamous relationships and attachment, we find the research is extremely limited. As I write this book in twenty twenty, there are less than a handful of studies that examine the relationship between attachment and consensually nonmonogamous relationships. From a research perspective, this is insufficient. The good news is that what little research has been done thus far demonstrates that people in consensually nonmonogamous relationships are just as likely to be securely attached as people in monogamous relationships. In a survey conducted with over one thousand three hundred people, Moors, Conley, Edelstein and Chopik examined whether there were any differences in attachment styles for people who were either in monogamous, swinging or polyamorous relationships. They found that there was no difference in attachment anxiety levels between people who were monogamous versus those that were consensually nonmonogamous, and that people in consensually nonmonogamous relationships were actually lower in attachment avoidance than the people in monogamous relationships were. This research suggests that people in consensually nonmonogamous relationships exhibit characteristics of secure attachment, maybe even more so than people in monogamous relationships. A smaller study of one hundred seventy-nine gay men similarly found no difference in attachment styles between the participants who were in in monogamous relationships and those in nonmonogamous relationships. A two thousand fourteen doctoral dissertation investigated whether there was any difference in the attachment styles of",
