If you don't know how to do problems like this, it's time to learn about Lagrange multipliers. You can find this in any book on calculus of several variables. But the idea is in the picture above. Say we've got two smooth functions f, g: RN maps to R and we have a point on the surface g equals constant where f is as big as it gets on this surface. The gradient of f must be perpendicular to the surface at this point. Otherwise we could move along the surface in a way that made f bigger! For the same reason, the gradient of g is always perpendicular to the surface g equals constant. So gradient f and gradient g must point in the same or opposite directions at this point. Thus, as long as the gradient of g is nonzero, we must have\nwsee | gradient f equals lambda gradient g\nilgr | for some number lambda, called a Lagrange multiplier. So, solving this equation along with\nhrx3 | g equals constant\nna9n | is a way to find the point we're looking for-though we still need to check we've found a maximum, not a minimum or something else.\n8k3d | We can write a formula that means the exact same thing as gradient f equals lambda gradient g using differentials:\nagug | df equals lambda dg\nmkb4 | This is what we'll do from now on. Gradients are vector fields while differentials are one-forms. If you don't know what this means, you can probably ignore this for now: the difference, while ultimately quite important, will not be significant for anything we're doing.\n06qs | MAXIMIZING ENTROPY SUBJECT TO A CONSTRAINT\ncdth | To maximize the entropy\nevax | H equals negative the sum from i equals one to n of pi ln pi\n2wtm | subject to a constraint on the expected value\nib53 | A equals the sum from i equals one to n of pi Ai\n0kr1 | it's good to look for a probability distribution such that dH equals lambda dA\n58mo | for some number lambda. This will then be a Boltzmann distribution:\n1ghh | exp of negative lambda times Ai\n643d | Pi equals\n58a9 | the sum from j equals one to n of exp of negative lambda times Aj\nhjlr | We've seen how to maximize a function subject to a constraint. Now let's do the case we're interested in: maximizing entropy subject to a constraint on the expected value of some quantity.\n0k3o | Suppose we have a finite set of outcomes, say one, two, ..., n. Our 'quantity' A is just a number A1, A2, ..., An depending on the outcome. For any probability distribution p on the set of outcomes, we can define its Shannon entropy and the expected value of A:\na1r1 | H equals negative the sum from i equals one to n of pi ln pi, A equals the sum from i equals one to n of pi Ai.\nbou6 | Here we are using base e for the Shannon entropy, to simplify the calculations. Let's try to find the probability distribution that maximizes H on the surface A equals c. We'll show that if such a probability distribution p exists, and none of the pi are zero, then p must be a Boltzmann distribution\ns7uq | the sum from j equals one to n of exp of negative lambda times Aj\nl11a | Pi equals\nllit | the sum from i equals one to n of exp of negative lambda times Ai\nmf1f | for some lambda in R. If you're willing to trust me on this, you can skip this calculation.\nm61m | To use the method from last time the Lagrange multiplier method-we'd like to use the probabilities pi as coordinates on the space of probability distributions. But they aren't independent, since\npnz9 | the sum from i equals one to n of pi equals one. To get around this, let's use all but one of the pi as coordinates, and remember that the remaining one is a function of those. Let's use p2, P3, ..., Pn as coordinates, so that P1 equals one minus the sum of p2, ..., Pn. Furthermore, the space of all probability distributions on our finite set is\n1abn | the set of P such that zero is less than or equal to Pi is less than or equal to one, and the sum from i equals one to n of P equals one. It looks like a closed interval when n equals two, or a triangle when n equals three, or a tetrahedron when n equals four, or some higher-dimensional version of a tetrahedron when n is larger. In its interior this space looks locally like RN minus one, so we can use the Lagrange multiplier method, but it also has a boundary where one or more of the pi vanish, and then this method no longer applies. (We'll see an example of that later.)\n8un4 | So, let's assume p is a probability distribution maximizing the Shannon entropy H on the surface A equals c, and also suppose p has p1, ..., Pn greater than zero. Suppose that not all the values Ai are equal, since that makes the problem too easy-see why? Then dA is never zero, so from what I said last time, we must have\ns0ti | dH equals lambda dA\nyhew | at the point p. So let's see what this equation actually says.\naqjo | Since\nopdt | H equals negative the sum from i equals one to n of pi ln pi\nj6d4 | we have\nwmtt | dH equals negative the sum from i equals one to n of d(pi ln pi) equals negative the sum from i equals one to n of (one plus ln pi) dpi.\nu5uc | Similarly, since\n0d2r | A equals the sum from i equals one to n of pi Ai we have\ngly4 | dA equals the sum from i equals one to n of Ai dpi.\nw1gv | So, our equation dH equals lambda dA says\nf69a | negative the sum from i equals one to n of (one plus ln pi) dpi equals lambda times the sum from i equals one to n of Ai dpi.\nycgz | For these to be equal, the coefficients of dpi must agree for each of our coordinates P2, ..., Pn. But we have to remember that p1 equals one minus (p2 plus ... plus Pn) and thus dp1 equals negative (dp2 plus ... plus dpn). Thus, for each i equals two, ..., n we have\njb3e | (one plus ln p1) minus (one plus ln pi) equals lambda times negative A1 plus Ai\ne580 | and fiddling around we get\nkwv3 | exp of negative lambda times A1 over exp of negative lambda times Ai equals P1 over Pi\nwxdu | This says something cool: the probabilities p sub i are proportional to the exponentials exp of negative lambda Ai. And since the probabilities must sum to one, it's obvious what the constant of proportionality must be:\nzdfh | p sub i equals exp of negative lambda Ai over the sum from i equals one to n of exp of negative lambda Ai. So yes: p sub i must be given by the Boltzmann distribution!\ni1dq | In summary, we've seen that if there exists a probability distribution p that maximizes the Shannon entropy among probability distributions with expected value A equals c, and if all the p sub i are positive, then p must be a Boltzmann distribution. But this raises other questions. When does such a probability distribution exist? If it exists, is it unique? And what if not all the p sub i are positive?\nhwux | In what follows we'll dive down this rabbit hole and get to the bottom of it. I'll just state some facts-you may enjoy trying to see if you can prove them. First, there exists a probability distribution p sub one, ..., p sub n with expected value A equals c if and only if\n```",
