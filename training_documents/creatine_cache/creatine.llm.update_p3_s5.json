Anabolic steroids are drugs, with a different chemical structure than creatine, and are Class C, Schedule Three controlled substances regulated by the Food and Drug Administration and subject to the regulatory control provisions of the Controlled Substances Act set forth by the Drug Enforcement Association. Creatine, on the other hand, like many other dietary supplements fits well within the confines of The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of nineteen ninety-four, which is a statute of United States Federal legislation which defines and regulates dietary supplements by the Federal Drug Administration for Good Manufacturing Practices. It is illegal to possess and administer anabolic steroids without a physician's prescription. However, there are no legal ramifications for the possession or ingestion of creatine.\nw8r5 | In summary, because creatine has a completely different chemical structure, it is not an anabolic steroid.\nybik | Does creatine cause kidney damage or renal dysfunction? Questions and concerns involving creatine supplementation and kidney damage or renal dysfunction are common. In terms of pervasive misinformation in the sport nutrition arena, the notion that creatine supplementation leads to kidney damage or renal dysfunction is perhaps second only to the myth that protein supplementation and high habitual protein intake causes kidney damage. Today, after more than twenty years of research which demonstrates no adverse effects from recommended dosages of creatine supplements on kidney health, unfortunately, this concern persists. While the origin is unknown, the connection between creatine supplementation and kidney\ngii5 | damage or renal dysfunction could be traced back to two things: a poor understanding of creatine and creatinine metabolism and a case study published in nineteen ninety-eight.\nq5eu | In skeletal muscle, both creatine and PCr are degraded non-enzymatically to creatinine, which is exported to the blood and excreted in the urine. Healthy kidneys filter creatinine, which would otherwise increase in the blood. Therefore, blood creatinine levels can be used as a proxy marker of kidney function. However, the amount of creatinine in the blood is related to muscle mass (i.e. males have higher blood creatinine than females) and both dietary creatine and creatinine intake. Both blood and urinary creatinine may be increased by ingestion of creatine supplementation and creatine containing foods, such as meat. Creatine is normally not present in urine, but can reach very high levels (more than ten grams per day) during creatine supplementation. There appears to be an unsubstantiated perspective that if the kidneys are \"forced\" to excrete higher than normal levels of creatine or creatinine, some sort of kidney \"overload\" will take place, causing kidney damage and or renal dysfunction. In reality, transient increases in blood or urinary creatine or creatinine due to creatine supplementation are unlikely to reflect a decrease in kidney function. Additionally, one must exercise caution when using blood creatinine and estimated creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate in individuals who consume high meat intake or supplement with creatine. In a review of creatine supplementation studies, Persky and Rawson found no increase in serum creatinine in twelve studies, eight studies showed an increase that remained within the normal range, and only two studies showed an increase above normal limits (although not different from the control group in one study).\na7ao | In nineteen ninety-eight, a case study of a young male with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and relapsing nephrotic syndrome was reported. The young male, who had kidney disease for eight years and was treated with cyclosporine (i.e., immunosuppressant) for five years, had recently begun ingesting creatine supplementation (fifteen grams per day for seven days; followed by two grams per day for seven weeks). Based on increased blood levels of creatinine and subsequent estimate of calculated creatinine clearance, his kidney health was presumed to be deteriorating, although he was otherwise in good health. The patient was encouraged to discontinue creatine supplementation. At this time, it was already known that blood and urine creatinine levels can increase following ingestion of creatine containing food products, including creatine supplements. This was ignored by the authors of this case study, as was the inclusion of two investigations which demonstrated that creatine supplementation did not negatively impact renal function. The dosage of creatine during the maintenance phase, which was also\n29a3 | ignored, was only slightly higher than the daily creatine intake of a typical omnivore's dietary intake, or in terms of food, a large hamburger or steak per day (meat contains about zero point seven grams of creatine per six ounce serving). In response to this case study, two separate teams of experts in creatine metabolism wrote letters to the editor of Lancet. However, the notion that creatine supplementation leads to kidney damage and/or renal dysfunction gained traction and momentum.",
