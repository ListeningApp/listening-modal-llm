You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

abow | Equation (34) can be solved in terms of a spectral ex- pansion (see e.g. [2, 24]). Writing
qx6n | P(x,t) = cnPn (x)e-Ent n=0

j3tt | The conditional probability, a quantity akin to the evolu- tion operator or propagator in quantum mechanics, can be expressed in terms of the spectral expansion as
zoz0 | <LATEX>\widetilde { P } \left( x , t | x _ { 0 } , 0 \right) = \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } p _ { n } \left( x \right) p _ { n } \left( x _ { 0 } \right) e ^ { - E _ { n } t }</LATEX> <LATEX>P \left( x , t | x _ { 0 } , 0 \right) = e ^ { - V \left( x \right) / \Upsilon } \widetilde { P } \left( x , t | x _ { 0 } , 0 \right) e ^ { + V \left( x _ { 0 } \right) / \Upsilon }</LATEX> (41) (42)
3blu | Any correlation function can then be expressed by using (42). An economic notation can be achieved by using Dirac bra-ket notation in terms of which e.g.
xv2l | <LATEX>\widetilde { P } \left( t , 0 \right) = \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } | n \rangle e ^ { - E _ { n } t } \langle n |</LATEX> (43)
xt4k | Correlation functions can then be expressed in the spec- tral expansion as:
ti78 | <LATEX>\langle f \left( x \left( t \right) \right) g \left( x \left( 0 \right) \right) \rangle = \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } \langle 0 | f | n \rangle e ^ { - E _ { n } t } \langle n | g | \mathrm { i n } \rangle</LATEX> ( (4)

n093 | <LATEX>\langle 0 | f | n \rangle = \int _ { - \infty } ^ { \infty } d x p _ { 0 } \left( x \right) f \left( x \right) p _ { n } \left( x \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>\langle n | g | \mathrm { i n } \rangle = \int _ { - \infty } ^ { \infty } d x p _ { n } \left( x \right) g \left( x \right) \widetilde { P } \left( x , 0 \right)</LATEX> (45) (46)
4khi | Note that the "out state" in the stochastic problem is always <LATEX>\langle 0 |</LATEX> and the "in state" is defined in terms of
7fh2 | <LATEX>\widetilde { P } \left( x , t = 0 \right) .</LATEX> We can also write the conditional probability
5isn | <LATEX>P \left( x , t | x _ { 0 } , 0 \right) = \langle x | e ^ { - V \left( x \right) / \Upsilon } \widetilde { P } \left( t , 0 \right) e ^ { + V \left( x _ { 0 } \right) / \Upsilon } | x _ { 0 } \rangle</LATEX> governed by the above Euclidean Schrödinger equation, as a path integral
5vry | <LATEX>P \left( x , t | x _ { 0 } , 0 \right) = \mathcal{N} \exp \left( \frac { \varepsilon } { 2 D } \left[ V \left( x \right) - V \left( x _ { 0 } \right) \right] \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>\times \int _ { x \left( 0 \right) = x _ { 0 } } ^ { x \left( t \right) = x } \mathcal{D} x \left( \tau \right) \exp \left( - \int \frac { d \tau } { 2 D m } \left\{ \frac { 1 } { 2 } m \left( \partial _ { \tau } x \right) ^ { 2 } - \bar { U } \left( x \right) \right\} \right)</LATEX> (48)

johv | <LATEX>\bar { U } .</LATEX> Before proceeding to the next sections we should add a comment regarding the above path integrals. Beyond being expressions that allow formal manipulations, they can also be understood as limits of large multi-variate integrals arising from the discretization of time evolu- tion into small discrete time intervals. In general, this
2olp | discretization results into apparent ambiguities [25]1. In our case this can also be linked to the discretization of the Langevin equation (8) (the index i refers to the <LATEX>i ^ { \mathrm { t h } }</LATEX> time interval)
