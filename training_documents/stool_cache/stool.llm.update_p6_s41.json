        "content": "u8nw | In both countries, the increase in sensitivity of a TB diagnosis under the intervention generated a corresponding reduction in mortality: a fourteen to twenty percent relative reduction in the fraction of children with presumptive TB dying. In both countries, costs increased under the intervention, and the base-case (using smear microscopy in the standard of care) ICERs were one hundred thirty-two dollars per DALY averted in Ethiopia and ninety-four dollars per DALY averted in Indonesia. Restricting the analysis to children under five years resulted in cost savings with ICERs of negative seventy-eight dollars per DALY averted in Ethiopia\nl2v9 | and increased the ICER to two hundred nine dollars per DALY averted in Indonesia.\nafbe | Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses\n78r8 | Model projections showed large uncertainty that included cost savings under intervention (twenty-five percent of the runs for Ethiopia and twenty-eight percent for Indonesia), but also some increases in mortality (one point two percent of the runs for Ethiopia and two point eight percent for Indonesia). At a cost-effectiveness threshold of zero point five times GDP our analysis projected a probability of being cost effective of eighty-seven percent in Ethiopia and a ninety-six percent in Indonesia. The corresponding probabilities for a one times GDP threshold were ninety-five percent in Ethiopia and ninety-seven percent in Indonesia. Tornado plots show that prevalence of true TB among presumptive TB, the sensitivity of stool, and the fraction of children able to expectorate were the largest drivers of uncertainty.\n320g | Under the assumption that Xpert was used in the standard of care, the ICERs were one hundred thirty-eight dollars per DALY averted in Ethiopia and one hundred fifteen dollars per DALY averted in Indonesia. Assuming half the prevalence of true TB among patients with presumptive TB changed the ICERs to one hundred forty-five dollars per DALY averted in Ethiopia and one hundred fifty dollars per DALY averted in Indonesia. Finally, assuming a zero percent discount rate changed the ICERs to fifty-five dollars per DALY averted in Ethiopia and thirty-eight dollars per DALY averted in Indonesia, whereas five percent discount rate generated ICERs of one hundred ninety-nine dollars per DALY averted in Ethiopia and one hundred forty-two dollars per DALY averted in Indonesia.\ntp8g | DISCUSSION\ngxfd | In this modelling analysis, we found that the introduction of routine Xpert stool-based diagnostics (using the standard of care method) was cost-effective in both Ethiopia and Indonesia.

However, it is crucial that clinical assessment is still undertaken alongside negative bacteriological test results because bacteriological testing has a low negative predictive value especially in young children. Relying on bacteriological testing alone can reduce sensitivity to diagnose true TB and increase mortality, especially if referrals and re-assessments are common under the standard of care. We estimated ICERs of one hundred thirty-two and ninety-four dollars per DALY averted in the base-case analyses for Ethiopia and Indonesia, respectively. These ICERs are less than zero point five times GDP, which has been suggested as a rule of thumb for cost-effectiveness thresholds, as well as country-specific estimates of supply-side thresholds. The intervention would be especially cost-effective for children under five years of age.\n1jyv | Children age less than five years are at higher risk of dying from untreated TB than older children and have the greatest difficulty in spontaneously expectorating sputum. Under the intervention, we found greater increases in bacteriologically diagnosis and greater decreases in referrals in the less than five years age group. We found that the cost of introducing the intervention was partially offset by reduced referrals from PHC facilities to hospitals. In Ethiopia, this produced a projected cost saving in the under five age group, despite a slight increase in the average total number of assessments done. In taking a healthcare provider's perspective, we did not include patient costs in\nolce | our analysis, but health-seeking costs are a major driver of catastrophic costs in TB.\nerx1 | There are large uncertainties associated with many parameters describing processes and pathways for paediatric TB. We found no directly applicable estimates of rates of reassessments or (self-) referral at different stages of care, and had to rely on expert opinion. Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity of clinical assessment for paediatric TB is poorly quantified in the literature. Because of this, we placed a particular emphasis on including uncertainty in results, as well as systematically exploring their sensitivity to one-way variation in parameters, and discrete alternative assumptions. For example, because our estimate of true TB prevalence among children with presumptive TB was based on data mainly from hospitals which may have higher prevalence than PHC level, we halved prevalence resulting in increased ICERs by less than a factor of two without changing our qualitative conclusions. Despite these uncertainties, the intervention showed probabilities of being cost-effective greater than eighty-five percent in each country across a wide range of cost-effectiveness thresholds. This conclusion was also robust to assuming the standard of care used Xpert rather than sputum-smear microscopy at PHC level, and to different choices of discount rate.\nb3bt | Some aspects were deliberately simplified or omitted in the modelling. First, we did not model HIV because paediatric HIV rates in Ethiopia and Indonesia are relatively low at zero point zero nine percent and zero point zero three percent, respectively. This may underestimate the benefit from the intervention due to underestimated TB mortality, especially if stool-based",
