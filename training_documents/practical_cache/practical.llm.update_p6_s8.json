The diagnosis is challenging because the histological features of many disorders causing infantile cholestasis overlap, evolve and vary with age. The diagnostic accuracy of liver biopsy for biliary atresia diagnosis is between sixty percent and ninety-five percent. We have analyzed studies with liver biopsy as the only method for diagnosis. The earliest histological changes of biliary atresia might be relatively nonspecific, and biopsies performed too early in the course of the disease might result in a false-negative result. In a meta-analysis, including thirty-eight papers, the sensitivities and specificities of individual studies varied from ninety percent to one hundred percent and from eighty-four percent to one hundred percent, respectively. The percutaneous liver biopsy showed pooled sensitivity of ninety-eight percent, specificity of ninety-three percent, positive likelihood ratio of twelve point zero nine and negative likelihood ratio of zero point zero three. The positive predictive value was ninety-three percent and the negative predictive value was ninety-seven point seven percent.\nmeyw | In a meta-analysis, twenty-two articles were included; the pooled accuracy of preoperative liver biopsy was ninety-one point seven percent, with a sensitivity of ninety-one point two percent, specificity of ninety-three percent, positive predictive value of ninety-one point two percent, negative predictive value of ninety-two point five percent and accuracy of ninety-one point six percent.\n2e62 | A large multicentre study addressed histopathological features of liver biopsies that distinguish biliary atresia from other causes of infantile cholestasis. They found a diagnostic accuracy of the needle biopsy of ninety point one percent, whereas sensitivity and\n75y3 | gallbladder and cystic and common bile ducts with no reflux in intrahepatic bile ducts.

This study revealed large variability in the severity of histological changes in biliary atresia; for example, bile duct proliferation was absent in as many as twenty-two point eight percent of biliary atresia cases and bile duct/ductular plugs were absent in twenty-five percent of biliary atresia cases. Histological features of biliary atresia also overlapped with non-biliary atresia cases; more than forty percent of the latter had some degree of bile ductular reaction and bile plugs were present in fifteen percent. According to these data, percutaneous liver biopsy cannot exclude biliary atresia. The general reported complication rate of US-guided percutaneous liver biopsy ranges from one point seven percent and four point six percent but has not been reported in this specific population.\nq1q2 | Risk scores\ncb7r | Differentiation of biliary atresia from other nonsurgical causes of neonatal cholestasis is challenging so a diagnostic risk score is desirable. We searched for biliary atresia risk score papers in the literature including all imaging techniques.\n68xu | Kim et al. used both clinical gestational age at birth and imaging criteria triangular cord thickness at US, gallbladder structure at US, hepatobiliary scan findings to develop a risk score for biliary atresia that stratifies patients in a low-risk group in which liver biopsy may be postponed, an intermediate-risk group in which liver biopsy can be considered and a high-risk group in which prompt liver biopsy with or without intraoperative cholangiography should be considered. There are concerns about Kim et al.'s risk score. First, hepatobiliary scintigraphy causes a diagnostic delay of one week five days for preparation with phenobarbital and two days for the examination - we need twenty-four-hour delayed imaging and it\nhd35 | is not recommended because of its limited specificity. According to Kim et al.'s risk score, a full-term birth infant with triangular cord sign and gallbladder abnormalities has only a fifteen point eight eight percent probability of biliary atresia. This is not in agreement with the very high sensitivity and specificity of the combination of triangular cord sign and gallbladder abnormalities reported in the first part of our meta-analysis eighty-seven percent, ninety percent and ninety-nine percent, respectively. According to those results, this infant has a very high probability of having biliary atresia. Kim et al.'s risk score underweights the role of an optimized US scan. In that paper, US was performed after a two-hour fast, which in our opinion is too short. The US criteria did not include signs such as micro- or macrocyst or syndromic presentation. In Kim et al.'s strategy, biopsy is indicated in the high-risk group, but we consider it more important to do a cholangiography than a biopsy, according to the results of our review. We agree that the high-risk group should get a cholangiography and a biopsy and that the low-risk group can be monitored by close follow-up according to the age. However, our major concern with these results is that they give no answer to how to handle the patients with intermediate fifteen point eight eight to fifty-nine point nine nine percent risk of biliary atresia.\n2zpk | El-Guindi et al. used stool colour clay, US signs triangular cord sign, contractile gallbladder, gallbladder length at least twenty point five millimeters, hepatic artery diameter greater than or equal to two point zero five millimeters, hepatic artery diameter over portal vein diameter at least zero point four four five millimeters, hepatic subcapsular flow, laboratory tests and histopathology to develop a twelve-parameter diagnostic score to discriminate biliary atresia from other causes of neonatal cholestasis, reporting a sensitivity and specificity of one hundred percent each. The main concern is the reproducibility of these measurements and of this diagnostic score; Macaluso et al., applying the same diagnostic score to their population, obtained less encouraging results: global sensitivity was thirty-one percent with a specificity of ninety point nine percent.\n```",
