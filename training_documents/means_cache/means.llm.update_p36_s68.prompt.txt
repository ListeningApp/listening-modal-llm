You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

srly | · When the linear model is used to compare several means adjusted for the effect of one or more other variables (called covariates) it can be referred to as analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).
dl6i | · Before the analysis check that the covariate(s) are independent
89ub | of any independent variables by seeing whether those independent variables predict the covariate (i.e., the covariate should not differ across groups).
dhle | · In the table labelled Tests of Between-Subjects Effects, assuming you're using an alpha of 0.05, look to see if the value in the column labelled Sig. is below 0.05 for both the covariate and the independent variable. If it is for the covariate then this variable has a significant relationship to the outcome variable; if it is for the independent variable then the means (adjusted for the effect of the covariate) are significantly different across categories of this variable.
2nib | · If you have generated specific hypotheses before the experiment use planned contrasts; if not, use post hoc tests.
naev | · For parameters and post hoc tests, look at the columns labelled Sig. to discover if your comparisons are significant (they will be if the significance value is less than 0.05). Use bootstrapping to get robust versions of these tests.
7h0h | . In addition to the assumptions in Chapter 6, test for homogeneity of regression slopes by customizing the model to look at the independent variable × covariate interaction.
a64c | We have already looked at robust confidence intervals and p-values for the model parameters that were computed using bootstrapping and heteroscedasticity robust standard errors (Section 13.6.2). In addition, the companion website contains a syntax file (robustANCOVA.sps) for running a robust variant of ANCOVA (ancboot) that works on trimmed means and is described by Wilcox (2017). We need the Essentials for R plugin and WRS2 package installed (Section 4.13). This test is limited to the situation where the independent variable (the categorical predictor) has two categories and there is one covariate. But it does enable you to ignore assumptions and get on with your life. Because this syntax only works when you have two groups, I have provided a data file called PuppiesTwoGroup.sav, which contains the example data for
gi7n | this chapter but excluding the 15-minute condition, so it compares the control (no puppies) with the 30-minute group (Dose), and has the scores for the love of puppies covariate too (Puppy_love). The syntax to run the robust test is as follows: BEGIN PROGRAM R.
3pn1 | library(WRS2)
wjuz | mySPSSdata = spssdata.GetDataFromSPSS(factorMode = "labels") ancboot(Happiness ~ Dose + Puppy_love, data = mySPSSdata, tr = 0.2, nboot = 1000) END PROGRAM.
3yxv | Select and run these five lines of syntax (see SPSS Tip 10.3). As Output 13.13 shows, the test works by identifying values of the covariate for which the relationship between the covariate and outcome are comparable in the two groups. In this example it identifies five values of Puppy_love (2, 3, 5, 6, and 8) for which the relationship between love of puppies and happiness is comparable. At each of these design points, we're told the number of cases for the two groups (n1 and n2) that have a value of the covariate (Puppy_love) close to these design points (not exactly x, but close to it). Based on these two samples, trimmed means (20% by default) are computed and the difference between them tested. This difference is stored in the column Diff along with the boundaries of the associated 95% bootstrap confidence interval (corrected to control for doing five tests) in the next two columns. The test statistic comparing the difference is in the column statistic, with its p-value in the final column. Output 13.12 shows no significant differences between trimmed means for any of the design points (all p-values are greater than 0.05).
d8zj | 13.9 Bayesian analysis with covariates
ywxn | Because the model we have fitted is a linear model with a categorical predictor and a continuous predictor, you can use what you learned in Section 9.13 to run a Bayesian regression. You would need to manually create dummy variables (as in the file Puppy Love Dummy.sav) and drag these to the box labelled Factor(s) and drag Puppy_Love to the box labelled Covariate(s) see Figure 13.10. You would interpret in the same way as the model we fitted in Section 9.13.
uxhs | 13.10 Calculating the effect size
ed6e | In the previous chapter we used eta squared, n2, as an effect size measure when comparing means (Section 12.10). When we include a covariate too we have more than one effect and we could calculate eta squared for each effect. We can also use an effect size measure called partial eta squared (partial n2). This differs from eta squared in that it looks not at the proportion of total variance that a variable explains, but at the proportion of variance that a variable explains that is not explained by other variables in the analysis. Let's look at this with our example. Suppose we want to know the effect size of the dose of puppy therapy. Partial eta squared is the proportion of variance in happiness that the dose of puppy therapy shares that is not attributed to love of puppies (the covariate). If you think about the variance that the covariate cannot explain, there are two sources: it cannot explain the variance attributable to the dose of puppy therapy, SSpuppy therapy, and it cannot explain the error variability, SSR. Therefore, we use these two sources of variance instead of the total variability, SST, in the calculation. The difference between eta squared and partial eta squared is illustrated by comparing the following two equations:
6qqm | 2 SSEffect
onum | nº= > SS Total
3iir | (13.6)
7a0a | Partial 72= SSEffect + SSResidual SS Effect
o1qp | (13.7)
jrik | SPSS Statistics will produce partial eta squared for us (see Jane Superbrain Box
xv78 | 13.3), but to illustrate its calculation look at equation (13.8), where we use the sums of squares in Output 13.6 for the effect of dose (25.19), the covariate (15.08) and the error (79.05):
sdks | Partial nDose= SSDose + SSResidual SSDose 25.19 25.19 25.19+ 79.05 104.24 = 0.24
y8fb | (13.8)
521q | Partial nPuppy_love SS Puppy_love + SSResidual SS Puppy_love 15.08+79.05 15.08 15.08 -= 0.16 94.13
yogo | You can also use omega squared (@2). However, as we saw in Section 12.8, this measure can be calculated only when we have equal numbers of participants in each group (which is not the case in this example). So, we're a bit stumped! Not all is lost, though, because, as I've said many times already, the overall effect size is not nearly as interesting as the effect size for more focused comparisons. These are easy to calculate because we selected to see the model parameters (see Output 13.8) and so we have t-statistics for the covariate and comparisons between the 15-and 30-minute groups and the control and 30-minute group. These t-statistics have 26 degrees of freedom (see Section 13.6.1). We can use the same equation as in Section 10.9.5:6
