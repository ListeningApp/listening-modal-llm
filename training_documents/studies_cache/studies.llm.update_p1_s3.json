In recent years, social-ecological systems have emerged as a prominent analytical framing with which to investigate pressing sustainability issues associated with the Anthropocene era. Despite the growth of social-ecological systems research, the lack of a delineated set of methods commonly contributes to disorientation for those entering into a field where methodological pluralism is the norm. We conduct a review of social-ecological systems research, focusing particularly on methods used in this field. Our results reflect the rapid growth in social-ecological systems research relative to other publications in relevant subject areas, and suggest a maturation of the field. Whilst institutions investigating social-ecological systems have been mostly based in the global north, focal social-ecological systems have been more globally distributed, although key regions, especially island regions, remain poorly studied. Key problems addressed in the studies related to policy, trade, conservation, adaptation, land use change, water, forests, sustainability, urban problems, and governance and institutions. We identified three hundred eleven methods, which we grouped into twenty-seven method categories that can serve as a guide to social-ecological systems research methods for newcomers to the field. We also performed an exploratory assessment of the ability of these methods to account for key features of social-ecological systems as complex adaptive systems. We found that methods do better at accounting for the relational and context-dependent nature of social-ecological systems, and least well with complex causality. Our study highlights the plurality of methods used in social-ecological systems research, and helps highlight key areas in need of further methodological development.\n51vd | INTRODUCTION\nbaj1 | Human activities are changing the ecosystems upon which humanity depends in unprecedented and profound ways. In the fast-changing and ever-more-connected era of the Anthropocene, the environmental and social challenges we face demand better understanding of the complex and evolving links between ecosystems and human societies. The concept of social-ecological systems has emerged as a key conceptual and analytical framing with which to understand the connections and feedbacks between social and environmental interactions in real-world systems. The concept has helped facilitate increased recognition of the dependence of humanity on ecosystems, has improved collaboration across disciplines and between science and society, has increased methodological pluralism that has led to improved systems understanding, and has manifested in major policy frameworks and initiatives, such as Future Earth and the Sustainable Development Goals. Recent years have also seen the emergence of new research areas, modeling approaches, and analytic frameworks.\nn1wo | Despite progress, social-ecological systems research remains challenging. Central to this challenge is the recognition that social-ecological systems research represents an emergent \"third\" space that transcends the mere sum of social and ecological research practices and disciplines. Many methods and\n5bq3 | approaches used in social-ecological systems research do not fall within the realms of traditional social and natural sciences, or any singular discipline, and as a result social-ecological systems as a research field lacks its own coherent methodological identity, instead drawing strongly on methodological pluralism. Fluidity of identity is also evident in the multiple terms used to describe social-ecological systems, varied definitions for what social-ecological systems are, and the different ways that social-ecological systems are spoken about in academic literature, ranging from a boundary object to bridge disciplines to describing real epistemic systems that can be understood using empirical methods.\nezla | Although a variety of conceptual and methodological ambiguities plague this emerging research area, there is sufficient coherence to enable analysis of key dimensions of this research field. All social-ecological systems research has in common a nomenclature that designates the object of study as having integrated social and ecological components, as is also reflected in the names of prominent journals in the field. Indeed, several recent reviews have attempted such analyses of the social-ecological systems field. From these reviews, it is clear that social-ecological systems research, which is often approached alongside concepts such as ecosystem services, sustainability science, and transdisciplinary research, has grown over the past twenty years. Having its origins in place-based, local resource management studies, the field is still largely characterized by place-based studies, especially at the local scale.\nrsbu | Meta-approaches/comparative analyses and framework development are, however, also often conducted. Indeed, several large databases now exist to collect case studies for meta-analyses, e.g. social-ecological systems metaanalysis database, social-ecological systems global outlook, international forestry resources and institutions. Social-ecological systems research derive from a broad range of disciplines, including the environmental, social, agricultural, biological, Earth and planetary, and computer sciences, as well as medicine and the humanities. Although the focus of social-ecological systems research has shifted slightly over time, studies on adaptive management, governance, restoration, and poverty alleviation in sectors such as fisheries, forestry, and watersheds have been popular throughout.\n```",
