The basis for the petition sent to Management of the University is questionable because it is not premised on the report submitted by the Special Committee.\nnxb1 | Eight. The disparities in the content of the report submitted by the Special Committee and the petition sent to Management of the University by the Board of Convocation is unacceptable.\nkwpw | Nine. The rules of natural justice are breached because Members of Convocation who are cited in the petition were not given a hearing.\nusfa | Ten. The Ad-hoc Committee is of the view that, it is inappropriate to send copies of the petition meant for Management of the University to former Vice-Chancellors and Pro Vice-Chancellors because they are not part of Management.\ndnjr | The members of the Ad-hoc Committee are grateful for the opportunity to be of service to Convocation.\nqser | Nine point zero. Appreciation\n8gam | Four. The Board of Convocation should adopt engagement with Management and other stakeholders as a first option in resolving issues rather than petitions. Petitions may, however, be considered as a last option.\nz4db | Three. Convocation may properly constitute a committee on the floor of Convocation with specific terms of reference to consider any issue(s) it deems necessary.\nlw7l | Two. The Board of Convocation should render an unqualified apology to Professor Emmanuel Kwesi Abu and Professor Samuel Kyei as well as Convocation.\n2exi | One. The Board of Convocation should officially write to withdraw the petition from Management of the University and all who were served with copies.\n16py | Based on the findings of the Ad-hoc Committee and the conclusion, it makes the following recommendations for the consideration of Convocation:\nm4ov | Eight point zero. Recommendations\n9uqd | Based on the findings of the Ad-hoc Committee the veracity and the appropriateness of the petition cannot be sustained.\n8szx | Seven point zero.

The issues have the potential to threaten the harmony, morale, and integrity of the university system and therefore deserve urgent attention.\nf56l | The following are the major issues in the petition:\nar2z | (a) Wrongful withdrawal of the promotion of a senior member whereas other unmeritorious promotions have been allowed to stay;\nyad0 | (b) Undue delay, seeming abuse of process and unfairness in the promotion of some senior members of the University;\n3g38 | (c) Breach and selective application of the criteria for appointment and promotion of some senior members;\nvtbo | (d) Unilateral appointment to positions that do not exist and without recourse to the Statutes and practices or convention in the University;\nq8pa | (e) Unfair and wrongful interpretation and application of a committee's recommendation to override the Criteria for Appointments and Promotions of Senior Members;\nuc9x | (f) Unexplained delays in the promotion of Clinicians at the School of Medical Sciences.\nzy7o | Please find the details in the attached petition. It is our expectation that the petition would be given the attention and urgency it deserves to restore calm and defuse the simmering tension in the University.\nkcar | We should be grateful to receive responses from the University Management within fourteen days to inform our next line of action.\n00aw | University of Cape Coast\n351p | Convocation of University of Cape Coast\nzzcb | Petition from the Board of Convocation on Appointments, Promotions and Related Issues\nmxnx | Introduction\n11k8 | This petition is anchored on the powers conferred on Convocation of the University of Cape Coast by statute. Thirty-nine point two (a and b) of the University of Cape Coast Statutes, twenty sixteen.\ntwwy | It is the outcome of the work of a four-member special committee constituted by the Board of Convocation to investigate and seek clarifications from University Management on individual petitions on promotion and related matters received by the Board.\nfyp8 | The impetus to form the Committee came from a groundswell of complaints regarding promotions, appointments and interpretation of the University's policies. The following are some of the complaints:\nz994 | a) Promotion of some faculty members delays unduly. The undue delays have created serious tension in the University and disaffection among many colleagues.\nvvqn | b) Faculty members of the School of Medical Sciences of the College of Health and Allied Sciences seem to be suffering from promotion-related issues. Most of them, especially Clinicians, are demotivated to work beyond their core mandate. They are not putting in their maximum effort to continue to enhance teaching and especially research, and also perform their affiliate duties at the teaching hospitals as it used to be.\np6xg | c) Promotion of scholars who have contributed to the University's Times Higher Education ranking and grooming of the Medical School to be number one in Ghana are, on the contrary, treated with disdain, particularly with regard to consideration of their promotion documents.\nbppc | d) The established norm on appointment based on seniority and experience has not been adhered to recently.\nilnw | e) The criteria for appointments and promotions has been observed to be applied selectively.\nf3rc | f) Misinterpretation of Statutes and policies by Management and Boards has become a commonplace in the University.\nd7bx | g) There are communication lapses in promotion and appointment decisions.\ngx97 | Approach Used by the Committee\nppkp | The Special Committee consulted some key stakeholders in the University, including some members of Convocation and also relied on documents received from colleagues. Some of the stakeholders consulted included the Provost of the College of Health and Allied Sciences as well as the Dean, Vice-Dean and Faculty Officer of the School of Medical Sciences.\n8br6 | Documents consulted by the Committee included the University of Cape Coast Statutes (the current Statutes and its predecessors, i.e. twenty twelve, two thousand three); Report of the Professor Yankson's Committee on Grievances of UTAG UCC and other documents.\nde3k | Issues Raised During the Interactions\n2kb3 | It was admitted that some individuals and Departments are the cause of delay in processing of promotion documents. The Faculty Members of the School of Medical Sciences, however, raised the following concerns regarding delays in processing of their promotion documents:\nlqcx | One. The time it takes to receive updates on assessment outcomes is too long; in some instances it has taken three to five years.\n3h7w | Two. There are ambiguities in communication to applicants regarding assessment results. An example of such communication is; \"Two reports received to submit two new assessors\", even when the names of assessors have been re-submitted countless times.\nth5p | Three. There are unexplained delays and lack of clarity on some decisions taken on the promotion of some colleagues at the Appointments and Promotions Board.\nb7nk | Four. The requirement for acquisition of terminal degrees before some colleagues are considered for promotion to a higher rank is unfair and a demotivation to Clinicians in the School, particularly those with Fellowship qualifications who have contributed immensely to the University's achievements.\n```",
