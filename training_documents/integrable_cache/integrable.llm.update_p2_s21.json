        "content": "y219 | Here below, we consider two different ways of breaking integrability (i.e. to induce interactions among the quasi-particles): (i) different masses, such as a diatomic arrangement whereby M sub n equals m sub one equals M over two times one minus delta, M sub n equals m sub two equals M over two times one plus delta for odd (even) n; (ii) a conservative noise through random collisions exchanging the momenta of neighboring particles at a given rate gamma. In the former (latter) case delta (gamma) plays the role of the above mentioned closeness parameter. In either case, only three conservation laws survive, momentum, energy and stretch, yielding anomalous transport and dynamical scaling. For large enough delta-values, there is overwhelming evidence that both the diatomic HPG and Toda belong to the KPZ universality class. For the randomly perturbed Toda evidence of a diverging conductivity is solid, yielding eta approximately zero point four four for a large collision rate gamma equals one.",
