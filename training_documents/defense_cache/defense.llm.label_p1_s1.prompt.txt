Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1wj6 | The role of eosinophils in host defense against helminth parasites
936l | The precise function of eosinophils in parasitic infection in vivo remains poorly understood despite eosinophils having been shown to be potent effectors in killing parasites in vitro. Although it has long been held that the primary function of the eosinophil is protection against helminth parasites, there are little data to prove this unequivocally. Moreover, eosinophils are responsible for a considerable amount of inflammatory pathology accompanying helminth infections. This article will provide an overview of our current knowledge about eosinophils and their role, both protective and patho- genetic, in parasitic helminth infections. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2004;113:30-7)
06yq | Key words: Immunity, resistance, cytotoxicity, nematodes
dpv6 | Parasitic infections are caused by unicellular protozoa or multicellular helminths (worms), the extraordinary worldwide prevalence of which exacts a major medical and economic burden. Each parasite has an exceedingly diverse and unique biology. Protozoa are usually a few micrometers in size, whereas helminths are typically cen- timeters to meters in length. Tissue-dwelling protozoa are often intracellular parasites at some stage of infection, whereas helminths, being larger than most tissue cells, are almost always extracellular pathogens, with the signifi- cant exception being Trichinella spiralis. Although proto- zoa usually replicate during infection of a single host, helminths do not reproduce without the passage through either intermediate hosts or through soil or water.
8r5j | Helminths have many developmental stages present during infection.1 In the course of a single infection, the host might be repeatedly exposed to larval-, adult-, or egg-stage antigens. For example, free-swimming cercari- ae of the trematode Schistosoma mansoni penetrate the skin of human subjects immersed in infested water and evolve into tissue-stage schistosomula that migrate to the liver and mesenteric veins for further differentiation into sexually dimorphic adult worms. Eggs are laid that migrate through tissues into the lumen of the bowel or
2taz | bladder for environmental release. Similarly, filarial infection involves repeated exposure to arthropod-borne infective larvae and parasitization by long-lived adult worms capable of continuously releasing microfilariae that circulate in the bloodstream or migrate through sub- cutaneous tissues.
o3ya | Because each stage of parasite development can be antigenically distinct, the host response to helminth infection is often characterized by a series of discrete immune responses that evolve at different times during the course of infection. Protective immunity directed against a single stage might be circumvented by parasite differentiation, assisting in the survival of the pathogen and posing a significant challenge to immune-mediated resistance. Each stage of parasite development might also entail a change in tissue trophism, introducing a compartmental feature to immune or inflammatory responses. For example, a variety of distinct cutaneous, pulmonary, and intestinal inflammatory or hyper- eosinophilic syndromes are associated with different stages of Ascaris and Strongyloides species as they migrate through the skin and lung before reaching adult- hood in the gastrointestinal tract.2
r5il | Because complex parasitic life cycles can only be main- tained by sequential passage through intermediate and definitive hosts, parasites have adapted methods of opti- mizing transmission by prolonging infection. Perhaps because of this evolutionary pressure, chronicity, latency, or both are hallmarks of helminth infections. For example, adult schistosomes and filariae can survive in host tissues for as long as 20 to 30 years, continuously producing eggs and larvae. Strongyloides species, because of their ability to "autoinfect," maintain their life cycle for decades.3 Chronicity might also reflect pressure toward "true para- sitism" in that inducing mortality in the host would disrupt parasite transmission if the host were to die before egg lay- ing or larval release could occur. Adaptations for chronic- ity can be so successful among parasites that naturally acquired protective immunity is only observed rarely in areas endemic for a given disease. Specifically, schistoso- miasis results in an incomplete form of protection in which reinfection is limited but adult worms are tolerated for years (concomitant immunity).4
5gui | Whereas pathology and protective immunity to most protozoa are believed to reflect T cell-, B cell-, and macrophage-dependent (or perhaps cytokine-mediated) mechanisms, infection with helminth parasites induces immune effector responses that are characterized by IgE

ls7d | antibody production, tissue and peripheral blood eosinophilia, and the participation of inflammatory mediator-rich tissue mast cells, qualitatively not unlike that seen in atopic diseases. For the atopic state, these responses have clearly been implicated in the pathogene- sis of allergic diseases. In parasitic infection, although these types of responses can certainly induce pathologic reactions, they have also been implicated in mediating protective immunity to the helminth parasites.5-7
tzt3 | GENERAL FEATURES OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO HELMINTHS
t8vv | Whereas the cytokine response to helminth infection is clearly more complex than initially appreciated,8 the eosinophilia and increased serum IgE levels characteris- tic of helminth infection are associated with the produc- tion of IL-4 and IL-5. The critical role of IL-5 in this eosinophilic response has been clearly demonstrated in animal models, including transgenic and knockout mice infected with a wide variety of intestinal and tissue helminths.9,10 Whereas IL-5 alone is sufficient to cause helminth infection-mediated eosinophilia and eosinophil activation in most instances, a number of other cytokines (eg, IL-4 and IL-13)11,12 and chemokines (eg, RANTES and eotaxin)13,14 appear to be necessary for the recruit- ment of eosinophils to the tissues.
qvnu | A number of transcription factors involved in the reg- ulation of IL5 gene expression, including nuclear factor (NF) IL-6 (C/EBP/B), NF-AT, and GATA-3, have been recently identified.15 At least one of these, GATA-3, appears to play a direct role in helminth-induced eosinophilia, as demonstrated by enhanced IL-5 produc- tion and eosinophilia in GATA-3-transgenic mice infect- ed with Heligosomoides polygyrus, but not in uninfected GATA-3-transgenic control mice.16 The role of other transcription factors in the eosinophilia of helminth infection remains to be explored.
kggw | Eosinophils in the blood and tissues of helminth-infect- ed patients and experimental animals exhibit morpholog- ic and functional changes associated with eosinophil acti- vation in vitro.17 These include decreased density,18,19 upregulation of surface activation molecules (eg, CD69, CD25, CD44, and HLA-DR),20 enhanced cellular cyto- toxicity, and release of granule proteins, cytokines, leukotrienes, and other mediators of inflammation.
xrd1 | The kinetics of eosinophilia after infection with any parasitic infection have been difficult to define because the time of initial infection can be defined only rarely. However, information from both single-source out- breaks21,22 and experimental human infection has shed light on the initiation of eosinophilia and its natural reg- ulation. In a study of 5 volunteers infected with the hook- worm Necatur americanus, 23 it was shown that blood eosinophil counts increased from baseline between 2 and 3 weeks after infection and peaked between weeks 7 and 9 (Fig 1). This increase was accompanied by a parallel increase in total leukocyte counts. In those exposed to lymphatic filariae,24 peak eosinophil levels occur 11 to

More interesting was a spontaneous decrease in eosinophil numbers in the absence of treatment, suggest- ing active downregulation of the eosinophilia, a process seen in other experimental volunteer infections.25,26 This active (and spontaneous) modulation of eosinophilia gen- erally occurred when migration of the larval forms ceased and the infections became patent (sexually mature adults began egg laying [eg, hookworm23 or schisto- somes]) or larval release (eg, filariae24).

4i0e | Epidemiologic evidence for the role of eosinophils in the immune response to helminth infections
h2l3 | As early as 1939, eosinophils were postulated to play a role in the immune response to helminth infection.27 Such hypotheses were based primarily on histopathologic evi- dence of eosinophils surrounding dying parasites in tissue biopsy specimens. Later, in vitro killing of parasites by eosinophils (in the presence of antibodies, complement, or both)28-30 and eosinophil granule products31,32 was demonstrated. Despite these in vitro findings and epi- demiologic evidence correlating high eosinophil counts with resistance to posttreatment reinfection with Schisto- soma haematobium and S mansoni in human sub- jects, 33,34 the in vivo role of eosinophils in immunity to helminth infection has been much more difficult to define. There has been conflicting evidence35,36 on the protective efficacy of eosinophils in animals depleted of eosinophils and subsequently challenged with a variety of parasites

xmgs | (Table II). Overall, the discrepancy seen in the various studies examining the role of eosinophils in protective immunity in different animal models of parasite infec- tions has been attributed to the redundancy of effector immune responses or to the basic differences in the ani- mal models used.37
bd9h | Animal models
m047 | Animal models of helminth infection have allowed for the assessment of the eosinophil's role in vivo. Treatment with anti-IL-5 antibody prevents the tissue and blood eosinophilia that occurs in animal models of gastrointesti- nal helminth infection.10,38 However, such treatment has not been shown to increase susceptibility to infection in murine models of T spiralis,39 Trichuris muris,40 Nip- postrongylus brasiliensis,10 H polygyrus,9 or schistosomia- sis.41 Similarly, IL-5 transgenic mice that have persistent increases of eosinophil levels do not demonstrate enhanced immunity to T spiralis or S mansoni infection. 42,43
gy8c | Eosinophils do appear to play a role in the killing of some helminths, particularly those with tissue-migratory stages. Larval stages of many of the intestinal helminths, including Strongyloides, Nippostrongylus, and Ascaris
y4mj | species, migrate through the lungs or skin on their way to the gastrointestinal tract. Although treatment with anti-IL- 5 antibody had no effect on primary infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis in mice, recovery of worms from the lungs after challenge infection was increased in anti-IL-5-treated mice compared with that in control ani- mals.44 The most conclusive in vivo evidence for the role of eosinophils in helminth killing comes from experiments with diffusion chambers containing infective Strongy- loides stercoralis larvae implanted in the subcutaneous tis- sue of mice. Not only were eosinophils the only cells that accumulated in the chamber concomitant with larval killing,45,46 but such killing could be prevented by means of inhibition of eosinophil migration into the chamber or treatment of the mice with anti-IL-5 antibody.45-47
vpgq | In Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection in mice, immature worms develop in the brain before migrating to the lungs. Prolonged survival of intracranial worms resulting in a larger parasite burden in the lungs has been demonstrated in normal mice treated with anti-IL-5 anti- body,48 as well as in IL-5 receptor «-deficient mice,49 which is again consistent with a role for eosinophils in tissue-based larval killing.
ousl | TABLE III. The role of the eosinophil in mediated pathology in selected parasitic helminth infections
m4ju | Animal models of protective immunity to the exclu- sively tissue-dwelling nematode Onchocerca species fur- ther support this hypothesis. In diffusion chamber studies of infective larval survival in immune mice, eosinophils were the only cells that accumulated in the chambers at the time of larval killing.50 Furthermore, similar to the results with Strongyloides species larvae, eosinophil lar- val contact was necessary for larval destruction to occur.50 In a different murine model system, mice infect- ed with Onchocerca lienalis depleted of eosinophils (but not macrophages or neutrophils) with mAb showed delayed clearance of primary infection and abrogation of resistance to secondary infection.51
a0mb | Overall, despite the prevailing dogma, the animal mod- els do not strongly support an indispensable role for eosinophils in immunity to most helminth parasites in vivo.
ki8m | Human studies
km8w | In human subjects with onchocerciasis, the picture is somewhat more complex. Some studies of in vitro cytokine production in response to parasite antigens have demonstrated increased levels of IL-5 production by PBMCs from putatively immune individuals living in areas endemic for onchocerciasis in comparison with infected individuals,52 whereas others have detected no difference in parasite antigen-induced IL-5 production between these groups.53 The most compelling associa- tion between eosinophilia and protective immunity in human subjects comes from the elegant posttreatment reinfection studies in schistosomiasis that demonstrated a direct relationship between the lack of reinfection and the level of peripheral blood eosinophils in patients from areas endemic for both S mansoni and S haematobium infections.33,34

Interestingly, evi- dence suggests that there might be significant differences in the susceptibility to and mechanisms of eosinophil- mediated killing between different life-cycle stages of the same parasite. 54,55 Unlike protozoa, helminths are too big to be engulfed by phagocytes and can only be killed by these cells when the latter have been activated by products of the adaptive immune response.
