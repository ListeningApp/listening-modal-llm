        "content": "9m8s | Mathematical Crystal Chemistry\n893y | Efficient heuristics have predicted many functional materials such as high-temperature superconducting hydrides, while inorganic structural chemistry explains why and how the crystal structures are stabilized. Here we develop the paired mathematical programming formalism for searching and systematizing the structural prototypes of crystals. The first is the minimization of the volume of the unit cell under the constraints of only the minimum and maximum distances between pairs of atoms. We show the capabilities of linear relaxations of inequality constraints to optimize structures by the steepest-descent method, which is computationally very efficient. The second is the discrete optimization to assign five kinds of geometrical constraints including chemical bonds for pairs of atoms. Under the constraints, the two object functions, formulated as mathematical programming, are alternately optimized to realize the given coordination numbers of atoms. This approach successfully generates a wide variety of crystal structures of oxides such as spinel, pyrochlore-o, and K2 NiF4 structures.\nfavz | Discovering advanced materials enables technological innovation in many areas such as batteries, photovoltaics, and catalysis. Since electronic structure depends on the spatial arrangements of atoms, predictions of unknown crystal structures have a major impact on the discovery of better materials. However, computational structure searching is still difficult despite the progress of computational power, since structure prediction is a large-scale nonconvex minimization problem of the total energy, which has a large number of local minima, concerning the atomic arrangement and crystal lattice.\n7szx | Finding the global minimum essentially involves visiting every local minimum, but some heuristic approaches with more or less intelligent ways such as evolutionary algorithms and particle swarm-intelligence approach have predicted novel materials including binary hydrides that have been experimentally synthesized as high-temperature superconductors under high pressure. The drawbacks of these methods are that there are no guarantees that the most stable structure are found, and similarly, they can miss synthesizable unique structures. Furthermore, they cannot explain why and how the predicted structures are stabilized. This is also true of the deep learning approach and the random structure searching methods, while the latter may lead to peculiar structures without a priori knowledge.\nhx9e | The integer programming approach has been developed to deterministically find the lowest energy structure with guarantees. The global optimum of integer programming can be found deterministically by brute force with branch-and-cut algorithms that are capable of rapidly eliminating large parts of the optimization\nywn2 | tion domain from consideration. To apply this universal method, all the atoms are placed at discrete positions within a fixed cubic unit cell, and the total energy is represented by the sum of two-body classical interaction potentials. This approach has successfully found complex crystals such as garnet structure, but the fixed unit cells and approximated total energies may limit its applicability. Instead of using approximated total energies, geometrical approaches may be effective to search crystal structures, for example, Yokoyama et al. have developed the dual periodic graph approach to generate structures composed of space-filling polyhedra.\na63r | Important structural principles for ionic crystals have been summarized by Pauling in the five rules. George et al. have shown the limited predictive power of the Pauling rules since a few oxides simultaneously satisfy them, but the rules offer the basic concepts for inorganic structural chemistry. For example, the crystal structures of oxides, chalcogenides, and mixed anion compounds are linked polyhedra with explicit chemical bonds, especially between anions and cations. Anions such as oxygen prefer to constitute the Barrow packings, which are the densest packings of spheres, and small cations are placed in the tetrahedral and octahedral sites, while large cations typically have a coordination number greater than six, and in some cases, constitutes the Barrow packings with anions. Small and large cations generally behave as hard and soft spheres, respectively. Highly polar bonds do not favor edge-sharing polyhedra and especially face-sharing polyhedra because of the increased electrostatic repulsion between central atoms.\ndqvj | The structure of amorphous semiconductors is well represented by continuous random network models which require a condition that each atom should satisfy fully its bonding needs. Two atoms interact only if they are explicitly bonded, and the total energy is given\nr17u | by the Keating potential. The network is reproduced periodically by bond transpositions accepted with the Metropolis acceptance probability, conserving four coordination. This approach can generate structurally and electronically good structures comparable with experiments from random initial structures.\n3c47 | In this study, we propose a paired mathematical programming approach that finds candidate structures of crystals satisfying a series of empirical rules. The first is the minimization problem of the volume of the unit cell within the constraints of minimum and maximum distances between pairs of atoms. The constraints represent linked polyhedra and simultaneously the packings of anionic spheres regardless of the kinds of chemical bonds. We approximate the inequality constraints as the linear potentials for the structural relaxation. The second is the maximization problem of the number of chemical bonds. The five kinds of geometrical constraints, which impose restrictions on the distances between every pair of atoms, are assigned by the network of chemical bonds. The two optimization problems are alternately solved to find a proper structure where every cation satisfies its bonding needs; the transpositions of geometrical constraints transform random initial structures into linked polyhedra as the sillium approach for amorphous silicons. We define a feasible solution as a structure satisfying all the constraints in the two optimization problems and all the bonding needs of atoms, and the other cases are denoted as infeasible solution. An optimal solution in this study is defined to be the feasible solution whose volume of the unit cell is minimized. The paired mathematical programming we propose is an efficient method which tries to find the optimal solution for a model system with a given composition.\ng345 | Let us start our discussion by introducing the first object function in the paired mathematical programming formalism. The geometrical constraints are composed of the minimum and maximum distances between pairs of atoms. Suppose xi is the cartesian coordinate of atom i, and rijT is the distances between atoms i and jT given by\nsvhz | (one) where the atom jT corresponds to the atom j with the translational vector T of the crystal lattice. The object function is the volume ยง of the unit cell. The mathematical programming is given by\noaen | CijT equals x sub i plus T minus x sub i,\n5u67 | minimize ยง\ndvms | subject to xijT greater than or equal to d min dijT,\nqrd3 | (two) xijT less than or equal to d max\nrxrg | where dijT min and d max lijT are the minimum and maximum distances between atoms i and jT, respectively. This model finds structural candidates of crystals without calculating the total energies.\ntf43 | To solve the problem, the equality and inequality constraints are relaxed as follows: The constraint of minimum distance between atoms i and jT:\nfcco | KijT greater than or equal to d min,\n8uji | is relaxed to the hard-spherical potential Umin xijT defined to be\ndf3e | Umin equals To open bracket negative k i open parenthesis Cir minus d min close parenthesis\n53eu | CijT less than dijT min bijT less than WijT VI\na5u1 | , (four)\nry7u | where k y is a common constant for the minimum constraints. Similarly, the constraint of maximum distance between atoms i and jT:\n5mda | CijT less than or equal to d max.",
