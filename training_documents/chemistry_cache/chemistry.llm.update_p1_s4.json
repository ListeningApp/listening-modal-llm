The electrodes are obtained using silver nanoparticles, silver bromide, potassium bromide suspended in tetrahydrofuran solution of polyvinyl chloride and bis(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate and deposited on silver substrate, or another substrate covered with silver, by drop casting. After a short period of soaking in a potassium bromide solution, stable and reproducible formal potentials of negative one hundred fifty-seven plus or minus two millivolts were observed, and the solid-contact reference electrodes were ready to use. It is shown that the described reference electrodes are relatively insensitive to the changes in the sample matrix, the concentrations of ions, the pH and the redox potential. These electrodes can also be fabricated in miniaturized form, and thus used to produce miniaturized multielectrode probes.\n9own | The application of a conducting polymer as a solid contact for ion-selective electrodes with polymeric membranes has opened a new avenue in potentiometry. Different all-solid-state indicator and reference electrodes have since then been reported, and interest in solid contact ion-selective electrodes is a mainstream of potentiometry today. Solid contact reference electrodes, owing to their high metrological demands and distinctively different design techniques, occupy a know-how niche of their own.\nbqfb | A significant technical challenge is in selecting the materials and procedures that would be compatible in production for both solid contact ion-selective electrodes and solid contact reference electrodes. In the case of all-solid-state polyvinyl chloride electrodes, obviously advantageous would be the application of the same material, for example, conducting polymer and polyvinyl chloride. Some benefits can be gained by using organic salts and ionic liquids dispersed in polyvinyl chloride or inorganic salts in inert polymer binders. So far, the electrochemical mechanism of all-solid-state reference electrodes is not sufficiently elucidated, which prompts the researcher to use trial-error methods. A general electrochemical rationale points to a condition of the equitransferent liquid junctions. However, in the case solid contact reference electrodes, one has the asymmetric junction between the solid contact and solution, and applicability of the equitransferent condition is challenged. To understand the mechanism of solid contact reference electrodes, the concept of pseudoreference electrode and a \"stable-in-a matrix\" diffusion potential can be useful, but it appears that a more comprehensive interpretation is needed. At the moment though, further developments primarily depend on the practical purpose, the scope of applications and technical inventiveness.\nwwdt | For both theoretical and practical reasons, the most popular reference electrodes are silver chloride electrode systems used in different configurations. An inventive approach was the introduction of a composite membrane made of polyvinyl acetate containing a very large loading of potassium chloride. Very recently,\nmn1r | polypropylene has been successfully used as the binding polymer for the same purpose with the advantage of production by injection molding. In this report, we show that a composite based on polyvinyl chloride membrane containing nanoparticles of silver, silver bromide, potassium bromide, and potassium bromoargentates allows the design of a solid-contact reference electrode. In general, even the conventional silver/silver bromide electrodes are rarely used and, to our knowledge, the system reported has never been explicitly described.\n5vqw | Our technical note sees an avenue for a new class of the reference electrodes with heterogeneous membranes. We show that, by conventional drop casting, it is possible to obtain all-solid-state reference electrodes coupled with excellent analytical properties.\nmeyw | EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\n2e62 | Reagents. Bis(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate, tetrabutylammonium tetrabutylborate, and polyvinyl chloride high molecular weight were purchased from Fluka. Silver nanowires of diameter one hundred seventy-five nanometers times L twenty-fifty micrometers as zero point five percent suspension in isopropanol obtained from Sigma-Aldrich were used as received. Tetrahydrofuran purchased from Sigma-Aldrich was distilled before use.\n75y3 | The other compounds used were obtained as p.a. form POCh, Poland and Merck, Germany and used as received. The gases were obtained from Linde Gas, Poland.\ns2g2 | Water redistilled from quartz was used to prepare the solutions. All solutions with concentrations lower than zero point zero one molar were prepared just before use.\nq1q2 | Preparation of Reference Electrode Cocktails. Silver bromide was precipitated from three molar silver nitrate with the three molar potassium bromide solution. Precipitated salt was filtered\ncb7r | Analytical Chemistry\n68xu | (without washing) and dried at one hundred degrees Celsius. Potassium bromide p.a. was dried at three hundred degrees Celsius and ground to a fine powder. Next, silver bromide and potassium bromide were mixed in molar ratio one to five, and the mixture was thoroughly ground again and exposed to light to allow for photochemical decomposition of silver bromide. The presence of metallic silver nanoparticles was proved by XPS and XRD analysis. Bis(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate and polyvinyl chloride of total mass three point three grams and thirty-five to fifty weight percent of polyvinyl chloride were dissolved in twenty-five milliliters of freshly distilled tetrahydrofuran.\nhd35 | Three types of the solutions containing bromide salts (cocktails) were used.\n2zpk | The first contained zero point three three six grams of silver bromide/potassium bromide in one point five milliliters of the solution. This cocktail (owing to the small amount of silver nanoparticles produced during the photochemical reaction) is depicted and referred to below as \"REF-Br-photo\".\nepu7 | The third type of reference cocktail contained an additional amount of metallic silver formed during the redox reaction of silver bromide with reducing agent, for example, tetrabutylammonium tetrabutylborate. To prepare this cocktail, tetrabutylammonium tetrabutylborate was added to the solution containing the silver bromide/potassium bromide suspension. The amount of tetrabutylammonium tetrabutylborate introduced to one point five milliliters of suspension containing zero point three three six grams silver bromide/potassium bromide was varied from one to twenty-five milligrams. After tetrabutylammonium tetrabutylborate addition, the cocktail color changed from light yellow to dark brown owing to the formation of metallic silver, as proved by XPS. The reference membranes prepared from such cocktails are called \"REF-Br-QB\".\n7od1 | Regarding the major components, the typical composition of the above three membranes used in our studies was (in percent weight/weight): fifteen point two (silver bromide), forty-seven point eight (potassium bromide), twenty-three point one (bis(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate), and thirteen point nine (polyvinyl chloride).\n0bqy | Preparation of the Reference Electrodes. Before membrane casting, each cocktail was vigorously mixed and a cloudy mixture of one hundred to two hundred microliters was deposited on the silver substrate as well as on the glassy carbon or the gold substrate covered with silver and (for comparison) on the pure glassy carbon or gold. The electrodeposition of a silver layer on the glassy carbon or gold substrates was done in zero point zero five molar silver nitrate solution using an Autolab PGSTAT-one hundred Analyzer in the three-electrode electrochemical cell. The silver chloride electrode with a bridge filled with the one molar potassium nitrate solution was used as the reference electrode. A platinum sheet with an area of about two square centimeters was used as an auxiliary electrode. The deposition potential was adjusted to a current density of one point five to three milliamps per square centimeter and a typical deposition time was one thousand seconds.\n```",
