        "content": "wtfz | We define strategic leadership as setting long-term direction, thinking broadly about the organization, seeking ways to grow the business, aligning people with the vision and strategy and the like. We define operational leadership as focusing on short-term results, getting involved in operational detail, being grounded in the realities of implementing strategy, using processes to keep people on track and so on.\nqy1i | The two balances seem to complement each other: The strategic-operational duality describes what managers work on; the forceful-enabling duality describes how they go about it.\n1k9e | These two essential pairs are tacitly understood, if not fully formulated, by most managers. Indeed, leadership experts have long made similar distinctions in the literature. Forceful and enabling, for example, are our terms (actually, the language that managers use) for a distinction that has been made repeatedly\n5bjs | over the last fifty years - autocratic and participative, initiating structure and consideration, \"command and control\" and employee-centered. Yet the models in common use today - called competency models - often consist of long, unmemorable lists of skills and personal qualities not generally grouped in pairwise fashion. Therefore, these models miss the chance to identify lopsidedness, in our view the most common impediment to developing effective leadership. Our position is based on the essentially two-sided nature of leadership: For every truth there is an equal and opposing truth, and leadership models are more useful for respecting that reality.\nuodj | Identifying Lopsided Leadership\nk16v | For an assessment tool to diagnose lack of balance, or lopsidedness, it must be able to measure overdoing, something that commonly used performance-rating scales typically do not do. Rather, they reinforce the \"more is better\" view by attempting to measure either how often the manager engages in the behavior (for example, a five-point \"extent\" scale that ranges from \"not at all\" to \"to a very great extent\") or how well the manager performs a given task or behavior (for example, on a five-point scale that ranges from \"ineffective\" to \"outstanding\"). Since it is assumed that higher ratings on these scales indicate proficiency or mastery, there is no distinction drawn between \"very often\" and \"too often,\" nor any recognition of the possibility that a manager could possess too much of a desired quality.\nb2lm | What is needed, then, is a way of measuring leadership that allows for the possibility, in fact the reality, that sub-par managerial performance can result not only from a deficiency of certain skills and behaviors, but also from an excess of them as well. Aristotle made this deceptively simple truth central to his \"Ethics.\" He thought of virtue, or efficacy, as the midpoint between excess and deficiency. To measure performance in accordance with this old and worthy idea, we need only employ a rating scale that allows raters to distinguish between too little, the right amount and too much.\nti7f | We built such a scale into our Leadership Versatility Index, a three hundred sixty-degree questionnaire that we have used for ten years. In addition to identifying deficiency and sufficiency, the assessment tool also captures an executive's tendency to take things to an extreme. The rating scale's ability to capture overdoing on a single dimension like forceful leadership can in turn help identify an imbalance on a duality such as forceful-enabling.\noksu | Using an early version of the Leadership Versatility Index, we constructed two statistically sound scales, one to measure forceful leadership and the other for enabling leadership (for example, \"Makes tough calls\" versus \"Compassionate,\" \"Makes judgments\" versus \"Shows appreciation,\" \"Forces issues\" versus \"Fosters harmony\"). When we studied a sample of one hundred seven U.S. executives by soliciting ratings from them and one thousand thirty-six of their coworkers - superiors, peers\nwtow | and direct reports - we found, as expected, a strong inverse relationship between the two scales. That is, the more forceful managers are, the less enabling they are and vice versa. Thus, many managers do not move freely between opposing modes; they show a bias in favor of one mode and a prejudice against its complement.\no22k | The Lopsided Leader One of the most common patterns in leadership is an overbalance toward being forceful and away from being enabling. There are many variations to this theme. Some individuals are aggressive to the point of being abrasive and abusive. Others take so much responsibility that they crowd out their own staff. Still others are so focused on having their own unit, an extension of themselves, perform exceptionally well that they do not cooperate with peers and even have contentious relationships with them. Although it is less common, the converse pattern also occurs with regularity - an overreliance on enabling behaviors and an underreliance on forceful ones. Some managers are such good listeners, facilitators and consensus builders that their people don't know what they stand for. Other managers are so\nnwfz | The Virtues and Vices of Leadership Styles\nnvfy | Taking one leadership approach to the extreme while giving its complement short shrift leads to imbalance and ineffectiveness. The versatile, and therefore effective, leader can draw upon the virtuous aspects of each approach to suit the circumstances at hand. Below is a partial list of the virtues and vices associated with each of leadership's dominant dualities - forceful-enabling and strategic-operational.\nmror | respectful of other people and so afraid of imposing their ideas on them that they fail to assert themselves. Others have such great faith in people and their potential to develop that they are painfully slow to act on performance problems.\nzlxc | The Versatile Leader Versatility - which is the absence of imbalance - is also most usefully defined in terms of pairs of opposing qualities and skills. Versatile leaders are able to continually adjust their behavior, deftly applying the right approach, to the right degree, for the circumstances at hand. These are people who can pivot readily from forcing a tough issue to fostering harmony, from holding a blue-sky session to digging into an immediate problem. In that way, the virtues of each approach are maximized and its potential liabilities are avoided. It may be advantageous to be exceptionally directive or tough, for example, in a turnaround or crisis, but the same approach may be counterproductive in the early stages of negotiating a strategic alliance. Unfortunately, versatility is in short supply. Our research revealed that not even one in five leaders qualifies as versatile.\nk0bw | Because the two sets of leadership skills in a duality comprise opposite approaches, managers can experience tension between them or even see them as contradictory or incompatible. The challenge for the versatile leader is thus to meet what F. Scott Fitzgerald called \"the test of a first-rate intelligence\": to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function. That challenge is all the greater, given that most leaders will have to overcome their bias in favor of one of the ideas and against the other. This notion of versatility is not to be mistaken as moderation in all things. It simply denotes a wide and flexible range of behaviors, which can indeed include immoderate behavior when extreme circumstances require it.",
