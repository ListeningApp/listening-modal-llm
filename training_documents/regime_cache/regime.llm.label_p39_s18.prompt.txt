You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

Computing the optimal value <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star }</LATEX> defined in (3.13) requires computing the second-order response, as discussed in Section 3.3. In particular, this is done by using the recursive expression (2.25), obtained from the Fokker-Planck equation via formal asymptotics. We reformulate (2.25) for Feynman- Kac systems to compute the second-order response, using that, in view of (A.3),
m1hx | <LATEX>\bar { \psi } _ { 2 , \alpha } = \left( - \mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } \right) ^ { \dagger } \left[ \left( \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } ^ { \dagger } + \alpha \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { e x t r a } } ^ { \dagger } \right) \bar { \psi } _ { 1 } - \bar { \lambda } _ { 2 , \alpha } \psi _ { 0 } \right] ,</LATEX> where the value of <LATEX>\bar { \lambda } _ { 2 , \alpha }</LATEX> is determined by (A.5). This procedure could be extended to arbitrary orders by identifying terms with the same orders in <LATEX>\eta</LATEX> in (A.1).

xz5d | the density of the invariant probability measure for the systems at hand, namely over- damped Langevin dynamics in one and two dimensions, and Langevin dynamics in one dimension. This approach can be straightforwardly extended to solving Poisson equations with nontrivial right-hand sides such as (2.23) or the integrand in the as- ymptotic variance (2.43). We start each section by first discussing the discretizations associated with the equilibrium dynamics, after which we mention the modification needed when adding perturbations.
erwx | For all systems, the spatial domain, namely the torus Td = [0, 1)d, is discretized into ma points with uniform step size hq = 1/mq in each direction. While Vn denotes the invariant measure at the continuous level, we use th to denote its discretized counterpart, namely the approximations of the values of Un at the grid points.
ie7i | B.1. Overdamped Langevin dynamics. For a continuous function u: T -> R, we denote by [u]¿ = u(Qi), where Qi = ihq are the mesh points. Similarly, for a continuous function u: T2 -> R, we denote by [u]i,j = u(Qi,j), where Qi,j = (ihq, jhq) are the mesh points. The Fokker-Planck equation to discretize for the overdamped Langevin dynamics (2.11) reads
aksw | (B.1) [ % = div (V /0) + =AV0 = VTV1/0 + AV 40 + -A40.
0fsl | Using centered finite differences, the discretization of (B.1) in dimension one is given by

xs3r | Periodic boundary conditions are imposed, i.e. [b]o = [40]ma. In two dimensions, applying centered finite differences to the Fokker-Planck (B.1) yields
ffuj | [Og1 V]i,j [4]i+ 1] - [V]i-1] 2hg + [0q2 V]i,j [V]i, j+1 - [V]i,j-] + [AV], [V]i, j 2hg

t74k | Periodic boundary conditions are imposed, i.e. [V]o,: = [V]mq; and [],0 = [4];mg.
qdn7 | Discretization of perturbations. We now consider several classes of perturbation operators. One typical form is L = FTV, with F = (F1, F2) E R2 for two-dimensional dynamics. Its L2-adjoint acts as
dib4 | (B.3) Etyo = - div(F)vo - FT Vyo.
yvqj | Perturbations of this form include the physical perturbations Lphys considered through- out this work, divergence-free vector fields (3.5), and the differential term in the Feynman-Kac forcing (3.9). In dimension one, the-right hand side of (B.3) is dis- cretized with a centered finite difference as
vz2f | - [F][ V] - [F] [b]i+1 -[b]i-1 2hg .

clwo | Another example is the modified fluctuation-dissipation perturbation (3.8), pre- ceeded by a factor on as presented in this work. Since it corresponds to the gener- ator (2.12) of the dynamics at hand, its discretization corresponds in any dimension to rescaling the discretized Fokker-Planck by (1 + an).
aki1 | We also consider zero order operators, such as the source term for the Feynman- Kac forcing (3.9), namely TVV. As terms of this form include no differential oper- ators acting on yo, their discretization is trivially done, in any dimension, by direct evaluation, e.g. [V] [V] in dimension one.
vf5h | B.2. Langevin 1D. For the one-dimensional Langevin dynamics, we discretize the unbounded momentum space as follows: we first truncate it to [-Pmax, Pmax], then discretize it into mp interior points with uniform step size hp = 2pmax/(mp -1). For a continuous function u: Tx R -> R, we denote by [u]i,j = u(Qi, Pj), where Qi = ihq and Pj = jhp are the mesh points.
l51p | The numerical scheme for the Fokker-Planck equation (2.17) for Langevin dy- namics is obtained with centered finite differences, except for the transport term pr M-1Vqyo, where an upwind scheme is used (see below for details). In dimension one, (2.17) reads
s9zz | (B.4) Lov = - Cham v + Y (M-14) + M-1 pap4 + B-1024).
x97k | The discretization of (B.4) then reads

lw7l | Periodic boundary conditions are imposed on the positions, i.e. [4],] = [V]mq; ] for any 1 ≤ j ≤mp.
2exi | Discretization of perturbations. For Langevin dynamics, perturbations of the form (B.3) can correspond to differential operators acting on the positions or mo- menta, i.e. FTVq and FTVp. In dimension one, these options reduce to - Fogo and - FOpyo, both of which are trivially discretized with centered finite differences.
16py | For the modified fluctuation-dissipation in p, its discretization corresponds to scaling the LFD term in (2.16) by (y + an). For its position counterpart -8-1
m4ov | q its discretization corresponds to adding (B.2), scaled by on.

iwdc | Upwind scheme for Langevin. We now motivate the upwinding used to discretize the transport term <LATEX>p ^ { T } M ^ { - 1 } \nabla _ { q }</LATEX> in the Fokker-Planck equation (2.17). In particular, the use of a centered finite difference with an even number of points <LATEX>m _ { q }</LATEX> in the spa- tial domain would lead to independent submeshes, and hence might give incorrect results, an issue known as odd-even decoupling (see [45] for a thorough discussion). To overcome this, one resorts to decentered finite differences, in particular upwinding.
4vks | Recall that equation (2.3) can be seen as the stationary solution to the evolution PDE <LATEX>\partial _ { t } \psi = \mathcal{L} ^ { \dagger } \psi .</LATEX> To implement the upwinding scheme, we write the transport term in the Fokker-Planck in the form of the advection equation, that is
uyaf | <LATEX>\partial _ { t } \psi + p ^ { T } M ^ { - 1 } \nabla _ { q } \psi = 0 .</LATEX> The scheme used to discretize the components of <LATEX>\nabla _ { q } \psi</LATEX> depends on the sign of the components <LATEX>o f \quad p .</LATEX> The (partial) derivative is discretized with a scheme decentered on the left when <LATEX>p \geqslant 0 ,</LATEX> and decentered on the right when <LATEX>p \leqslant 0 .</LATEX> The discretization of <LATEX>p \partial _ { q } \psi</LATEX> in dimension one at a mesh point <LATEX>\left( Q _ { i } , P _ { j } \right)</LATEX> is therefore done as follows:
d1qh | <LATEX>\left\{ \begin{array}{} p \frac { \left[ \Psi _ { 0 } ^ { h } \right] _ { i + 1 , j } - \left[ \Psi _ { 0 } ^ { h } \right] _ { i , j } } { h _ { q } } , & p < 0 , \\ p \frac { \left[ \Psi _ { 0 } ^ { h } \right] _ { i , j } - \left[ \Psi _ { 0 } ^ { h } \right] _ { i - 1 , j } } { h _ { a } } , & p > 0 . \end{array} \right.</LATEX> Acknowledgments.
