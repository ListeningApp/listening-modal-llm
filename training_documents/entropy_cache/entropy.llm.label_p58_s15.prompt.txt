You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

k38m | Thanks to this, if we have a system whose space of states is <LATEX>\mathbb{R} ^ { n }</LATEX> and its energy function <LATEX>E : \mathbb{R} ^ { n } \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</LATEX> is a positive definite quadratic form, we can compute
nkj9 | <LATEX>\langle E \rangle = \frac { \int _ { \mathbb{R} ^ { n } } E \left( x \right) \exp \left( - \beta E \left( x \right) \right) d x } { \int _ { \mathbb{R} ^ { n } } \exp \left( - \beta E \left( x \right) \right) d x }</LATEX> by reducing it to the previous case using a change of variables. We get
35a8 | <LATEX>\langle E \rangle = \frac { 1 } { 2 } n k T</LATEX> 51
337o | So, each degree of freedom still contributes akT to the expected energy. That's the equipartition theorem!
cuth | But be careful. The equipartition theorem doesn't apply when the energy is an arbitrary function of n variables. It also fails when we switch from classical to quantum statistical mechanics.
09z2 | People sometimes memorize the conclusion of the equipartition theorem, E = 2nkT, without learning that it holds only for classical systems whose energy is a positive def- inite quadratic form. These people sometimes get fooled into thinking (E) is always proportional to T. Some of these poor benighted souls go around saying that temper- ature is just a measure of energy per degree of freedom. This completely ignores the subtlety of the concept of temperature.
13fv | As we've seen, the truly general relation between temperature and energy, for sys- tems in thermal equilibrium, also involves entropy:
v5pj | TdS = d(E).
trab | 52
grxs | THE AVERAGE ENERGY OF AN ATOM
u9dn | Since an atom of helium gas can move in 3 directions, and its energy depends quadratically on its velocity and not on position, the equipartition theorem says that classically its expected energy should be
t25w | (E) = - kT 2 3
x62u | where T is temperature and k is Boltzmann's constant, about 1.38 . 10-23 joules/kelvin.
aoc8 | So, heating an atom of helium gas 1 â„ƒ should take
3mdu | 3
m04v | x 1.38 . 10-23 joules = 2.07 . 10-23 joules
3aip | 2
q3gu | This is very close to the truth.
txab | We can finally start reaping the rewards of all our thoughts about entropy! The equipartition theorem lets us estimate how much energy it takes to heat up one atom of helium one degree Celsius. And it works!
dov0 | Of course we don't heat up an individual atom: we heat up a bunch. A mole of helium is about 6.02 . 1023 atoms, so heating up a mole of helium one degree Celsius (= 1 kelvin) should take about
xd5o | 6.02 . 1023 x 2.07 . 10-23 ~ 12.46 joules
3gny | And this is very close to correct! It seems the experimentally measured answer is 12.6 joules.
ws73 | What are the sources of error? Most importantly, our calculation neglects the interaction between helium atoms. Luckily this is very small at standard temperature and pressure. We're also neglecting quantum mechanics. Luckily for helium this too gives only small corrections at standard temperature and pressure.
vyos | It's important here that helium is a monatomic gas. In hydrogen, which is a diatomic gas, we get extra energy because this molecule can tumble around, not just move along. We'll try that next.
w4hq | 53
ghbe | THE ENERGY OF HYDROGEN
1lkf | If we treat a molecule of hydrogen as a dumbbell whose position takes 3 numbers and whose axis whose takes 2 numbers to describe, we can try to use the equipartition theorem to estimate its expected energy as
uobn | (E) = - kT 5
3194 | where T is temperature and k = 1.38 . 10-23 joules/kelvin.
r22o | In this approximation, heating a molecule of hydrogen gas 1 kelvin takes
nupw | 2 x 1.38 . 10-23 joules = 3.45 . 10-23 joules
37xs | In reality it takes 3.39 . 10-23 joules at standard temperature and pressure. Not bad!
hoi0 | A molecule of hydrogen gas is a blurry quantum thing, but let's pretend it's a classical solid dumbbell that can move and tumble but not spin around its axis. Then it has 3+2 = 5 degrees of freedom, and we can use the equipartition theorem to estimate its energy.
tffb | For T significantly less than 6000 kelvin, hydrogen molecules don't vibrate with the two atoms moving toward and away from each other. They don't spin around their axis until even higher temperatures. But they tumble like a dumbbell as soon as T exceeds about 90 kelvin.
ewwt | We need quantum mechanics to compute these things. But at room temperature and pressure, we can pretend a hydrogen gas is made of classical solid dumbbells that can move around and tumble but not spin around their axes! In this approximation the equipartition theorem tells us (E) = 5kT.
2tj1 | This is fine as far as it goes-but our goal in this course is to compute the entropy of hydrogen. We'll start with a useful warmup: the classical harmonic oscillator.

w251 | ENTROPY OF THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR: 1
1vgx | A classical harmonic oscillator has energy
yjnk | = p2 kg2
9zmh | 2m
mi3g | where q is its position, p its momentum, m its mass and Â« its spring constant.
ntjg | By the equipartition theorem, in thermal equilibrium at temperature T it has expected energy (E) = kT where k is Boltzmann's constant.
86at | So, using d(E) = TdS, its entropy is
bpd2 | S=Jas- Ja = k | -k(In
hkd8 | Since this does not approach 0 as T -> 0 from above, the Third Law of Thermodynamics doesn't hold for the classical harmonic oscillator.
sptg | But what is this constant C'? For that we must think harder.
2k40 | What's the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium? Using the equipartition theorem and the formula d(E) = TdS, we can show it's
krk7 | So, the entropy grows logarithmically with temperature. And it does not go to zero as T approaches zero: instead, it goes to negative infinity. So the Third Law of Thermo- dynamics does not hold for the classical harmonic oscillator!
4tyc | That may seem shocking, but it actually makes sense. The Third Law holds only for certain special systems. Furthermore, we've seen that the entropy of a sharply peaked probability distribution on a continuous state space is negative. We'll see that the Boltzmann distribution for the classical oscillator gets more and more sharply peaked near q = p = 0 as the temperature approaches zero from above. So in fact, it makes perfect sense that the entropy approaches -0.
2mjl | However, the classical harmonic oscillator is just an approximation to the quantum harmonic oscillator, which does obey the Third Law. It's a good approximation at high temperatures, but bad at low temperatures. In fact, this business of negative entropies at low temperature is not something that happens in the real world. It's just a defect of classical mechanics. It's trying to tell us that quantum mechanics is better.
6d9q | Another point: you'll have noticed that constant C here. What is it? We can make progress with a bit of dimensional analysis. The quantity ln T is a funny thing: if we change our units of temperature, it doesn't get multiplied by a constant factor, the way
wsc1 | 55
or3l | physical quantities usually do. It changes by adding a constant! So k In T doesn't have dimensions of entropy. But
fbyc | must have dimensions of entropy. The constant C must somehow save the day! How does that work? Let's see.
vceo | 56
kd78 | ENTROPY OF THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR: 2
896u | Classically, a harmonic oscillator at temperature T has entropy
o0si | S = k(ln T + C) Writing C = - In(To) for some constant To, this gives S = k ln(T /T0) Dimensional analysis implies T0 must have units of temperature!
1fx8 | But what is this temperature T0? For that we must think harder.
tfms | The formula S = k(ln T + C) is a bit scary from the viewpoint of dimensional analysis. We usually avoid working with the logarithm of a dimensionful quantity, like ln T, because it transforms in a funny way when we change our units. But if we write C = - In To then we get S = kln(T/To), and we see the solution to our problem! If To has units of temperature, then T/To is dimensionless, so In(T/To) doesn't change at all when we change our units. In other words: now ln(T/T0) is dimensionless, so S = k ln(T/T0) has units of entropy as it should.
pfv5 | So, the constant C must equal - In To for some temperature To that we can compute for any harmonic oscillator. What is it? We could just compute it. But it's more fun to use dimensonal analysis.
8gxa | What could it depend on? Obviously the mass m, the spring constant k and Boltz- mann's constant k. But there's no way to form a quantity with units of temperature from just m, k and k. So we need an extra ingredient.
fsvi | And we've seen this already: to define the entropy of a probability distribution on the q, p plane and get something with the right units, we need a quantity with units of action! The obvious candidate is Planck's constant h, and this is actually right. The entropy we're after is given by an integral with respect to dp dq/h where h = h/2T. So the temperature To can depend on h as well as m, k and k.
068d | We can compute a quantity with units of temperature from m, k, k and h. The frequency of our oscillator is w = k/m, and it's a famous fact that he has units of energy. k has units of energy/temperature ... so hw/k has units of temperature!
ysz7 | Thus, our temperature To must be hw/k times some dimensionless purely mathe- matical constant, which I'll call 1/a. a must be something like 7 or 2, or if we're really unlucky, e666 - though in practice we usually get numbers fairly close to 1, not huge or tiny numbers.
k5db | So, the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator must be
7jzh | S = kln(T/To) =kln(akT/hw).
vm00 | This is far as I can get without breaking down and doing some real work. Later we will compute Q.

ypz9 | ENTROPY OF THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR: 3
mpml | We've seen a classical harmonic oscillator with frequency w has entropy
imnm | S = kln(akT/hw) when it's in thermal equilibrium at temperature T.
8na8 | Here k is Boltzmann's constant, h is Planck's constant,
ul2a | and o is some dimensionless mathematical constant. We'll figure it out later.
4eaf | Even though we don't know o, this formula is already very interesting! kT is known to be the typical energy scale of thermal fluctuations at temperature T. hw is the spacing between energy levels of a quantum harmonic oscillator with frequency w. The ratio kT/hw is therefore roughly the number of energy eigenstates in which we may find a quantum harmonic oscillator with high probability when it's at temperature T.
4b6k | Thus, S is roughly k times the logarithm of the number of states that we're likely to find a quantum harmonic oscillator in, when it's at temperature T. This may seem mysterious. After all, we weren't trying to do quantum mechanics, much less count quantum states. But there are other examples of this pattern, where the entropy of a classical system in thermal equilibrium at temperature T is roughly k times the logarithm of the number of quantum states that are accessible at temperature T.
hxiu | We'll learn a bit more about this later, when we relate entropy to something called the 'partition function', which can be understood as the 'number of acccessible states'. This viewpoint will also explain the constant Q. But now let's calculate this constant.

nf6a | A classical harmonic oscillator has energy
5g96 | p, q) = 2 + Kg2 2m
d1y5 | where p is its momentum, q its position, m its mass and Â« its spring constant.
rl20 | At temperature T, the probability density of its momentum and position is the Boltzmann distribution:
t91r | e-BE(p,q) p(p,q) =

zhvt | Last time we found a formula for the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator ... which includes a mysterious purely mathematical dimensionless constant Q. Now let's figure out a.
yv1q | We'll grit our teeth and actually do the integral needed to calculate the entropy-but only in one easy case! Combining this with our formula, we'll get a.
u7jx | First, recall the basics. The energy E(p, q) of our harmonic oscillator at momentum p and position q determines its Boltzmann distribution at temperature T, which I'll call p(p, q) now since the letter p is already being used. Integrating -pln p using the measure dp dq/h we get the Shannon entropy. In physics we multiply this by Boltzmann's constant k to get the Gibbs entropy.

vlyz | We can choose units of length, time, mass and temperature to make a classical harmonic oscillator's mass m, its spring constant K, Boltzmann's constant k and Planck's constant h all equal 1.

ri4s | Let's do this integral!
2j8o | Let's compute the Boltzmann distribution p(p, q) and the entropy S. To keep the formulas clean, we'll work in units where m = K = k = h =1, and compute everything at one special temperature: T = 1.
qrl1 | In this setup h = 27, and
uvvk | e-BE(p,q) =e-(p2+q2)/2
mdnj | is a beautiful Gaussian with integral
