You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

pn9j | Large Kinetic Isotope Effects in Methane Oxidation Catalyzed by Methane Monooxygenase: Evidence for C-H Bond Cleavage in a Reaction Cycle Intermediate+
1pmc | ABSTRACT: The reduced hydroxylase component (MMOH) of soluble methane monooxygenase (MMO) from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b reacts with <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> and CH4 to produce CH3OH and H2O in a single- turnover reaction. Transient kinetic analysis of this reaction has revealed at least five and probably six intermediates during the turnover [Lee, S .- K., Nesheim, J. C., & Lipscomb, J. D. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 21569-21577; Liu, Y., Nesheim, J. C., Lee, S .- K., & Lipscomb, J. D. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 24662-24665]. One intermediate, termed compound Q, reacts with CH4 to yield enzyme-bound product. It is shown here that the deuterium kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for the reaction of compound Q with <LATEX>C H _ { 4 }</LATEX> is 50-100, which is one of the largest effects observed to date. The rate constants for the reactions of the deuterated homologs of methane decrease monotonically as the deuterium content increases, suggesting that a large primary isotope effect dominates. The KIEs determined by analyzing the products after a single turnover have the following values: 1:1 CH4:CD4 (19); CD3H (12); CD2H2 (9); and CH3D (4). The KIE values determined by directly observing the reactive intermediate and by monitoring product ratios are all large, consistent with complete C-H bond breaking in the oxygenation step of the reaction. However, the differences in the KIE values determined by these two methods suggest that the reaction is more complex than currently proposed. A modified mechanism introducing the possibility of hydrogen- atom reabstraction by an intermediate methyl radical is proposed.
5z6q | Methane monooxygenase (MMO)1 isolated from meth- anotrophic bacteria catalyzes the incorporation of one atom of oxygen from <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> into an unactivated C-H bond of methane <LATEX>\mathrm { \left( b d e \right. } = 1 0 4 \mathrm { k c a l / m o l } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>p K _ { a } = 4 8</LATEX> to form methanol (Dalton, 1980; Lipscomb, 1994). The second atom of oxygen is reduced to water. Many other hydrocarbons serve as adventitious substrates (Higgins et al., 1980; Green & Dalton, 1989). The oxidation reaction of the soluble form of MMO occurs in the active site of the hydroxylase component (MMOH) of this three-protein-component enzyme system (Fox et al., 1989). The other two components are a NADH- coupled reductase (MMOR), which contains FAD and [Fe2S2] cofactors, and a cofactorless protein termed compo- nent B (MMOB) (Lund & Dalton, 1985; Fox et al., 1989, 1990b; Liu, Y., et al., 1995). MMOH contains a hydroxide- bridged diiron cluster that cycles between an activated diferrous state and a resting diferric state during each catalytic cycle (Ericson et al., 1988; Fox et al., 1988; Rosenzweig et
yeoh | al., 1993; Woodland et al., 1986). Recently, as illustrated in Figure 1, we and others have shown that at least five, and probably six, transient intermediates occur as the diferrous MMOH cycles back to the diferric state after exposure to oxygen in the presence of MMOB and substrate (Lee et al., 1993b; Liu, K. E., et al., 1995a,b; Liu, Y., et al., 1995). One of these intermediates, termed compound Q, absorbs at 330 and 430 nm and exhibits an unusual Mössbauer spectrum best characterized as arising from a symmetric [Fe(IV). Fe(IV)] state of the cluster (Lee et al., 1993a). Although
b8hf | Isotope Effects in MMO Catalysis
hntf | the structure of compound Q is not known, comparison of the Mössbauer spectral features with recently developed model systems suggests that there are two bridging u-oxo or hydroxo ligands forming a so-called "diamond core" structure (Que & Dong, 1996). The formation rate of compound Q is independent of substrate concentration for most substrates. In contrast, its decay rate is linearly dependent on substrate concentration, making the reaction appear second order overall. The rate constant for compound Q decay is strongly dependent on the particular MMO substrate added. Methane elicits the largest value among the many alkanes, alkenes, and heterocyclic compounds investigated so far. Chemical quench experiments indicate that product is formed in the active site at the same rate as compound Q decays. Together these observations suggest that compound Q reacts directly with substrate to form product and, thus, represents the form of the enzyme carrying the activated oxygen species capable of attacking unactivated hydrocarbon bonds.
99fo | Several potential mechanisms for the intriguing oxygen insertion reaction of the soluble MMO have been suggested. All of the proposals invoke direct coordination of oxygen to the diferrous cluster of MMOH to generate a peroxo adduct of some type, which is then cleaved homolytically or heterolytically to generate a radical or oxenoid reactive oxygen species, respectively. Barton and co-workers (Barton et al., 1992) have suggested that an iron oxenoid species might facilitate the formation of a bond between the iron and the substrate carbon to form a species that would allow direct insertion of oxygen. Feig and Lippard (1994) have suggested that an active site cysteine is oxidized by 1 reducing equiv by an oxenoid species to produce an active site diradical. In one proposed reaction from this species, concerted hydrogen atom abstraction by the cysteinyl radical and insertion by the cluster-associated oxygen radical would lead to product. Shteinman (1995) and Shestakov and Shilov (1996) have proposed that the diamond core structure of compound Q allows the redistribution of electron density, such that the irons are predominantly Fe(III) and each of the bridging oxygens has radical character. The coordinated attack of these radicals on substrate, one to carbon and one to hydrogen, is proposed to result in direct oxygen addition to the carbon to form a 5-coordinate methane intermediate that facilitates C-H bond breakage to yield product. We (Fox et al., 1989, 1990a; Froland et al., 1992; Priestley et al., 1992; Lipscomb, 1994) and others (Dalton et al., 1993) have speculated that a metal oxenoid species abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate to yield an intermediate substrate radical and a metal-bound hydroxyl moiety. Re- bound of the hydroxyl would yield product. Considerable support for the latter mechanism has derived from experi- ments that showed that (R)- or (S)-[2H1,3H1 ]ethane undergoes partial inversion of configuration during the course of oxidation to ethanol, implying the formation of an unbound substrate-derived intermediate, probably a substrate radical, that can rotate in the active site before the reaction is consummated (Priestley et al., 1992).
