You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

Provision of one reducing equivalent and O2 was sufficient to generate the same ensemble of products as those formed under multiple turnover conditions with surrogate redox partners (Figure 6B, Figure S19).
zxz6 | DISCUSSION
xnth | Steady-state analysis of product formation by AspB has revealed a significant inverse kinetic solvent isotope effect, implicating the use of an intermediate prior to CYP-I for the initiation of substrate dimerization. The competent formation of aspergilazine A under conditions when a second electron is omitted suggests that only a single reducing equivalent from a

2zmw | redox partner is needed for catalysis to occur. Further support for the reactive nature of a ferric superoxide complex is provided through examination of the single-turnover KSIE of oxy-AspB decay, which reverts to a normal (i.e., kH/kp >1) value due to the suppression of available proton-linked uncoupling pathways.
bf9k | Unlike analogous species in nonheme mono- and di-iron enzymes,4ยบ the ferric-superoxide intermediate in CYPs has been largely considered catalytically inert47 and instead serves as the primary branchpoint between uncoupling via autox- idation and further reduction and proton-mediated O-O heterolysis. One notable exception is the CYP TxtE, which catalyzes the nitration of tryptophan." Transient absorption studies have shown that the ferric superoxide complex of TxtE reacts with nitric oxide (NO) gas to form a ferric peroxynitrite intermediate that subsequently undergoes a homolytic cleavage to form compound II (CYP-II) and release of an NO2 radical.48 Intriguingly, TxtE is also missing the conserved acid residue, which is replaced with a proline, underscoring the importance in the management of proton delivery in this process. Unlike AspB, the TxtE oxy-species is unreactive toward its substrate tryptophan but requires further "activation" by NO.49
otkr | The analogous oxy-species is used by the histidine-ligated heme enzyme family (recently designated as heme-dependent aromatic oxygenase (HDAO)50) that is historically defined by tryptophan 2,3 (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenases (IDO).51-53 TDO and IDO act on a very similar tryptophan substrate, and transient absorption experiments have shown that a ferric superoxide intermediate directly reacts with the substrate through a mechanism involving direct radical addition at the C2 position of the indole ring4 or epoxidation. The heterolytic O-O cleavage then furnishes a transient compound II species56 and a monooxygenated or epoxide product en route to dioxygenation.56,57 Thus, we also considered if AspB may initiate activation of cWP in a similar manner involving a cryptic monooxygenation, but such a mechanism is inconsistent with the normal KSIE for oxy-decay upon substrate N-H deuteration and the inhibitory nature of 3.
ibgs | The apparent reactivity of the AspB-oxy complex contrasts with synthetic heme-superoxo adducts, which are typically considered sluggish oxidants for HAT. The bond dissociation free energy (BDFE) of an indole N-H bond is estimated ~90 kcal/mol, and the DKP N-H is considerably higher. Numerous reports have demonstrated HAT on relatively weak O-H (BDFE โค80 kcal/mol) substrates, -62 in accordance with the limited experimental data available of the resultant hydroperoxo species (OO-H BDFE ~70 kcal/ mol). Although the precise electronic origins for enabling HAT by AspB-oxy remain to be elucidated, it is likely that preorganization of the substrate in an optimized geometry is necessary to allow for such a reaction to occur and to thwart unwanted indole oxygenation.
colo | Based on the current findings, we propose a mechanism for AspB dimerization that is shown in Figure 7. The use of ferric- superoxide species as a primary oxidant may serve as a general stratagem to circumvent monooxygenation and forgo the nonproductive (and less controlled) oxidation of a redox-active substrate by compound I. Although the deuteration strategy employed here does not allow for precise assignment of the abstraction site (DKP vs indole N-H), the ferric-superoxide species may not have the sufficient oxidizing potential for abstraction of the DKP N-H group based on its higher bond

pk06 | Figure 7. Proposed mechanism of cWP dimerization initiated by the ferric superoxide complex of AspB. After substrate binding, reduction to the ferrous state, and O2 binding, the ferric superoxide species abstracts a hydrogen atom from the indole nitrogen. This furnishes a ferric-hydroperoxo complex and bypasses the need for a second reduction step. The conserved Thr244 facilitates proton delivery, enabling O-O bond scission and formation of the high-valent CYP-I. Secondary oxidation and downstream dimerization affords aspergila- zine A.
7wn9 | dissociation energy (BDE), consistent with the highly inhibitory nature observed upon substrate indole N-methyl- ation. Indole N-H HAT would then be envisioned to furnish a hydroperoxo species, bypassing the need for the I-helix acid residue for primary protonation. As we have shown that the I- helix alcohol residue (T244) is important for functional product formation in AspB, ensuing O-O heterolysis likely occurs to give rise to compound I and provide an additional oxidizing species for the downstream secondary activation required for subsequent dimerization. HAT by compound I would yield compound II, which would then need to auto- decay to regenerate the ferric water-bound resting state.
wcd0 | Our findings highlight a unique strategy that CYPs can use for selective diversification of natural products through C-C and C-N bond formation. This discovery not only expands the scope of CYP reactivity but may also prove valuable in leveraging these enzymes for chemoenzymatic DKP assembly. As both AspB and NzeB bypass the need for a second electron transfer step provided by a redox donor, more efficient turnover methods (e.g., light- or electrode-driven catalysis) can be envisioned to form high yields of these unique bioactive natural products.
