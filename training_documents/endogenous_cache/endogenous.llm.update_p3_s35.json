        "content": "ug1e | One hundred eighteen that ApoE four reduces the threshold at which Tau aggregates by twenty-five fold compared to ApoE three and\ntxjz | One hundred nineteen two hundred fold compared to ApoE two, thereby dramatically elevating risk for Tau aggregation due to\ntahh | One hundred twenty neuroproteasome dysfunction. Neuroproteasome-inhibition-induced endogenous Tau inclusions\nrja2 | One hundred twenty-one migrate as a high molecular weight species, which is typically reported only in the AD brain or\njk9f | One hundred twenty-two with seeding-competent Tau. Using quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis supported by\nlu5d | One hundred twenty-three imaging in primary neurons and in vivo, we find that neuroproteasome inhibition induces the\nmw2y | One hundred twenty-four phosphorylation of Tau at sites consistent with pathological aggregated Tau in the AD brain. We suggest that neuroproteasomes serve as a pivotal proteostasis factor, mechanistically distinct from canonical degradation systems, directly linking ApoE to the formation of endogenous Tau aggregates.\nkba4 | One hundred twenty-five\nlxpp | One hundred twenty-six\nxvte | One hundred twenty-seven\n3qkr | One hundred twenty-eight\n5y46 | One hundred twenty-nine Results\n9dqf | One hundred thirty\nvugf | One hundred thirty-one Endogenous affinity tags on the twenty S proteasome reveal that neuroproteasomes co-purify\n7d5n | One hundred thirty-three\n22rs | One hundred thirty-four We sought to purify the neuroproteasome directly out of the mouse brain. Our attempts to do this out of wild-type tissue proved challenging due to lengthy preparations which caused low\nbjpt | One hundred thirty-five\nvkpg | One hundred thirty-six yields. To circumvent this, we built a transgenic mouse line to endogenously tag the twenty S\nyix9 | One hundred thirty-seven proteasome for affinity purification. The proteasome is comprised of the twenty S catalytic core\niaod | One hundred thirty-eight particle which, as part of the ubiquitin-dependent degradation system, can be terminally\nt8jd | One hundred thirty-nine associated with either one or two nineteen S regulatory particles, referred to as the twenty-six S or\n140 | thirty S proteasome respectively. The twenty S core is characterized by four axially\nnz5q | One hundred forty-one stacked heptameric rings: the outer alpha subunit rings which gate substrate entry and the inner\na2fr | One hundred forty-two rings which contain the catalytic beta subunits. The nineteen S caps contain subunits to bind\nhm2f | One hundred forty-three ubiquitylated substrates and ATPases to unfold said substrates into the twenty S core. Therefore,\nrrgl | One hundred forty-four modifying the twenty S with affinity tags allows us to isolate any complex containing the core\nyf3c | One hundred forty-five proteasome, such as free twenty S, singly-capped twenty-six S, doubly-capped thirty S proteasomes, or the\nptp0 | One hundred forty-six neuroproteasome. We modified the C-termini of nearly every core proteasome subunit with\nqtyd | One hundred forty-seven either six X-His or Strep-Two tags and screened out constructs based on low expression and\nju7r | One hundred forty-eight interference with proteasome function. Of the remaining two constructs, we found that\nggbe | One hundred forty-nine only the C-terminal modification of Psma three was compatible with proper proteasome assembly\nvefl | One hundred fifty and function and did not adversely affect cell health. Based on these data, we\nk6et | One hundred fifty-one generated a twenty S-FLAG transgenic line by adding flanking loxP sites surrounding the final exon\nmw5f | One hundred fifty-two exon eleven of the Psma three gene followed by the same sequence with a linker containing a three X-\nm1ik | One hundred fifty-three FLAG tag. By crossing twenty S-FLAG transgenic mice with a line expressing Cre\naj2w | One hundred fifty-four recombinase driven by the pan-neuronal Actlb six (BAF fifty-three b) promoter, we generated mice that\nxhz8 | One hundred fifty-five expressed FLAG-tagged proteasomes selectively in neurons. Brains from twenty S-\naqos | One hundred fifty-six FLAG/BAF fifty-three b-Cre mice and Cre-only littermate controls were processed and FLAG-tagged\n209y | One hundred fifty-eight simultaneously, twenty-six S proteasomes were isolated using the GST-UBL affinity isolation\nyrjp | One hundred sixty method and all samples were immunoblotted using antibodies raised against multiple nineteen S\nhzcm | One hundred fifty-nine\ndz5o | One hundred sixty-one and twenty S subunits. We find that the FLAG tag is incorporated into the proteasome and we fail to detect any FLAG in the Cre-only littermate controls.\nm2rl | One hundred sixty-two\nek0a | One hundred sixty-three We next measured the catalytic activity of the FLAG-tagged proteasome compared to\ne4tl | One hundred sixty-four unmodified proteasomes by monitoring the cleavage of a model substrate, Suc-LLVY-AMC.\nvoil | One hundred sixty-five An increase in fluorescence reflects the proteasome-dependent cleavage of this LLVY substrate\n24g5 | One hundred sixty-six which mobilizes the free fluorescence of AMC. We find that the catalytic activity of isolated twenty-six S\nj1i2 | One hundred sixty-seven proteasomes from mice expressing twenty S-FLAG are indistinguishable from the unmodified\n22xo | One hundred sixty-eight proteasomes isolated from controls. We find that FLAG affinity purified proteasomes\nye4p | One hundred sixty-nine are catalytically identical to twenty-six S affinity purified proteasomes. We fail to detect FLAG\nxdal | One hundred seventy expression in the livers from twenty S-FLAG/Baf fifty-three b-Cre mice, nor can we affinity isolate\ni4yy | One hundred seventy-one proteasomes using the FLAG epitope handle from the liver, indicative of the selective and\n172 | inducible nature of the twenty S-FLAG transgene. Overall, we find that mice expressing twenty S-FLAG appear indistinguishable from wild-type littermates. These extensive\n3e6g | One hundred seventy-four characterizations support the conclusion that epitope tagging of the twenty S with FLAG is inert and\np9wt | One hundred seventy-five does not disrupt native proteasome function.\nbg6v | One hundred seventy-six\nek18 | One hundred seventy-seven To test whether the twenty S-FLAG was efficiently incorporated into the neuroproteasome, we\nhdkt | One hundred seventy-eight performed surface biotinylation experiments out of both primary neurons and hippocampal tissue\nyyzt | One hundred seventy-nine from twenty S-FLAG transgenic mice. This is a well-established method for measuring\n7lvc | One hundred eighty neuroproteasome surface localization. Hippocampi from twenty S-FLAG/Baf fifty-three b-Cre mice\nrt7z | One hundred eighty-one were incubated with a cell-impermeable sulfonylated Biotin-NHS-Ester to label surface-exposed\nwpui | One hundred eighty-two amines and surface proteins were pulled down on streptavidin beads. We observe strong FLAG\n23tt | One hundred eighty-three expression in the surface fraction, indicating that the FLAG tag is incorporated into the\nv3cv | One hundred eighty-four neuroproteasome. We fail to detect cytosolic proteins such as Actin in our surface\no6hl | One hundred eighty-five fraction, validating our surface-labeling approach, and fail to observe FLAG expression in twenty S-\npv9r | One hundred eighty-six FLAG mice without Cre. By blotting using an antibody which detects six of the seven\n3ujw | One hundred eighty-seven alpha subunits of the twenty S proteasome including seven, the subunit coded for by Psma three, we can\nekyb | One hundred eighty-eight clearly distinguish the modified alpha seven subunit overlaying with the FLAG signal, denoting\n09tz | One hundred eighty-nine modification of the endogenous protein. Next, we used surface biotinylation to assess if\nncf7 | One hundred ninety our transgenic system was functional in primary cultures. Primary neurons from twenty S-FLAG mice\nqd2c | One hundred ninety-one were cultured and transduced with AAVs to express Cre recombinase at days in vitro two\nin7g | One hundred ninety-two and then processed for surface biotinylation at days in vitro fourteen. We did not detect FLAG\n1sn7 | One hundred ninety-three without AAVs to express Cre, supporting our conclusion that the twenty S-FLAG transgene is\n194 | inducible and not leaky.\nbcxr | One hundred ninety-five\n0dtd | One hundred ninety-six Next, we purified FLAG-neuroproteasomes to determine their composition. First, we prepared\nrnxf | One hundred ninety-seven plasma membranes from twenty S-FLAG/Baf fifty-three b-Cre brains and then gently extracted membrane\ns6hr | One hundred ninety-eight proteins. We find our membrane preparations were enriched in membrane proteins such as",
