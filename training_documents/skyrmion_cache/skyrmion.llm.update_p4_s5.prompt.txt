You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

gvwz | MPS are constructed to target states of small entropy by truncating the reduced density matrix to a dimension <LATEX>\dim \left( \rho _ { A } \right) \leqslant M ,</LATEX> which yields an upper bound for the entangle- ment entropy of an MPS state, <LATEX>\widetilde { S } = \ln M ,</LATEX> a quantity on the order of <LATEX>1 \quad - \quad 1 0</LATEX> for typical simulations. The bulk of FP states can be approximated by product states of <LATEX>\sin - 1 / 2</LATEX> particles aligned to the axis of the magnetic field, and for those states, one finds <LATEX>S \approx 0</LATEX> up to small finite-size corrections. In contrast, for systems hosting a single quantum skyrmion, we obtain val- ues for the entanglement entropy in the range <LATEX>0 . 2 < S < 0 . 7 ,</LATEX> which demonstrates the presence of significant entanglement in the <LATEX>s p i n - 1 / 2</LATEX> quantum skyrmion and indicates that they can- not be expressed as a classical product state. Finally, in the HS phase, we find the strongest entanglement <LATEX>\left( 0 . 7 < S \right) .</LATEX> While we focus mainly on skyrmions with ferromagnetic exchange interaction <LATEX>\left( J < 0 \right) ,</LATEX> we find strong signatures of skyrmions and skyrmion lattices for antiferromagnetic exchange <LATEX>\left( J > \right.</LATEX> 0) as well. However, this phase differs from the ferromag- netic skyrmions and skyrmion lattices, most apparently in the entanglement, which is significantly larger. We postpone a detailed investigation of quantum skyrmions and skyrmion lattices for antiferromagnetic exchange couplings to future work.
sk5m | The von Neumann entropy targets quantum correlations between a bipartition of the system but does not provide local information about the entanglement between individual spin- <LATEX>1 / 2</LATEX> pairs. To access the spatial distribution of entanglement, it is therefore more convenient to calculate the concurrence <LATEX>C _ { r _ { 1 } r _ { 2 } } ,</LATEX> defined for two lattice sites at positions <LATEX>r _ { 1 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>r _ { 2 } .</LATEX> For a generic state it can be expressed through the root of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian matrix <LATEX>R _ { r _ { 1 } r _ { 2 } } = \rho _ { r _ { 1 } r _ { 2 } } \widetilde { \rho } _ { r _ { 1 } r _ { 2 } } ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>\rho _ { r _ { 1 } r _ { 2 } } = \mathrm { t r } _ { r \notin \left[ r _ { 1 } , r _ { 2 } \right] } \left( \rho \right)</LATEX> is the reduced density matrix of the two sites <LATEX>r _ { 1 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>r _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>\widetilde { \rho } _ { r _ { 1 } r _ { 2 } } = \left( \sigma _ { \mathrm { y } } \otimes \sigma _ { \mathrm { y } } \right) \rho _ { r _ { 1 } r _ { 2 } } ^ { * } \left( \sigma _ { \mathrm { y } } \otimes \sigma _ { \mathrm { y } } \right)</LATEX> is a rotation of this reduced density matrix. The concurrence is constructed from the square roots <LATEX>\lambda _ { i }</LATEX> (ordered in decreasing order) of the eigenvalues of
qws8 | <LATEX>R ,</LATEX> <LATEX>C _ { r _ { 1 } r _ { 2 } } = \max \left\{ 0 , \lambda _ { 1 } - \lambda _ { 2 } - \lambda _ { 3 } - \lambda _ { 4 } \right\} .</LATEX> (4)
877u | It is related to the entanglement of formation: for separable states <LATEX>C</LATEX> vanishes, and it increases monotonically toward the limit <LATEX>C = 1</LATEX> for two maximally entangled spin-1/2's [58]. Using the concurrence, we obtain the space-resolved entan- glement distribution between spin pairs in the different phases and present its qualitative distribution by green links in Fig. 5. For a more quantitative analysis, we differentiate between
rzhj | <LATEX>B = - \quad 3 D / 4 .</LATEX> concurrences of different ranges up to third-nearest neighbor in Table I.
