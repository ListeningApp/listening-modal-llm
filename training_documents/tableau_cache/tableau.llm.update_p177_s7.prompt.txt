You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

tv7p | . Parameters are related to the Data sources through the use of calculated fields, which can be complicated to maintain
iube | In the next few exercises, we will accomplish several tasks via the creation of three parameters. We will create parameters that integrate with calculated fields to:
e033 | · Show a single year in one graph and a range of years in another graph
y8m6 | . Filter across multiple Data sources
4595 | . Allow users to select the detail that needs to be explored
zjlt | There are a couple of key concepts about parameters that you should keep in mind as we go through this chapter:
sxhf | 1. Each parameter is unique to a workbook and not to a Data source.
qnrk | L You can copy parameters from one workbook notes to another without issues because they are not dependent on data sources.
nps9 | 2. Each parameter has a name, data type, format, and value.
t0gb | [ 158 ]
fep0 | Chapter 8
mjuh | The first task that we need to accomplish by creating a parameter involves using a Year filter for the dashboard. Two of the visualizations, namely the map and the line graph, have a Time dimension. We want to create a filter from which users can select the year. When a user selects a year, the map will be filtered to show only that year, but the line graph will show five years on either side of dashboard.
7go1 | In order to build this functionality, we will need to create three new elements. The descriptions of these elements are as follows:
clrl | . The Year parameter: This has a data type of INT and a range of values
ulg7 | . A Calculated field: This will be used as a filter on the map so that the year that we are showing in the map matches the selection from the parameter
ai6n | . A Second Calculated field: This will be used as a filter on the line graph that allows five years on either side of the selected year
r85f | Let's create a Year parameter by performing the following steps:
809c | 1. Create a new parameter by clicking on the Context menu in the Data window or by right-clicking on the white space in the Data window and selecting Create Parameter.
88wb | 2. Give the parameter a name that represents what you want users to do. Ensure that the name does not match any of the field names in your data source. Otherwise, this will cause issues.
cos6 | 3. We named our parameter Select a Year.
d7mf | 4. Select the data type of the parameter. When you are using a parameter in a Calculated field, you can convert it to different types. We want ours to be a string because Year is a string field in the Data source.
swxw | 5. If we had selected a different type of field, we would have had to format it accordingly. One of the reasons why we left it as a string is that we won't be running the risk of displaying improperly formatted values.
21z8 | 6. Select List for the Allowable values, as shown in the following screenshot:
joel | 7. You have the option of populating the list from your own list of values or from one of the fields in either of the two Data sources.
ikdv | ]
msiy | The parameter lists are not updated dynamically from the fields.
y8pn | notes
brx4 | 8. Click on the Add from Field button and then select the Year field.
6o0i | 1
9i2l | You only see fields of the same data type as a parameter. If there were multiple data sources in the workbook, you would see the others as well.
jkgo | Chapter 8
keob | 9. Now, the list of values matches that of the source field from the Data source. But from the bottom of the list of values, remove the years after 2008 because the data collected for these years is not complete. You can do this by hovering the pointer of the mouse over the row and clicking on the X that appears to the right of a values, as shown in the following screenshot:
6xew | 10. Also, keep in mind that Tableau is case-sensitive, which means that the contents of the parameter list must match the contents of the field list.
hmbg | 11. The final parameter has been set to a default of 2008, as shown in the following screenshot:
a82c | Using parameters as Filters
u2j3 | You now have a parameter that you can use to filter certain fields. In the following steps, we will create two new calculated fields-the first will filter the map to show only the Year selected, and the second will filter the line graph to show five years on either side of the Year selected:
tnhu | 1. On the map's worksheet, the first task is to create a new Calculated field called Map Year Filter.
yki0 | 2. The formula is simple; it is Boolean expression, and it tells Tableau Public that we want only the Year values that map the parameter selection, as shown in the following screenshot:
lsai | 3. Remove the filter on the Year field, which is a blue pill on the Filters shelf.
i5g8 | 4. Drag this new field from the Dimensions pane to the Filters shelf and select True.
hdi4 | 5. Apply this filter to the Region KPIs worksheet.
ofyw | 6. Right-click on the Select a Year parameter, which is below the Measures in the Data window, and show the parameter control.
hzyo | Next, we will create a Calculated field for the line graph that filters to show five years on either side of the parameter.
j7i8 | Chapter 8
ilpe | Open the worksheet with the line graph, perform the following steps to create a Calculated field:
ulbc | 1. Create a new Calculated field and name it Year + -.
7nzf | 2. In the following screenshot, we used a formula to convert both the parameter and field to integers so that we can perform mathematical functions on them. If you want to, you can create another parameter to allow users to input the number of years that they would like to see on either side and then replace the instances of 5 with it:
uuws | 3. Click on OK.
ruhe | 4. Add this new field from the Measures pane to the Filters shelf and select True. Now, we will return to the dashboard and continue making modifications. The first thing that we want to do is show the parameter.
p7y3 | 5. From the Context menu for the map worksheets on the dashboard, click on Parameters and then click on the Select a Year parameter.
kxtt | 6. The parameter automatically appears next to the Region Quick Filter. It would look better if the two were stacked. So, add a Vertical Layout Container to the Horizontal Container with the header and filter, and then move the Filter and parameter into it.
qdy5 | 7. Add an extra 100 pixels of height to the dashboard.
wl6l | Filters and Actions
60q4 | Modifying titles
mwhj | We can modify the header of the dashboard to reflect the selection of a year as well. The title is hard-coded to identify CO2 emissions from 2008, but if we select a different year from the parameter, such as 2005, then we need to ensure that the title is updated.
t8dw | We can add the parameter to the title by performing the following steps:
jmsn | 1. Double-click on the title.
xkyp | 2. Delete the hard-coded reference to 2008.
yciz | 3. Click on the Insert button.
7zau | 4. Select the parameter that we want to add, as shown in the following screenshot:
a7jx | Since this title is actually a text object on the dashboard and not a specific worksheet title, we cannot insert field values, but we can insert parameters. It's always a good idea to make it very obvious what your user is looking at so that they don't run the risk of assuming the wrong thing.
