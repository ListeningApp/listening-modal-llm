        "content": "7h0h | The figures provided by Willoughby, which were based on the information from the interrogated Chinese POWs, systematically decreased the size of the opposing force. This was accomplished by a selective use of the available data. On October twenty-ninth, for example, many reports based on POW interrogations indicated that a massive PLA crossing of the Yalu had taken place. Nevertheless, Willoughby's assessment cited only one report and estimated that \"only token forces from the Fortieth Army Headquarters and from each of its divisions entered Korea on October twentieth.\" Later, while admitting that elements of four Chinese armies were in Korea, he counted the specific units of the captured soldiers but not their parent units. Thus, when visiting the X Corps in November he estimated that \"probably only a battalion of volunteers of each division identified was actually in Korea.\" Justin Haynes rightly concluded: \"Due to this method of analysis Willoughby accounted for only one third of Chinese Communist troops inside North Korea at that time.\" In fact, on the eve of the Second CPVF Campaign, Willoughby accounted for less than a fifth of the Chinese power.\na64c | In order to prevent challenges to his estimates Willoughby, strove to monopolize the estimates of the CPVF OB. Upon learning that CIA officers were participating in the interrogations of the Chinese POWs and reporting their findings to Washington, he began denying them access to the captured CPVF soldiers. He also threatened to close down a CIA shop in Tokyo after learning that it had reported, based on information from Taiwanese intelligence, that the Chinese army had crossed the Yalu. As a result, the CIA estimates of the Chinese threat had to rely on Willoughby's reports. The same was true with the Joint Chiefs of Staff: ninety percent of their intelligence was based on Willoughby's reports. Consequently, the Far East Command evaluation of Chinese intervention capabilities and intentions \"seem to have been the determining factor in shaping the future course of United Nations military action\" in the war.\ngi7n | Following the end of the first Chinese campaign, the JCS considered three possible courses of action: hold the present line; resume the advancement to the Yalu; or withdraw to a better line of defense. In light of the lack of clarity about the extent of Chinese threat, the JCS preferred the first option. Attempting to occupy the rest of North Korea was considered too risky and withdrawal was deemed morally and politically problematic. Nonetheless, under pressure from MacArthur and the JCS concern about an emerging State Department plan to create a buffer zone along the Yalu, the JCS gave the general reluctant approval to resume the offensive. Willoughby's underestimation of the Chinese force in Korea, as well as his assessment that the weakened CPVF was withdrawing northward, which was based on a Chinese deception to lure MacArthur to resume his offensive, significantly influenced this decision. Obviously, the prize of ending the war by Christmas outweighed a more cautious policy.\n3pn1 | On the eve of the \"home-by-Christmas offensive,\" the Eighth Army held ninety-six POWs, who testified that six Chinese armies, eighteen divisions, were in Korea. A day later, when the Eighth Army started its advancement, FEC G-Two provided its estimation of the enemy forces-eighty-two thousand seven hundred ninety-nine North Korean and from forty thousand to seventy thousand nine hundred thirty-five Chinese soldiers. Willoughby also assessed that the Chinese forces lacked ammunition reserves and stated, \"Constant United Nations pressure along the entire line during the past few weeks should make it perfectly clear to the Reds that this drain on fire power is certainly not apt to be decreased but increased.\" This optimism proved to be completely wrong. The Chinese were aware that the Americans underestimated their capabilities and intentions and planned to use this to achieve another surprise. By this stage, they had accumulated three hundred eighty thousand soldiers in Korea, three hundred nine thousand sixty-five more than Willoughby's precise estimate indicated, and prepared for a counterattack.\nwjuz | The systematic underestimation of the magnitude of the Chinese forces in Korea had a dramatic impact on the way the war developed. At the strategic level, the failure to realize that Beijing had already committed significant forces to Korea led to the mistaken conclusion that the relatively small number of Chinese forces in Korea was merely a means to save face after the public intervention threats. Hence, giving MacArthur the green light to renew the offensive was not seen as too risky. As the Army Chief of Staff, Gen. J. Lawton Collins, concluded, an American offensive \"might well provide an out for the Chinese Communists to withdraw into Manchuria without loss of face.\" At the operational level, Willoughby's assessment that most of the Chinese army had not crossed the Yalu but remained in Manchuria made the option of reaching the Yalu more feasible and less perilous. The commanders of both the Eighth Army and the X Corps estimated that the enemy forces they were to confront \"would fight only a delaying defensive action.\" This had a devastating effect on force deployment when the United Nations offensive was launched. In the case of the X Corps, for example, it \"led to an ill-advised thinning out of American forces\" when they started their offensive on November twenty-seventh. And at the tactical level, Willoughby's gross underestimation of the magnitude of the Chinese threat left the forces at the front completely unaware of the enemy who confronted them, and completely unprepared when the full blow fell on them.\n3yxv | On November twenty-fifth, a day after the beginning of MacArthur's offensive into what Halberstam defined as \"the largest ambush in the era of modern warfare,\" the Chinese counteroffensive was launched. It lasted until December twenty-fourth and delivered the United States one of the greatest defeats in its history. Under difficult weather conditions, and against a highly capable enemy, the surprised Eighth Army and X Corps had to withdraw to south of the thirty-eighth parallel. According to Chinese accounts, by the end of the Second Campaign, the United Nations losses amounted to thirty-six thousand casualties and POWs, of which twenty-four thousand were Americans. The CPV losses were thirty thousand seven hundred. The war turned into a Chinese-United States confrontation, and instead of ending in nineteen fifty, it lasted for another two-and-a-half years and took the lives of many more.\nd8zj | Page one hundred fifty-nine. Explaining the intelligence failure\nywxn | A gross intelligence failure following an earlier one is the exception rather than the rule, as demonstrated by the other two dyads in this study. Our hypothesis has been that a second failure in a row will not result from insufficient information about the looming threat but, at least partially, emerge as the product of ineffective learning process after the first fiasco on the part of critical decision-makers. The American failure of November nineteen fifty supports this hypothesis.\nuxhs | Broadly speaking, the fundamental sin of the American estimation process, especially in the FEC, was that of hubris. MacArthur's successful landing in Inchon and the fast collapse of the KPA eroded the impact of the more painful events of the war's first months. This success, moreover, increased the American belief in its military superiority against any Asian opponent, and nurtured the cult of MacArthur's omnipotent leadership.",
