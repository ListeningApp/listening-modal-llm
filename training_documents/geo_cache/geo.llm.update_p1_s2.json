One option for cost-effective storage of large quantities of hydrogen is the geological subsurface. However, previous experience with underground hydrogen storage is restricted to salt caverns, which are limited in size and space. In contrast, pore storage facilities in aquifers and/or depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs could play a vital role in meeting base load needs due to their wide availability and large storage capacity, but experiences are limited to past operations with hydrogen-bearing town gas. To overcome this barrier, here we investigate hydrogen storage in porous storage systems in a two-step process: One) First, we investigate positive and cautionary indicators for safe operations of hydrogen storage in pore storage systems. Two) Second, we estimate hydrogen storage capacities of pore storage systems in current and decommissioned underground natural gas storage systems and saline aquifers. Our systematic review highlights that optimal storage conditions in terms of energy content and hydrogen quality are found in sandstone reservoirs in absence of carbonate and iron bearing accessory minerals at a depth of approximately one thousand one hundred meters and a temperature of at least forty degrees Celsius. Porosity and permeability of the reservoir formation should be at least twenty percent and five times ten to the negative thirteen square meters, approximately five hundred millidarcys, respectively. In addition, the pH of the brine should fall below six and the salinity should exceed one hundred milligrams per liter. Based on these estimates, the total hydrogen storage capacity in underground natural gas storages is estimated to be up to eight billion cubic meters or zero point seventy-two million tonnes at standard temperature and pressure corresponding to twenty-nine terawatt hours of energy equivalent of hydrogen. Saline aquifers may offer additional storage capacities of eighty-one point six to six hundred ninety-one point eight million tonnes of hydrogen, which amounts to three point two to twenty-seven point three petawatt hours of energy equivalent of hydrogen, the majority of which is located in the North German basin. Pore storage systems could therefore become a crucial element of the future German hydrogen infrastructure, especially in regions with large industrial hydrogen storage demand and likely hydrogen imports via pipelines and ships.\n8mp0 | One Introduction\nxjyk | Global environmental changes and future energy needs are among the most fundamental challenges facing humanity in the near future. Green hydrogen produced by renewable energies has the capacity to overcome these obstacles by decarbonizing the industry, electricity generation, transport, and heat. With its National Hydrogen Strategy, the German government has given a strong boost to the hydrogen economy in all sectors of the energy system. But renewable energy sources needed for the production of green hydrogen are subjected to weather-related and seasonal fluctuations. Hence, measures are needed to stabilize and secure future energy supplies. Hydrogen storage could therefore be the decisive factor in the energy transition. Only then the divergent hydrogen demand and production will be balanced.\nmt0f | In addition to the storage of hydrogen in tanks or pipes, the geological subsurface also offers possibilities for the long-term storage of hydrogen. The hydrocarbon industry has been using the underground for decades in Germany and around the world to store large quantities of natural gas in the pore space of rocks or in salt caverns. More than twenty-three billion cubic meters of natural gas are stored underground in Germany. This gives Germany the fourth-largest storage capacity in the world after the United States, Russia, and Ukraine. About thirty-six percent, approximately eight point six billion cubic meters, of the current technically usable working gas volume is stored in pore storage systems for seasonal base load coverage and seventy-four percent of the installed capacity are stored in salt caverns for peak load coverage with more efficient injection and withdrawal cycles. Nevertheless, current research into underground hydrogen storage potential in Germany and Europe has mainly focused on salt caverns only. The total energy storage potential in salt caverns is estimated to be as high as eighty-four point eight petawatt hours in Europe and thirty-five point seven petawatt hours in Germany alone. It is therefore not surprising that first flagship projects for underground storage of hydrogen in salt caverns at the field scale have already been launched in Germany at the Bad Lauchstädt Energy Park, in Rüdersdorf, and in Epe. However, suitable salt deposits are locally limited and only nine percent of the total worldwide working gas capacity is attributed to salt caverns. Pore storage facilities such as depleted gas fields and saline aquifers could therefore play an important role in the energy transition due to their widespread and broad availability across Europe.\nawab | Here, we investigate safety requirements and storage potentials in the light of future hydrogen needs. The aim is to formulate recommendations for future underground hydrogen storage in porous media. Our study starts with an overview of the past, present, and future of underground hydrogen storage in Germany, discussing the experience with underground hydrogen storage and the prospects for hydrogen network structures. It highlights the progress that has been made and the challenges that need to be overcome for widespread\nixcc | deployment. In particular, there are critical factors that need to be considered in the design and operation of underground hydrogen storage facilities to ensure their safe and efficient operation. These critical factors or indicators, such as biotic and abiotic reactions, sealing capacity, cap rock integrity, cushion gas requirements, etc., are discussed before estimates of underground hydrogen storage capacity in Germany are made. Our estimates are made with respect to the discussion of technical hydrogen storage capacity in former and current underground gas storage facilities and the theoretical hydrogen storage capacity in saline aquifers. This section provides a quantitative assessment of the potential of underground hydrogen storage to support the energy transition in Germany. The fifth and final section discusses storage capacity and demand in Europe and assesses the costs and purity requirements of underground hydrogen storage. It builds on the findings of the previous sections and highlights the economic and technical challenges associated with underground hydrogen storage and the potential role of underground hydrogen storage in supporting the development of a sustainable hydrogen economy in Europe.\n8p6h | Two Past, present, and future of underground hydrogen storage in Germany\npmgl | Two point one Experiences with underground hydrogen storage",
