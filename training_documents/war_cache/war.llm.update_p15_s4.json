Violence towards civilian populations, usually in the context of war, whether from bitter civil conflict or invasion by neighbors related to unresolvable territorial disputes, has been endemic and huge in scale. In the nineteen sixties and nineteen seventies alone, 'massive massacres amounting to genocide' - a phrase used in a speech in nineteen seventy-nine to Amnesty International - took place, according to one listing, in eleven countries, including the mega-horror of Cambodia.
