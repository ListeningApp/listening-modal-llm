You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

seik | The most critical mistakes ("scandalous" and "foolish") involved MacArthur's mistaken estimate of the magnitude of the Chinese threat in November. In part, it was the outcome of the Bataan Gang mentality that provided him with information and estimation please. But it was MacArthur, primarily his paranoia and narcissistic personality, who created this atmosphere, and we will elaborate on this subject. We will also present two additional patterns of behavior which he exhibited prior to the November fiasco: an overly optimistic estimate of the balance of forces before the outbreak of 4 war; and a drive, motivated by political and operational considerations, to end every confrontation as soon as possible.
oq7c | Although many biographies discuss the relationship between MacArthur's strategy and personality, only a few attempted to analyze his strategy as a function of his personality""" and none did it within the Korean War context. Manchester provides a good short description of this personality:
z4mi | He was a great thundering paradox of man, noble and ignoble, inspiring and outrageous, arrogant and shy, the best of men and the worst of men, the most protean, most ridiculous, and most sublime. No more baffling, exasperating soldier ever wore a uniform. Flamboyant, imperious, and apocalyptic, he carried the plumage of a flamingo, could not acknowledge errors, and tried to cover up his mistakes with sly, childish tricks.222
hkft | Manchester specifically relates MacArthur's paranoia as a salient component of his psyche:
jai3 | The General's paranoia never lay more than a fraction of a millimeter below the surface of his thoughts. "They" had conspired against his father, "they" had refused to decorate him after his Vera Cruz adventure, "they" had undercut him in France in 1918, "they" had forced him into retirement in 1937, "they" had refused to reinforce his defense of Corregidor and Bataan, "they" had sent an inferior B-17 to Cagayan, and "they" were waiting even now to thwart him again.223
p57i | The prime suspect of MacArthur's envy and paranoia was George Marshall, who was the same age and had performed brilliantly as a staff officer under Pershing in WWI. Marshall was probably one of the "deskbound men who envied and resented" MacArthur as "a fighting officer."224 When MacArthur became chief of staff, p. 173 he exiled Marshal to run the Illinois 4 National Guard. No wonder then that during the war MacArthur, now serving under Marshall, who had become chief of staff in 1939, believed that Marshall and others plotted
u5ug | against him. Sheer classic projection may have added to his belief, whereby he assumed that others would behave toward him as he would toward them if their situations were reversed. He even expressed the belief that the "Germany First" policy formulated by Roosevelt and Churchill was a conspiracy to deny him the resources he needed to win the war in the Pacific. In addition to Marshall, who was "working against him at all times," he also blamed the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. The two had had a stormy relationship since Eisenhower ended his job as MacArthur's assistant in the Philippines in the late 1930s, and MacArthur blamed him for undermining his work and "stealing publicity." Gen. Robert Eichelberger, a corps commander under MacArthur, noted when describing this paranoid way of thinking that stealing "any publicity from MacArthur was like driving a dagger into his heart."225
i9k5 | MacArthur's paranoia did not fade away after 1945. During the Korean War he was certain that the chief of staff, Omar Bradley, hated him since he had rejected Bradely as a senior commander when planning the invasion of Japan in 1945.22 And even his 1964 memoirs were colored by his paranoia. Twenty-two years after the decision to prevent the release of a statement he prepared on Japanese atrocities in the "Bataan Death March," he wrote, "Perhaps the Administration, which was committed to a Europe-first effort, feared American public opinions would demand a greater reaction against Japan."227
20z2 | MacArthur's paranoia can be linked to his deep sense of family heritage, particularly his father's career." . 228 He was born into an aristocratic family. His father was the youngest colonel in the Union Army during the Civil War and occupied the Philippines in 1900. Afterward, however, despite being the highest ranking officer in the Army, his military career came to a dead end (for which his son blamed others). MacArthur's mother lived through his success-she spent four years in West Point watching over him during his studies in the military academy-and she "sent him out not merely to avenge the wrongs done to his father but to compete against him."229 L
4cgs | Douglas MacArthur's need to be worthy of the heritage of his family and redeem his father's end of career constitutes a partial explanation for his narcissist personality: his grandiose sense of self-importance, conviction of his rightness, sensitivity to criticism and demand for admiration, tendency to get into power struggles, and his desire to take credit for himself and place blame on others.250 Narcissism in general, and paranoia in particular, explain his need to form a group of loyal and admiring officers-some of whom were highly talented-who would provide the recognition he so desperately craved, particularly during the difficult years in the Philippines and Australia. In November 1950, this mentality provided support that was needed to bridge the gap between his goal of ending the war by Christmas and the reality of the battlefield.
htre | In addition to narcissism and paranoia, other patterns help to understand MacArthur's conduct on the eve of the fiasco. One was his constant unrealistic optimism concerning the balance of forces prior to the breakout of war, and disregard of his Asian enemies. In 1939, he doubted if "an enemy could concentrate superior forces at any vital Philippine area" and estimated that a Japanese blockade would be "practically unfeasible without the tacit agreement of the other nations surrounding the Pacific." On the eve of the attack on Pearl Harbor, he was certain that war would not start before spring. When it started, he defined the Japanese blockade on the Philippines as a "paper blockade." When the Korean War started, he was contemptuous of the fighting capabilities of the KPA, and despite their initial military achievements did not change his mind, believing that if he could put the First Cav Division into Korea, "those fellows scuddle up to the Manchurian border so quick, you would see no more of them."232
