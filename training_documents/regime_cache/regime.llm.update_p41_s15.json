For Langevin dynamics, perturbations of the form B point three can correspond to differential operators acting on the positions or momenta, i.e. FTVq and FTVp. In dimension one, these options reduce to negative Fogo and negative FOpyo, both of which are trivially discretized with centered finite differences.\nzutp | For the modified fluctuation-dissipation in p, its discretization corresponds to scaling the LFD term in two point sixteen by y plus an. For its position counterpart negative eight negative one\nqgmy | q its discretization corresponds to adding B point two, scaled by on.\n40wi | Upwind scheme for Langevin. We now motivate the upwinding used to discretize the transport term P T M negative one nabla q in the Fokker-Planck equation two point seventeen. In particular, the use of a centered finite difference with an even number of points m q in the spatial domain would lead to independent submeshes, and hence might give incorrect results, an issue known as odd-even decoupling. To overcome this, one resorts to decentered finite differences, in particular upwinding.\na418 | Recall that equation two point three can be seen as the stationary solution to the evolution PDE partial t psi equals L dagger psi. To implement the upwinding scheme, we write the transport term in the Fokker-Planck in the form of the advection equation, that is\ne9lu | partial t psi plus P T M negative one nabla q psi equals zero. The scheme used to discretize the components of nabla q psi depends on the sign of the components of p. The partial derivative is discretized with a scheme decentered on the left when P is greater than or equal to zero, and decentered on the right when P is less than or equal to zero. The discretization of p partial q psi in dimension one at a mesh point Q i, P j is therefore done as follows:\na278 | p fraction numerator left bracket Psi zero h right bracket i plus one, j minus left bracket Psi zero h right bracket i, j over h q denominator, and p less than zero, p fraction numerator left bracket Psi zero h right bracket i, j minus left bracket Psi zero h right bracket i minus one, j over h a denominator, and p greater than zero.
