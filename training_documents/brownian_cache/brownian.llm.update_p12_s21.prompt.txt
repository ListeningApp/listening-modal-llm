You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ohpj | As the equilibrium variance is also easily computed from the Boltzmann distribution, equation (121) gives us a second test to verify that the effective potential has been computed correctly, at least around the minimum.
ry5f | In the LPA approximation the variance and the de- cay rate of the autocorrelation function are both directly given by the curvature of the effective potential at its minimum. The inclusion of WFR however alters the de- cay rate without changing the equilibrium variance. This is as it should be since the latter is fixed by the equi- librium Boltzmann distribution. As we will see, WFR improves the decay rate which is indeed not exactly de- termined by the effective potential's curvature alone.
31wg | V. SOLUTIONS TO THE FLOW EQUATIONS
celk | In this section we obtain the resulting effective poten- tial and wave function renormalisation for 3 types of po- tential. The first we consider is a simple polynomial in line with [16]:
3mf9 | <LATEX>V \left( x \right) = 1 + x + \frac { x ^ { 2 } } { 2 } + \frac { 2 x ^ { 3 } } { 3 } + \frac { x ^ { 4 } } { 4 }</LATEX> (122)
z2rd | We will also consider a doublewell made by two <LATEX>\mathrm { L J }</LATEX> po- tentials back to back:
vqld | <LATEX>V \left( x \right) = 4 \epsilon _ { 1 } \left( \frac { \sigma ^ { 1 2 } } { \left( x + 3 \right) ^ { 1 2 } } - \frac { \sigma ^ { 6 } } { \left( x + 3 \right) ^ { 6 } } \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>+ 4 \epsilon _ { 2 } \left( \frac { \sigma ^ { 1 2 } } { \left( x - 3 \right) ^ { 1 2 } } - \frac { \sigma ^ { 6 } } { \left( x - 3 \right) ^ { 6 } } \right)</LATEX> (123)
ljmz | where <LATEX>\sigma</LATEX> will be taken to be 1 from here on in and <LATEX>\epsilon _ { 1 }</LATEX> & <LATEX>\epsilon _ { 2 }</LATEX> represents the depth of each well. We will choose <LATEX>\epsilon _ { 1 } = 1 , \epsilon _ { 2 } = 1 0 \text { nu }</LATEX> meaning the left well is 1 unit deep and the right units deep (in <LATEX>2 D _ { 0 } / \varepsilon</LATEX> units) and the potential is asymmetric. Clearly here the domain of in- terest is <LATEX>x \in \left( - 3 , 3 \right)</LATEX> as the potential diverges at <LATEX>x = \pm 3 .</LATEX> Finally we also consider a "bumpy" bare potential con- sisting of a simple <LATEX>x ^ { 2 }</LATEX> underlying potential with additional gaussian bumps (or dips):
en1l | <LATEX>V \left( x \right) = x ^ { 2 } + \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } \alpha _ { i } \exp \left[ - \frac { \left( x - \beta _ { i } \right) ^ { 2 } } { \mu } \right]</LATEX> (124)
45gx | where there are <LATEX>n</LATEX> bumps or dips with the prefactor <LATEX>\alpha _ { i }</LATEX> being positive or negative respectively. We will focus on an x2 plus 3 bumps and 3 dips in an asymmetrical setup. This potential could represent a rudimentary toy model for motion over a "potential energy landscape" with a se- ries of local energy minima. This serves to clearly demon- strate the effect of local extrema on the final shape of the effective potential since the underlying <LATEX>x ^ { 2 }</LATEX> potential does not alter its shape under the RG flow. We chose the parameters to be for <LATEX>x ^ { 2 } + 6</LATEX> bumps/dips:
xgur | <LATEX>\alpha _ { 1 } = \alpha _ { 4 } = \alpha _ { 5 } = - 1 . 5</LATEX> <LATEX>\alpha _ { 2 } = \alpha _ { 3 } = \alpha _ { 6 } = 1 . 5 , \mu = 0 . 0 6</LATEX> <LATEX>\beta _ { 1 } = - \beta _ { 2 } = 0 . 7 , \beta _ { 3 } = - \beta _ { 4 } = 1 . 4 , \beta _ { 5 } = - \beta _ { 6 } = 2 . 1</LATEX> (125)

The dotted blue curve indicates the bare potential which is progressively changed, through dot-dashed green and dashed yellow, into the solid red, effective potential, as fluctuations are integrated out.
dndq | expressed in dimensionless units (we have set <LATEX>\widehat { x } \rightarrow x</LATEX> to avoid notational clutter).
xzce | We solve the LPA flow equation (88) on a grid in the <LATEX>\chi</LATEX> direction and using an adaptive step size Runge- Kutta ODE solver to evolve in the <LATEX>k</LATEX> direction. A similar approach was used for including (96). The numerical derivatives in the <LATEX>\chi</LATEX> direction were based on a finite dif- ference scheme using the Fornberg method with a stencil size of 5 for the potentials under study. While increas- ing the grid size improves the accuracy of the numerical derivative it also increases the number of coupled ODEs to be solved, making the integration much more com- putationally expensive. A balance must be drawn de- pending on the potential in question. For our cases we considered 1001 points and <LATEX>x \in \left( - 3 , 3 \right)</LATEX> for the unequal L-J potential and <LATEX>x \in \left( - 5 , 5 \right)</LATEX> for the other two. Figs. 1, 2, 4, 3 and 5, display the results.
