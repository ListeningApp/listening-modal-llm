You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

7eaf | If anyone were to say: 'Why can we not have a British Karakul skin?' the foregoing remarks would probably be what he would be told by an expert-
t890 | Suppose we use this example to illustrate, however partially, my remarks that something which belongs to one culture should not-in the metaphysical sphere-be imported into another? Am I not importing something from another culture, or even series of cultures?
nwqa | It must immediately be noted that the relevant factor here is whether the import belongs uniquely to the culture from which it was imported, or whether it does not.
sewa | If I import a habit, like wearing sandals, from Greece, where it is hot to Greenland where it is cold, I am doing the wrong sort of importing. If, on the other hand, I import something of use, like wool, from a place where it grows to a place where it can be used, I am probably doing something useful.
0tlp | It is a sad commentary on the primitive state of thinking upon this matter that people try to safeguard their existing ways by excluding things which are of use and including things which are useless.
bz3j | The difficulty on the part of the ordinary man to know what is useful and what is merely secondary, cultural material, is in part due to his impatience and greed - he wants anything that might be useful, (or is attractive) in part due to the fact that nobody has told him the elementary fact that certain things arc not only useful but essential imports, and partly due to the fear that something brought into his life or thinking from another source might not suit him.
14mv | From this point of view, in metaphysics, you will see that he is at a very low level of accomplishment, which would not be able to persist for very long in the technological sphere of a simple society after it had once been impinged upon by a more developed one.
75iu | Of course, there are time-honoured ways of introducing into a society something which it needs but does not want to accept. Many of them are still being used. King Abdul-Aziz ibn Saud, in order to 'prove' that the radio was not an evil thing, had to broadcast verses from the Koran so that clerics could testify that it must be a good thing, since it was assumed that the devil could not quote the Koran.
a82u | There was the case of St. Francis who in a famous story told the Pope that his ideas and organisation were really ancient ones belonging to the Church, which had been neglected and con- currently developed elsewhere and were now finding their real place.
tx0t | In parts of the world it is still customary for someone who has taken a pill given to him under modern medical doctrine to take it to the local magician to have it made 'really potent' by means of a spell.
2zty | More in our own locality of operation, you may observe the almost magical 'rationalising' effect of an explanation which en- ables the hearer to reorganise his prejudices in a seemingly orderly way. You can say to him: I am telling you the same thing which was preached by so-and-so, and here is the correspondence of the ideas.' He will feel much better. He does not primarily want
63ho | truth, he wants reassurance, system, safety.
32zi | Or you can do it in another way. You can say - and it works - 'This does not appear to be the same but it works wonders'. This can stimulate his greed, enable him to overcome prejudices in the 'higher interest' of something extra possible for himself.
59si | Why am I describing these mechanisms, and why do I dis- approve of them?
i30e | For no other reason than that they are the easy, superficial way. You may say: 'What I am telling you is the same as what you learned from so-and-so' and you may be telling the truth. This truth may be important, and its proper realisation can have a very important effect. But, once you say this truth, you may expect the hearer to use this important truth for purposes of rationalisation. Instead of letting the basic truth have access to his consciousness, he exhausts its energy for him by using it to make acceptable, to superficial thinking, things about which he has had doubts.
tvst | This primitive and futile use of important fact is, metaphysic- ally speaking, the sign of an immature man or woman.
wrky | This is an important point at which we part company with the more conventional psychologist. The latter, far from complaining about this 'mechanism of rationalisation', tends to regard it as useful (for integrative purposes, for example) except where it produces a state of mind at variance with social norms, particularly his own.
2my1 | But the psychologist as familiar to us today is generally dealing with what we call the false personality of man: the superficial (though necessary) intellectual-emotional system with which he works. We are attempting to contact and inform the deeper in- dividuality of the human being.
8ql6 | How does this tie in with our Karakul Lamb? Quite simply. The people who think that we are importing something, even though we prefer to say we are re-introducing it, if they are 'satisfied' by our explanations and thus rationalise them through greed or for some other motive, are as inaccessible to what we are really saying and doing as those who disregard everything we say or do.
07fv | KEEPING CLEAR OF THE BOTTOM
kg0h | Indeed, in a more elaborate form, their reaction is the same as the ground-plan of this Mulla Nasrudin anecdote:
pl1f | 'That is a very dangerous lake, Mulla' said a local fisherman; 'and people who swim in it are always being found dead at the bottom'
wavb | 'That's all right, friend', said Nasrudin, 'I'll keep well away from the bottom .
at1i | Indeed, when this teaching is projected, as it in fact is, in an- other convention than the metaphysical one, the people who reject what we are saying in the metaphysical idiom often show a marked potentiality for understanding. Bear in mind here that it is only the superficial thinker who assumes that our teaching, if it is a genuine one, is not bound by the limitations of so- called 'metaphysical' vocabulary. It can be taught in any manner. But it can be taught to so-called metaphysicians only in the jargon, or some equivalence of it, which is conditioned into them already.
4dbf | These remarks should be absorbed because of the unacceptably narrow view unfortunately acquired by many people who try to understand psychological, religious, philosophical and metaphysi- cal ideas.
nsky | Abdulkarim Jili, the author of the important Sufi work Insan-i- Kamil, 'Perfected Human Being' who died in the fifteenth century of the Christian Era emphasises that Being is thought, and the external aspect of Being is the world. Through the multiplicity of perceived ideas and objects, of course, Sufi doctrine holds that real being may be perceived. This is the doctrine of 'The phenomenal is the Bridge to the Real', but it is instrumental in function. This means that the things of the world which conduce to higher per- ception have little meaning but much potential use. People look for meaning and are ignorant of use. So they value secondary worldly ideas instead of choosing them as instruments.
pa2d | Teaching Methods and Prerequisites
lf13 | Q: According to the Sufis, is there any knowledge of the differ- ence between teaching and conditioning; and do people know what they want when they set out to learn?
28e7 | A: People are conditioned not only by deliberate indoctrination, but also by systems whose proponents themselves are ignorant of the need for safeguards to prevent conditioning. People are also conditioned by a constellation of experiences. In most human societies, unanimity of thought has been arrived at by an un- recognised conditioning process in which virtually all the society's institutions may be branches of the conditioning process.
