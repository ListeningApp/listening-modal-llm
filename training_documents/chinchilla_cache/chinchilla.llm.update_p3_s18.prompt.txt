You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

j79f | Modelling the scaling behavior. Understanding the scaling behaviour of language models and their transfer properties has been important in the development of recent large models (Hernandez et al., 2021; Kaplan et al., 2020). Kaplan et al. (2020) first showed a predictable relationship between model size and loss over many orders of magnitude. The authors investigate the question of choosing the optimal model size to train for a given compute budget. Similar to us, they address this question by training various models. Our work differs from Kaplan et al. (2020) in several important ways. First, the authors use a fixed number of training tokens and learning rate schedule for all models; this prevents them from modelling the impact of these hyperparameters on the loss. In contrast, we find that setting the learning rate schedule to approximately match the number of training tokens results in the best final loss regardless of model size-see Figure A1. For a fixed learning rate cosine schedule to 130B tokens, the intermediate loss estimates (for <LATEX>\left. D ^ { \prime } < < 1 3 0 B \right)</LATEX> are therefore overestimates of the loss of a model trained with a schedule length matching <LATEX>D ^ { \prime } .</LATEX> Using these intermediate losses results in underestimating the effectiveness of training models on less data than 130B tokens, and eventually contributes to the conclusion that model size should increase faster than training data size as compute budget increases. In contrast, our analysis predicts that both quantities should scale at roughly the same rate. Secondly, we include models with up to 16B parameters, as we observe that there is slight curvature in the FLOP-loss frontier (see Appendix E)-in fact, the majority of the models used in our analysis have more than 500 million parameters, in contrast the majority of runs in Kaplan et al. (2020) are significantly smaller-many being less than 100M parameters.

xb13 | Estimating hyperparameters for large models. The model size and the number of training tokens are not the only two parameters to chose when selecting a language model and a procedure to train it. Other important factors include learning rate, learning rate schedule, batch size, optimiser, and width-to-depth ratio. In this work, we focus on model size and the number of training steps, and we rely on existing work and provided experimental heuristics to determine the other necessary hyperparameters. Yang et al. (2021) investigates how to choose a variety of these parameters for training an autoregressive transformer, including the learning rate and batch size. McCandlish et al. (2018) finds only a weak dependence between optimal batch size and model size. Shallue et al. (2018); Zhang et al. (2019) suggest that using larger batch-sizes than those we use is possible. Levine et al. (2020) investigates the optimal depth-to-width ratio for a variety of standard model sizes. We use slightly less deep models than proposed as this translates to better wall-clock performance on our hardware.
cxqi | Improved model architectures. Recently, various promising alternatives to traditional dense trans- formers have been proposed. For example, through the use of conditional computation large MoE models like the 1.7 trillion parameter Switch transformer (Fedus et al., 2021), the 1.2 Trillion pa- rameter GLaM model (Du et al., 2021), and others (Artetxe et al., 2021; Zoph et al., 2022) are able to provide a large effective model size despite using relatively fewer training and inference FLOPs. However, for very large models the computational benefits of routed models seems to diminish (Clark et al., 2022). An orthogonal approach to improving language models is to augment transformers with explicit retrieval mechanisms, as done by Borgeaud et al. (2021); Guu et al. (2020); Lewis et al. (2020). This approach effectively increases the number of data tokens seen during training (by a factor of ~ 10 in Borgeaud et al. (2021)). This suggests that the performance of language models may be more dependant on the size of the training data than previously thought.
qfmx | 3. Estimating the optimal parameter/training tokens allocation
rut3 | We present three different approaches to answer the question driving our research: Given a fixed FLOPs budget, how should one trade-off model size and the number of training tokens? In all three cases we start by training a range of models varying both model size and the number of training tokens and use the resulting training curves to fit an empirical estimator of how they should scale. We assume a power-law relationship between compute and model size as done in Clark et al. (2022); Kaplan et al. (2020), though future work may want to include potential curvature in this relationship for large model sizes. The resulting predictions are similar for all three methods and suggest that parameter count and number of training tokens should be increased equally with more compute3- with proportions reported in Table 2. This is in clear contrast to previous work on this topic and warrants further investigation.

mq4s | 3.1. Approach 1: Fix model sizes and vary number of training tokens
95el | In our first approach we vary the number of training steps for a fixed family of models (ranging from 70M to over 10B parameters), training each model for 4 different number of training sequences. From these runs, we are able to directly extract an estimate of the minimum loss achieved for a given number of training FLOPs. Training details for this approach can be found in Appendix D.
a0a5 | For each parameter count N we train 4 different models, decaying the learning rate by a factor of 10x over a horizon (measured in number of training tokens) that ranges by a factor of 16x. Then, for each run, we smooth and then interpolate the training loss curve. From this, we obtain a continuous mapping from FLOP count to training loss for each run. Then, for each FLOP count, we determine which run achieves the lowest loss. Using these interpolants, we obtain a mapping from any FLOP count C, to the most efficient choice of model size N and number of training tokens D such that FLOPs(N,D) =C.4 At 1500 logarithmically spaced FLOP values, we find which model size achieves the lowest loss of all models along with the required number of training tokens. Finally, we fit power laws to estimate the optimal model size and number of training tokens for any given amount of compute (see the center and right panels of Figure 2), obtaining a relationship Nopt oc Ca and Dopt of Cb. We find that a = 0.50 and b = 0.50-as summarized in Table 2. In Section D.4, we show a head-to-head comparison at 1021 FLOPs, using the model size recommended by our analysis and by the analysis of Kaplan et al. (2020)-using the model size we predict has a clear advantage.
