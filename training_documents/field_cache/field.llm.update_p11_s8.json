The line of argument is that it is not fair to only give a fraction of the population a potentially beneficial treatment. While I am sympathetic to this line of reasoning, it is ultimately flawed. First of all, it only considers contemporaneous trade-offs. One could easily argue that it is not fair to future generations to bypass learning opportunities that could make them better off. I am personally glad that earlier generations executed experiments to determine the efficacy of promising drugs so that today my father's heart condition can be treated appropriately. Second, even if one insists on everyone receiving treatment, it remains possible to execute an experiment whereby people receive treatment in waves over time.\nepu7 | Fourteen. Always obtain IRB approval.\n7od1 | Local Research Ethics Committees and Institutional Review Boards in the United States serve an important role in monitoring experimental research. Before commencing a field experiment, you should be sure to receive IRB approval. Some researchers do not have Local Research Ethics Committees and\n0bqy | Institutional Review Boards. Outside the United States, for example, researchers in the social sciences must rely largely on their own principles. In those cases, I urge the researcher to follow, as closely as possible, strict guidelines that protect the rights of experimental subjects.\nb780 | Conclusion\nccmb | When economists are struggling to understand a key causal connection or an important structural parameter or the effects of a change in business practice or public policy, they have long used this semiautomatic approach: write down a theoretical model and start looking for available naturally occurring data. To economists, \"field research\" has often meant chatting with the cab driver on the way from the airport to another academic seminar. But more and more empirical economists are opening their eyes and searching for situations and questions in which a field experiment might offer a feasible and desirable approach.\nma93 | As I have noted elsewhere, field experiments represent a unique manner in which to obtain data because they force the researcher to understand everyday phenomena, many of which we stumble upon frequently. Merely grasping the interrelationships of factors in field settings is not enough, however, as the field experimenter must then seek to understand more distant phenomena that have the same underlying structure. Until this is achieved, one cannot reap the true rewards of field experimentation. I hope that this symposium furthers economists' usage of the field experimental method.\nc6hh | Why Economists Should Conduct Field Experiments and Fourteen Tips",
