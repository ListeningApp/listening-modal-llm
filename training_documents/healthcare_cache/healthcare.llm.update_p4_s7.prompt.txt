You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

qy1i | 3. ECOTHERAPY
1k9e | In addition to carbon awareness in traditional health care, patients may seek unconventional ecotherapy. Ecotherapy is not necessarily sustainable, but it has environmental resonance.54 Ecotherapy may encom- pass "prescriptions for nature"55 such as walks in a for- est, going outside more,56 attending a nature retreat, or participating in other forms of open-air recreation.57 While the medicalization of nature is problematic, as it may lead to instrumentalization, many patients find
5bjs | medical legitimacy through the word "therapy" and retain use of the term. To be sure, patients may still utilize traditional medicine and may not be concerned with reducing their impact on the environment. In fact, if ecotherapy is used as a conjunctive to tradi- tional medicine it can require more total resources. This inconsistency is part and parcel of health care; even as some patients try to be healthier in one area of life, such as not smoking, they may flout health care wisdom in other areas, like physical activity.
uodj | B. Physicians
k16v | The notion of activism - particularly in the envi- ronmental movement - often invokes the image of protests, people holding signs, chaining themselves to a tree, or acts of civil disobedience that may result in arrest.58 While using the label "activist" in ecology may be viewed by some as synonymous with a liberal agenda, white privilege, or even a eugenic Malthusian- ism, physician activism in environmental initiatives is frequently indicative of a dedication to the health of all, not just the elite few. Physicians for Social Respon- sibility (PSR) have been active for over 50 years. As the group developed, an "Environment and Health Com- mittee" was added as an area of focus. Topics under this banner include environmental concerns such as fracking, climate and health, and clean energy.59 PSR are motivated by activism on "issues that represent the gravest dangers to human health." Doctor activ- ists also urge the nation to act on climate change60 and draft position papers on climate change and health.61
b2lm | Physicians are concerned with the amount of waste they emit in the course of their work; 62 with the struc- tural design of their health care facilities;63 and with the toxicity of their work environment.64 The Uni- versity of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) began a Green Health Center project almost two decades ago with the objective to "engage in educational and research programs that support this aim (of sustain- ability) and to begin the process of redesigning our own institution toward sustainability."65 Other medi- cal centers, particularly those affiliated with universi- ties, have followed by developing their own pathways to greener health care facilities.66 Green health centers across the country are supported by physician leader- ship and maintained by policies and practices within hospitals.
ti7f | 3. GREEN TEAMS
oksu | Green Teams are a smaller group of health care pro- fessionals who may or may not be situated within a
wtow | Green Health Center. At the Massachusetts General Hospital for Children at Harvard Medical School, a Green Team of medical professionals were organized "to develop high impact strategies towards the cre- ation of a zero-carbon emissions model in the PICU" (pediatric intensive care unit).67 The Green Team col- lected waste and itemized the excess. By identifying areas for waste reduction - such as returning unused equipment to a storage space - they were able to reduce their waste while providing excellent patient care.
o22k | 4. GREEN PRESCRIPTIONS
nwfz | Some physicians attempt to green their prescribing practices through a mixture of preventative health care advice and low-carbon treatments. It is widely documented that plant-based diets have numer- ous health benefits and are less resource intensive than meat based diets.68 In recognition of this, some physicians are recommending plant based diets as a medical standard for global carbon reduction and better health outcomes.69 Maximilian Andreas Storz declares, "plant-based diets are a powerful tool - not using and advocating for them is not only unethical, but harms patients and the planet alike."70 Vegetarian and vegan diets have become more prevalent in soci- ety and thus more accessible.71 Green prescriptions combine the legitimacy of physician-directed advice with environmental ethics.
nvfy | 5. EDUCATION
mror | Physicians provide education to peers through Grand Rounds, on-the-job training, and in continuing edu- cation. Medical educators argue that "health care pro- viders require training on the connections between the climate, ecosystems, sustainability, and health and their responsibility and capacity in changing the status quo,"72 which is largely wasteful. In an effort to support this education, Dr. Rebecca Philipsborn at the Emory School of Medicine has developed a virtual 4- week Climate Change and Health curriculum, which includes topics and syllabi to be implemented in other medical schools.73 It should also be noted that the UK also has a significant amount of curriculum develop- ment around sustainable health care.74
zlxc | Other educational resources include articles on functionally green initiatives, which may employ con- cepts such as "Choosing wisely,"75 not using "Too Much Medicine,"76 avoiding "do not do" practices,77 optimiz- ing "high value care,"78 or minimizing its opposite - "low value care."79 Publications written in different countries are accessed by those in the United States, thus reflecting the culturally relevant reach of green physician education.80
k0bw | III. Rationale for Participation in Green Initiatives
aq5a | Highlighting the green initiatives that patients and physicians participate in and probing their motiva- tions for such participation permits strategic devel- opment of areas of consensus in sustainable health care, which can lead to green health care reform. This section speculates on broad trends in participa- tion in green health care initiatives. Patients appear to participate in green initiatives based on a valuing of nature and the desire to reduce health care issues. Doctor participation in green health care initiatives stems from an investment in health promotion and discomfort with wasteful hospital practices.
sc5y | A. Patients
0yab | Sustainability is important to patients.81 Patient involvement in sustainable health care - as with other pro-environmental actions - may be driven by a con- cern for nature having intrinsic worth, or the assess- ment that nature has instrumental worth.82 In the for- mer, nature should be preserved for the good it has in itself. This is similar to a "deep ecology" perspective,83 where animals and plants are independently valuable. In the latter, individuals want to enjoy nature, use nat- ural resources, or have these opportunities available for future human generations. Both the non-anthro- pocentric and anthropocentric perspectives guards against overuse of health care resources in order to create a better environment.
w95z | 2. REDUCE HEALTH ISSUES
0i1k | "Climate change anxiety" has emerged as a new mental health issue84 affecting those who worry pathologically about the deteriorating planet.85 Patient participation in green initiatives may be an attempt to manage cli- mate change anxiety, or it can be part of therapy for dealing with anxiety. Climate change anxiety may be regarded as an American luxury, whereas psychologi- cal issues arising from climate change health hazards - such as post-traumatic stress from climate events and fear of experiencing future climate change health hazards - require global attention. However, the entire spectrum of health care issues related to envi- ronmental destruction warrant attention.86 By reduc- ing resource use in health care, patients may be able to minimize health issues associated with climate change.
dqlg | B. Physicians
p6pq | 1. HEALTH PROMOTION
zse6 | It could easily be argued that a doctor's primary motivation for practicing medicine is the health and
p2n3 | wellbeing of patients. Since climate change is a rec- ognized health threat, some professionals see it as their obligation to practice sustainability measures in order to reduce the effects of climate change.87 Patient health could be subsumed into the broader obligations toward public health, the commitment to the healing profession, and professionalism.88 Physicians who participate in green initiatives may do so as a matter of personal integrity and professional responsibility.89
ohh7 | Effective health care reform will require compliance across the board.
