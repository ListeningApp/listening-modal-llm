Although ML analysis of multi-omics is still in its embryonic stage, it has already been explored for a wide range of applications, as reported in recent reviews on brain diseases, diabetes, cancers, cardiovascular disease, medical imaging, single-cell analysis in humans and plant science studies. Currently, many of the multi-omic reviews are focused on individual sub-topics. For example, designing studies, setting up workflows, choosing software tools and evaluating overfitted performance.\np1l0 | In contrast, this review aims at a broader focus, presenting an interdisciplinary perspective to new readers in this domain by providing a background on multi-omics and ML. It takes forward the integration terminologies introduced by Ritchie and summarizes the recent integrative state-of-the-art approaches. We aim to cover various integration methods concisely and include a recommendation flowchart enabling interdisciplinary scientists to have a quick head start in this domain.\n1i8b | Scope of this review: This review investigates the two primary learning strategies in ML, i.e., supervised and unsupervised, which are commonly used within the context of multi-omics integration. This review considers multi-omics integration as a process of combining different single omics. Although various ML specializations such as reinforcement, hybrid, multi-view and self-supervised learning are now emerging in generic healthcare applications, they have not yet gained enough momentum in multi-omics analysis, hence they remain beyond the scope of this review.\n5sfj | This paper is organized as follows. Section Two provides a short background related to multi-omics and ML. Section Three describes how ML is employed for multi-omics analysis and what are the various real-world challenges of it. In Section Four, details of different multi-omics integration approaches are presented. Section Five, published multi-omics studies using ML methods are discussed. Section Six describes a recommendation flowchart for choosing an appropriate method for multi-omics integration. Conclusions are provided in Section Seven.\nvk4h | Two. Background\nnsm3 | Two point one. Multi-omics\njdfw | In living beings, genetic information in the cells flows from DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) to the mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) to protein and is dictated by the central dogma of molecular biology. This flow of information is often considered analogous to a computer system which has facilitated the understanding of biological information processing.\nuc9r | The study of DNA, mRNA and proteins is broadly denoted as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics respectively. The genetic blueprint of a cell is explored using genomics, which looks at the DNA of individuals and helps us to investigate the presence or absence of certain genes.\nl0ap | are actively expressed and provides information about what is happening at the cellular level. Proteomics helps in characterizing the information flow happening within the cell and the organism in the form of protein pathways and their networks.\nx815 | Although metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics do not form part of the central dogma analysis, they still provide an invaluable amount of information regarding the metabolites, lipids and glycans (synthesized by the proteome via biosynthetic pathways). These substances are the intermediate products of a cell's information flow and therefore are considered to be excellent indicators of the cell's activity. Similar to single-genome studies, metagenomics is used to sequence genetic information from environmental samples without the requirement of isolating individual species.\n```",
