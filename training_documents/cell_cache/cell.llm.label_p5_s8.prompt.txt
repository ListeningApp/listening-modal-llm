o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

byu8 | It might seem that with more sensitive analysis, the ZGA timing in other mammals would shift into earlier stages and the minor ZGA could occur as early as in mice. In fact, Xue et al. reported minor ZGA in human 1-cell embryos [15]. However, there are two arguments against this possibility. First, some of the evidence for early human genome activation is possibly an experimental artifact, especially when the analysis is restricted to polyA RNA (Fig. B). Second, the whole transcription correlation data paint a different picture when comparing mice with human or bovine early embryos (Fig.)
76b0 | The mouse model is exceptional in that minor and major ZGA produce distinct sets of RNAs that are separated by the cleavage between 1-cell to 2-cell embryos. This can be visualized as a dif- ference in developmental stage transcriptome correlations when
zxz6 | separating exon and intron NGS data in mice (Fig.). When such analysis is done on mouse NGS, intron data show that the 1-cell zygote is already establishing a "zygotic" nature. This is apparently because introns in maternal mRNAs were already spliced out and degraded while nascent transcripts transcribed at the 1-cell stage come often from genes expressed at the 2-cell stage, but never from oocyte-specific genes. At the same time, exon data from the 1-cell zygote show its "maternal" identity (because of the high abun- dance of residual maternal mRNAs). However, such a phenomenon is not observed in bovine early development (Fig.) where one can- not place a clear boundary between minor and major ZGA. Bovine and human early embryos exhibit the major shift between maternal and zygotic transcriptomes at 8-16 cells and 4-8-cells, respectively (Fig.), indicating a later onset of major ZGA in these species com- pared to mouse.
xnth | Mice thus activate their genomes fast (in terms of cleavage stages) and their minor and major ZGA waves are separated by the first cleavage event. This appears as a novel feature that evolved in the mouse lineage while the delayed major ZGA observed in humans and bovine could be the an ancestral trait. It also seems that transcriptional activation in other mammals is more incre- mental during the early cleavage divisions than the two bursts of transcription in 1-cell and 2-cell mouse embryos.
vafm | 8. ZGA and the nature of the "zygotic program"
2zmw | While the set of genes that are transcribed during early devel- opment can be described by transcriptome profiling, the entirety of the "zygotic program" remains poorly defined. In mammalian development, the priority of the post-fertilization "zygotic pro- gram" is establishing totipotency, i.e. the ability to develop in all cell types, including extraembryonic tissues. During subsequent embryonic lineage commitment [77], the totipotency is reduced to pluripotency, i.e. ability to give rise to all cell types within the developing embryo, but not extraembryonic lineages. Thus, for oocyte-to-embryo reprogramming, three types of transcription programs (or transcription factor networks) can be distinguished:
bf9k | maternal -the oocyte transcription factor network includes oocyte-specific proteins such as FIGLA, NOBOX, LHX8, SOHLH1/2, FOXO3A (reviewed in [78]), which are responsible for accumula- tion of maternal mRNAs. As mentioned above, NGS data suggest that germ cell-specific transcription factors, which control expres- sion during oocyte growth, do not contribute to ZGA in mouse embryos [65]. This implies efficient removal or repression of these transcription factors during ovulation and after fertilization. For example, NOBOX becomes undetectable in already preovulatory oocytes [67]. In contrast to somatic cells, where transcription fac- tors are retained on mitotic chromosomes and mark promoters for transcription following entry into interphase, this is not the case for condensed metaphase II chromosomes [79].
otkr | zygotic totipotent -a transcription factor network which forms in mice during the 2-cell stage by maternally-provided zygotic genome-activating transcription factors and transcription factors expressed during minor and major ZGA. It is poorly understood how oocytes produce transcription factors that would be recruited for genome activation while not contributing to transcription in the oocyte. While an obvious candidate mechanism is dor- mancy, where translationally repressed mRNAs become translated in response to developmental stimuli (reviewed in [80]), dor- mancy of maternal transcription factors acting in ZGA has not been explored. Nevertheless, cloning experiments document that the oocyte's ability to reprogram gene expression of a somatic nucleus into a totipotent state resides in the cytoplasm [81,82]. The totipotent program forms before lineage commitment and is responsible for the totipotency of early embryo blastomeres. It

5z6q | is unclear whether this transcription program can exist as a sta- ble program as it has two transient components: transcription factors encoded by maternal RNAs and by genes silenced at the end of the 2-cell stage. Interestingly, analysis of ESCs revealed a minor subpopulation of cells with 2-cell-like expression pattern (e.g. expressing MuERV-L) suggesting that the zygotic totipotent program might be induced in cultured cells) [83].
yeoh | embryonic pluripotent - this transcription factor network is equivalent to that of ESCs and gives cells their pluripotent prop- erties (reviewed in [84]). A subset of these transcription factors, the famous "Yamanaka" factor combination of Pou5f1, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, is sufficient to reprogram gene expression and induce pluripotency in differentiated somatic cells [16]. Importantly, the pluripotent program is inter-related with the zygotic transcription factor network because its formation is initiated during ZGA (Fig.).
b8hf | The set of transcription factors and binding sites in the regu- lated genes that constitute mammalian <LATEX>\mathrm { Z C A }</LATEX> is poorly defined, but details of these gene regulatory networks are emerging. A part of the mammalian ZGA gene regulatory network appears to be the pluripotency network [85]. This raises the question to what extent is ZGA related to induction of the core pluripotency net- work. The answer is that although the major ZGA and induction of the core pluripotency network have some overlap, the two events are distinct. The contribution of core pluripotency factors to mam- malian major ZGA seems small judging by the frequency of known binding sites of the core pluripotency factors [86] in proximity of genes transcribed during major ZGA (Svoboda and Franke, unpub- lished observation). Furthermore, zygotes lacking both maternal and zygotic Oct4a expression can still activate the genome and form a Nanog-expressing inner cell mass [87]. This situation con- trasts with zebrafish where a conserved core network component consisting of Nanog, Pou5f1, and SoxB1 family members represent >75% of transcripts during the first wave of zygotic gene expression [88].
hntf | In mice, transcripts of most of pluripotency factors are present in the blastocyst, which is consistent with the origin of ESCs (Fig. D). About a half of the factors are expressed maternally while the other half appear in early embryos. Among Pou5f1, Sox2, and Nanog, whose homologs constitute the maternal foundation of ZGA in zebrafish [88], only Pou5f1 is expressed maternally, whereas Sox2 is transiently expressed at the 2-cell stage and then again in blastocysts. Klf4 is one of the few pluripotency factors strongly expressed during major ZGA in mice. Nanog is first expressed in 2-cell embryos and its transcripts accumulate until the blastocyst stage. Taken together, the mouse model suggests that a fraction of the core pluripotency factors is provided maternally to initi- ate a reprogramming transcription factor cascade that forms the core pluripotency network controlling the pluripotent state of inner mass cells.
99fo | However, when performing a similar expression analysis in bovine or human embryos, striking differences in terms of tem- poral/stage expression of pluripotency factors emerge (Fig. D). This high variability implies that the core pluripotency network during early mammalian development could be established in mul- tiple ways. Also, this evolving variability in maternal and zygotic appearance of pluripotency factors could contribute to reproduc- tive barriers emerging during speciation. One could envision that maternally provided pluripotency transcription factors initiating the core pluripotency network formation (and genome activation in general) in a defined sequence would fail to activate the genome in another species. Such a post-zygotic reproductive barrier would be a more cos-effective solution than hybrid sterility. In any case, the mammalian core pluripotency circuitry appears linked to ances- tral vertebrate ZGA, but in mammals it evolved into a pluripotency program in inner cell mass cells upon their separation from extra- embryonic lineages.
y5r7 | If the core pluripotency circuitry makes a minor contribution to mammalian zygotic transcription programs, can other contributory factors be defined? An important insight into the murine zygotic transcription programs comes from detailed analysis of ESCs. As mentioned above, a small fraction (~1%) of ESCs express an LTR retrotransposon mouse endogenous retrovirus type L (MuERV-L) [83]. MuERV retrotransposons [89,90] are transiently expressed during ZGA where they comprise a significant fraction of mRNAs [58,91]. This minor ESC population expressing MuERV-L sequences has unique characteristics in terms of gene expression and totipo- tency which is normally found in blastomeres of the 2-cell zygote [83]. This finding suggests that the pluripotent potential of ESCs does not only stochastically fluctuate "forward" towards differen- tiation, but also "back" towards a totipotent state [83] and that "totipotency" indeed might exist as an expression program driven by a defined set of transcription factors.
lrry | Whether MuERV-L is an active player in this fluctuation and whether it is a unique feature of the mouse model is an open question. MuERV-L engagement in transcription in 2-cell zygotes appears primarily a consequence of MuERV-L survival strategy. Retrotransposon expansion in the genome requires retro- transposition to occur during the germline cycle. Consequently, retrotransposons sequences adapt such that they would be rec- ognized and transcriptionally activated during the germline cycle. Accordingly, MuERV-L LTRs evolved to recruit transcription factors initiating gene expression in zygotes. Consequently, as MuERV- L had been spreading through the mouse genome, it would be distributing zygotic genome activation platforms that could be recruited for novel functions during ZGA. In fact, many LTRs of the ERVL retrotransposon family to contributed to the separation of maternal and zygotic programs in mammals [92]. Studies of transcriptional control of reveal factors/mechanisms contributing to murine <LATEX>Z G A \left[ 9 3 - 9 7 \right] .</LATEX> One of the remarkable MuERV-L regulators is a double homeobox gene Dux4, which has been recently implicated in ZGA [70-72]. Dux4 becomes transiently expressed during minor ZGA[65] and, as an intron-less gene local- ized in a tandemly duplicated locus, is the primary candidate for a transcription factor involved in ZGA. Dux4 also fits into the model that the earliest transcribed genes are short and newly evolved [98].
hvhm | 9. Conclusions
863b | Mammalian OET is characterized by relatively long transition between the maternal and zygotic gene expression which involves only a small number of cleavages a zygote. This likely reflects the need to produce a totipotent early embryo, which undergoes separation of extraembryonic and embryonic lineages. There is a variable timing of the major ZGA; the early onset in mice seems to be a derived character while blastomeres of other mammals undergo several cleavages before the major ZGA. Advances in high throughput methods have been providing a comprehensive picture of gene expression and, lately, also chromatin dynamics during OET. However, there is a number of issues that still need to be addressed. Of a particular interest are determination of variable and consti- tutive parts of genome reprogramming and identification of the set of maternally provided transcription factors, which would be sufficient to drive OET. Also of interest are mechanisms assuring that transcription factors driving the maternal and zygotic tran- scription do not interfere as well as events that lead to the early genome activation during evolution of mice. Improved understand- ing of molecular mechanisms underlying OET will translate into more efficient manipulation of a cell-fate, which is of fundamental importance for biotechnology and medicine.
