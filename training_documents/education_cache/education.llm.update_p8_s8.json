        "content": "ftfg | The future of higher education in a disruptive world\n7xi5 | The future of higher education in a disruptive world\nw8r5 | Disruption is underway\nybik | The ability to transform will be the critical one for all education institutions to cultivate, so they can shape and respond to a changing world of education.\ngii5 | The future of higher education in a disruptive world\nq5eu | The story of universities in the previous section required generalization. Some jurisdictions will continue to support higher education more than others. Some institutions in those jurisdictions will be more successful than others because of hard work, inheritance, location, or good fortune.\na7ao | There are, however, some major drivers of global change affecting us all and from which no institution could be completely immune. The fourth industrial revolution, a fusion of exponential technologies where silicon and carbon meet, will prove to be as profound as the previous revolutions driven by steam, electricity, and computing.\n29a3 | Each of the earlier revolutions was accompanied by changes in the mode of education and the institutions that provided it. The school classroom, the worker's institute, the civic, technological and research university, can all be matched with the economic and social needs of their times. There is no reason to expect that the new revolution will be different, but we are at the early stages of thinking about the corresponding changes needed in education. In the view of this report's author, the ability to transform will be the critical one for all education institutions to cultivate, so they can shape and respond to a changing world of education.\nsb1e | Demographic changes are also underway that influence everything deeply. Some jurisdictions have aging populations, low fertility rates, and a shrinking 'support ratio' of working-age people twenty-five to sixty-four to those sixty-five and older. By twenty fifty, the United Nations believes that forty-eight countries and territories are likely to have support ratios below two. By contrast, other jurisdictions have fertility rates well above the replacement rate of two point one, huge young populations, and growing middle classes. Power and influence are shifting inexorably as a result, in what has been described as a global rebalancing between East and West.\nw2yn | Universities have experienced this in various ways. Declining domestic enrollments in the U S, for example, have been partly offset by growing international numbers. Australia and Canada, which also rely on immigration to maintain population growth, have aggressively promoted their universities as destinations that will strengthen a migration claim. The U K, leaving the European Union, has declared itself \"open for talent,\" with longer post-study work rights as part of the inducement.\nap6l | Whatever the eventual impact of the pandemic, international student mobility will not last forever at these levels. China's domestic university system is improving rapidly, such that it is a study destination. India is investing heavily in its own post-secondary institutions. And we might be seeing a shift in demand internationally away from traditional university study towards more vocational, practical courses. Those universities in low fertility rate jurisdictions which have hitched their business model to international students will urgently need to revisit their strategy and reduce their costs.\niest | The potential implications of climate change pervade the whole world, as do the implications of policies designed to address global warming. We can expect enormous opportunities for research to enhance our understanding of the situation and the efficacy of policy. Similarly, technologies that will help us to live and work differently, ideally towards zero net emissions, will likely be based on discoveries by universities and research institutes.\ncox8 | But universities themselves, as public purpose organizations, will need to be exemplars, reducing their emissions from campus operations and doing things differently. International student physical mobility and conference attendance, for example, will be harder to justify when practical alternatives are becoming available. Frugality and cost-benefit thinking will move to center stage.\nppqi | Finally, in this list of change drivers from which no one is immune is the era that Forrester Research calls the 'Age of the Customer'\noxou | Universities in low fertility rate jurisdictions which have hitched their business model to international students will urgently need to revisit their strategy and reduce their costs.\n495n | The future of higher education in a disruptive world\nawri | The idea of consumer sovereignty is not new, but its application in practice has been restricted. If consumers didn't know about better alternatives or could not exercise them, or couldn't hear about other consumers' experiences, they stuck with what they knew and what was easily available. Now, with social media, abundant product information, online purchasing, and the ability to switch preferences quickly, consumer sovereignty is becoming a reality.\nbl28 | No business can ignore Customer Experience. And the sector is starting to see this in universities, although KPMG education specialists also argue that this should be developed into a more complex idea of Student Experience, which adds in Learner Experience and Personalized Experience, so that:\nd5bz | In the last two decades, many higher education systems have fostered competition between providers to create quasi-markets as those systems moved from elite to mass participation. But the choice of the student was typically constrained by resources, geography, and information.\nap5o | Now these barriers to choice are being overcome. The next shift will likely be from mass face-to-face to mass digital learning. The modal way of engaging with learning is starting to flip.\n7zvf | The future of higher education in a disruptive world\nmov9 | In recent years, there has been talk in the sector about blended and flexible learning, but the reality has been that online resources have supplemented the dominant mode of delivery, which was synchronous and in-person. Spurred by the pandemic, but probably coming anyway, is the reverse situation. Courses will be designed to be delivered through technology - 'digital first' - and supplemented by face-to-face, human support.\nks7m | It is early days, but the written word is already being accompanied by video, mixed reality, and simulations, with realistic holograms a possibility. Smart bots for every subject open up the possibility of personalized learning at scale, monitored by advanced learning analytics. And if the student does not have to leave home or work to experience this (unless they wish to), consumer choice finally opens up. The Age of the Customer is now hitting universities.\nw1w1 | One might predict that some universities will deliberately promote a physical experience on campus as part of their value proposition. If they have the brand to keep attracting demand, they will always have their place - but they will become the minority. There is also a midway point between physical-learning and virtual-learning environments: the augmented-learning environment, where attendance at a place is overlaid with a much richer view, enabling a deep experience from modest premises.\nh8gv | One thing is clear. The university that expects students to battle with traffic, find a parking place, go to a lecture, write examinations by hand, get a seat in a crowded library and then go home again will be riding its luck.\nkwkp | Four building blocks for transforming and optimizing\nyj0m | As mentioned earlier many higher-education institutions around the world are at or approaching a crossroads. This applies to strategy and to operating model.\newfp | - Do they transform?\noczy | Do they optimize?\n2ttg | Do they do nothing and react later?\nhis3 | - Do they do nothing and take the risk?\nm50z | KPMG education specialists advise against the fourth of these scenarios, except perhaps for the very few institutions with brands and resources that make the status quo a safer option than any of the known alternatives.\nme84 | The third scenario (reacting later) might be a reasonable strategy for a further minority which believe they have time on their side and the ability to pivot quickly if they need to. Being wrong about this could be costly, however.\no56m | For the majority of institutions, the realistic choice likely falls between transforming their operating model, and all that goes along with this, in a reasonably short period, or achieving the same outcome over a longer period, spreading the expense and workload - that is, optimizing - while taking the risk of fresh disruption upending them in the meantime.\nslz6 | Transform or optimize?\n90k5 | Transformation\n9m8s | Operating model transformation is required where an organization has significantly changed its strategic ambition or requires a fundamental shift in its value proposition and business model.\n893y | Optimization\nfavz | Operating model optimization is where an organization needs to improve its organizational effectiveness and efficiency in order to improve performance to meet its strategic ambition and enact its business model.",
