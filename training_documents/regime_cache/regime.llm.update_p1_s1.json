Statistical physics provides a formulation to study the macroscopic properties of interacting particle systems based on the behavior of their microscopic constituents. Its numerical realization, known as \"molecular dynamics\", has played an essential role in science for the past seventy years. One of the major aims of molecular dynamics is to compute macroscopic quantities or thermodynamic properties, typically given by averages of basic dynamical variables, which allows to obtain quantitative information on a system. Molecular dynamics can be thought of as a numerical microscope, as it bridges the gap between theoretical and experimental work, playing an important part across (essentially) all of science.\n5vry | One particular interest in molecular dynamics is the computation of transport coefficients, such as the mobility, thermal conductivity and shear viscosity. At the macroscopic level, transport coefficients relate an external forcing acting on the system (i.e. a perturbation on the equilibrium dynamics) to an average response expressed through some steady-state flux (of energy, momentum, charged particles etc). From a mathematical perspective, this can be done by introducing a reference dynamics which models systems at equilibrium, and perturbing it by some external forcing of magnitude N in the set of real numbers mimicking the driving exerted on the system to create some flux. This corresponds to the so-called nonequilibrium molecular dynamics.\n9w33 | To realize this in molecular dynamics simulations, we consider general perturbed dynamics of the form\njohv | dX equals (b of X plus nF of X) dt plus sigma of X dW sub t,\n2olp | where F is the external forcing and n in the set of real numbers its magnitude, and W sub t a standard Brownian\nzb7x | motion. In general, it is observed that the response E of n of R of the system, given by the steady-state average of a physical observable R of interest which has average zero for unperturbed dynamics (n equal zero), is proportional to the magnitude of the forcing for small values of the forcing. This corresponds to the linear response regime; see Figure one. When this is the case, the linear response p sub one is computed as\nuadf | P sub one equals limit as n approaches zero of E of n of R divided by E of zero of R.\nwuf4 | (One point one)\nlfk1 | By definition, transport coefficients are the proportionality constants p sub one relating the response E of n of R to the forcing for n small. One typical example is the case where the force F is constant and the configuration space is a torus. Such a forcing is considered to compute the mobility of particles in the system, which we discuss in more detail in Section Two point two point three. Another example is the case where F has components in one direction only, whose magnitude depends on the position in another direction. Such forcings can be used to estimate the shear viscosity through the so-called sinusoidal transverse force method.\nrwjw | In practice, steady-state averages involved in the linear response are computed as ergodic averages over a very long trajectory of the system, obtained as a realization of the stochastic differential equation (SDE) (Two point four). Although there are several such ways of computing these steady-state averages, it is typically done in one of two ways: either based on (i) equilibrium techniques based on Green-Kubo formulae, which are integrated autocorrelation functions; or (ii) nonequilibrium steady-state methods where the limit (One point one) is numerically estimated. Both numerical methods have advantages and drawbacks, and are constantly undergoing algorithmic advances. In this work, however, we focus exclusively on the nonequilibrium approach.\niazp | In the NEMD approach, a standard estimator to compute the linear response (One point one) is\nksn3 | (One point two) I of n,t equals integral from zero to t of R of X ds,\n8xbx | where the fixed value of n not equal to zero should be small enough in absolute value in order for the nonlinear part of the response to be negligible. Although there are various sources of error associated with the estimator (One point two), as made precise in Section Two point three, the variance associated with (One point two) is the main issue. In particular, in the context of computing transport coefficients, the large signal-to-noise ratio leads to a very large statistical error, as we are averaging very small linear responses. The estimator (One point two), for instance, has asymptotic variance of order big O of t to the negative one times n to the negative two, much larger than the usual asymptotic variance of order big O of t to the negative one associated with its equilibrium averages counterpart, as the linear regime is only valid for n less than one. This motivates the interest of variance reduction techniques, which are used to decrease the statistical error in the estimated averages. Examples of standard variance reduction techniques for Monte Carlo simulations are antithetic variables, stratification, control variate methods and importance sampling.\naod5 | One of the main challenges with computing nonequilibrium steady-state averages, however, is that traditional equilibrium variance reduction techniques cannot be used the same way. Although many practitioners of molecular dynamics realize that the computation of transport coefficients is a difficult numerical issue, there were only a handful\nayqs | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS\njnpq | of attempts to develop dedicated variance reduction techniques. Many practitioners still use direct, brute force numerical methods based on a time integration of the dynamics.\nr4w4 | In order to reduce the statistical error of order one divided by (n squared t), one idea is to extend the regime of linear response, which consequently allows to use larger values of n. One approach for doing so is to use synthetic forcings. Such forcings, as presented in this work, were introduced by Evans and Morriss (synthetic fields, in their terminology) with the purpose to produce a mechanical analog of a thermal transport process. This notion was originally used by Gillan and Dixon, then abstracted and extended by Evans and Morriss. The name synthetic is used to denote that the external fields under consideration do not exist in nature.\nsswz | The key idea behind synthetic forcings is that there are infinitely many forcings which lead to the same transport coefficient. This flexibility should be used to develop better numerical methods for the computation of transport coefficients. In theory, one can add an extra forcing to the physical perturbation of the system, as long as this extra forcing preserves the invariant measure of the reference system, which in turn preserves the linear response. We call the resulting perturbation a synthetic forcing, as it has no physical representation; it is a mathematical device used to simplify the problem at hand.\n0uoj | The aim is to find synthetic perturbations allowing to reduce the nonlinear part of the response as much as possible (see Figure one) in order to consider larger values of n. In this article, we present a mathematical framework for choosing and quantifying the quality of synthetic forcings, in the context of linear response theory, and discuss various possible choices for them. We illustrate the analysis with numerical results in low dimensional systems.\n0c89 | This work is organized as follows. We present in Section two a review of linear",
