You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

3c47 | Metabolomics and proteomics have been integrated using RF for analysis of prostate cancer (Fan et al., 2011) and thyroid functioning (Pietzner et al., 2017). Similarly, metabolomics is integrated with mRNA for studying ulcerative colitis (Bjerrum et al., 2014) and cancer survival (Kim et al., 2014). On the other hand, glycomics and epigenomics have only appeared once in the multi-omics context (along with mRNA and metabolomics) and used by Zierer (Zierer et al., 2016) for the study of age-related comorbidities using a graphical variant of RF.
g345 | Recently, metabolomics and proteomics have also been integrated with lipidomics to evaluate COVID-19 patients using PLS-DA (Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis) and Extra Trees (Overmyer et al., 2020; Thomas et al., 2020).
svhz | Multi-omics studies have also been successfully conducted in plants (potato (Acharjee et al., 2016, Acharjee et al., 2011)) and animals (such as canine heart disease (Li et al., 2015)).
oaen | Overall, the different recent multi-omics studies highlight the supe- riority of integration methods in understanding the complexity of different diseases and uncovering the underlying abnormalities from the vastly generated multi-omics data, which is not always possible with individual omics analysis.
5u67 | 6. Recommendations
dvms | Today a plethora of multi-omic integration methods are available for both supervised and unsupervised learning as evident in the current review. This information can overwhelm interdisciplinary scientists and would require a time-consuming effort to understand the challenging mathematical and computational concepts behind them. Hence, we suggest that interdisciplinary teams working on multi-omics always include ML practitioners to assist with the choice of methods, the development of solutions, the interpretation of results and their signif- icance and limits. Such truly interdisciplinary teams offer real oppor- tunities for better mutual understanding of the different fields, practice and expertise necessary, leading ultimately to more robust conclusions. Also, to facilitate the method selection process, a recommendation flowchart is proposed in Fig. 3. It shows the various decision steps required for choosing an appropriate method (or family of methods) for a given scenario. For example, to choose a method for integrating two omics for unsupervised learning one can choose a model-based method such as 'PSDF or Lemon-Tree' if the two omics are gene expression and CNV, otherwise 'MDI or SNF' can be used. Similarly, 'NEMO' can be used in scenarios where the datasets are partially overlapping, and a trans- formation approach is required. Hence, it can be used for biomedical analysis, including diagnosis, prognosis and biomarker identification, by posing them as supervised or unsupervised learning problems.
qrd3 | Clearly, a 'one-size-fits-all' approach is not feasible. Also,
rxrg | unfortunately, the existing literature does not provide many direct comparisons between methods using the same publicly available data- sets. Hence, to choose the best method which suits a given dataset and question, an empirical approach that investigates the use of different methods, guided by ML practitioners is recommended.
tf43 | 7. Conclusions
fcco | This paper reviewed various ML approaches used for the integration of multi-omics data for analysis. A concise background of multi-omics and ML was presented. It examined the concatenation-, model- and transformation-based integration methods, employed for multi-omics data along with their advantages and disadvantages. Also, various existing multi-omics studies have been summarised. Finally, a recom- mendation flowchart is presented for interdisciplinary professionals to choose an appropriate method for a multi-omics dataset. Overall, this work showcases the recent findings in the multi-omics domain and signifies the key role of ML in the future of personalised healthcare.
