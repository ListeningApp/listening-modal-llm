You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

m4cb | The digestibility of starch is an important factor in determining the availability of glucose in feed formulations. The enzyme a-amylase hydrolyses starch into maltose. Additional enzymes, maltase and isomaltase, then hydrolyse maltose further into glucose. These enzymes are present in the gastrointestinal tract of fish and shrimp but their activity and effectiveness vary between species. Data are limited for crustacean species (Table II) but in fish, a reduction in digestibility is observed when the dietary level of starch increases, irrespective of the starch origin.
m61y | According to Stone (2003) the reduction in the digestibility of carbohydrates when dietary levels increase may be the result of an overload on the digestive enzymes that become saturated with substrate. The threshold for enzyme saturation by substrate is unknown in crustaceans and it is not apparent in the data shown in Table II.
u2ob | Herbivorous species of fish have high activity and efficacy of starch degrading enzymes. Omnivorous species have moderate activity whilst carnivores have only a limited ability to digest starch.
2gnm | Since cellulase is quite rare in the animal kingdom, it is generally believed that the source of cellulase in decapod crustaceans is exogenous - symbiotic organisms living in the hepatopancreas. Even so, Yokoe and Yasumasu (1964) found more cellulase activity in hepatopancreas extracts from Procambarus clarkii than shown by Gram- negative bacteria living in the digestive tract.
emgw | 3.3 Lipases and esterases
xaqt | Lipids, like carbohydrates and proteins, are cleaved by hydrolysis reactions. Otherwise, lipid digestion and absorption are fundamentally different because lipid is not water soluble and coalesces into large droplets in water. The low surface-to-volume ratio of a large lipid droplet is not conducive to effective digestion by lipases, and so emulsification is extremely important for lipid digestion. Emulsification stabilizes small lipid droplets in
5rcb | aqueous solution by coating them with molecules that are partly hydrophobic (to dissolve in the lipid droplet) and partly hydrophilic (to dissolve in water).
524j | Vertebrates produce bile in their livers, which flows into the small intestine. Bile salts are moderately effective emulsifying agents and become much more effective in concert with polar lipids such as monoglycerides (the digestive products of triglycerides) and phospholipids (Kanazawa, 1985) (Fig. 9).
xd3m | Invertebrates do not produce bile. Lipase enzymes attach to lipid droplets which form an emulsion and hydrolyse triglycerides to 2-monoglycerides, some glycerol and free fatty acids. Phospholipids play a significant role in lipid emulsification in crustaceans.
8qb6 | Lipases which are capable of hydrolysing triglycerides and phospholipids (Table III) have been observed in several species of shrimp (Deering et al., 1996; González et al., 1994; Moss et al., 2001). Due to their function, lipases are commonly named esterases, although they almost exclusively hydrolyse carboxylic esters.
wkbn | The presence of real lipases in the shrimp hepatopancreas has been a point of disagreement among specialists working on the physiology and biochemistry of these species, since most of the techniques employed in their study cannot establish whether the lipolytic activity found was due to real lipases or to non-specific esterases.
ftfg | Both triglyceride lipase and phospholipase have been observed in Litopenaeus vannamei (del Monte et al., 2003; Forrellat et al., 2004). A comparison of substrate specificity of lipases from Litopenaeus schmitti indicated a strong preference for n-3 (w-3) and n-6 (w-6) fatty acids (del Monte et al., 2002). Studies of lipases from Litopenaeus vannamei, Farfantepenaeus californiensis and Farfantepenaeus notialis, showed similar preferences (Forrellat et al., 2004). Note, with the exception of the land snail (Cepaea nemoralis) animals are incapable of de novo synthesis of fatty acids with double bonds in the n-6 (linoleic series) and n-3 (linolenic series) positions; only plants are able to synthesize these fatty acids de novo.
7xi5 | Lipases and esterases are associated with the microvilli of R-cells as well as vacuoles of F-cells, the lumen of the hepatopancreas tubules and in intertubular connective tissue (López-López et al., 2005).
w8r5 | 4. Changes in enzyme activity
ybik | Large changes in enzyme activity are observed during moulting (e.g. trypsin and chitinase) (Sainz Hernández & Cordova Murueta, 2009). Chitinase digests the old exoskeleton so it can be resorbed and replaced by newly synthesized chitin. The production of digestive enzymes also seems to vary throughout the year and even within a species, depending upon the available nutrient resources or stage of development (e.g. Biesiot & Capuzzo, 1990). The Caridean shrimp (Crangon crangon) has high trypsin activity during the summer and low activity during the winter (Pöhlmann, 2007; Sahlmann, 2008).
gii5 | Adjustments to diet composition for proteases, lipolytic enzymes and amylase have been shown for many species. The responses vary among species. In some species, responses are seen in proteolytic and amylase activity but not in lipolytic activity, but for other species, amylase and/or protease activity seem unresponsive (Gamboa- Delgado et al., 2003; López-López et al., 2005; Moss et al., 2001). A high dietary starch content was found to increase the specific activity of a-amylase and a-glucosidase in Litopenaeus vannamei (Gaxiola et al., 2005; Le Moullac et al., 1997). The same species has shown variation in trypsin and chymotrypsin activity with variation in protein level (Le Moullac et al., 1997; Lemos et al., 2000; Muhlia-Almazán & García- Carreño, 2003; Muhlia- Almazan et al., 2008). The magnitude of the stimulation seems to depend on the species and the dietary protein source.
q5eu | Digestive enzymes seem to be released from the hepatopancreas upon feeding (Ong & Johnston, 2006). Passage of food from the midgut to the stomach has been found to induce additional synthesis and secretion of enzymes (Vogt et al., 1989). The release of digestive enzymes by the hepatopancreas is influenced by the endocrine system. For example, crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone (CHH) induces the release of proteases and amylases from the hepatopancreas (Dietrich, 1988); this organ is also responsive to a variety of vertebrate gastrointestinal hormones (Resch-Sedlmeier & Sedlmeier, 1999).
