You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

twwy | i) An Overview of the Major Organs and Tracts In the Male Genito- urinary System (Figure 1): The genitourinary system of both males and females includes two kidneys, each with a ureter leading from the kidney to the urinary bladder, and one urethra. In both genders, the reproductive organs are closely aligned and included in this body system. In males the reproductive organs and tract include two testes, two epididymites, two ductus deferens, one prostate gland, and two seminal vesicles, as well as the two ampullas and ejaculatory ducts leading from the ductus deferens to the prostate gland, and a single urethra through which both urine and semen flow. The urethra leads from the urinary bladder through the prostate gland through the penis to end at the urethral meatus or opening. The bulbourethral gland or Cowper's gland sits at the base of the prostate. The penile structures include the corpora cavernosa, corpora spongiosum, the penile shaft, glans penis, and the prepuce or foreskin.
fyp8 | ii) Each of These Organs and Tracts Will Be Described in More Detail Below
z994 | 2) THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT: SEX DETERMINATION AND SEX DIFFERENTIATION: There are two processes that occur during development of the gonads and the reproductive tract, its organs, and external genitalia- these processes are termed sex determination followed by sex differentiation
vvqn | a) Sex determination: During early embryogenesis for the first 6 weeks, there are no observable sexual differences between XX and XY fetuses apart from their chromosomes. A urogenital ridge (the precursor of the adrenals, urinary, and genital systems) forms on the ventral side of the mesonephros and appears as a paired thickening of intermediate mesoderm, which will ultimately be composed of somatic and germ cells. For the genital ridge to form, there must be sufficient expression of two proteins, Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) and SF1, an orphan nuclear receptor. SF1 is a dosage sensitive gene, and loss of a copy can induce sex reversal in XY individuals. The primordial germ cells, cells derived from the proximal epiblast, migrate through the primitive streak into the extra-embryonic region at the base of the yolk sack by the 4th week of gestation. This migration is driven by the kit ligand signaling system (KITL, also known as stem cell factor, steel factor, or mast cell growth factor) expressed in the gonadal ridge and hindgut along the pathway of migration.
p6xg | b) Testis Determination: In the 1940s a fascinating series of experiments by Dr. Alfred Jost showed that the presence of a testis during development drives the development of the internal and external genitalia along the male pathway. In the absence of any gonad, the internal reproductive tract and external genitalia develop along the female pathway.
bppc | 4.6
ilnw | i) Male Sexual Determination: The Importance of the sex-determining region on the Y chromosome (SRY), but sex determination is more complex than just one gene: SRY is the testis-determining factor because it upregulates SOX9 gene expression and the transcription factor SOX9 is now considered by many to be the master testis determining factor. Thus, SRY, which tilts the balance between testis and ovarian directing gene expression, is necessary but not sufficient for testis determination, and both the timing of expression and the level of expression are critical factors. SOX9 either succeeds in determining Sertoli cell differentiation or is silenced by other genes that enact ovarian differentiation-it is a true battle of the sexes! It is important to be aware that there are a number of genes that must be expressed during early fetal gonadal sexual differentiation to effectively elicit the development of a functional testis or ovary (Figure 2). For the purposes of this course the take home message is that both SRY and SOX9 actions are required for testis differentiation.
f3rc | (1) Sertoli cell differentiation requires the actions of not only SRY, but also fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9), and cord formation is dependent on the basal lamina deposition between the Sertoli and peritubular myoid cells-these cords will form the seminiferous tubules.
d7bx | (2) Leydig cell differentiation: the origin of the fetal Leydig cells is not clearly understood, but they are present at around 8 weeks of gestation and begin to produce testosterone, which is needed for the maintenance of the wolffian ducts and masculinization of the external genitalia. At this time the Leydig cell is stimulated by placental hCG (first and second trimesters) and later by fetal pituitary LH. The Leydig cells also secrete insulin-like growth factor 3 (INSL3) that is responsible for the first, transabdominal phase, of testicular descent.
gx97 | (3) Germ cell differentiation: By the end of the 5th week of gestation, the germ cells have arrived at the genital ridge and proliferate. These germ cells are encompassed by the cells forming the seminiferous cords and differentiate into spermatogonial precursors but do not enter

8br6 | the meiotic pathway, unlike the events occurring in the fetal ovary during development. In the absence of germ cell migration to the genital ridge or lack of survival, the testis will continue to develop, unlike the fetal ovary which requires germ cell migration through meiosis (if this does not occur the follicular cells degenerate and streak gonads develop) (Figure 3).
de3k | (1) The wolffian ducts are derived from the intermediate mesoderm and ultimately give rise to the kidney and the proximal male genital tract. As a result, when kidney development is abnormal it is likely that there are other malformations of the urinary and/or reproductive systems.
2kb3 | (2) The müllerian ducts are derived from the coelomic epithelium and will later form to develop the Fallopian tubes, the ducts in the pelvic region fuse to give rise to the uterovaginal canal. In the female, the wolffian duct begins to regress at about 2 months of gestation.
lqcx | (3) Regression of müllerian ducts and differentiation of the wolffian duct into the male accessory organs is a key element of male differentiation of the internal reproductive tract organs: The initial indication of male differentiation of the genital tract occurs in about 55-60 day old embryos. The müllerian duct first undergoes epithelial to Bipotential Gonad mesenchymal transformation and a wave of Genads apoptosis spreads along the müllerian duct. The connections between the mesonephric Müllerian Duct tubules and gonadal primordium are Male Hormones: Wolffian MIS Duct No Male established by week 6 of gestation and give Testosterone Hormones Ins13 rise to the rete testis. The wolffian duct survives and the upper part gives rise to the epididymis and, below that, the vas deferens.
