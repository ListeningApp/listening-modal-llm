You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

z8f7 | Cancer 3D Models for Metallodrug Preclinical Testing
7w7j | Abstract: Despite being standard tools in research, the application of cellular and animal models in drug development is hindered by several limitations, such as limited translational significance, animal ethics, and inter-species physiological differences. In this regard, 3D cellular models can be presented as a step forward in biomedical research, allowing for mimicking tissue complexity more accurately than traditional 2D models, while also contributing to reducing the use of animal models. In cancer research, 3D models have the potential to replicate the tumor microenvironment, which is a key modulator of cancer cell behavior and drug response. These features make cancer 3D models prime tools for the preclinical study of anti-tumoral drugs, especially considering that there is still a need to develop effective anti-cancer drugs with high selectivity, minimal toxicity, and reduced side effects. Metallodrugs, especially transition-metal-based complexes, have been extensively studied for their therapeutic potential in cancer therapy due to their distinctive properties; however, despite the benefits of 3D models, their application in metallodrug testing is currently limited. Thus, this article reviews some of the most common types of 3D models in cancer research, as well as the application of 3D models in metallodrug preclinical studies.
51vd | 1. Introduction
baj1 | Animals as models of human anatomy, physiology, and disease pathology have been a key tool for scholars for millennia, allowing for an understanding of the human body and disease without risking human lives [1]. Even though animal models are fundamental tools in modern biomedical research for proving scientific significance, their use is being reduced and, when possible, replaced as a result of animal ethics. An ethical framework has been implemented to reduce animal usage as well as the suffering caused while doing research. Additionally, projects involving animal models must be evaluated in order to determine if the costs outweigh the benefits [2]. Besides the ethical concerns, scientific issues also need to be considered, particularly in the biological evaluation of novel drugs, as the genetic differences between animal models, namely mice, and humans, may lead to results without strongly supported translational significance [3-5].
n1wo | Therefore, in vitro models such as two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures, arose in the 20th century as possible alternatives for the biological studies of normal gene function, disease states, therapeutic strategies, etc. [6]. Due to their simplicity and affordability, 2D monolayer cultures are considered extremely appealing for laboratory use [7]. However, these cultures lack the three-dimensionality of tissues and organs, leading to alternate tissue architecture, cell differentiation, cellular communication, and biochemical signaling in comparison with what is found in vivo [5,8]. Nonetheless, these models are still useful for a variety of cell growth and functional studies and for the production of biological therapeutics [7,9].
5bq3 | Three-dimensional (3D) models can be presented as a step further in biomedical re- search, allowing for a higher throughput and mimicking of human characteristics than animal models, while maintaining more accurate tissue signaling than 2D models [4,5]. These cell models are capable of better simulating tissue complexity, namely cell morphol- ogy, cell differentiation, gene expression, interactions between the cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM), concentration gradients, tissue stiffness, and drug response [10-12]. Fur- thermore, 3D culture models may also allow for a reduction in animal models used while still recapitulating the in vivo microenvironment, which is missing in more simple in vitro models [13]. These more advanced culture systems can be applied to several areas of fundamental and translational research, for instance, stem cell biology, toxicology, and developmental biology.

rsbu | Cancer occurs when cells accumulate genetic errors, proliferating out of control and possibly spreading to other areas of the body, forming metastasis [14]. Regarding data from 2020, it is estimated that there were around 19.3 million new cases of cancer worldwide and that nearly 10 million people died from cancer, making it the second leading cause of death around the globe [15]. Besides the major impact that cancer has on people's lives, it also represents a notorious economic impact on the whole of society. In 2020, it is estimated that the United States of America spent around 194 billion Euros on cancer care [16]. Additionally, in Europe (27 countries of the European Union, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), the overall cost of cancer was 199 billion Euros in 2018 [17]. Cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment are one of the 21st century's most important public health concerns, as demonstrated, for instance, by the EU's "Europe's Beating Cancer Plan", launched in 2021 [18], and the USA's "Cancer Moonshot", launched in 2016 [19], which aim to address, among others, a better understanding of cancer biology and the development of better therapies and diagnostic methods.
magd | Cancer cells exist in a complex cellular environment, the tumor microenvironment, which is a key modulator of cancer cell behavior [20,21]. Tumors are not only composed of cancer cells, which possess several genetic mutations that affect proper cellular functioning, but also of other cells that are present or recruited to the tumor's microenvironment, such as fibroblasts, immune cells, and endothelial cells. Moreover, the tumor's microenvironment is also composed of non-cellular components, including growth factors, ECM, cytokines, and chemokines, which act as modulators of cancer development [22,23]. The molecular com- munication established between the aberrant and normal cells, as well as the interactions with the ECM, modulates the overall tumorigenicity [24-26]. Because of these interactions, several molecules that affect crucial cellular events, such as proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, and tissue remodeling, among others, are released, creating an environment that favors cancer progression [27]. Furthermore, transmembrane cell adhesion molecules sense and transmit information regarding ECM alterations, activating signaling pathways and regulating cancer cell behavior [28].
tb74 | The complexity of the tumor's microenvironment and the interactions established with cancer cells are the main reasons 2D models fail to accurately replicate the in vivo tissue [29]. Even though 2D monolayer cell cultures have allowed for breakthrough discoveries in fundamental cancer biology, these are grown in simple and unrealistic conditions, where the cells are attached to rigid surfaces and lack three-dimensionality [30,31]. The cells grown in a 2D culture become deformed in the out-of-plane axis and are not mechanically or physically restrained, which may lead to cell behavior changes [32]. The application of these models in anti-cancer drug development hinders the efficiency of the process, leading to erroneous results [33]. This happens because drug optimization is based on conditions not found in vivo, considering that 2D models are unable to accurately mimic the microenvironment of the tumor [34,35]. Using these simple models for drug screening results in numerous drugs that do not reach the market and, consequently, pharmaceutical companies' investment losses [36].
8l69 | Considering the 3D models' capacity to more accurately replicate the tumor microen- vironment, the interest in applying these for drug development has increased over the year [37,38]. Moreover, the introduction of 3D models in drug development may also allow for a reduction in animal models, addressing some ethical concerns [13]. However, these should not be seen as the only correct tool for cancer research, but as a support approach to be used alongside 2D models before in vivo testing in animal models [39,40].
