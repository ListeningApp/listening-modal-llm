It is found in the putative Gospel of Thomas, which was found in Egypt in nineteen forty-five.\n59ph | In this story, reference is made to a, woman carrying a container\nt5gu | of meal and walking a long distance. Unknown to her, the meal flows out behind her 'and she did not know how to work'. When she arrived at her house, she put down the container and found it to be empty. This parable refers to the 'Kingdom of the Father', and its applicability to our contention about the imperceptible loss of potentiality, through a form of thoughtlessness (called by the Sufis 'heedlessness') is very apposite to this subject.\nimx8 | SELLING HALF THE HOUSE\nac5x | About giving and getting, Nasrudin visited a house-agent one day: 'I want to sell one half of the house I live in,' he said.\nqicp | 'But Mulla, I know your house - you only own one-half of it.'\n54mw | That is exactly the point. I want to sell my half to buy the other half with the money I raise from the deal.'\nocir | The Giving of Charity\ncc6v | Q: Have you any remarks to make on the giving of Charity among Sufis?\nm8ic | A: One commanding principle of all Sufis, binding upon them, is secret charity. Charity takes many forms. As to monetary charity:\n417c | If money is given with a sense of joy, that joy is 'payment' for the charity, and the good which comes to the giver is restricted to that emotion. Although this kind of giving is familiar to most people, it nevertheless remains the minor form of charity. The second part of the minor form of charity is to give in order that the person may help himself. Thus a person might buy a tool for a carpenter, so that he could earn his living. This may not be emotional, but could still be 'calculated' charity. Its limitations make it less than true charity.\n575r | Money or valuables are given by Sufis, or those who desire to be counted among them, in accordance with the principle: 'Let your left hand not know what your right hand does.'\nl3k3 | A Sufi will:\nlg54 | Give before being asked; Give whatever he has, without counting it; Give when asked;\nz6q4 | Give no emotional or calculated charity unless he can give true charity.\nwbp4 | It is meritorious to give money to a Sufi for him to distribute it. He will give it out, in large or small amounts, to those who are deserving; not necessarily in accordance with their outward need. A beggar or a poor man may get a thousand gold pieces, not just a copper coin.\n24l6 | Charity does not always involve money, as you know. Charity is not only given, as you call it. It is lived and performed, which means \"being and doing.\"\njgdb | As Saadi, the great dervish, says in his Gulistan:\n3ypu | 'You who are unmoved by others' suffering are not entitled to the name of man.' Charity has been made into a great virtue only because of the low level of human decency.\np6xi | If you still think that charity is not a necessity but a high virtue, you do not even know what your contemporaries, in your own civilisation, have discovered, and which has been published in mass-circulation newspapers on the subject. Here is an example of the charity of animals:\nnyuz | CHARITY OF THE RATS\njbh9 | Dr. J. T. Greene, of Georgia University, took ten white rats and trained them to obtain food pellets by pressing one of two levers in their cage. One lever produced fewer pellets and was hard to depress, and the rats soon found this out and ignored it, concentrating on the other. Now the experimenter wired the levers so that when the one which yielded food was pressed, a rat in the next cage received an electric shock.\nj6xs | What did the food-seeking rats do? First, they recognised that their actions were giving their neighbor pain; then no less than eight out of ten of them went over to the other lever, even though it was hard to work, and concentrated on it, saving their fellow from further harm.\neuvy | The Number of Readings of a Book\ngr44 | Q: I understand that the study of books is very important. Can you say something about how Sufis feel about reading, and the number of times a book is read?\nunx6 | A: A Sufi book will have to be read in the ordinary way several times. If the mind of the reader is not correctly prepared, he will reject the book, read it selectively, or else indoctrinate himself with the contents. All these results are undesirable.\nztem | The above facts, however, account for the effects of literature upon the minds of various people. The human mind is an organism in which what it absorbs will be to one man meat, another poison. This effect is inherent in the mind of the reader much more than in the book.\nbw7k | And yet people persist in considering books, in their possible effect upon people, as always the same. This stupidity is one of the less attractive legacies of mechanical scholasticism, which, indeed, usually requires a standardized mind to approach each and every book.\nswja | Many people are proud of how many times they have read a book. They point to well-thumbed copies as evidence of their diligence. In some circles, indeed, 'a tattered bible' is still taken as an evidence of piety.\nfbei | And yet hardly anyone knows that the condition of the book, the treatment which it has received at the hands of the reader, will leave traces upon it, which will have an effect, just as will the typeset content, long after the impressions upon the book have been made. Borrowed books carry an imprint. Books which one has used too many times carry this imprint, this 'smell of infidelity' as it is called in Persian, from one reading to another.\ny870 | It is for this reason that people are often asked to read many times several copies of the same book, even if it means buying new copies after each second reading. This is something which may not be well-known, but it is effective nevertheless. Today's refined\nfkwk | barbarian could find in such a procedure only the suspicion that it is a device to sell him more copies of a book!\n94g9 | It will be noticed from the foregoing material that our study methods are just as much concerned with matters of little-known fact as they are with psychological factors which people know but do not apply. This is why the curriculum of a School requires all-round attention to the needs of the teaching, the material taught, the students and the teacher.\n9fvk | Rumi teaches of the use of books in a book (The Diwan of Shams-i-Tabriz) where he denounces books as a source of wisdom. They are, as in the case of the one which he is writing at that moment, instrumental:\nrweo | The Man of God is a wise one by means of Truth:\nzfci | The Man of God is no lawyer from a book ...",
