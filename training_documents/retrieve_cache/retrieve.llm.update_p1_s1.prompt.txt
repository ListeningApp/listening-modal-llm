You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

e8nr | Developing Versatile Leadership
k78w | Leadership consists of opposing strengths, and most leaders have a natural tendency to overdevelop one at the expense of its counterpart. The resulting imbalance diminishes their effectiveness. But leaders who work to guard against such lopsidedness can increase their versatility and their impact.
g9du | M odern conceptions of leadership suffer from a serious limitation. Although it is generally acknowledged that effective leaders must possess a number of sometimes seem- ingly contradictory qualities and skill sets, the idea that a strength taken to an extreme can be a weakness does not seem to have registered fully in the practice of management.1 The notion that inadequate performance results from underdoing any of the requisite skills - delegating, giving direction, com- municating, cooperating with peers and so forth - is well established and reflected in most formal systems designed to assess managers for selection or development. However, the idea that performance problems can just as easily spring from taking a given behavior to an extreme has received far less attention.
f682 | Perhaps the focus on overdoing hasn't been as sharp because its problematic aspects are not immediately obvious - after all, leaders often must go to extremes to meet tough challenges. It is difficult to draw the line, however, between making the serious effort required to get things done and going too far.2 A problem commonly seen in recently promoted senior executives, for example, is their difficulty in adjusting their skill sets to the requirements of their higher-level jobs. What had, in their previous posi- tions, been a seemingly inoffensive, even useful, tendency to get heavily involved in
li1k | operational detail can become a big liability in their new roles, resulting in the misallocation of time and attention away from strategic considerations or getting in the way of direct reports' ability to do their jobs. Still, even in executive positions there are situations that require the individual to get deeply involved. For senior managers, then, effectiveness hinges on the ability to appropriately gear their leadership qualities and skills to the cir- cumstances at hand.
pbea | The lack of balance in leadership, which is linked to the idea of overdoing and is well known to individual managers, has also
ccpt | About the Research
0fpw | The research reported here proceeded in two stages. The first stage was action research: We conducted comprehensive assessments of the leadership of individ- ual senior managers by interviewing scores of coworkers, past and present, and administering a battery of psycho- logical tests. We analyzed the data rigorously and interpreted it with each executive.' Patterns gradually emerged - forcefulness taken to an extreme, enabling leadership as the complement of forceful leadership, the tendency for executives to be lopsided one way or the other and so on." Robert Kaplan then developed a 360-degree survey to meas- ure versatility, or lack thereof, on force- ful and enabling leadership. Later a second major duality - strategic and operational leadership - emerged from our ongoing action research, and we added it to the survey. Above all, the sur- vey needed a way to capture overdoing, which is integral to imbalance. The cur- rent version of that scale is:
dqn8 | In the research we have done to date, using three samples of U.S. executives and evolving generations of the 360- degree survey, now called the Leadership Versatility Index, this duality-based way of assessing versatility has proved reli- able and valid."" The current pairs of sur-
cop0 | vey items that measure versatility on each of the two dualities have good internal reliability, in the .90s for versatil- ity on the forceful/enabling duality and in the low .80s for versatility on the strategic/operational duality. In addition, ratings from superiors, peers and direct reports converge to a high degree. Indices of inter-rater reliability and inter- rater agreement easily exceed the mini- mum standard of .70 and generally reach the upper .80s within each rating group.
lhkq | We tested our hypothesis that versa- tility is central to effectiveness by corre- lating scores on a versatility index with ratings of overall effectiveness. The measure of effectiveness is a single item rated by coworkers on a 10-point scale, where 10 is outstanding and 5 is ade- quate, and our analyses indicate that this measure is reasonably reliable and valid." To arrive at an index of versatility we use the Pythagorean theorem to reduce the scores on opposing sides to a single number for each of the two dualities, forceful-enabling and strategic- operational.V
82ju | In each of the three studies we have done - two on only forceful-enabling leadership and one on both dualities - there has been a sizable correlation between the versatility index and overall effectiveness, on average in the upper .50s. This was true for ratings of all coworkers taken together and for each group (superiors, peers and direct reports) taken separately. The correlations were
y2qo | not fully registered in the practice of management. When pre- sented with two opposing approaches, people in general have a tendency to polarize, placing a high value on the approach in which they have greater faith and competence while overlooking or demeaning the value of the other. Despite their obvious intel- ligence, executives are no different. They may be too task-ori- ented and not sufficiently people-oriented, too tough and not responsive enough to people's needs, too big-picture-oriented with not enough emphasis on planning and follow-through. One strategically gifted individual, for example, called the practical
1piq | also significant when versatility and effec- tiveness were each rated by different groups. Furthermore, in the study of both dualities, the correlation between versatil- ity and effectiveness was about .60 in each case, and they each made their own contribution to predicting effectiveness, together explaining over half of the vari- ability. In other words, versatility in terms of these two dualities accounted for the majority of what it meant to be an effec- tive executive.
7fqw | process of implementing plans "operational gruel." A senior manager who made a career of turning around troubled opera- tions spoke of strategy meetings as "spending fluff time." A naturally powerful leader expressed severe misgivings about "get- along/go-along" types. Another was too attached to the idea of being "nice" to his people and harbored resentment toward man- agers who lead with obvious personal power.
rhaz | We have commonly seen imbalances like these when assessing executives in our consulting work on leadership. To address the imbalances, we have found it helpful to define leadership skills and qualities in terms of paired approaches that may look like opposites but together constitute a balanced whole.3 This view leads to the notion of leadership effectiveness as the ability to draw freely from two opposing sides as appropriate for a given situation, unencumbered by prejudice against or bias for either - in other words, the ability to be versatile. It became clear to us in our work that there are two overarching balances to be struck in that regard: the balance between forceful leadership and enabling leadership (the first to emerge and the one we have studied the most) and the balance between strategic leadership and operational leadership. That is not to say that no other major distinctions apply - that between general-management skills and technical/functional expertise, for instance - but the two highlighted here far exceed any others in importance.
wak1 | Consulting the literature and relying on our firsthand expo- sure to executive leaders, we define forceful leadership on the basis of a leader's own intellect and energy - taking charge, tak- ing stands, having leadership presence, being decisive, setting challenging expectations for people, holding them accountable, making tough calls, asking probing questions and so on. We define enabling leadership as creating conditions for other people to be forces in their own right - empowering them, being recep- tive to where others stand on issues, being responsive to the needs of others, being understanding when others don't deliver, sharing the limelight and so on.
