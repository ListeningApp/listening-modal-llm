        "content": "5bjs | For ex vivo COX-negative two activity, heparinized blood, one milliliter, was immediately transferred into two one point five milliliter polypropylene tubes, five hundred microliters each. One tube contained ten microliters of lipopolysaccharide isolated from Escherichia coli zero one eleven colon B four in zero point one percent bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffered saline solution. The second tube contained ten microliters of phosphate buffered saline and was used as the negative control sample. Samples were then incubated at thirty-seven degrees Celsius for twenty-four\nuodj | hours. Afterwards, samples were centrifuged at two thousand g for five minutes at eighteen degrees Celsius, one hundred microliters of plasma were added to four hundred microliters of methanol and homogenized. This solution was then centrifuged at six thousand g for ten minutes at eighteen degrees Celsius; supernatant was harvested and stored at negative eighty degrees Celsius until the time of P G E two concentration analysis.\nk16v | All tests were performed in duplicate and the quantification of T X B two and P G E two concentrations were performed with commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nb2lm | Laboratory tests\nti7f | Blood samples, two milliliters, were collected for measurement of hepatic function tests, alanine transaminase; alkaline phosphatase; aspartate aminotransferase; gamma-glutamyltransferase; serum albumin and total protein, and renal function tests, creatinine; urea, seven days before and seven days after anesthesia. Symmetric dimethylarginine concentration was also measured at seven days before, twenty-four hours and seven days after anesthesia in samples from all cats used in the COX inhibition evaluation.\noksu | Adverse effects\nwtow | Adverse effects and short-term postoperative complications were monitored in the twenty-four hours after first analgesic administration and reassessed on postoperative days seven and ten, suture removal. Through daily telephone contact, the owners were asked about their cats' general condition, presence of emesis, sialorrhea, diarrhea, changes in food and water intake, abnormal behavior and general aspect of the surgical wound.\no22k | Physiological variables\nnwfz | Measurements of heart rate, respiratory frequency, rectal temperature and blood glucose concentration were obtained immediately before the premedication, baseline, and one, two, four, eight, twelve and twenty-four hours after first analgesic administration.\nnvfy | Pain and sedation assessment\nmror | Pain and sedation were evaluated at the same time points as the physiological variables. Subjective pain scores were obtained from four pain scales; the visual analogue scale, Colorado State University feline acute pain scale in English, U N E S P-Botucatu multidimensional composite pain scale for assessing postoperative pain in cats in Portuguese, Brondani\nzlxc | et al. two thousand twelve, and Glasgow feline composite measure pain scale, Reid et al. two thousand seventeen. Sedation was evaluated using a scale, zero to three, no effect, mild, moderate and severe, adapted from Valverde et al. two thousand four.\nk0bw | Rescue analgesia\naq5a | Rescue medication tramadol hydrochloride, two milligrams per kilogram Cro, nidor two percent; Agener União Saúde Animal, S P, Brazil, was administered I V if C M P S-Feline scores were greater than or equal to five. Additional tramadol, one milligram per kilogram I V, could be administered if analgesia was inadequate after thirty minutes. The person that performed pain assessment was unaware of the drug administered. Cats administered rescue medication were reassessed thirty minutes after tramadol administration and up to twenty-four hours; however, the physiological variables data, pain and sedation scores recorded after rescue analgesia were excluded from the analysis.\nsc5y | Statistical analysis\n0yab | A sample size calculation was performed for ex vivo COX activity and pain assessment; need for rescue analgesia of seventy percent and twenty percent of dogs submitted to ovariohysterectomy and I V administration of fifteen or twenty-five milligrams per kilogram of dipyrone, respectively.\nw95z | Data are expressed as mean plus or minus standard deviation, parametric variables, or median, range, nonparametric variables, as appropriate. The data were tested for normality using a D'Agostino-Pearson test. A two-way analysis of variance was used to evaluate parametric data and a Kruskal-Wallis test was applied on nonparametric data. Post hoc analysis was performed with Tukey or Dunn tests to identify differences among time points and groups. The Spearman's rank correlation between pain scales was evaluated. The number of cats that required rescue analgesia was compared among groups using the Fisher exact probability test. Statistical significance was attributed if P is less than zero point zero five. Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Version seven point zero three.\n0i1k | Results\ndqlg | A total of thirty-seven cats were initially selected for participating in the study. Overall, four cats were excluded because of non-compliant preoperative behavior and three cats were excluded because of pregnancy. Groups D twenty-five, D twelve point five and M did not differ significantly regarding body weight, two point seven plus or minus zero point five; two point seven plus or minus zero point four; two point seven plus or minus zero point five kilograms, respectively, age, thirteen plus or minus five; twelve plus or minus nine; fifteen plus or minus thirteen months, respectively, and surgical time, twenty-eight plus or minus six; twenty-five point four; thirty-four minutes, respectively.\np6pq | Effect of dipyrone on cyclooxygenases in cats M A A Pereira et al.",
