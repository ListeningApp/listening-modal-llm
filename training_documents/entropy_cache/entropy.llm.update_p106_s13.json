        "content": "8oh3 | F sub I equals negative K ln Z sub I equals negative K ln open parenthesis one divided by N factorial multiplied by V to the power of N divided by Lambda to the power of three N close parenthesis. Thus the entropy of the gas is\nm27u | S sub I equals open parenthesis average E sub I close parenthesis minus F sub I close parenthesis divided by T equals K N open parenthesis ln open parenthesis V divided by Lambda cubed close parenthesis plus three halves close parenthesis minus K ln N factorial. In short, it is K ln N less than for the gas of distinguishable particles. This makes beautiful intuitive sense: there are N factorial permutations of the particles that we no longer care about in the indistinguishable case.\ns0b6 | STIRLING'S FORMULA\nihlu | Stirling's formula says\nr3zr | Approximates to square root two pi N open parenthesis N divided by E close parenthesis to the power of N\nj6ku | N factorial\nzt0d | and it gives ln N factorial approximately equals open parenthesis ln N minus one close parenthesis N plus one half ln two pi N where the error goes to zero as\nej0q | N approaches positive infinity. Now we need a bit of math: Stirling's formula for the factorial function. In one form this says\ndg44 | The limit as N approaches positive infinity of the quantity square root of two pi N times open parenthesis N divided by E close parenthesis raised to the power of N divided by N factorial equals one. We abbreviate this fact, that the ratio of two quantities approaches one as N approaches positive infinity, by saying N factorial is asymptotic to square root of two pi N times open parenthesis N divided by E close parenthesis to the power of N. We also write\nlhtj | N factorial is asymptotic to square root of two pi N open parenthesis N divided by E close parenthesis to the power of N. where the symbol approximates means 'asymptotic to'.\nns07 | If we take the logarithm of both sides we get\nq8bx | ln N factorial approximately equals open parenthesis ln N minus one close parenthesis N plus one half ln two pi N. The symbol approximates has a vaguer meaning: 'approximately equal to'. But it turns out that in this instance the approximation is extremely good: the difference between the left and right sides goes to zero as N approaches positive infinity. In fact we will content ourselves with a cruder approximation:\nlftq | ln N factorial approximately equals open parenthesis ln N minus one close parenthesis N because in the entropy entropy of an ideal gas N is typically huge, so the term we have discarded here is dwarfed by the others.\nhyaf | Puzzle forty-seven. Suppose N is Avogadro's number, close to the number of atoms in four grams of helium:\n9etn | N approximately equals six times ten to the power of twenty-three. What is the ratio of one half ln two pi N to\n2bic | N? While deriving Stirling's formula is fascinating and not at all trivial, doing so would take us rather far afield. So I will resist, and refer you instead to this:\njras | THE SACKUR-TETRODE EQUATION\ndwvf | In thermal equilibrium, an ideal gas of N indistinguishable classical particles in a three-dimensional box of volume V has entropy\nic87 | S sub I equals K N open parenthesis ln open parenthesis V divided by Lambda cubed close parenthesis plus three halves close parenthesis minus K ln N factorial where Lambda equals h divided by square root of two pi m K T is the thermal wavelength.\nbxpw | Using Stirling's formula\n4g09 | ln N factorial approximately equals open parenthesis ln N minus one close parenthesis N we get the Sackur-Tetrode equation:\ntxr8 | S sub I approximately equals K N open parenthesis ln open parenthesis V divided by N Lambda cubed close parenthesis plus five halves close parenthesis Taking our formula\nrsup | S sub I equals K N open parenthesis ln open parenthesis V divided by Lambda cubed close parenthesis plus three halves close parenthesis minus K ln N factorial and using a simple version of Stirling's formula, ln N factorial is asymptotic to open parenthesis ln N minus one close parenthesis N, we get the famous Sackur-Tetrode equation:\nhk1c | S sub I is asymptotic to K N open parenthesis ln open parenthesis V divided by Lambda cubed close parenthesis plus three halves close parenthesis minus K open parenthesis ln N minus one close parenthesis N is asymptotic to K N open parenthesis ln open parenthesis V divided by N Lambda cubed close parenthesis plus five halves close parenthesis. Note that with this formula, if we multiply both V and N by the same constant, the entropy also gets multiplied by that constant. In this situation we say the entropy is 'extensive'.\nna8b | For a better approximation, we can use\na4wk | ln N factorial approximately equals open parenthesis ln N minus one close parenthesis N plus one half ln two pi N where the error goes to zero as N approaches infinity. This gives a correction to the Sackur-Tetrode equation:\nbi02 | S sub I approximately equals K N open parenthesis ln open parenthesis V divided by N Lambda cubed close parenthesis plus five halves close parenthesis minus one half ln two pi N. Here if we multiply both V and N by a constant C, we don't just multiply the entropy by C: we also have to subtract one half ln two pi C. So the entropy is not quite extensive but this effect is tiny when you've got a mole of gas.\nyc23 | THE ENTROPY OF AN IDEAL MONATOMIC GAS",
