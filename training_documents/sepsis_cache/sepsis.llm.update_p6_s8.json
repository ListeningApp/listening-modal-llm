        "content": "rzhj | Participants randomized to therapeutic warming had lower twenty-eight-day mortality than those in the control group (eighteen percent vs forty-three percent; absolute risk reduction, twenty-five percent; ninety-five percent confidence interval, negative forty-eight to negative two; Figure three). Post hoc adjustment of the twenty-eight-day mortality outcome for enrollment SOFA score revealed similar effect of treatment group allocation (adjusted odds ratio, zero point one five one; ninety-five percent confidence interval, zero point zero two nine to zero point seven eight nine). They also had more twenty-eight-day hospital-free days (two point six days; ninety-five percent confidence interval, zero to eleven point six days). There were no differences between twenty-eight-day ventilator-free days or the forty-eight-hour delta-SOFA score. Secondary infections were common (thirty percent), but they were not different between the two groups.\nbfax | Safety Outcomes\nf2y8 | Participants randomized to therapeutic warming had similar vasopressor doses and vital signs during their intervention period compared to control participants.\no7qm | Vasopressor dose was reached in two participants (seven percent) leading to termination of warming, but the same vasopressor criterion was met in four control participants (fourteen percent). No participants met the predetermined stopping rules for heart rate or respiratory rate.\nd52l | DISCUSSION\nqlbb | In this pilot randomized controlled trial, we demonstrated that therapeutic hyperthermia in afebrile critically ill patients with sepsis was feasible, but we\nnhsg | did not observe a difference in monocyte HLA-DR expression, induced interferon gamma production, or lymphopenia. We also did not observe more adverse events in the therapeutic hyperthermia group. We did, however, observe decreased mortality and increased twenty-eight-day hospital-free days in the group that underwent therapeutic hyperthermia. These are important observations because they suggest there may be a clinical benefit of this treatment, although the biological mechanism and replicability in a larger trial remain unknown.\nhy0l | The risk of hypothermia and the survival benefit of fever in patients with sepsis are well described. A meta-analysis of observational studies cited a pooled estimate of a forty-seven percent mortality in hypothermic patients with sepsis versus twenty-two percent mortality in those with fever. While the control group mortality in our trial was high, it tracks closely with the mortality observed in prior cohorts of afebrile critically ill sepsis patients. Perhaps more compelling, participants allocated to therapeutic hyperthermia experienced a mortality that was more closely aligned with expected mortality in febrile sepsis patients. Studies of antipyretic therapy in sepsis have demonstrated little benefit. A single trial of external cooling in febrile sepsis patients showed reduced vasopressor doses and lower early mortality in febrile patients cooled to normothermia, but these findings were not replicated in a subsequent randomized trial. The inflammatory cascade, cytokine expression, and transcription factors in febrile sepsis patients are likely different from afebrile sepsis patients, and having experienced fever may confer benefit to immunocompetent sepsis patients that cannot be undone with cooling.\n4jmz | The mechanism through which therapeutic hyperthermia may have affected clinical outcomes in this study is unclear. Previous data have demonstrated that, compared to afebrile patients with sepsis, febrile patients had a greater increase in monocyte HLA-DR early after sepsis diagnosis, suggesting a lower",
