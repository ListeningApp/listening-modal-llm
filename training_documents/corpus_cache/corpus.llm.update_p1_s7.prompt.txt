You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

bbpr | Added value of corpus callosotomy following vagus nerve stimulation in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: A multicenter, multinational study
5zyf | Abstract
9own | Objective: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe form of epileptic encepha- lopathy, presenting during the first years of life, and is very resistant to treatment. Once medical therapy has failed, palliative surgeries such as vagus nerve stimula- tion (VNS) or corpus callosotomy (CC) are considered. Although CC is more ef- fective than VNS as the primary neurosurgical treatment for LGS-associated drop attacks, there are limited data regarding the added value of CC following VNS. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of CC preceded by VNS.
bqfb | Methods: This multinational, multicenter retrospective study focuses on LGS children who underwent CC before the age of 18 years, following prior VNS, which failed to achieve satisfactory seizure control. Collected data included
wwdt | epilepsy characteristics, surgical details, epilepsy outcomes, and complications. The primary outcome of this study was a 50% reduction in drop attacks.
mn1r | Results: A total of 127 cases were reviewed (80 males). The median age at epilepsy onset was 6 months (interquartile range <LATEX>\left. \left[ I Q R \right] = 3 . 1 2 - 2 2 . 7 5 \right) .</LATEX> The median age at VNS surgery was 7years <LATEX>\left( I Q R = 4 - 1 0 \right) ,</LATEX> and CC was performed at a median age of 11 years <LATEX>\left( I Q R = 8 . 7 6 - 1 5 \right) .</LATEX> The dominant seizure type was drop attacks (tonic or atonic) in 102 patients. Eighty-six patients underwent a single-stage complete CC, and 41 an ante- rior callosotomy. Ten patients who did not initially have a complete CC underwent a second surgery for completion of CC due to seizure persistence. Overall, there was at least a 50% reduction in drop attacks and other seizures in 83% and 60%, respec- tively. Permanent morbidity occurred in 1.5%, with no mortality.
5vqw | Significance: CC is vital in seizure control in children with LGS in whom VNS has failed. Surgical risks are low. A complete CC has a tendency toward better effectiveness than anterior CC for some seizure types.
meyw | 1 INTRODUCTION |
2e62 | Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe form of epileptic encephalopathy, presenting during the first years of life, and is very resistant to control through antiseizure medications (ASMs). LGS may cause gen- eralized seizure phenotypes, and significantly impact neurodevelopmental aspects such as learning, behavior, alertness, and quality of life.1 Thus, seizure reduction is of utmost importance, especially in young children.2 Moreover, drop seizures, which occur in more than half of the patients, are a significant source of morbid- ity, causing severe injuries, and are among the most disabling factors in this syndrome.3 Many such patients require close and continuous supervision and head pro- tection with special helmets.
75y3 | Once conventional ASMs have failed, palliative surger- ies such as vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) or corpus cal- losotomy (CC) should be considered.4,5 A comparison of the effectiveness and safety of CC and VNS, which are the most common palliative surgical methods, suggests that CC is more effective than VNS in reducing atonic seizure; there is 74%-85% reduction in tonic and atonic seizures following CC, compared to approximately 55% reduc- tion following VNS.46 However, CC is associated with a higher rate of adverse events when compared to VNS. For this reason, in many cases, physicians or family favor VNS over CC as the primary surgical palliative treatment.7
s2g2 | Although CC is more effective than VNS as the primary treatment for LGS-associated drop attacks, there are lim- ited data regarding the added value of CC following VNS.

cb7r | Key Points
68xu | · CC has an added value on all seizure subtypes in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who have undergone prior vagus nerve stimulation
hd35 | · Complete CC has a tendency toward better ef- fectiveness than anterior CC
2zpk | · Additional studies are needed to ascertain the low morbidity associated with complete callosotomy
epu7 | The current study evaluates the safety of CC and its ef- fectiveness for drop attacks and other seizure types follow- ing prior VNS for LGS.
7od1 | 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS |
0bqy | This is a multicenter, multinational, retrospective, histori- cal cohort study. Following institutional review board ap- proval, we retrospectively reviewed the files of all children with LGS who underwent CC (complete or incomplete) following a prior VNS. Seventy-one international epilepsy centers were invited to participate based on personal con- tacts. No institutions were excluded; 27 did not respond, 17 centers had no cases meeting the inclusion criteria, one declined participation, and 26 centers contributed 145 pa- tients (ranging from one to 18 patients from each partici- pating center) operated on between 2003 and 2021.
b780 | 2.1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria
ccmb | Children (up to 18 years of age during CC surgery) under- going CC surgery, who also underwent a prior VNS for LGS, were included in the study. The LGS diagnosis was based on the criteria of the International League Against Epilepsy.8 All variations of CC were included (anterior, posterior, complete, open disconnections, and radiofre- quency or laser ablation). All LGS etiologies were included. Other epileptic syndromes (unrelated to LGS) and patients who underwent VNS following prior CC were excluded.
ma93 | 2.2 | Collected data
c6hh | Collected data included demographics, epilepsy etiology, age at seizure onset, and seizure semiology. Surgical data included any prior epilepsy-related surgery (including re- sections, but not including CC), data regarding VNS sur- gery (including complications and effectiveness on drop seizures and other seizures), data regarding CC surgery (including technique, extent, complications, and effective- ness), and the need for additional surgeries.
y7ea | 2.3 | Study outcomes
nav4 | The primary outcome was effectiveness of CC in reducing 50% of drop attacks at the last follow-up despite failure of a prior VNS. Secondary outcome measures were other sei- zure reductions, role of extent of callosotomy, and safety.
gem8 | 2.4 | Statistical analysis
e8nr | Data were tabulated in an Excel spreadsheet. SPSS soft- ware was used for all statistical analyses (SPSS Statistics, version 25, IBM). Categorical variables are reported as numbers and percentages. Comparison between outcomes of partial and complete callosotomy was done using the chi-squared test. Continuous variables are reported as me- dian and interquartile range (IQR). Correlation between
