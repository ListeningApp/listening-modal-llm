You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ap5o | From an empirical perspective there is evidence that voice is different from other behaviors. In a recent study, Van Dyne and LePine (1998) presented initial construct validity support for a 6-item measure of voice behavior. In their study, supervisors, peers, and employees differen- tiated in-role from extra-role behavior, and also distin- guished between two forms of promotive extra-role be- havior-helping and voice. Using multigroup confirma- tory factor analysis, they demonstrated that their three- factor (in-role, helping, and voice behavior ) measurement model was fairly stable over time (6 months) and across raters (self, peers, and supervisor). They also found that supervisors recognized and rewarded voice because em- ployees who exhibited voice at Time 1 received higher performance ratings at Time 2.
7zvf | However, despite the empirical evidence that voice is distinct from other work-related behaviors and has practi- cal importance in work group contexts, researchers have not had much success in predicting voice (see, e.g., Wi- they & Cooper, 1989). We suggest that this can be attrib- uted to at least two factors: (a) focusing on satisfaction and excluding other theoretically relevant predictors, and (b) utilizing measures of voice with questionable con- struct validity.
mov9 | Focus on Satisfaction
ks7m | Research on voice has emphasized the person-centered antecedents of satisfaction, dissatisfaction, or both. This emphasis can be attributed to Hirschman (1970), who proposed that voice is a "political" response ( as opposed to exit, which is an "economic" response) of organ- izational members or customers to their dissatisfaction with organizational-level decline. Researchers extended Hirschman's theory by proposing that voice is also a re- sponse to dissatisfaction with specific aspects of work in the context of high levels of overall job satisfaction or prior job satisfaction (e.g., Farrell & Rusbult, 1992; Rus- bult et al., 1988). This research on voice made a contribu- tion because it provided an initial theoretical framework for assessing a key antecedent of voice. The emphasis on a single antecedent (satisfaction) or type of antecedent (person-centered) is also consistent with initial research in many areas.
w1w1 | Researchers have traditionally attempted to predict hu- man behavior using either person-centered (e.g., affect, abilities, personality ) or situation-centered (e.g., job char- acteristics, social settings) variables. Recently, however, researchers have begun to recognize that most human behavior is influenced by many independent factors and that relationships may vary systematically depending on the situation and vice-versa (e.g., Brockner, 1988; Eke-
h8gv | VOICE IN WORK GROUPS
kwkp | hammer, 1974). Thus, there is a need to develop predictive models that consider the independent and joint effects of theoretically relevant personal and situational variables (Hattrup & Jackson, 1996).
yj0m | Several recent studies on behaviors closely related to voice illustrate the use of both personal and situational antecedents in the same model. Near and Miceli (1995), for example, theorized that individual and situational vari- ables affect the outcome of whistle-blowing. Scott and Bruce (1994) found support for their hypotheses relating both individual and situational variables to innovative be- havior. Ford (1996) included both individual and situa- tional variables in his model of creative behavior. Finally, and more directly relevant to our approach, Van Dyne et al. (1995) proposed an initial nomological network for voice that included both person-centered (affective states and individual differences) and situational (contextual factors ) antecedents. In summary, given that satisfaction is only one of several theoretically relevant variables, it is not surprising that predicting employee voice behavior has been difficult.
ewfp | Measurement of Voice
oczy | Schwab (1980) pointed out that concern for measure- ment has been viewed as secondary to substantive issues in the early stages of research on most new constructs. We suggest that this has been the case with research on voice and the result has been weak and inconsistent empir- ical findings. First, voice scales used in past research included items with questionable content validity. For ex- ample, Leck and Saunders's (1992) 5-item scale con- tained the items "Voluntarily wear clothing (hat, jacket, pin, etc.) that bears your organization's symbol or insig- nia" and "Say good things about your job even when others criticize it." The inclusion of such items in scales designed to measure voice inevitably causes construct contamination (Schwab, 1980) and construct stretching (Osigweh, 1989), which may inflate or deflate observed validity coefficients depending on the extent of criterion contamination or deficiency. Second, researchers have used voice scales with low internal consistency reliability (e.g., Rusbult et al., 1988; Withey & Cooper, 1989). Low reliability attenuates validity coefficients. Third, most re- search on voice (e.g., Farrell & Rusbult, 1992; Leck & Saunders, 1992; Rusbult et al., 1988; Saunders et al., 1992) has used self-reported frequency or intentions/like- lihood of engaging in voice behaviors rather than observed frequency of actual behavior. Because of the challenging nature of voice, it is problematic to assume that intentions translate into behavior. To the extent that this assumption does not hold, intention-based measures of voice lack construct validity, which may inflate or deflate the size of relationships depending on what is actually being measured.
2ttg | Summary
his3 | To date, researchers have not had great success in pre- dicting voice. This shortcoming can be attributed to (a) focusing on a single antecedent and (b) using measures with questionable construct validity. Although such short- comings often occur in relatively new research domains, developing and testing more detailed models and using measures with construct validity will advance theoretical understanding and suggest interventions that can be ap- plied by managers. The objective of this article is to use theory and recent empirical findings to develop and test an initial set of voice antecedents. Following the general recommendations of interactionists and more specific rec- ommendations regarding voice, we propose and assess a predictive model of voice including both person-centered and situational antecedents. In addition, we use a measure of voice with initial evidence of construct validity.
m50z | Person-Centered Antecedents
me84 | Although a large number of person-centered character- istics could be considered in a predictive model of voice, practical and statistical concerns limit any single study to a manageable subset of those characteristics (Cohen, 1990). Therefore, in our study, we chose to focus on one person-centered characteristic from each category sug- gested by Van Dyne et al. (1995; i.e., affective characteris- tics and individual differences). Building on past voice research, we chose satisfaction as our affective construct because it is the key antecedent in existing models of voice. Extending past research, we included global self- esteem. Global self-esteem was chosen because of its im- portance in predicting behavior that is somewhat risky to the self.
