You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

5bjs | A fast spin echo three-dimensional (3-D) MR cholangiopancreatography is recommended with echo time (TE) 600-700 ms, repetition time (TR) 1,500-2,500 ms (the- oretical, dependent on respiratory gating), flip angle 140° and fat suppression using a 1.5-tesla (T) unit (Fig. 2). Acquisitions are strictly coronal and almost isotropic to allow for non- distorted detection and assessment of the smaller structures. Real-time navigator gating is necessary to synchronize breath- ing. Field of view 18-24 cm and acquisition matrix 256×256 are adequate. We suggest using a flexible surface coil accord- ing to the child's weight (minimum 12 channels).
uodj | Gentle swaddling and natural sleep or sedation are both possible options. We recommend the patient fast for at least 4 h before the MRI and no digestive contrast.
k16v | The MR cholecystopancreatography diagnosis of biliary atresia was made on the basis of the non-visualization of the extrahepatic biliary tree [15, 17, 19, 22, 24] or the non- visualization of the extrahepatic bile duct and gallbladder, also considering periportal thickening and high signal intensity in the porta hepatis on T2-weighted images [14, 21] (Fig. 2). Other authors considered the non-visualization of the extrahe- patic bile duct and gallbladder abnormalities [20, 23] (Fig. 3).
b2lm | The meta-analysis performed by He et al. [25] included 7 MR cholecystopancreatography studies (age range: 1-15 days) for biliary atresia diagnosis reporting a sensitivity of 89.7% (range: 84.8-93.4%), a specificity of 64.7% (range: 58.0- 71.0%), a positive likelihood ratio of 3.10 (range: 1.59-6.06), a negative likelihood ratio of 0.16 (range: 0.06-0.44) and a diagnostic odds ratio of 32.48 (range: 8.22-128.29).
ti7f | Kim et al. [16] used a conditional inference tree analysis to select discriminators for the diagnosis of biliary atresia. Visibility of the common bile duct, abnormality of the
oksu | gallbladder and MRI triangular cord thickness were good dis- criminators for the diagnosis of biliary atresia. The MRI-based decision tree using these findings with MRI triangular cord thickness cutoff of 5.1 mm showed 97.3% sensitivity, 94.8% specificity and 96.2% accuracy, comparable to US. MRI scans in this study were performed using sedation. This was a retro- spective study with the possibility of bias. The authors did not assess the reproducibility of MRI triangular sign thickness and the baseline characteristics (gender and laboratory results) were different between the biliary atresia and non-biliary atresia groups. The proportion of patients with visible or dilated com- mon bile duct on MRI in the non-biliary atresia group (94/96, 97.9%) was much higher than in other studies because the au- thors included 42 patients with choledochal cyst and partially visualized common bile duct in the visible common bile duct group, compared with previous studies that excluded these cases (mean age±standard deviation in the biliary atresia group 59.3 ±30.2 days and in the non-biliary atresia group 57.9±43.1 days).
wtow | According to Siles et al. [18], non-enhanced MR cholecystopancreatography visualization of the entire extrahe- patic bile duct system, including confluence of intrahepatic bile ducts, is possible but was only observed in 62.5% of neonates and infants younger that 3 months in a normal phys- iological state. For infants younger than 30 days, this result dropped to 50%. This compromises the ability of MR cholecystopancreatography to exclude the diagnosis of biliary atresia at the optimal time for surgery.
o22k | Hepatobiliary scintigraphy
nwfz | Hepatobiliary scintigraphy uses Tc-99 m-labelled iminodiacetic acid derivatives as a radiotracer. Patient preparation for imaging should include phenobarbital to activate liver excretory en- zymes and increase bile flow for a minimum of 3-5 days before the hepatobiliary imaging study. Scintigraphy can exclude bil- iary atresia by demonstrating transit of radiotracer into the bow- el (Fig. 4). Cholescintigraphic images should be acquired at multiple times up to 24 h.
