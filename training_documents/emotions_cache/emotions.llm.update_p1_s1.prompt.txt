You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

afbe | Further Evidence for Mixed Emotions
78r8 | Emotion theorists have long debated whether valence, which ranges from pleasant to unpleasant states, is an irreducible aspect of the experience of emotion or whether positivity and negativity are separable in experience. If valence is irreducible, it follows that people cannot feel happy and sad at the same time. Conversely, if positivity and negativity are separable, people may be able to experience such mixed emotions. The authors tested several alternative interpretations for prior evidence that happiness and sadness can co-occur in bittersweet situations (i.e., those containing both pleasant and unpleasant aspects). One possibility is that subjects who reported mixed emotions merely vacillated between happiness and sadness. The authors tested this hypothesis in Studies 1-3 by asking subjects to complete online continuous measures of happiness and sadness. Subjects reported more simultaneously mixed emotions during a bittersweet film clip than during a control clip. Another possibility is that subjects in earlier studies reported mixed emotions only because they were explicitly asked whether they felt happy and sad. The authors tested this hypothesis in Studies 4-6 with open-ended measures of emotion. Subjects were more likely to report mixed emotions after the bittersweet clip than the control clip. Both patterns occurred even when subjects were told that they were not expected to report mixed emotions (Studies 2 and 5) and among subjects who did not previously believe that people could simultaneously feel happy and sad (Studies 3 and 6). These results provide further evidence that positivity and negativity are separable in experience.
320g | Can people feel happy and sad at the same time? If the experience of valence is analogous to the experience of temperature, the answer is no. Imagine a room heated by a heater running at maximum capacity and cooled by an air conditioner running at half capacity (Green, Salovey, & Truax, 1999). If the air flowing from the heater and air conditioner have ample opportunity to mix together, how would the room's occupants feel? Would they feel extremely warm and moderately cold? No. Just as if the heater was running at half capacity and the air conditioner was off, they would feel moderately warm and not at all cold (see Schimmack, 2001). This is because the experience of temperature is irreducible. In other words, the experi- ences of warm and cold are inseparable such that feelings of warmth preclude feelings of cold and vice versa. A long line of scholars have argued that positivity and negativity are also inseparable in experience
tp8g | and that emotional valence is irreducible (Bain, 1859; Barrett, 2006; Barrett & Bliss-Moreau, 2009; Russell & Carroll, 1999; Titchener, 1908; Wundt, 1896). Bain (1859), for instance, conceptualized plea- sure and displeasure as being so antagonistic that "the presence of the one destroys the property of the other, as an acid neutralizes an alkali [i.e., base]" (p. 441), and Barrett (2006) has conceptualized valence as a "basic building block" of emotional experience (p. 36). By such accounts, people cannot feel happy and sad at the same time (Barrett & Bliss-Moreau, 2009; Russell & Carroll, 1999), even if the events affecting their emotional state have both pleasant and unpleasant aspects (Russell, 2003). On the other hand, Socrates argued in Plato's Philebus that the experience of positivity is separable from that of negativity. Hume (1739/2000), Ebbinghaus (1902; cited in Wohlge- muth, 1919), and Cacioppo and Berntson (1994) have taken similar positions. This line of thinking raises the possibility that people can feel mixed emotions of happiness and sadness at the same time.
gxfd | To the extent that mixed emotions can occur, they may have meaningful consequences. Evidence indicates that individuals with schizophrenia may experience mixed emotions when recalling pleasant memories (Cohen, St-Hilaire, Aakre, & Docherty, 2009), that mixed emotions may foster healthy coping with stressors (Coifman, Bonanno, & Rafaeli, 2007), and that the extent to which advertisements elicit mixed emotions may influence their effec- tiveness (Williams & Aaker, 2002). As explained below, however, answering the basic question of whether people can feel happy and

jkp9 | sad at the same time requires more sophisticated measures of emotion than those employed in these and other studies, including our own (e.g., J. T. Larsen, McGraw, & Cacioppo, 2001). As a result, it remains unclear whether people can feel happy and sad at the same time. Our goal is to take steps toward answering that question and the larger question of whether valence is irreducible in experience.
z8tt | Contemporary Theoretical Perspectives
9g22 | A common contemporary approach to identifying the number and nature of the dimensions underlying emotional experience is to ask people to rate the extent to which they currently feel a variety of discrete emotions (e.g., happy, excited, stressed, sad). Factor analyses of the resulting correlation matrices generally reveal a two-factor solution with each emotion falling along the perimeter of a circumplex structure. Most notably, happiness and sadness consistently emerge as polar opposites separated by nearly 180° (for a meta-analysis, see Remington, Fabrigar, & Visser, 2000). What, then, is the relationship between happiness and sadness in experience?
41fx | Even though Watson and Tellegen's (1985) positive activation- negative activation (PA-NA) model contends that highly arousing positive emotions (e.g., excited) and negative emotions (e.g., dis- tressed) are fairly independent, it recognizes that happiness and sadness lie at opposite ends of a bipolar valence dimension (e.g., Watson, Wiese, Vaidya, & Tellegen, 1999; see Figure 1). The
7um8 | PA-NA model further contends that polar opposites (e.g., happi- ness and sadness) should be perfectly negatively correlated. By this account, any increase in happiness comes with a commensu- rate decrease in sadness, and vice versa (see Figure 2A).
uow2 | Russell's (1980; Russell & Barrett, 1999; Russell & Carroll, 1999) valence-arousal model highlights a bipolar valence dimen- sion ranging from positive emotions (e.g., happiness) to negative emotions (e.g., sadness) and an orthogonal arousal dimension ranging from emotions low in arousal (e.g., calm) to those high in arousal (e.g., tense; see Figure 1). As explained by Watson et al. (1999) and Russell and Barrett (1999) and illustrated in Figure 1, the PA-NA and valence-arousal models are virtually identical even though they highlight different pairs of dimensions. Perhaps the most prominent difference between the models is that they make different predictions about the relationship between polar opposite emotions. Whereas the PA-NA model contends that polar opposites are perfectly negatively correlated, the valence-arousal model's bipolarity hypothesis (Barrett & Russell, 2003) echoes Bain (1859), Wundt (1896), and Titchener (1908) by contending that happiness and sadness, like feelings of hot and cold (Schim- mack, 2001), are mutually exclusive. As Russell and Carroll (1999) put it, "Bipolarity says that when you are happy, you are not sad and that when you are sad, you are not happy" (p. 25; see Figure 2B).
iat7 | At first glance, the PA-NA model's contention that happiness and sadness are perfectly negatively correlated seems reasonable.
