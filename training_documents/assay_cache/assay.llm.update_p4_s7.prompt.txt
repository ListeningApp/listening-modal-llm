You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

rzhj | Data analysis
bfax | Data were entered in Epidata version 3.3 and analyzed using SPSS software package version 20. The Xpert sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated using the following as one of the reference stan- dards: i) LJ culture alone; ii) LJ culture and/or Xpert (confirmed TB); and iii) composite refer- ence standard (CRS) (confirmed TB and Unconfirmed TB). Differences and similarities between the two methods (stool Xpert versus gastric aspirate Xpert) was determined based on the 95%CI. Non-over lapping 95% CIs indicated a difference between the two methods (stool Xpert versus gastric aspirate Xpert) and vice versa.
f2y8 | Ethical consideration
o7qm | Ethical approval (Protocol number IHRPGD552/18) was obtained from Institutional Review Board of Jimma University, Ethiopia. We obtained written informed consent from parents or legal guardians of children and assent from children above ten years old.

Seventy-eight (51.3%) of 152 participants were females and participants' ages ranged from 7 months to 14 years (median 3 years). Majority, 98 (64.5%), of the participants were rural resi- dents (Table 1). Regarding the clinical manifestation of the participants, 141 (92.8%) had cough for >2 weeks, 122 (80.3%) had loss of appetite, 109 (71.7%) had fever, 90 (59.2%) had weight loss, 90 (55.9%) had weakness/fatigue, 70 (46.1%) had shortness of breath and 35 (23%) had TB contact history. The majority, 142 (93.4%), were vaccinated with BCG. Close to a third of the participants, 54 (35.5%), were severely malnourished, whereas 6 (3.9%) of them were on anti-retroviral therapy.
b7cq | Diagnosis of TB
0b39 | Out of the 152 pulmonary specimens analyzed, MTB was detected in 9 (6.7%) by culture and in 8 (5.9%) by Xpert. In one of the participants, gastric aspirate Xpert was positive whereas the culture from the same specimen was negative. On the other hand, in two of the participants, culture from the gastric aspirates were positive whereas Xpert results were negative. All the 17 expectorated sputum specimens were negative by both Xpert and culture. Stool Xpert testing revealed 10 (6.6%) MTB positive cases. Rifampicin resistance was not detected in any of the Xpert positive specimens. Table 2 shows results of gastric aspirate Xpert, stool Xpert and gas- tric aspirate culture amongst study subjects.
qecd | Overall, 10 (6.6%) of the 152 study participants had microbiologically confirmed PTB, defined as a positive result on culture and/or Xpert on pulmonary specimen. We reviewed the medical records of the remaining 142 (93.4%) of participants who were microbiologically neg- ative. Of these, 8.5% (12/142) were clinically diagnosed as TB by the clinicians. Among the 12 clinically diagnosed TB cases, 83.3% (10/12) showed clinical improvement after ATT. The remaining 2 cases died after two weeks of ATT initiation and were classified as unlikely TB cases. Out of the 10 cases who have improved clinically, 4 had radiological findings suggestive of TB whereas 6 had no radiological evidences of TB documented on their medical records and hence were classified as "unconfirmed TB". However, none of the children with clinically- diagnosed TB (unconfirmed TB) had positive stool Xpert result. In the remaining 91.5% (130/

bgre | 142) of the cases, TB was ruled out and an alternative diagnosis was made and hence, they were classified as "unlikely TB" (Fig 1).
57lp | Diagnostic performance of stool Xpert
ukth | Error/invalid results were documented in 4.6% (7/152) of Xpert tests performed on stool. Due to a shortage of Xpert cartridges, we didn't repeat the tests in these invalid cases. Of the 145 stool specimens with valid Xpert results, 6.9% (10/145) were MTB positive. Stool Xpert detected all gastric aspirate culture confirmed TB cases and one positive case missed by gastric aspirate culture (Table 2). Moreover, stool Xpert also detected two MTB positive cases which were found to be negative on gastric aspirate Xpert.
kpvt | Using culture of the respiratory specimen (gastric aspirate and expectorated samples) as the reference standard, stool Xpert had sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 66.4-100) and specificity of 99.3% (95% CI: 96.2-100), whereas gastric aspirate Xpert had sensitivity of 77.8% (95% CI: 40- 97.2) and specificity of 99.3% (95% CI: 96.2-100) (Table 3). Using gastric aspirate culture and/ or Xpert positivity (microbiological confirmation) as one of the reference standards, stool Xpert had each 100% sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV (Table 4 and S1 Table).
jie2 | Moreover, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of stool and gastric aspirate Xpert were also calculated with reference to CRS. Accordingly, stool Xpert had a sensitivity of 50% (95% CI; 27.2-72.8), specificity of 100% (95% CI: 97.1-100), PPV of 100% and NPV of 92.6% (95% CI; 89-95.1) against CRS (Table 5). The corresponding sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for gastric aspirate Xpert were 40% (95% CI; 19.1-64), 100% (95% CI; 97.2-100), 100% and 91.7% (95% CI; 88.5-94) respectively compared to CRS (Table 5). Stool and gastric aspirate Xpert MTB detection rates compared to CRS is also shown in supporting information (S2 Table).
d0ik | Discussion
0x0s | Ethiopia is among the 30 countries with high-burden of TB and TB/HIV in the world and there is a huge number of undiagnosed TB in children [11]. The national guidelines for TB care in Ethiopia recommends Xpert for the diagnosis of childhood TB. However, obtaining appropriate respiratory specimens from children is difficult. Thus, a non-invasive sample for the diagnosis of TB in children would improve care for this population. In the current study, we have demonstrated that stool Xpert has comparable performance with gastric aspirate Xpert in consecutively recruited children with presumptive PTB. Other studies have also reported promising findings [6, 12].
