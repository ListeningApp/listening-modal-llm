o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

rhaz | The effects of frame geometry on the seismic behavior and weight of chevron EBFs were investigated in 2008 by Özhendekci and Özhendekci [157]. It was concluded that EBFs with shear links performed better than those with intermediate and moment links. Furthermore, the use of longer shear links and shorter intermediate links was found to be advantageous in terms of seismic performance. However, it was demonstrated that for shear links, the frame weight would also increase along with the link length.
wak1 | A novel performance-based plastic design (PBPD) methodology for EBFs was proposed by Chao and Goel [158, 159] in 2005. The method, which uses an energy-balance criterion and provides a design base shear for a given hazard level, global yield pattern, and target drift, is a direct method in the sense that it does not require any assessment after the initial design. A procedure for the height- wise distribution of this lateral force was also proposed based on the results of extensive nonlinear dynamic analyses. The results revealed that the EBFs designed using the new approach can satisfy expected performance objectives and perform better than those designed using conventional methods, without any notable increase in material usage. It is worth noting that an application of a performance- based approach for the design of a 97.6m tall EBF system located in the United States was reported by Sabol and Nishi [160] in 2011.
wtfz | In 2013, Sullivan [161] developed a direct displacement-based design (DDBD) method for EBFs with the aim of overcoming the deficiencies generally attributed to the force-based design approach. The method replaces a multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system with an equivalent single-degree-of- freedom (SDOF) structure. A flow chart of this iterative design process as well as a design example were also provided. Sullivan [161] and O'Reilly and Sullivan [60] demonstrated the effectiveness of the method through time-history analyses of EBFs designed using DDBD. The studied EBFs exhibited lower-than-expected ductilities (p < 3), and thus it was noted that the codified response modification factors (i.e. R factors) are generally unconservative. Furthermore, using a unique R factor and a single displacement amplification factor (Ca) factor for all EBFs was found to be inappropriate since the ductility (u) would tend to reduce as the EBF height increases. The use of longer shear links was recommended by Sullivan [161] similar to Özhendekci and Özhendekci [157].
qy1i | The effect of height-wise distribution of the demand-to-capacity ratio of links was studied by Rossi and Lombardo [109] in 2007 using IDA. Partial collapse mechanisms, especially in the upper stories, were observed in all of the cases which had scattered height-wise link demand-to-capacity ratios. Furthermore, the R factors for mid- and high-rise EBFs as well as EBFs with long links were found to be considerably lower than those proposed by different building codes [68, 162]. A subsequent study was undertaken by Bosco and Rossi [111] in 2009. The results of extensive nonlinear incremental dynamic analyses revealed that the traditional method of designing EBFs considering capacity design principles as well as providing uniform demand-to-capacity ratios for links would not necessarily ensure proper distribution of link inelastic action through the height, especially for mid- and high-rise EBFs. To have a better prediction of the seismic performance of EBFs, a new parameter, called the damage distribution capacity factor, was introduced by Bosco and Rossi [111]. It was demonstrated that, considering both of the demand-to-capacity ratio and the damage distribution capacity factor, it is possible to accurately predict the collapse mechanism of an EBF system.
1k9e | In 2013, Bosco and Rossi [112] proposed a design procedure for dual EBFs to overcome the deficiencies observed in their previous studies regarding regular EBFs. In this approach, EBF links are the main energy dissipating mechanisms while MRFs provide lateral stiffness during inelastic behavior. Nevertheless, to have a more cost-efficient design, limited yielding was also permitted in MRFs at beam ends, bottom ends of the first story columns, and top ends of upper story columns. In a companion numerical study by Bosco and Rossi [113] it was demonstrated that dual EBF structures designed based on the proposed methodology perform better than those designed according to conventional methods. In addition, an expression for determining the R factor for dual EBFs was proposed which was dependent upon the link rotation capacity, ymax, and gave R factors ranging from 4.0 (for long links) to 7.5 (for short links). A similar formula for the R factor of EBFs, ranging from 3.5 (for long links) to 5.0 (for short links), was suggested more recently by Bosco et al. [110]. Furthermore, the use of modal response spectrum analysis instead of equivalent lateral load methods for the design of mid- and high-rise EBFs was emphasized by Bosco et al. [110]. In a very recent study
5bjs | by Bosco et al. [163] the Eurocode 8 [154] EBF design procedure has been thoroughly reviewed and the important drawbacks and discrepancies are highlighted.
uodj | The seismic column demands of EBFs were studied by Richards [164] in 2009. The demands from nonlinear dynamic analyses were compared to the amplified seismic axial force (§2.PEQ) according to IBC 2006 [165] or ASCE 7-10 [140] considering the amplification factor (or structural overstrength) of 2.0. The numerical results revealed that designing EBF columns solely using the amplified seismic axial force can be quite unconservative for upper tier columns of tall EBFs while overly conservative for columns at the base of these structures. A similar conclusion was reported by Kuşyılmaz and Topkaya [166] in 2013. An average value of 3.25 was reported by these researchers for the structural overstrength factor which is well above the codified value of 2.0. The results reported by both studies may indicate some concern regarding the EBF column design; however, as noted by Kuşyılmaz and Topkaya [166], recalling that the capacity design principles should also be considered in the EBF column design it is anticipated that the use of [20 = 2 would not yield substantial underestimations in the EBF column design process.
k16v | The appropriateness of using the displacement amplification factor, Ca, equal to 4.0 per ASCE 7- 10 [140], which is directly used for estimating the plastic link rotation angle, Yp, was studied by Richards and Thompson [58] in 2009. Nonlinear dynamic analyses of a large set of EBFs revealed that a factor of Ca = 4 can underestimate Yp for links of low-rise EBFs while overestimating the plastic rotations of links in mid- and high-rise EBFs. Although calibrated Ca factors were proposed, the researchers pointed out that the study was inadequate to recommend factors for general design. To further investigate this design deficiency, a numerical study was undertaken by Kuşyılmaz and Topkaya [59] in 2015 and it was demonstrated that the Ca factor of 4.0 may result in significantly unconservative estimates of Yp in low-, mid-, and high-rise EBFs. Results of the inelastic time-history analyses were used to develop a nonlinear relation which provides Ca values ranging from 8.0 (in the lower stories) to 5.0 (in the upper stories). In a subsequent study by Kuşyılmaz and Topkaya [167] nonsimulated collapse analyses revealed that EBFs designed in accordance with the U.S. provisions [3, 140], considering an R factor of 8.0, have higher collapse probabilities than expected.
b2lm | Consequently, two distinct design modifications were proposed to reduce this probability. The first one was a modification to the Ca value based on [59] and the second one was a modification to the R factor, where a value of 4.0 was recommended.
ti7f | In a recent study by Speicher and Harris [168] the seismic performance of six EBFs designed using IBC 2012 [169] were assessed based on ASCE 41-06 [170] using static and dynamic, linear and nonlinear analyses. The correlation between ASCE 7-10 [140] and ASCE 41-06 [170] in terms of the anticipated performance level was also studied. Numerical results once again indicated the possibility of concentration of inelastic action in a limited number of links in a properly designed EBF system. In addition, it was observed that the linear assessment methods given in ASCE 41-06 [170] are less conservative than the nonlinear assessment procedures. However, it was unclear which of these procedures is more representative of the actual behavior, since the code does not consider the effect of loading history in the assessment process and acceptance criteria. Speicher and Harris [168] mentioned that the responses of links under earthquake loadings were mostly one-sided with a ratcheting approach towards large rotations, and thus, higher rotation capacities might be anticipated for links compared to the codified limits. Consequently, the need for link assessment criteria which are based on cumulative demands was highlighted.
oksu | Studies have also been undertaken recently to provide simple relations for estimating the fundamental period as well as the stiffness of EBF systems. In 2010, Richards [171] derived a simple relation for predicting the lateral stiffness of an EBF story based on the design story shear, frame geometry, and beam depth. A comprehensive study was conducted in 2015 by Kuşyılmaz and Topkaya [172] to improve the accuracy of the formula available in ASCE 7-10 [140] for estimating the fundamental period (T) of EBFs, which first appeared in UBC 88 [72] and has not been calibrated since then. A hand-method for estimating T was first formulated and its accuracy was demonstrated by comparing the results with data obtained through an extensive parametric study and also with data available in the literature. A simple period-height relation for EBFs was then developed. The results obtained by this expression were compared to the apparent (measured) periods of actual EBF buildings, reported by Kwon and Kim [173], and acceptable conformity was reported. In a similar study, Young and Adeli [174] studied the effect of building irregularities on the fundamental period of
wtow | EBFs. It was demonstrated that the formula given in ASCE 7-10 [140] can yield overly conservative estimates of T for these systems. The results from analyses of 12 properly designed EBFs as well as the data available in the literature were combined to propose a three-variable power expression for predicting T, which included the effects of EBF building irregularities. The study also confirmed that regular EBF buildings tend to have a longer fundamental period compared to EBF buildings with irregularities. The accuracy of the proposed formula was demonstrated using the analytical periods compiled by Tremblay [175] and the apparent periods reported by Kwon and Kim [173].
o22k | The effect of the variability of steel material in the seismic performance of EBFs was studied by Badalassi et al. [176] in 2013. The numerical results revealed that the variability of the steel material did not have a major effect on the failure probability of the studied structures. In addition, the capacity design requirements of Eurocode 8 [177] were found to be appropriate. It is worth mentioning that in some of the studied EBFs by Badalassi et al. [176] two floor beams were used in each level of the EBFs to avoid interaction between the floor deck and the link. The coupled beam sustained the gravity loads while the main beam contained the link and carried the seismic loads. This approach is generally attributed to Perretti [178].
nwfz | The seismic reliability of EBFs was investigated recently by Lin et al. [179] by means of nonlinear dynamic analyses, considering far-fault and near-fault earthquakes, based on the guidelines of FEMA 356 [180]. It was concluded that EBFs (particularly low-rise EBFs) have lower failure probabilities than MRFs. The reduction was more pronounced when far-fault ground motions were considered. The behavior of EBFs under near-fault earthquakes was also studied by Eskandari and Vafaei [181] In 2015. Even though near-fault earthquakes were found to be somewhat more destructive, the probability of low-cycle fatigue-induced premature web fractures were observed to be higher for the case of far-fault ground motions. Nevertheless, it was also concluded that EBFs are suitable systems to be used in near-fault regions owing to the fact that the yp values recorded for all links were in the acceptable range based on FEMA 356 [180] requirements for the life safety performance level.
nvfy | The application of the reduced beam section (RBS) connection in dual EBFs with long external links was investigated in 2011 by Naghipour et al. [182]. Results of nonlinear static (pushover) analyses on four-, seven-, and ten-story dual EBFs revealed that the RBS connection can increase the
mror | ductility of the system (by about 10%) and reduce the demand on link-to-column connections by moving the hinge location away from the column face. The RBS connection was however recommended only for long links with shallow sections.
zlxc | The seismic performance of a special type of EBF, hereafter referred to as HS-EBF, in which links are constructed from conventional steel while other members are made from high strength (HS) steels with Fy in excess of 345 MPa, was investigated by Lian et al. [39] in 2015. Results of a cyclic test on a scaled one-story one-bay chevron HS-EBF conducted by these researchers were used to validate their numerical modeling approach. The results of the subsequent analyses under cyclic loading and three ground excitations revealed a general similarity between the performances of HS-EBFs and equivalent conventional EBFs. However, better load carrying capacity and lower material consumption was reported for the HS-EBFs while slightly higher ductility and energy dissipation was indicated for the EBFs. The inter-story drifts and plastic link rotations were also found to be lower in the studied EBFs. Furthermore, a maximum height limit of sixteen stories was recommended for HS-EBFs in order to achieve better seismic performance.
k0bw | A number of recent studies have focused on the optimization of EBF systems. In 2013, Gong et al. [183] presented a genetic algorithm based structural optimization technique for EBFs. A successful application of this optimization method was demonstrated for a hypothetical three-story EBF building; however, this came with the cost of an excessive computational burden (of the order of days). In a more recent study, Karami Mohammadi and Sharghi [184] developed an optimum design technique for EBFs based on the concept of uniform deformation theory. These researchers applied the method to three-, five-, and ten-story EBFs and demonstrated that the optimized EBFs have lower weights and better seismic performances compared to those of regularly designed EBFs.
aq5a | There are also a limited number of studies regarding the effect of concrete slabs on the structural response of EBF systems. In 2013, Danku et al. [185] investigated the issue in three EBFs and three dual EBFs with four, eight, and twelve stories through nonlinear static (pushover) analyses as well as IDA considering seven earthquake records. The models were calibrated using the outcomes of a companion experimental study [37]. The numerical results revealed that composite action can increase the system stiffness and reduce the structural drifts and rotation demands on links and lead to a more
