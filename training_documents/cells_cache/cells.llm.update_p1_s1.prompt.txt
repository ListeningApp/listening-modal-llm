You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

zlxc | Flow-induced reprogramming of endothelial cells in atherosclerosis
k0bw | Abstract
aq5a | Atherosclerotic diseases such as myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and peripheral artery disease continue to be leading causes of death worldwide despite the success of treatments with cholesterol-lowering drugs and drug-eluting stents, raising the need to identify additional therapeutic targets. Interestingly, atherosclerosis preferentially devel- ops in curved and branching arterial regions, where endothelial cells are exposed to disturbed blood flow with characteristic low-magnitude oscillatory shear stress. By contrast, straight arterial regions exposed to stable flow, which is associated with high-magnitude, unidirectional shear stress, are relatively well protected from the disease through shear- dependent, atheroprotective endothelial cell responses. Flow potently regulates structural, functional, transcriptomic, epigenomic and metabolic changes in endothelial cells through mechanosensors and mechanosignal transduction pathways. A study using single-cell RNA sequencing and chromatin accessibility analysis in a mouse model of flow-induced atherosclerosis demonstrated that disturbed flow reprogrammes arterial endothelial cells in situ from healthy pheno- types to diseased ones characterized by endothelial inflammation, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, endothelial-to-immune cell-like transition and metabolic changes. In this Review, we discuss this emerging concept of disturbed-flow-induced reprogramming of endothelial cells (FIRE) as a potential pro-atherogenic mechanism. Defining the flow-induced mechanisms through which endothelial cells are reprogrammed to promote atherosclerosis is a crucial area of research that could lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets to combat the high prevalence of atherosclerotic disease.

0yab | Introduction
w95z | Atherosclerosis is a multifactorial and chronic inflammatory disease of the arteries, in which fibrofatty plaques develop in the arterial wall1. As advanced plaques develop, the arterial wall stiffens, the arterial lumen narrows and, occasionally, plaques rupture or are eroded, result- ing in severe clinical consequences, including myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and peripheral artery disease, which are the leading causes of death worldwide2.
0i1k | Dysfunction and inflammation of endothelial cells have a crucial role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis3. Endothelial cells lining the inner layer of the blood vessels are in direct contact with the blood and become dysfunctional and inflamed in response to various risk factors, such as hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes mellitus, hyper- tension, smoking and ageing, especially at specific atherosclerosis- prone regions associated with disturbed blood flow. At these sites of endothelial inflammation, circulating monocytes bind to endothelial cells and transmigrate into the subendothelial space, differentiating into macrophages. These regions also show increased permeability to circu- lating LDL cholesterol, which becomes oxidized in the subendothelial space and is ingested by nearby macrophages, thereby promoting foam cell development and triggering a vicious cycle of inflammation and macrophage accumulation1. In addition, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in these regions transdifferentiate into synthetic phenotypes and migrate to the subendothelial layer and proliferate, contributing to arterial wall thickening4. In addition, some VSMCs transdifferentiate into foam cells5, eventually leading to the formation of fatty streaks and fibrofatty plaques (Fig. 1a). As atherosclerotic plaques grow outwardly and inwardly, mature and progress, some plaques rupture, causing major cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke 5,6.
dqlg | Although atherosclerotic risk factors such as hypercholester- olaemia, hyperglycemia and hypertension are systemic, plaques
p6pq | preferentially develop in a focal manner in curved and branching regions of the arteries associated with disturbed blood flow7. Disturbed flow in these regions is characterized by the delivery of low-magnitude oscillatory shear stress (OSS) to the endothelial cell surface7-9. Endothe- lial cells detect various shear stress patterns and magnitudes through mechanosensing receptors (mechanosensors), which translate these mechanical cues into cell signalling (mechanosignal transduction) and subsequent structural and functional responses10. Advanced omics analyses have demonstrated that flow potently regulates nearly all facets of endothelial cell biology and pathobiology, from individual molecules and genes to structures and functions of the entire cell. Flow regulates endothelial cell transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes at a genome-wide scale in vivo and in vitro, altering endothelial cell func- tion, proliferation, survival and differentiation. Whereas stable blood flow, with the characteristic high-magnitude, unidirectional laminar shear stress (ULS) observed in straight, non-branching regions of the vasculature, promotes atheroprotective endothelial cell homeostasis, disturbed flow promotes pro-atherogenic endothelial cell responses, including endothelial dysfunction.
zse6 | Although lipid-lowering drugs such as statins and PCSK9 inhibi- tors are highly efficient in reducing blood cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease burden11, atherosclerotic diseases continue to be leading causes of death worldwide, highlighting the need for novel anti-atherogenic drugs targeting non-lipid, pro-atherogenic pathways. In this context, the CANTOS trial12 demonstrated that inhibi- tion of vascular inflammation using the IL-1ß inhibitor canakinumab significantly reduced atherothrombotic events in patients with previ- ous myocardial infarction compared with placebo, in a cholesterol- independent manner. Although canakinumab was not approved by the FDA owing to an increase in fatal infections with canakinumab treatment in the trial, the findings demonstrated that targeting an inflammatory pathway could be a novel and effective anti-atherogenic therapy. Similarly, genes, proteins and pathways regulated by flow (flow-sensitive) that control pro-atherogenic endothelial cell dysfunc- tion and inflammation could be promising novel therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis. To this end, in this Review, we discuss the current literature on flow-sensitive genes, proteins and pathways, including the emerging concept of disturbed-flow-induced reprogramming of endothelial cells (FIRE), involved in endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis.

ohh7 | Vascular haemodynamics
vbni | The vascular endothelium is in direct contact with the blood in the arterial lumen and forms a protective barrier between the blood and the outer vascular wall13,14. The vascular endothelium is constantly exposed to haemodynamic forces: normal (transmural) stress and circumferential stress in the arterial wall resulting from blood pressure, and tangential shear stress on the endothelial surface due to blood flow (Fig. 1b). Whereas transmural pressure and circumferential stress in the vessel wall mainly affect and regulate medial VSMCs, fluid shear stress mostly affects endothelial cells, potently regulating their function 13-16
dgcw | Shear stress on endothelial cells
gvwz | Shear stress is the frictional force derived from blood viscosity and flow rate that acts tangentially on the endothelial surface13,16,17. Due to complex vascular geometries and haemodynamic conditions, shear stress levels and directional patterns vary greatly in different regions
