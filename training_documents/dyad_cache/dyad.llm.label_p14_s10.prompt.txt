You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

oksu | The efforts to monitoring China, primarily its preparations for a massive intervention in the war, went somewhat better, and the source of the failure here lay within the sphere of analysis. Although the CIA had

nwfz | lost all its assets in mainland China following the Communist victory there, it succeeded in receiving some relevant information through other sources. On October 19, the same day the PLA started crossing the Yalu, a Hong Kong-based Chinese businessman warned that 400,000 PLA troops had started or were about to start crossing into North Korea.10 CIA officers in Tokyo warned twice of a 300,000-strong PLA force deployed near the Yalu.10 These warnings had no impact on intelligence estimates. MacArthur himself rejected them, and threatened to arrest a CIA officer stationed in Tokyo for warning about a coming Chinese intervention.103
nvfy | Aerial reconnaissance occasionally yielded some useful information. In early September, one warning indicator concerning possible Chinese intervention involved aerial photographs that showed three air-force bases, capable of handling a total of 300 aircraft, had been built in close proximity to the Yalu.104 104 On October 18, aerial photographs showed that close to a hundred Soviet-made aircraft had been deployed in those fields.105 The obvious conclusion should have been that the Chinese were building air support for a potential large-scale confrontation with the UN forces.

zlxc | Sigint coverage of the Chinese preparations for war suffered from a number of problems. The Chinese military hardly used radio equipment. On average, a CPV division had about 5 percent of the communication devices 4 of a US division.100 The PRC was also ranked relatively low in AFSA's order of priorities, although it climbed to the top when UN forces crossed the 38 parallel and advanced northward. Sigint collection efforts also suffered from a lack of Chinese linguists, primarily in the Mandarin dialect that was used by the PLA. The Allies' contribution was also limited. The British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) operated a listening post in Hong Kong, but it covered southern China, not Manchuria. The Taiwanese Sigint, which provided relevant information, was rejected for being "biased or self-serving."10
k0bw | Although one of the best experts on the subject regarded the Sigint contribution as "extremely poor,"the NSA account claimed that the lack of warning about the intervention "was a failure to utilize already available intelligence."1" Indeed, AFSA's monitoring, mainly of personal and administrative traffic, provided reasonable indications of the preparations to intervene. In May and June, it reported that 70,000 PLA troops, from two army groups, had moved down the Yangtze River.11 On July 17, it provided information that the Fourth Field Army, considered the PLA's best combat force, had deployed units in Manchuria and in east China. Based on this information, the Army G-2 assessed that the PRC intended to attack Taiwan, whereas G-2 in Tokyo concluded that the Fourth Army had "returned to its normal operating area in North China." The Watch Committee did a far better job on July 17, when estimating that "concentration of Chinese Communist troops in Manchuria might be intended for use in Korea."In early September, AFSA located the deployment of six PLA armies in Manchuria, and in the weeks that followed, it reported their move closer to the border, as well as the transfer by railroad of artillery units and of Chinese aircraft to newly established air bases in Manchuria. On the basis of this information, the Watch Committee 4 concluded on September 22 that the PLA could cross the Yalu "with little advance notice."112
aq5a | Other indications that were collected by AFSA included the reservation of ferries for military use in the Yalu, the ordering of 30,000 maps of Korea, shipments of medical supplies to the border area, and North Korean traffic mentioning a "regiment that came from China.115 Nevertheless, neither Sigint monitoring nor other means of collection provided indications for the actual crossing of the Yalu, which started on October 18 and took place at night under strict radio silence.114
sc5y | MacArthur's G-2 reports usually correctly reflected the available information. On July 3, Willoughby estimated that China "stationed two cavalry divisions and four armies in Manchuria." Since a Chinese Army amounted to about 30,000 soldiers, their total number reached at least 150,000. In late August, he estimated that 246,000 soldiers had been deployed there, and after the Inchon landing he "speculated that 450,000 Chinese troops were massed in Manchuria."115 On October 5, two weeks before the actual crossing had started, MacArthur's G-2 who relied on Taiwanese sources raised the possibility that nine Chinese divisions
0yab | had already deployed in Korea."" At the same time, and in contrast to the CIA, Willoughby did not report on the buildup of air fields near the border, although this indicated preparations for a confrontation with UN forces. When US reconnaissance flights revealed on October 18 that close to a hundred Soviet-made aircraft had been deployed in these airfields, MacArthur's air commander, Gen. Stratemeyer, estimated it to be a means to back up the Chinese intervention threats but, like Willoughby, regarded it as a bluff.118
w95z | Chinese public and diplomatic intervention threats constituted a major source of concern, primarily in Washington, which was otherwise completely dependent on intelligence from the Far East Command. On September 26, a day after China's foreign minister Zhou Enlai warned that China would respond if the UN forces crossed the 38th parallel, the Chinese Foreign Office issued another public statement: "The American warmongers are mistaken in thinking that their accusations and threats would intimidate the people of

dqlg | p. 152 China."11" The same day, the acting PLA 4 Chief of Staff, Gen. Nieh Jung-chen, delivered a warning during a dinner with the Indian ambassador, K. M. Panikkar. He made it clear that China would not "sit back with folded hands and would let the Americans come to the [Chinese-Korean] border." Nieh said that China might pay dearly in such a war but added: "Without sacrifice a nation's independence cannot be held."12º On September 30, a day before ROK units crossed the 38th parallel and two days before Mao made the final decision to intervene, foreign minister Zhou Enlai told the Central People's Government Council that the Chinese people would not be "afraid to oppose aggressive war" and "would not tolerate their neighbor being savagely invaded by the imperialists."121 And following Mao's decision to intervene, Zhou summoned Panikkar to a dramatic ten minute talk at 12:20 a.m. and warned, "If the Americans crossed the 38th parallel China would be forced to intervene in Korea." He thus made an American crossing a "fully defined casus belli." In response to a question by Panikkar, Zhou made it clear that ROK's crossing "did not matter."122
p6pq | Neither the warning indications about the PLA buildup in Manchuria nor the Chinese public and diplomatic warnings changed the American estimate that an intervention was unlikely. In an October 12 memorandum to President Truman, the CIA did not rule out "full-scale Chinese Communist intervention" but estimated that "barring a Soviet decision for global war, such action is not probable in 1950." The Kremlin, according to the CIA, had no interest in such a confrontation.12 President Truman and Secretary Acheson saw no reason to change their previous assessment. Acheson assessed that the military and political risks involved in intervention were too high and the strategic gains too low." 124
zse6 | Basing his estimate on military factors, Willoughby said, in late September, "If the Chinese were going to intervene they would have done so when we made the Inchon landing."12 On the eve of MacArthur's conference with President Truman on Wake Island, Willoughby estimated that the Chinese intervention warnings were "probably in a category of 4 diplomatic blackmail."12 MacArthur echoed this estimate, telling President Truman during their October 15 meeting that the likelihood of Chinese intervention was "[v]ery little. Had they intervened in the first or second months it would have been decisive."127
p2n3 | ii. The decision-making process: Washington, Tokyo, Korea
ohh7 | Most studies of the surprise Chinese attack in late November have focused on the failure, primarily in Washington, to realistically judge Beijing's public and diplomatic intervention threats. This mistaken estimate contributed to the American surprise, but its main source was the adherence of MacArthur and his G-2 to the belief that China would avoid massive intervention, despite undisputable evidence to the contrary. This misconception was the foundation of MacArthur's decision to advance to the Yalu, of Washington's political and military approval of this move, and of the operational risks taken by the UN forces in order to complete their mission as early as possible, which furthermore exposed them to the CPVF counteroffensive.
vbni | The clearest evidence for the PRC's intentions and capabilities was the PVF's First Campaign, which lasted two weeks. On October 25, the CPVF, which by this stage amounted to more than 260,000 soldiers, initiated

sk5m | a large-scale offensive, mainly against the four ROK divisions that were deployed with the Eighth US Army on the western peninsula and the X Corps on the eastern coast. The ROK First Division fell into a giant ambush by the CPVF 39th Army. Its commander, Gen. Paik, who was considered the best ROK commander, immediately realized that the skilled soldiers his division met were Chinese. Shortly afterward, he personally interrogated the first Chinese POW and heard from him that 20,000 Chinese soldiers were deployed nearby. The information was immediately reported through the Eighth Army's G-2 to Gen. Willoughby in Tokyo. During the next four days, the ROK Second Corps, made up of three divisions, suffered thousands of losses and was driven back in disarray.

877u | Simultaneously, Gen. Almond's X Corps advancement was blocked by a strong Chinese force. A Chinese POW who identified himself as a soldier of the 5th PLA Regiment of the Chinese 8th Army said that another 4,000 to 5,000 troops were nearby. " Additional POWs said in interrogations that 4 they belonged to the 124th Division. Almond, who personally interviewed them, reported to MacArthur that PLA units were deployed in northeast Korea. 130
rzhj | At the end of October, "the frontline commanders did not doubt that the Eighth Army and the X Corps had encountered powerful, organized elements of CCF [Chinese Communist Forces] armies across a wide spectrum of extreme North Korea."By November 1, as an American official history of the war concluded, "the CCF had driven back the ROK II Corps, crippling it disastrously, and was south of Chongchon on the open right flank of Eight[th] Army. And disaster was also threatening in the center of the Eight[th] Army front of Unsan. " 132 It came a day later, as another official account described it: "The climax of this early Chinese intervention came on the night of 1-2 November when the 8th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, was attacked by a full Chinese division in positions near Unsan and very roughly handled."133 Practically, the regiment lost more than half its men.14 It was the first major clash between American and Chinese forces and the first American defeat since the landing in Inchon. The outcome sent shock waves through the Eighth Army. Walker's G-2 concluded that the Eighth Army now faced two PLA armies with "improved tactical capabilities" displaying "an unusual capability to fight at night."> The X Corps' G-2 reached a similar conclusion: following a number of limited battles with the CPVF and after interrogating at least 30 POWs, he reported, on October 29, "Integral PLA have been committed against UN Forces." On November 2, US Marine forces destroyed the PLA's 124th Division in a fierce battle that was supported by tanks. The destroyed division was immediately replaced by another one-a clear indication of the magnitude of the CPVF.137
bfax | Altogether, the Chinese First Campaign (October 25-November 8) took a high toll on UN forces. In October, the American losses were 40 per day. They rose to 326 per day in the first week of November.1 138 8 By Chinese accounts, 12,325 South Koreans, 3,518 Americans, and 147 other nationalities were killed, wounded, or captured during the campaign. The CPVF sustained 10,700 casualties including MIAs.139 4
f2y8 | Willoughby's reaction to the reports about the Chinese intervention was mainly denial. Shortly after X Corps soldiers caught the first Chinese soldiers, Almond told Willoughby about it and asked him to come and see them with his own eyes. Willoughby refused, saying that they were only a "token force." Close to four weeks later, he did come, saw a number of the POWs, but insisted that they were North Koreans and not Chinese.14 In between, he passed on to Washington the information about captured PLA soldiers, accepting that organized Chinese units were in Korea, but denying what that meant:
o7qm | From a tactical standpoint, with victorious United States divisions in full deployment, it would appear that the auspicious time for intervention has long since passed; it is difficult to believe that such a move, if planned, would have been postponed to a time when remnant North Korean forces have been reduced to a low point of effectiveness." 142

nhsg | p. 158
hy0l | In the following days, Willoughby's reports labeled the Chinese forces in Korea "volunteers." Even more importantly, the numbers of soldiers he reported did not reflect the magnitude of the threat. On November 2, he reported that 16,500 Chinese soldiers were in Korea and a day later (11/3) that their number had risen to 34,000, while an additional 415,000 were deployed in Manchuria.143 On November 11, he estimated that 76,800 Chinese troops were in Korea. 144
4jmz | The figures provided by Willoughby, which were based on the information from the interrogated Chinese POWs, systematically decreased the size of the opposing force. This was accomplished by a selective use of the available data. On October 29, for example, many reports based on POW interrogations indicated that a massive PLA crossing of the Yalu had taken place. Nevertheless, Willoughby's assessment cited only one report and estimated that "only token forces from the Fortieth Army Headquarters and from each of its divisions entered Korea on 20 October."> Later, 4 while admitting that elements of four Chinese armies were in Korea, he counted the specific units of the captured soldiers but not their parent units. Thus, when visiting the X Corps in November he estimated that "probably only a battalion of volunteers of each division identified was actually in Korea."146 Justin Haynes rightly concluded: "Due to this method of analysis Willoughby accounted for only one third of Chinese Communist troops inside North Korea at that time."14 In fact, on the eve of the Second CPVF Campaign, Willoughby accounted for less than a fifth of the Chinese power. 148
