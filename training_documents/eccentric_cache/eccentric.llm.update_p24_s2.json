        "content": "a7ao | In a subsequent study, Okazaki et al. tested an additional twelve welded link-to-column specimens to investigate the effect of loading history and to study other details such as the all-around fillet weld detail and a new reinforced detail referred to as the supplemental web doubler connection. The test results seemed inconclusive as regards the effect of the loading protocol. On the other hand, excellent performance was reported for most of the specimens with the fillet welded and the newly proposed supplemental web doubler details. A summary of the experimental results for these two connections reported by Okazaki et al. indicates their high potential for practical applications. Several design and welding details for the all-around fillet weld\n29a3 | connection were also outlined by these researchers. A step-by-step design procedure for the supplemental web doubler connection was developed by Hong et al. through a series of nonlinear FE analyses and substantiated by experiments.\nsb1e | Two numerical studies were conducted recently to propose alternatives for reducing the demand in critical regions of welded link-to-column connections, i.e., at the link flanges in the vicinity of groove welds. Prinz and Richards studied reduced web section links while Berman et al. investigated reduced flange section links. The reduced web section links with perforated webs did not perform well in the simulations while the reduced flange section links were found to be a potential solution, pending testing required for further validation.\nw2yn | The AISC Seismic Provisions do not require qualification testing for the link-to-column connection of a short link, provided that the connection is reinforced with haunches or other proper details which prevent yielding in the reinforced segment adjacent to the column. Although this approach is found to be effective in MRF connections, no research is available at the time which proves the reliable performance of such a reinforced detail specifically in EBF link-to-column connections. The commentary on AISC three hundred forty-one mentions the promising performance of the supplemental web doubler detail proposed by Okazaki et al.; however, it encourages designers to configure EBFs to avoid link-to-column connections entirely. The use of built-up box links in EBFs with link-to-column connections has not been studied explicitly nor addressed by the specifications.\nap6l | Four. Numerical Modeling of Links\niest | General FE techniques which model links using shell or solid elements can reasonably simulate the behavior of these members under monotonic and cyclic loadings, specifically if the strength degradation related with low-cycle fatigue-induced fractures does not need to be captured. However, due to the complexity and computational burden of these methods they are not typically used for nonlinear time-history analysis, and instead, simplified approaches are utilized which model a link through a combination of line elements, nodal constraints,\ncox8 | springs, or plastic hinges. Although the detailed description and evaluation of the latter are out of the scope of this study, a brief outline of each method is provided here for the sake of completeness.\nppqi | In nineteen seventy-seven, Roeder and Popov proposed a sandwich beam model for links where shear was resisted by the web and moment through uniaxial stresses by the flanges with bilinear responses. The method was intended to be used for modeling shear yielding links with small end moments. A very simple model was later proposed by Yang in which the shear link behavior was simulated using a truss member with calibrated uniaxial strength. In nineteen eighty-three, a finite element model based on a stress resultant formulation was developed by Hjelmstad and Popov which utilized a moment-shear yield surface. The method was not suitable for link modeling since strain hardening effects were not incorporated. A simplified approach was proposed in nineteen eighty-seven by Whittaker et al. for short links where regular flexural elements with moment hinges were calibrated to exhibit moment capacities corresponding to the nominal shear strength of the link.\noxou | Ricles and Popov developed an approach in which a link was represented by a linear elastic beam with a nonlinear zero-length hinge at each end. Although the numerical results obtained using this approach were fairly accurate, the calibration and programming of the method was quite complex.\n495n | A modeling procedure was developed by Ramadan and Ghobarah on the basis of the theory proposed by Ricles and Popov; however, with simpler end hinges and the ability to be conveniently incorporated into regular analysis programs. The model was calibrated using the results of experiments conducted at the University of California at Berkeley in the nineteen eighties on links constructed from A thirty-six steel. The accuracy of the method was demonstrated through a comparison with test results. In two thousand three, Richards and Uang modified the link model proposed by Ramadan and Ghobarah in order to improve its accuracy in predicting the behavior of links constructed from A nine hundred ninety-two steel. The proposed element was later used in an extensive parametric study.\nawri | A simplified approach was recently used by Khandelwal et al. in which the behavior of short links was simulated using a rectangular truss system with vertical rigid bars and elastic horizontal bars and a nonlinear diagonal spring.\nbl28 | A three element link model consisting of a central beam element and concentrated hinges at the ends was introduced by Rossi and Lombardo in two thousand seven and extensively used in the numerical studies of Bosco and her colleagues. Although suitable for initial analysis, the model was not able to properly capture the cyclic response of links. For instance, non-zero stiffness values were provided by this model even at very large deformations. To overcome these deficiencies, an enhanced model of this element was recently developed by Bosco et al. in which the responses of flexural and shear hinges were defined using the uniaxial material model of Zona and Dall'Asta. The model was separately calibrated for short and long links using a large body of test data. The effectiveness of the approach was demonstrated for short, intermediate, and long links by comparing numerical and test results. It is worth noting that in all of the above-mentioned models the effects of axial force and strength degradation on the nonlinear behavior were neglected.\nd5bz | In studies by Malakoutian et al., O'Reilly and Sullivan, and Kanvinde et al. the OpenSees analysis platform was utilized where a beam-column element with distributed plasticity and additional independent nonlinear shear springs located at the element ends was used for link modeling. Various different material models were adopted in each of these studies. Moghaddasi B. and Zhang used the beam element of OpenSees with zero-length moment hinges at the ends as well as four parallel translational springs at each end for simulating the behavior of shear links. This method was also used in the numerical study of Dastmalchi.",
