        "content": "gem8 | C D four. Steady State Kinetics of Methane Turnover. It has been reported by Rataj et al. that initial velocity measurements of C H one and C D four oxidation by the multiple-turnover reconstituted MMO system show that the major isotope effect appears in the V max to K M ratio rather than in V max. This experiment was repeated under the same conditions used for the single-turnover studies. In the case of methane turnover at four degrees Celsius, the deuterium isotope effect in V max is one point six plus or minus zero point three, while that for V max over K M is twenty-five plus or minus five. The data are in accord with the study of Rataj et al., but different from the data reported for MMOH from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) by Wilkins et al. This study showed a V max isotope effect of one point seventy-five, but an inverse isotope effect of zero point eighty-eight on the K M and a V max over K M isotope effect of two.\n\ne8nr | DISCUSSION\n\nk78w | MMO presents a unique opportunity to utilize isotopic substitution to probe the oxygenase catalytic process because it is the only alkane oxygenase for which the reactive intermediate in the catalytic cycle has been directly monitored. In general, KIEs in monooxygenases such as cytochrome P four fifty and dopamine beta monooxygenase must be measured by steady state kinetics or product analysis. Consequently, a direct measurement of the intrinsic isotope effect in the actual oxygen insertion step cannot be achieved and may be masked by slower steps such as product release or electron transfer. In the current study, we have shown that the decay of the reaction cycle intermediate compound Q, which appears to encompass the product-forming step, is very sensitive to the deuteration of methane. The mechanistic significance of this observation is discussed in the following sections.\n\ng9du | Origin of Unusually Large Isotope Effects. The observed isotope effect for compound Q decay exceeds by severalfold the classical limit for a deuterium isotope effect. Large isotope effects typically arise in reactions that include branched pathways, multiple steps with cumulative effects of more than one isotope-sensitive step, a hydrogen-tunneling process, or a magnetic isotope effect. The effects of a branched reaction are usually seen in the product distribution rather than the direct observation of the decay of a reactive, chromophoric intermediate as reported here. The participation of more than one isotope-sensitive step is feasible, but the possibilities for such a process are constrained by the fact that no loss of hydrogen other than from the bond where oxygen insertion occurs is observed. Thus, it is unlikely that two hydrogen atoms are removed during the course of the reaction. In preliminary studies, we have not been able to observe magnetic isotope effects in the product distribution. Consequently, of the possibilities noted, hydrogen tunneling appears to be the most likely origin of the large isotope effect.",
