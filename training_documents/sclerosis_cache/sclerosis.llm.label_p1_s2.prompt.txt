You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

2taz | Abstract
o3ya | Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-inflammatory disease that attacks and damages myelinated axons in the central nervous system (CNS) and causes nontraumatic neurological impairment in young people. Historically, Lidwina of Schiedam documented the first MS case. After that, Augustus d'Este wrote for years about how his MS symptoms worsened. Age, sex, genetics, environment, smoking, injuries, and infections, including herpes simplex and rabies, are risk factors for MS. According to epidemiology, the average age of onset is between 20 and 40 years. MS is more prevalent in women and is common in Europe and
r5il | America. As diagnostic methods and criteria change, people with MS may be discovered at earlier and earlier stages of the disease. MS therapy has advanced dramatically due to breakthroughs in our knowledge of the disease's etiology and progression. Therefore, the efficacy and risk of treatment medications increased exponentially. Management goals include reducing lesion activity and avoiding secondary progression. Current treatment approaches focus on managing acute episodes, relieving symptoms, and reducing biological activity. Disease-modifying drugs such as fingolimod, interferon-beta, natalizumab, and dimethyl fumarate are the most widely used treatments for MS. For proof of the efficacy and safety of these medications, investigations in the real world are necessary.

82qc | Introduction And Background
ls7d | Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune inflammatory disease that assaults myelinated axons in the central nervous system (CNS), damaging the myelin and axon to varying degrees [1]. Inflammation, neurodegeneration, and gliosis are hallmarks of MS. Perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and macrophages destroy the myelin sheaths that pathologically wrap neurons [2,3]. In most cases, the condition is relapsing- remitting, with brief bouts of neurologic impairment that resolve entirely or nearly wholly [4]. MS pathophysiology is not fully understood but may be connected to hereditary predisposition and a putative non-genetic trigger that results in a sustaining autoimmune disease leading to recurring immunological attacks on CNS [5]. The geographic variance in the incidence of MS suggests environmental causes [3,5]. Due to improvements to the criteria used to make these assessments, people may now get a more accurate and quick diagnosis [4].
tzt3 | Recent breakthroughs in the knowledge of MS processes have led to the development of innovative therapy methods [5,6]. Recently, numerous drugs have been effective in phase III testing, indicating approval [7]. As viable therapy increases, choosing the correct one for each patient is harder. Modern medicine treats this condition with hormones, immunosuppressants, plasma exchange, and other medications [8]. As a clinically incurable disease, MS burdens patients and communities [9]. As a result, how to manage MS safely and efficiently has become a pressing societal medical issue [3,10]. Therefore, this study aims to review the history, pathophysiology, and pharmacological interventions of MS.
t8vv | Review History
qvnu | The term "paraplegia" refers to any severe neurological disorder marked by motor impairment. Saint Lidwina of Schiedam, who lived in the Netherlands at the end of the 14th century, documented the first mention of MS [11,12]. Augustus d'Este kept a journal for 26 years in which he wrote about how symptoms of what we
kggw | Cureus
xrd1 | now know to be MS got worse over time. His initial sign was a temporary visual impairment, most likely optic neuritis, at age 28. He died at age 54 of motor symptoms and lower extremities that hindered his walking [11-14]. Charcot's naming and framing of MS provided a framework for organizing previously unexplained discoveries and making future advances in MS. Since then, the consolidation has continued. Charcot's students correlated the disease's clinical symptoms with postmortem lesion pathology. Joseph Babinski's 1885 MS thesis described plaques in the brain and spinal cord. Pierre Marie highlighted autonomic dysfunction and gait impairments in MS [11,15]. Ernst Leyden initially hypothesized a hereditary component of MS in the mid-19th century. Still, it wasn't until the 1930s that Curtius and others in Germany started systematically assessing the genetics of MS and how the illness clustered in certain families [11,13,14].
5746 | Charcot, Von Frerichs, Vulpian, and others differentiated and "framed" MS as a unique, recognizable entity [12,15]. MS cases were classified according to their histology, clinical appearance, and prognosis before being diagnosed by doctors worldwide [13,14]. As awareness of MS developed, so made etiology ideas and therapeutic attempts; a 1935 research study included 158 MS treatments. Subsequent "cures" included anticoagulants, histamine desensitization, various diets, immunizations, and anticancer drugs [13,16]. Randomized clinical trials became more precisely defined in the decades following the 1960s, aided by advances in sickness classification and disability indices. Hypotheses were developed to account for immunological changes, genetic influences, geographical differences, infections, and environmental factors [6]. MS organizations enhanced research and general education and altered attitudes regarding the condition [16,17]. Last years, significant advances have been made in fundamental analysis to clarify the disease's causes and processes and immunomodulatory medications [11,16,17].
7toz | Etiology
j346 | Several risk factors lead to MS's development, including age, sex, race, heredity, geography, and infections such as herpes simplex, chlamydia, and rabies [18,19]. MS is likely the result of a complicated interplay between genetics, food, and the environment [6,20]. MS is primarily caused by an autoimmune attack on the CNS due to hyper immunity. Numerous postulated pathways have been proposed, but the proposed "outside-in" mechanism involves CD4+ proinflammatory T cells [21]. Researchers hypothesize that an unknown antigen promotes and activates 1 T-helper (Th1) and 17 T-helper (Th17), leading to CNS endothelium adhesion, blood-brain barrier (BBB) crossing, and subsequent immune attack through cross- reactivity. The "inside-out" theory posits that an innate malfunction of CNS produces and culminates in inflammation-mediated tissue destruction [21]. The phenomenon of environmental impacts, such as latitudinal gradients in different countries, has been widely studied [22]. A deficiency in vitamin D has been a possible explanation for susceptibility observed in populations living at higher latitudes [23,24]. Individuals with relatives have a considerable chance of developing the disease. The expected range of heritability is between 35 and 75% [25,26]. Human leukocyte antigen DRB1*1501 has a significant association with MS [27].
v8uq | Risk factors
x972 | Vitamin D Deficiency
cwrw | Vitamin D's activity in lymphocyte stimulation and modulation of growth and immune response suggests that it plays a substantial role in the pathogenesis of MS [19]. In addition, the reactions of the innate immune system and adaptive immunological activity are increased. Vitamin D reduces the production of Th1-mediated proinflammatory cytokines [28]. In many trials, vitamin D administration dramatically altered interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) levels [29,30]. MS is more common in people living farther north or south of the equator. The prevalence rate in societies near the equator is almost non-existent but grows to 50 cases per 1,000,000 individuals living 45 degrees north or south. Vitamin D insufficiency among MS patients is likely a contributor to this fascinating regional distribution [1,20,31,32].
4i0e | Genetics and Family History
h2l3 | There is proof that some individuals have an inherited susceptibility to MS. However, this genetic susceptibility is not inherited since there is no MS-specific gene [33,34]. Genetic studies have shown a connection between first, second, and third-degree relatives [35,36].
dfzb | Diseases
u6ty | It has been postulated that bacterial or viral infections may promote the later development of MS in genetically susceptible individuals. Disorders in late childhood may introduce foreign antigens that activate Th1 cells and induce the characteristic of the autoimmune response of MS [20,31].
awvu | Injury
on9b | Severe injuries that directly damage the brain or spinal cord have been investigated as possible triggers for MS. Trauma increases the permeability of the BBB, thus facilitating the entry of Th1 cells into the CNS. This

xmgs | is the initiating factor for the inflammatory response that leads to myelin destruction and the formation of MS lesions [37,38].
bd9h | Cigarette Smoking
m047 | Smoking is associated with higher risk of MS. Smokers with MS have a worse long-term prognosis and a greater incidence of brain atrophy than non-smokers [39]. In addition, MS sufferers are more likely to smoke than general population [40]. MS patients are more likely than the general population to have comorbid conditions associated with worse quality of life, a higher burden of disability, and higher mortality rates [41,42].
gy8c | Epidemiology
y4mj | MS is one of the most prevalent neurologic illnesses in the world and, in many countries, the leading cause of non-traumatic neurologic impairment in young people [43]. MS affects around 400,000 people in the United States and 2.5 million worldwide [44]. MS is now more prevalent among women; however, this was not always the case. In the early 1900s, the sex ratio was about equal. Since then, the sex ratio in most industrialized nations has progressively increased and is close to 3:1 (F: M) [44,45]. Smoking raises MS risk by about 50% [46]. Although the average age of onset is between 20 and 40 years, the disease can manifest at any age. Almost 10% of cases are diagnosed before the age of 18. In some cases, MS diagnosed after the age of 50 is known as "late-onset multiple sclerosis" (LOMS), which is a rare case [47]. Populations of European ancestry are estimated to have a prevalence of one in 1000. Less is known about prevalence among non- European groups, and most research points to a lower frequency among individuals of East Asian and African heritage. Recent research has shown that African-American communities have a prevalence rate comparable to European communities [48,49]. MS has a prevalence gradient dependent on latitude, with a higher incidence in the northern latitudes of Europe and North America. Observations indicating varied genetic susceptibility factors have also been observed in distinct human subpopulations, independent of latitude, indicating the interaction of poorly understood genetic and environmental components. Multiple studies have shown that populations that relocate to regions with a higher incidence of MS during infancy have a higher chance of developing the disease [50,51].
vpgq | Pathophysiology
ousl | MS refers to the formation of plaques in CNS along with inflammation, demyelination, axonal damage, and axonal loss. These plaques are located in the brain and spinal cord, mainly in the white matter surrounding the ventricles, optic nerves and tracts, corpus callosum, cerebellar peduncles, long tracts, and subpial area of the spinal cord and brainstem, as well as gray matter. They have expressed in all forms of MS (primary, secondary, and relapsing-remitting MS). Still, their expression varies over time, demonstrating a profound heterogeneity in the immunopathological patterns of demyelination and oligodendrocyte degeneration between the relapsing-remitting course and the progressive forms of the disease [52,53]. MS is considered an autoimmune disease caused by autoreactive immune cells that traverse BBB and attack the CNS. Regular deletion of autoreactive immune cells during development occurs in the thymus or bone marrow through central tolerance B cells. Although some may escape this process and be released into circulation, peripheral tolerance mechanisms prevent them from causing disease in most cases. The impaired function of regulatory T cells and the resistance of autoreactive T cells to suppression are two mechanisms through which peripheral tolerance might fail. A complicated interaction between genetic and environmental risk factors may affect the activity and activation of these autoreactive cells, therefore contributing to the development of disease [52,54,55]. The primary T cell subsets implicated in MS include CD8+ T cells, CD4+ Th1 cells, and Th17 cells. Interferon-gamma, IL-17, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors are cytokines produced by autoreactive T cells that may contribute to the pathophysiology of MS [54]. The increased immunoglobulin in cerebral fluid suggests a role for B cells in MS. Intrathecal production of oligoclonal immunoglobulins, also known as oligoclonal bands (OCBs), is a diagnostic feature of MS. In MS, the majority of B cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain parenchyma are CD27+ memory B cells. Memory B cells are clonally enlarged in the CSF and brain parenchyma and exhibit somatic hypermutation and class-switched immunoglobulin transcripts. Furthermore, the overlap of the CSF immunoglobulin proteomes and the B cell immunoglobulin transcriptomes provides evidence that antibody-secreting cells derived from clonally expanded B cells within the CNS are a significant source of excessive intrathecal clonal immunoglobulin production, as demonstrated by the presence of OCBs in CSF [54,56].
m4ju | Meninges in MS patients include inflammatory B cell infiltrates, and a greater load of these injects to the severity of cortical lesions, neurodegeneration, and clinical impairment. B cells may serve as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reservoirs [53,54]. After EBV infection, B cells transform into antigen-processing cells, resulting in a more precise presentation of antigens. Recombinant human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein was shown to be internalized and cross-presented by EBV-infected B-cells, which were efficiently identified by cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells. Furthermore, B cells obtained from MS patients had more CD40 on their surface, indicating that B cells deliver antigens more effectively [24]. Increased expression of B cell activation markers in individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) was related to a high degree of neurodegeneration, as indicated by a rise in the number of T1 hyperintense lesions and a decrease in brain
