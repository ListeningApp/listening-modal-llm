        "content": "jzqz | See the things you want as if they were actually around you all the time. See yourself as owning and using them. Make use of them in imagination just as you will use them when they are your tangible possessions. Dwell upon your mental picture until it is clear and distinct, and then take the mental attitude of ownership toward everything in that picture. Take possession of it, in mind, in the full faith that it is actually yours. Hold to this mental ownership. Do not waiver for an instant in the faith that it is real.\n0uje | And remember what was said in a preceding chapter about gratitude: Be as thankful for it all the time as you expect to be when it has taken form. The person who can sincerely thank God for the things which as yet he owns only in imagination has real faith. He will get rich. He will cause the creation of whatever he wants.\napx3 | You do not need to pray repeatedly for things you want. It is not necessary to tell God about it every day.\nkcrm | Your part is to intelligently formulate your desire for the things which make for a larger life and to get these desires arranged into a coherent whole, and then to impress this whole desire upon the formless substance, which has the power and the will to bring you what you want.\nmbsp | You do not make this impression by repeating strings of words; you make it by holding the vision with unshakable purpose to attain it and with steadfast faith that you do attain it.\nzynb | The answer to prayer is not according to your faith while you are talking, but according to your faith while you are working.\n8h0u | You cannot impress the mind of God by having a special Sabbath day set apart to tell him what you want, and then forgetting him during the rest of the week. You cannot impress him by having special hours to go into your closet and pray, if you then dismiss the matter from your mind until the hour of prayer comes again.\nb09f | Oral prayer is well enough, and has its effect, especially upon yourself, in clarifying your vision and strengthening your faith, but it is not your oral petitions which get you what you want. In order to get rich you do not need a \"sweet hour of prayer;\" you need to \"pray without ceasing.\" And by prayer I mean holding steadily to your vision, with the purpose to cause its creation into solid form, and the faith that you are doing so.\nzutp | \"Believe that ye receive them.\"\nqgmy | Chapter Eight: Thinking in The Certain Way\n40wi | Once you have clearly formed your vision, the whole matter turns on receiving. When you have formed it, it is well to make an oral statement, addressing the supreme in gratitude. Then, from that moment on you must, in mind, receive what you ask for.\na418 | Live in the new house, wear the fine clothes, ride in the automobile, go on the journey, and confidently plan for greater journeys. Think and speak of all the things you have asked for in terms of actual present ownership. Imagine an environment and a financial condition exactly as you want them, and live all the time in that mental environment and financial condition until they take physical shape.\ne9lu | Mind, however, that you do not do this as a mere dreamer and castle builder. Hold to the faith that the imaginary is being realized and to your purpose to realize it. Remember that it is faith and purpose in the use of the imagination which make the difference between the scientist and the dreamer.\na278 | And having learned this fact, it is here that you must learn the proper use of the will.\nffto | Chapter Nine\nak21 | How To Use The Will\ni7n1 | To set about getting rich in a scientific way, you do not try to apply your will power to anything outside of yourself.\nm9yn | You have no right to do so, anyway. It is wrong to apply your will to other men and women in order to get them to do what you wish done.\ncg8u | It is as flagrantly wrong to coerce people by mental power as it is to coerce them by physical power. If compelling people by physical force to do things for you reduces them to slavery, compelling them by mental means accomplishes exactly the same thing; the only difference is in methods. If taking things from people by physical force is robbery, then taking things by mental force is robbery also. There is no difference in principle.\n2hsv | You have no right to use your will power upon another person, even \"for his own good,\" for you do not know what is for his good. The science of getting rich does not require you to apply power or force to any other person, in any way whatsoever. There is not the slightest necessity for doing so. Indeed, any attempt to use your will upon others will only tend to defeat your purpose.\n7s7l | You do not need to apply your will to things in order to compel them to come to you. That would simply be trying to coerce God and would be foolish and useless.\nuwdf | You do not have to try to compel God to give you good things, any more than you have to use your will power to make the sun rise.\njjgp | You do not have to use your will power to conquer an unfriendly Deity, or to make stubborn and rebellious forces do your bidding. Substance is friendly to you, and is more anxious to give you what you want than you are to get it.\ndf4g | To get rich, you need only to use your will power upon yourself.\nqc2j | When you know what to think and do, then you must use your will to compel yourself to think and do the right things. That is the legitimate use of the will in getting what you want - to use it in holding yourself to the right course.\nx3oh | Use your will to keep yourself thinking and acting in the certain way.\nfqvx | Do not try to project your will, or your thoughts, or your mind out into space to \"act\" on things or people. Keep your mind at home. It can accomplish more there than elsewhere.\nviae | Use your mind to form a mental image of what you want and to hold that vision with faith and purpose. And use your will to keep your mind working in the right way.\np8u9 | The more steady and continuous your faith and purpose, the more rapidly you will get rich because you will make only positive impressions upon substance, and you will not neutralize or offset them by negative impressions.\n49ky | The picture of your desires, held with faith and purpose, is taken up by the formless, and permeates it to great distances - throughout the universe, for all we know.\np5wo | The Science of Getting Rich\n74rp | As this impression spreads, all things are set moving toward its realization. Every living thing, every inanimate thing, and the things yet uncreated are stirred toward bringing into being that which you want. All force begins to be exerted in that direction. All things begin to move toward you. The minds of people everywhere are influenced toward doing the things necessary to the fulfilling of your desires, and they work for you, unconsciously.\noolg | But you can check all this by starting a negative impression in the formless substance. Doubt or unbelief is as certain to start a movement away from you as faith and purpose are to start one toward you. It is by not understanding this that most people make their failure. Every hour and moment you spend in giving heed to doubts and fears, every hour you spend in worry, every hour in which your soul is possessed by unbelief, sets a current away from you in the whole domain of intelligent substance. All the promises are unto them that believe, and unto them only.\n3ewf | Since belief is all-important, it behooves you to guard your thoughts, and as your beliefs will be shaped to a very great extent by the things you observe and think about, it is important that you should carefully govern to what you give your attention.\n5iea | And here the will comes into use, for it is by your will that you determine upon what things your attention shall be fixed.\n62l5 | If you want to become rich, you must not make a study of poverty.",
