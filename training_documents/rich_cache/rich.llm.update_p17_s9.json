All the forms that a person fashions with his hands must first exist in his thought. He cannot shape a thing until he has thought that thing.\nk5pk | So far, humankind has confined its efforts wholly to the work of its hands, applying manual labor to the world of forms and seeking to change or modify those already existing. Humankind has never thought of trying to cause the creation of new forms by impressing thought upon formless substance.\nn093 | The Science of Getting Rich\n4khi | When a person has a thought-form, he takes material from the forms of nature and makes an image of the form which is in his mind. People have, so far, made little or no effort to cooperate with formless intelligence - to work \"with the Father.\" The individual has not dreamed that he can \"do what he seeth the Father doing.\" An individual reshapes and modifies existing forms by manual labor and has given no attention to the question of whether he may produce things from formless substance by communicating his thoughts to it.\n7fh2 | We propose to prove that he may do so - to prove that any man or woman may do so - and to show how. As our first step, we must lay down three fundamental propositions.\n5isn | First, we assert that there is one original formless stuff or substance from which all things are made. All the seemingly many elements are but different presentations of one element. All the many forms found in organic and inorganic nature are but different shapes, made from the same stuff. And this stuff is thinking stuff - a thought held in it produces the form of the thought. Thought, in thinking substance, produces shapes. A human being is a thinking center, capable of original thought. If a person can communicate his thought to original thinking substance, he can cause the creation, or formation, of the thing he thinks about. To summarize this:\n5vry | There is a thinking stuff from which all things are made, and which, in its original state, permeates, penetrates, and fills the interspaces of the universe.\n9w33 | A thought in this substance produces the thing that is imaged by the thought.\njohv | A person can form things in his thought, and, by impressing his thought upon formless substance, can cause the thing he thinks about to be created.\n2olp | It may be asked if I can prove these statements, and without going into details I answer that I can do so, both by logic and experience.\nzb7x | Reasoning back from the phenomena of form and thought, I come to one original thinking substance, and reasoning forward from this thinking substance, I come to a person's power to cause the formation of the thing he thinks about.\nuadf | And by experiment, I find the reasoning true. This is my strongest proof.\nwuf4 | If one person who reads this book gets rich by doing what it tells him to do, that is evidence in support of my claim, but if every person who does what it tells him to do gets rich, that is positive proof until someone goes through the process and fails. The theory is true until the process fails, and this process will not fail, for everyone who does exactly what this book tells him to do will get rich.\nlfk1 | I have said that people get rich by doing things in a certain way, and in order to do so, people must become able to think in a certain way.\nrwjw | A person's way of doing things is the direct result of the way he thinks about things.\niazp | To do things in the way you want to do them, you will have to acquire the ability to think the way you want to think. This is the first step toward getting rich.\nksn3 | And to think what you want to think is to think TRUTH, regardless of appearances.\n8xbx | Every individual has the natural and inherent power to think what he wants to think, but it requires far more effort to do so than it does to think the thoughts which are suggested by appearances. To think according to appearances is easy; to think truth regardless of appearances is laborious and requires the expenditure of more power than any other work we are called upon to perform.\naod5 | There is no labor from which most people shrink as they do from that of sustained and consecutive thought. It is the hardest work in the world. This is especially true when truth is contrary to appearances.\nayqs | CHAPTER FOUR: The First Principle in The Science of Getting Rich\njnpq | Every appearance in the visible world tends to produce a corresponding form in the mind which observes it, and this can only be prevented by holding the thought of the TRUTH.\nr4w4 | To look upon the appearances of poverty will produce corresponding forms in your own mind, unless you hold to the truth that there is no poverty; there is only abundance.\nsswz | To think health when surrounded by the appearances of disease or to think riches when in the midst of the appearances of poverty requires power, but whoever acquires this power becomes a master mind. That person can conquer fate and can have what he wants.\n0uoj | This power can only be acquired by getting hold of the basic fact which is behind all appearances, and that fact is that there is one thinking substance from which and by which all things are made.\n0c89 | Then we must grasp the truth that every thought held in this substance becomes a form, and that man can so impress his thoughts upon it as to cause them to take form and become visible things.\n658v | When we realize this we lose all doubt and fear, for we know that we can create what we want to create, we can get what we want to have, and can become what we want to be. As a first step toward getting rich, you must believe the three fundamental statements given previously in this chapter, and in order to emphasize them, I repeat them here:\n4gqa | There is a thinking stuff from which all things are made, and which, in its original state, permeates, penetrates, and fills the interspaces of the universe.\nmpgz | A thought in this substance produces the thing that is imaged by the thought.\ngf06 | A person can form things in his thought, and, by impressing his thought upon formless substance, can cause the thing he thinks about to be created.\n75hv | You must lay aside all other concepts of the universe, and you must dwell upon this until it is fixed in your mind and has become your habitual thought. Read these statements over and over again. Fix every word upon your memory and meditate upon them until you firmly believe what they say. If a doubt comes to you, cast it aside. Do not listen to arguments against this idea. Do not go to churches or lectures where a contrary concept of things is taught or preached. Do not read magazines or books which teach a different idea. If you get mixed up in your understanding, belief, and faith, all your efforts will be in vain.\ntbiu | Do not ask why these things are true nor speculate as to how they can be true. Simply take them on trust. The science of getting rich begins with the absolute acceptance of this.\n413q | CHAPTER FIVE\n8wkl | Increasing Life\nnext | YOU MUST GET RID OF THE LAST VESTIGE OF THE OLD IDEA that there is a Deity whose will it is that you should be poor or whose purposes may be served by keeping you in poverty.\n3dfm | The intelligent substance which is all, and in all, and which lives in all and lives in you, is a consciously living substance. Being a consciously living substance, it must have the nature and inherent desire of every living intelligence for increase of life. Every living thing must continually seek for the enlargement of its life, because life, in the mere act of living, must increase itself.\nhjmm | A seed, dropped into the ground, springs into activity, and in the act of living produces a hundred more seeds; life, by living, multiplies itself. It is forever becoming more. It must do so, if it continues to be at all.\n```",
