        "content": "i3w4 | Second-order Methods. By incorporating Hessian information, second-order methods hold the promise to alleviate many of the well-known deficiencies of first-order alternatives, e.g., they are typically better suited to ill-conditioned problems. For constrained problems, generic projected (quasi) Newton methods involve iterations of the form X sub k plus one equals X sub k plus alpha sub k P sub k where\nta7u | P sub k equals the argument minimize over X in Omega the inner product of g sub k and P plus the inner product of P and B sub k P over two,\nqqu2 | where alpha sub k is an appropriately chosen step-size, e.g., backtracking line search, and B sub k captures some curvature information of f at X sub k (and also potentially the step-length as in the proximal arc search). For B sub k equals I we recover a projected gradient variant, whereas for B sub k equals H sub k, or some approximation, we obtain projected (or more generally proximal) Newton-type methods. The main drawback of this framework is that the subproblem may no longer be a simple projection even when Omega is a simple, and one has to resort to an optimisation subroutine to (approximately) solve.\nlpgr | An alternative is the interior point framework, where the constraints are directly integrated into the objective as \"barrier\" functions. While the subproblems in this framework amount to solving linear systems, to produce accurate solutions the barrier function must ap-\n1b4f | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimisation with Nonnegativity Constraints\nfh0y | proach the constraint, which can lead to highly ill conditioned subproblems. Some recent works consider interior point methods for one. In particular, in capped Newton-CG with a preconditioned Hessian is used to optimise a log barrier augmented objective. Due to issues arising from increasingly ill-conditioned subproblems, the practical efficacy of this method seems to be inferior when compared to projection-based methods, including those of first-order.\n4g6f | The issue with the general purpose second-order methods discussed so far is that, unlike projected gradient, they do not leverage the simplicity of the nonnegativity constraints and the corresponding projection. In this light, a na√Øve adaptation of the projected gradient would imply directly projecting the Newton step on the constraints, e.g., X sub k plus one equals the projection over Omega of X sub k minus alpha sub k H sub k inverse g sub k. Unfortunately, such a direct adaptation may lead to ascent directions for the objective function at the boundary. To that end, the two-metric projection (TMP) framework offers an ingenious solution. Specifically, at each iteration, the component indices, ceiling D, are divided into the approximately bound, J sub k plus, and free sets, J sub k minus, given by\nfpm1 | \nycds | J sub k plus equals the set of i in D such that X sub k i is less than or equal to delta, g sub k i is greater than zero, J sub k minus equals D excluding J sub k plus where delta is greater than zero. A matrix, D sub k, is then chosen to be \"diagonal\" with respect to set J sub k plus, that is,\nduzw | D sub k i j equals zero, i in J sub k plus, j in D excluding i, and the update is simply given by\na7jq | X sub k plus one equals the projection of X sub k minus alpha sub k D sub k g sub k.\ns9lx | It has been shown that TMP is asymptotically convergent under certain conditions and reasonable choices of D sub k. For example, for strongly convex problems, the non-diagonal portion of D sub k can consist of the inverse of the Hessian sub-matrix corresponding to the indices in J sub k minus. In this case, the update reduces to a scaled gradient in J sub k plus and a Newton step in J sub k minus. Bertsekas also shows that, under certain conditions, TMP can preserve fast \"Newton like\" local convergence. Practically, TMP type algorithms have been successfully applied to a range of problems. In large scale and nonconvex settings, employing the Newton step as part of the update may be infeasible or even undesirable. Indeed, not only can Hessian storage and inversion costs be prohibitive, the existence of negative curvature can lead to ascent directions.",
