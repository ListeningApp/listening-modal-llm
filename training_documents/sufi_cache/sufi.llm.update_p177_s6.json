        "content": "4g5b | 'Who are the people most notorious in your realm for their envy and inflexibility?' Arif asked.\nddml | 'The dyers of wool and cloth,' said the King. 'Each one thinks that he is a master-dyer, and that his techniques and knowledge are the best. These men combine with one another very seldom, and then generally only to oppose the occasional intruder or minor dyer trying to rise in the profession.'\nahtn | 'Very well,' said Arif; 'cause it to be announced to the dyers that the world's greatest master of their art is coming to take up his abode in your capital city.'\n5jda | When the dyers heard the talk of this possibility spread throughout the city, and were shown samples of Arif the Master Dyer's work, which was magnificent, they went into transports of rage. So bitterly did they begin to hate their unknown rival that it very soon became obvious to almost everyone else that powerful emotion, not justice or fidelity to their craft, lay behind their vicious, bitter and often irrational denunciations of the interloper.\nq1jc | Now the people of the country in general whom the dyers had\nke6a | not educated in distinguishing between a good dye-or dyer- and a bad one, heard the attacks, saw the rage, observed the frenzies. Indeed, it was next to impossible for them to avoid these things. And the main effect which the dyers could achieve, though this was of course not what they sought, was to get the name of Arif the Demon on every lip.\nc4gy | When Arif at last entered the town, the whole population flocked to see him. He lived quietly and with dignity among the people, who were unable to find the treachery, ignorance and evils which they had been warned against, and consequently began to conclude that they had themselves been deceived about Arif's character. Their acceptance of him, and its acceleration, were correspondingly great. Their contempt for the dyers was equally complete. People not only began to take all their dyeing to Arif, but, as in all the best tales, he inherited the kingdom as well.\nlr9x | Much lip-service is paid to the idea that people should not be envious of others, and many people believe that they are not jealous and that they do not oppose others. In fact the reverse is the case, and much of ordinary life uses envy as its fuel. You may recall the saying that there are three things which every individual considers to be attributable only to others: one, lack of a sense of humor; two, bad driving; three, jealousy.\njux5 | The planning which Sufis do, which is unfamiliar in fact if not in theory in current cultures, is contained in the saying of DÃ±un'nun the Egyptian, quoted by Khwaja Gharib Nawaz:\nbe8m | 'Sufis are those who have expunged from their minds the human tendencies of envy and enmity.'\n1lxd | I cannot forbear from saying, though, that there are many things expressed in current cultural terms which are of the greatest importance to people who want to understand the Sufi way. Some of them may be indicated for people before they can go beyond their present contexts, as you seem to want to do. Most of the people who want 'esoteric knowledge' do not bother about the basic exoteric senses which come first. In the following tale, the first two pieces of advice could have been given to the tense 'seeker' by anyone. He did not need a Sufi:\nz3ff | MISTAKEN IDENTITY\nrv0j | A certain 'seeker after Truth' rushed into the house which had been pointed out to him as that of the Eastern sage. He grabbed the hand of the figure seated on a prayer-rug and begged for advice.\nkv4p | 'I have three things to tell you,' said the other man. 'First, you are too excited to understand anything. Second, you are standing on my foot. Third, I am a servant-the Sage lives next door!'\ng1v3 | Method, System and Conditioning\n7d2w | THERE are four factors which, when applied upon human beings, 'programme' them like machines. These are the factors which are used in indoctrination and conditioning. By their use, deliberate or otherwise, self-applied or otherwise, the human mind is made more mechanical, and will tend to think along stereotyped lines.\n3b38 | Innumerable experiments, recent and ancient, have fully verified the presence and effect of these factors. They are: tension alternating with relaxation, sloganisation and repetition.\nil0a | Because most human beings are trained to accept these factors as part of their 'learning' process, almost everything which is presented to a human being to be learned is generally converted by him into material which he applies by these methods.\nmato | The test of a teaching system, and of its success, is whether one, it is applied by these methods, knowingly or otherwise; two, it develops into a system which uses these methods.\nuas3 | In the various groupings of people engaged in this kind of teaching whom I have contacted during the past few years, virtually none is free from this element or these factors. The result is that one set of slogans has been changed for another: and phrases like 'man is asleep', words like 'essence', certain exercises and techniques as well as literary material, have been studied so closely and so diligently that they have succeeded in the main only in indoctrination. Their instrumental effect is spent.\n6hc3 | It is mainly for this reason that tradition repeatedly says that the formulation must change in accordance with the people, the place and the Work.\nrkb7 | It is extremely easy to test the individuals who have developed (through no fault of their own) this (conditioned-reflex) response to work-terms and other teaching stimuli. Such people always respond in a typical manner to approaches made to them, and in this respect they do not differ from people who have been indoctrinated into any static and linear system: political, patriotic,\neu28 | economic, religious, philosophical, where the extra dimension of understanding is weak or absent.\nbes8 | There is, however, a saving grace. This is that if we retrace our position to the point just before the learning and teaching became 'established' as a conditioning in the mind of the individuals, we can reclaim the flexibility which the work demands. The methods used to do this, however, are not ones which are familiar to most people.\nqlbn | You have to be able to understand before you can verify.\nmnni | People ordinarily do not reach deeply enough into themselves to find out how to learn about what Sufis call Reality. They make premature assumptions about how to learn, and what attracts them must be good, and so on, which in the end defeats their putative purpose.\nqvk0 | THE LIMBLESS FOX\nyoge | In the Bostan of Saadi there is the tale of the man who once saw a limbless fox and wondered how it managed to be so well-fed. Deciding to watch it, he found that it had positioned itself where a lion brought its kill. After eating, the lion would go away, and the fox would eat its leavings. So the man decided to allow fate to serve him in the same way. Sitting down in a street and waiting, all that happened was that he became more and more weak and hungry, for nobody and nothing took any interest in him.\nwb8y | Eventually a voice spoke and said: 'Why should you behave like a lamed fox? Why should you not be a lion, so that others might benefit from your leavings?'\nwkvi | This story is itself an interesting test. One sometimes finds that it encourages people with a desire to teach to set themselves up as teachers, and enables others, who are more humble, to rearrange their ideas, so that they can learn first, no matter what they readily imagine about being able to teach and benefit others before getting their own focus right.\nvo68 | Everything man needs is in the world. How does he use it? Think of the Eastern proverb: 'God provides the food, men provide the cooks.'\n1329 | Western Culture\nd26s | Q: Why are you critical of Western culture?",
