You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

x0yg | Willoughby's record as an estimator, which is more relevant for our subject, was less bright. By Campbell's analysis, he "made nine badly flawed estimates in the Pacific War, which he later tried to cover up, whereas he was correct in only four key estimates."2" No wonder then that Willoughby's colleagues thought that he had "the best hindsight of any intelligence officer in the army," or that he was "a better historian than an intelligence officer."260
mjt8 | While Willoughby's record as an intelligence estimator in WWII was dubious, three tendencies that he exhibited during his service are relevant to understand his mistakes in November 1950. The first was his tendency toward centralism, as evidenced by his attempts to gain organizational monopoly over the intelligence process and his practice of personally handling the process of making intelligence estimates. Shortly after becoming MacArthur's G-2, he dismissed Australian intelligence summaries (which proved to
htcn | be correct), and throughout the war he prevented the OSS from operating in his theater of operations. After the war, he boasted that this was a major achievement. On the eve of the Korean War, he dismissed South Korean warnings that the KPA was preparing an attack. After war began, he lessened his tight centralistic policy, allowing the CIA 4 limited freedom of action, but he later prevented its agents from interrogating Chinese POWs for fear that they would produce estimates different from his own. His centralistic tendencies were also exposed in the way he estimated intelligence. Earlier in Bataan, he did the estimate while Akin was in charge of Sigint, and Sutherland, MacArthur's chief of staff, decided which intelligence would be passed on to MacArthur.205 After that, with the exception of MacArthur, there is no record of any collective intelligence estimation process under Willoughby's command. Almond testified that Willoughby "was not receptive to alternative analysis or ideas." Personal monopolization explained his personal involvement in producing the Daily Intelligence Summary.204 Sometimes, when MacArthur rejected his estimates, he took it as a personal insult.265
86d4 | In November 1950, Willoughby's tendency toward centralism led him to exclude any organization or person -apart for MacArthur himself-from interfering with the intelligence process. As a result, MacArthur, either because of wishful thinking or because of Willoughby's influence or both, underestimated the magnitude of the Chinese threat.
z7qp | Willoughby's second tendency was toward mirror imaging, that is, the inclination to estimate the opponent's policy through the prism of one's own culture, logic, and prejudice. Drea, who claimed that Willoughby often made mirror-imaging estimates, regarded it as one of his "cardinal sin."200 In April 1942, Willoughby reached the conclusion that the rational target for the coming Japanese attack would be northern Australia. His naval counterpart, Edwin T. Layton assessed, on the basis of the same intelligence information, that it would be Port Moresby in New Guinea. The May 1942 battle of the Coral Sea, the first major naval engagement since the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor, showed that Willoughby "rationale" was mistaken and Layton was right.Similarly, during the Battle of Hollandia in the summer of 1944, Willoughby misjudged, despite the excellent available intelligence information, the target and the timing of the Japanese counterattack. As he later admitted, the enemy had carried out the attack "regardless of the odds against him."26 Then, during the invasion of the island of Leyte in the Philippines in October 1944, he
6t1g | p. 182 "assessed Japanese 4 intentions according to what he would do" and concluded that they would avoid reinforcing their army due to American air-superiority." 269
cpls | Willoughby learned nothing from these mistakes. His persistent estimates, despite intelligence evidence to the contrary, that the PRC would avoid a massive intervention in Korea were based on a military logic that asserted that the best time to intervene was prior to the Inchon landing. This way of thinking did not take into account the possibility that the Chinese strategy was based on other factors-such as the reluctance to intervene at too early a stage, when the UN forces were still far from Manchuria and did not constitute a viable threat to Chinese territory. Willoughby's refusal to accept that massive Chinese forces had crossed the Yalu also reflected a belief that such a move could not take place without significant Sigint indications. He did not take into account that, unlike the American army, the CPVF was poorly equipped with wireless sets, that it was well-trained in maintaining radio silence, and that it used primitive but efficient means of communication, such as runners or dispatch riders.
m50n | Willoughby's third relevant tendency involved his need for cognitive closure. While most descriptions portray him as an authoritarian type and, hence, a person with a high need for closure, this was not always the case. Very much like Stalin during the battle for Moscow in late 1941, Willoughby was consumed by fear of invalidity at the beginning of his career as MacArthur's G-2. This was mainly the product of his lack of intelligence experience, the humiliating defeat MacArthur suffered in the Philippines, and the high cost of being mistaken at this critical stage of the war. These pressures led him, especially in 1942, to avoid fast and persistent freezing. Sometimes he even went to the other extreme, reversing major interpretations
eztf | overnight without apparent reason." 270 In addition, when he presented his assessments to MacArthur, he used to include in them all possible courses of action available to the enemy.2(1
bwsu | This was not the situation in the fall of 1950. By then, Willoughby was an experienced (though not necessarily appreciated) intelligence officer. He effectively supported his chief in the conduct of the brilliant Inchon landing, which was carried out against the opinion of many others. And now his admired boss wanted to reach the Yalu as soon as possible in order to end the war by Christmas. By this stage, Willoughby exhibited the main symptoms of a person with a high need for closure""": his thesis that the Chinese 4 lost their opportunity to intervene and therefore would avoid such a move was clear, orderly, and coherent. His intelligence-making process, which lacked any form of brainstorming, reflected a highly authoritarian leadership style, reluctance to listen to different perspectives, and no tolerance for any pluralism of opinion. His high level of confidence was exhibited by his "knowledge" (rather than estimate) that the Chinese would not intervene. It was enhanced by a similar confidence on the part of MacArthur. Willoughby, moreover, refused to consider novel information that was inconsistent with his thesis, and denied undisputed facts, as seen for example in his claim that the captured Chinese soldiers were North Koreans. As one officer had put it, "None of this [evidence for a possible large-scale Chinese intervention] was going to affect Willoughby. The Chinese were not going to come in. He knew it. And he was never wrong."273
oqod | The combination of an intelligence officer who monopolized the intelligence process, estimated the enemy according to his own logic, and exhibited the symptoms of a high need for closure and an unshakable faith that MacArthur could not be wrong provides, then, another explanation for one of the worst American intelligence fiascos in the post-WWII era.
