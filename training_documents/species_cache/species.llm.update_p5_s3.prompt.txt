You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

zlxc | Species ranges are inherently dynamic and can fluctuate tremendously over time in response to climatic, tectonic, or oceanographic events. Species ranges are naturally modified through migration and propagule dispersal or often through long-distance dispersal events assisted by wind or water cur- rents (Gillespie et al. 2012), or other organisms, without nec- essarily involving environmental changes. Human-induced environmental changes may increase the accessibility or suitability of a region for a given species (Chen et al. 2011, Fraser et al. 2018), which may allow for new geographi- cal areas to be colonized. Assessing the contribution of human-induced environmental change to range expansion will mostly be based on circumstantial evidence such as a close match between the ecological requirements of a species and the recent change in the recipient environment brought about by environmental change and attributes of the range expansion process. It is often difficult to ascertain the degree of indirect influence of human agency on species range expansion. However, it is likely that only few species that are currently expanding do so without responding to human- induced environmental change. For practical purposes, we therefore propose that evidence that the spread of a species is due to human-induced environmental change is sufficient to qualify a species to fulfill this criterion (see supplement S1 for examples), whereas evidence that range expansion is not due to human-induced environmental change should be used for identifying species that expand their ranges naturally. However, an estimate of uncertainty of the assessment should be provided. The near ubiquity of anthropogenic impacts in the Anthropocene means that under these circumstances, it may be much harder to distinguish species that are expand- ing their ranges independently of environmental change.
k0bw | Finally, the absence of direct human-mediated disper- sal for range expansion or the creation of human-made dispersal corridors (e.g., canals) is a prerequisite for a taxon to qualify as range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental change. Such human agency includes the intentional or unintentional anthro- pogenic transport of propagules or individuals from the native range (or from a previously colonized alien range) or increasing region accessibility via the construction of corridors (e.g., canals, tunnels, roads, bridges) that connect previously separated regions (e.g., river catchments, seas, islands; Essl et al. 2018). These processes may aid or allow the colonization of regions that have become newly suitable for a species. In many situations, human agency and indirect human-induced environmental change may synergistically enable species-range expansion and attributing their relative importance may be difficult. If human agency (other than human-induced environmental change) is involved, the respective taxon should be considered alien (Richardson et al. 2000, Pyšek et al. 2004, Essl et al. 2018). In addition to these defining characteristics, a range of other features is associated with the phenomenon of range-expanding native species (e.g., ecological novelty).
aq5a | Range-expanding species responding to human- induced environmental change compared with alien species
sc5y | Range expansion of species responding to human-mediated environmental change and biological invasions have com- mon features, but they differ qualitatively and quantitatively in key processes. For the former, individuals colonizing new geographic space are usually drawn from the leading edge of the historic native range, with concomitant conse- quences (e.g., these populations are often genetically less diverse than those in the central part of the range, or they may differ from populations in the central range; Excoffier et al. 2009, Wilson et al. 2009). The individuals driving long- distance dispersal may differ in dispersal-relevant traits from the average values of the population they are drawn from (Darling et al. 2008, Phillips et al. 2010, Hill et al. 2011). Therefore, populations in newly colonized regions may also differ in these traits from the source populations. Range expansion may be driven by widely different numbers of individuals, and if numbers are low (which is often the case), bottleneck and founder effects are frequent and may result in reduced genetic diversity (Excoffier et al. 2009).
0yab | In contrast, alien species may be drawn from a wide range of source populations, which are often located in the central parts of their range, and repeated introductions from differ- ent source populations are a widespread phenomenon (Shirk et al. 2014). Furthermore, postintroduction evolution in the new range because of different selection pressure and limited gene exchange with native populations has repeatedly been documented (Excoffier et al. 2009, Zhang et al. 2018). This is probably more relevant for alien species, because they typi- cally encounter substantially different selection pressures in
w95z | the new region, whereas range-expanding species respond- ing to human-induced environmental change colonize regions adjacent to their historic range with smaller differ- ences in selection pressures. However, it has been shown that native species expanding their ranges in response to climate warming experience less control by natural enemies than long-term resident natives (Engelkes et al. 2008). Therefore, populations of alien species in their new range may be more (e.g., as a consequence of repeated introductions and admix- ture) or less genetically diverse and substantially different from those in their native range, depending on the direction and strength of the relevant selection processes. However, there are many cases in which alien populations have reduced genetic diversity (Hagenblad et al. 2015). Although range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental change and aliens are likely to differ in many aspects, comparative studies are needed to determine the character and magnitude of differences between these two species categories.
0i1k | Typically, range-expanding species responding to human- induced environmental change first colonize regions directly adjacent to the historic native range and may usually only colonize regions further away from the historic range as the expansion progresses. This progression is highly contingent on the maximum spread distance of individuals and the availability of suitable habitats. Range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental change show denser, more aggregated distributions, reflecting coloniza- tion and this link between current distribution patterns and processes of distribution change can be used as indication for identifying range-expanding species (Wilson et al. 2004). In contrast, if alien species are introduced to areas outside their native range but within the same continent, the foci of primary introductions are often not adjacent to the native range, because introductions depend on human agency that helps to overcome dispersal barriers. Subsequent spread across the suitable range is also contingent on the spread potential of the species, but secondary introductions may substantially increase spread (Kowarik 2003).
dqlg | Ecological novelty is a characteristic feature of species redistribution in the Anthropocene (Saul and Jeschke 2015). Different facets of ecological novelty can be conceptual- ized, and we argue that these are associated in different ways with range-expanding and alien species (table 1). Specifically, ecological novelty can be inversely measured as ecoevolutionary experience of interacting resident and non- resident species (sensu Saul and Jeschke 2015): Organisms with novel weapons (sensu Callaway and Ridenour 2004) or other novel traits the resident species are not familiar with (i.e., they have a low ecoevolutionary experience) are expected to have stronger impacts than organisms that are similar to resident species (i.e., high ecoevolutionary experi- ence). We would expect that resident species typically have a higher ecoevolutionary experience when interacting with range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental change than with alien species coming from
