        "content": "5rxi | free energy part of the entropy per atom is thirteen point five four one nats. On the other hand, the expected energy part of the entropy per atom is two, coming from the atom's three momentum degrees of freedom. The total entropy per atom is thus\ncm65 | In A three plus one plus equals one NA three\nux5y | fifteen point zero four one\nc8vn | nats.\nalzc | To impress our friends we can convert this to bits: we divide by ln two and get about\n0dos | fifteen point zero four one\nbc48 | zero point six nine three one five equals twenty-one point seven zero zero\nf3v7 | bits of unknown information per atom of helium.\n8s6f | I've kept only five significant figures in the later stages of these calculations, since that's how precise the experimental data is. Next let's compare the final result to experiment!\nx7h9 | THE ENTROPY OF HELIUM: EXPERIMENT\nygmb | The entropy of helium at standard temperature and pressure has been measured to be one hundred twenty-six point one five joules per kelvin per mole.\n0o5y | One bit of unknown information per atom corresponds to about five point seven six three one joules per kelvin of entropy per mole.\ndnu3 | Thus, each atom of helium at standard temperature and pressure carries about one hundred twenty-six point one five\ndsty | equals twenty-one point eight eight nine\nci0z | five point seven six three one\nsban | bits of unknown information.\nhy6w | Experimentally, the entropy of helium at standard temperature and pressure is one hundred twenty-six point one five joules per kelvin per mole. Converting this to bits per atom we get twenty-one point eight eight nine, very close to our theoretical result of twenty-one point seven zero zero, but about zero point nine percent higher.\nwlk5 | There are a couple of possible reasons for this slight discrepancy. First, while our theoretical calculation assumed that helium is an ideal gas of noninteracting point particles, this is not true. The helium atoms interact!\nais9 | Second, our computation ignored quantum effects except for using Planck's constant to determine the thermal wavelength. Even for an ideal gas, quantum effects become important when V over NA three ceases to be large. This happens at high densities V over N, low temperatures T, or for particles of small mass m. Helium has a low mass as molecules of gas go and our ultimate goal, hydrogen, is even worse.\ncdkq | Now let's tackle the final summit: hydrogen. This is a diatomic gas, so it works differently.\najvs | THE IDEAL DIATOMIC GAS\nmwef | In thermal equilibrium, a classical ideal diatomic gas of N indistinguishable molecules of mass m in a three-dimensional box of volume V has expected energy\nk8pl | five E equals kNT\n04f6 | and free energy\n3nhr | F equals negative kT In N! A three N one V N\n4hg2 | where A equals h over square root two pi m k T is the thermal wavelength.\nv0rl | Its entropy S is E minus F over T, so E N over I M A three plus two minus\n8iyl | negative k ln N!\nasz3 | and using Stirling's formula In N! approximately equal to (In N minus one) N we get S approximately equal to k N (In M A three plus three) N A three\nsalu | It's easy to repeat our computation of entropy for a diatomic gas if we recall that the tumbling of the molecules adds two degrees of freedom to the three for position, giving E equals two kNT. Tracking the effects of this change we see the entropy is higher than for a monatomic gas. To be precise, the entropy of a classical ideal diatomic gas is\nv78z | approximately equal to E N (In M A S plus two) N A three\nf0em | So, it has one more nat of Shannon entropy per molecule than an ideal monatomic gas! Let's see how this plays out for hydrogen.\nc3sz | THE ENTROPY OF HYDROGEN: THEORY\nbghr | Assuming hydrogen is a classical ideal diatomic gas, its entropy is\nfdud | E N (In N A S plus two) N A three\n8191 | which corresponds to\nk3he | ln N A three V plus seven\nlze6 | nats of unknown information per molecule. At standard temperature and pressure, this gives fifteen point one four four nats or\nc1ys | ln two fifteen point one four four\n1tyf | approximately equal to twenty-one point eight four eight\nktwv | bits of unknown information per molecule.\n0yl7 | A hydrogen molecule has m equals three point three four seven zero six times ten to the negative twenty-seven kilograms, so at a temperature T equals two hundred ninety-eight point one five kelvin its thermal wavelength is\n8kqn | six point six two six zero seven times ten to the negative thirty-four joule seconds\nct3i | approximately equal to two pi times three point three four seven zero six times ten to the negative twenty-seven kilograms times one point three eight zero six four nine times ten to the negative twenty-three joules per kelvin times two hundred ninety-eight point one five kelvin\ntvep | approximately equal to seven point one two one five six times ten to the negative eleven meters.\ndmvx | For a mole of an ideal gas at standard temperature and pressure, N equals six point zero two two one four zero seven six times ten to the twenty-third and V approximately equal to zero point zero two four seven eight nine six cubic meters, so\n9z6z | approximately equal to one hundred thirteen thousand nine hundred seventy-one N A three V approximately equal to six point zero two two one four zero seven six times ten to the twenty-third times (seven point one two one five six times ten to the negative eleven meters) cubed zero point zero two four seven eight nine six cubic meters\n4qhr | We thus have\n3qb9 | ln N A three V approximately equal to In one hundred thirteen thousand nine hundred seventy-one approximately equal to eleven point six four four\naksw | Thanks to our previous work we know this means that that the logarithm of the number of accessible states of each molecule would be eleven point six four four if it were trapped in its own small box of volume V over N. There is also a correction to this simplified picture due to density fluctuations, which gives one extra nat of entropy. These add up to give the free energy contribution to the entropy per molecule: twelve point six four four nats. This is less than we got for helium. But the expected energy contribution to the entropy per molecule is larger: we again get two nats from the molecule's three momentum degrees of freedom,\np87k | but now we get one extra nat due to its two extra tumbling degrees of freedom. The total number of nats of unknown information per hydrogen molecule is thus\ninmq | ln V over N A cubed plus one plus three over two plus one approximately equal to fifteen point one four four. Finally, the number of bits of unknown information per hydrogen molecule is\nigkq | fifteen point one four four divided by zero point six nine three one five approximately equal to twenty-one point eight four eight. This is slightly more than for helium, where the number was twenty-one point seven zero zero.\nfy1j | As a sanity check, let's do this calculation a different way. A hydrogen molecule is close to half the mass of a helium atom, so its thermal wavelength should be square root two times as large. In our calculation we're treating V over N as the same for both gases, so hydrogen's V over N A cubed should be two to the negative three halves times as large as that for helium. Since ultimately we compute bits by taking a logarithm in base two, this reduces its entropy per molecule by three halves bits. However, hydrogen's two tumbling degrees of freedom increase its entropy per molecule by one nat, or one over ln two bits. We have\nfujm | negative three halves plus one over ln two approximately equal to negative one point five plus one point four four three approximately equal to negative zero point zero five seven. This suggests that each hydrogen molecule should carry zero point zero five seven fewer bits of unknown information than each helium atom. Why did our more careful calculation say hydrogen should have about\nqq4d | twenty-one point eight four eight minus twenty-one point seven zero zero approximately equal to zero point one four eight more bits of unknown information per molecule? What's the mistake?",
