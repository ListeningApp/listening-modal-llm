You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

8ov0 | When a covariate is used we look at its overall relationship with the outcome variable: we ignore the group to which a person belongs. We assume that this relationship between covariate and outcome variable holds true for all groups of participants, which is known as the assumption of homogeneity of regression slopes. Think of the assumption like this: imagine a scatterplot for each group of participants with the covariate on one axis, the outcome on the other, and a regression line summarizing their relationship. If the assumption is met then the regression lines should look similar (i.e., the values of b in each group should be equal).
mj9m | Let's make this concept a bit more concrete. Remember that the main example in this chapter looks at whether different doses of puppy therapy affect happiness when including love of puppies as a covariate. The homogeneity of regression slopes assumption means that the relationship between the outcome (dependent variable) and the covariate is the same in each of our treatment groups. Figure 13.3 shows a scatterplot with regression line that summarizes this relationship (i.e., the relationship between love of puppies, the covariate, and the outcome, participant's happiness) for the three experimental conditions (shown in different panels). There is a positive relationship (the regression line slopes upwards from left to right) between love of puppies and participant's happiness in both the control (left panel) and 15-minute conditions (middle panel). In fact, the slopes of the lines for these two groups are very similar, showing that the relationship between happiness and love of puppies is very similar in these two groups. This situation is an example of homogeneity of regression slopes. However, in the 30- minute condition (right panel) there is a slightly negative relationship between happiness and love of puppies. The slope of this line differs from the slopes in the other two groups, suggesting heterogeneity of regression slopes (because the relationship between happiness and love of puppies is different in the 30-minute group compared to the other two groups).
94h3 | Although in a traditional ANCOVA heterogeneity of regression slopes is a bad thing (Jane Superbrain Box 13.2), there are situations where you might expect regression slopes to differ across groups and that variability may be interesting.
9jx1 | For example, when research is conducted across different locations, you might expect the effects to vary across those locations. Imagine you had a new treatment for backache, and you recruit several physiotherapists to try it out in different hospitals. The effect of the treatment is likely to differ across these hospitals (because therapists will differ in expertise, the patients they see will have different problems and so on). As such, heterogeneity of regression slopes is not a bad thing per se. If you have violated the assumption of homogeneity of regression slopes, or if the variability in regression slopes is an interesting hypothesis in itself, then you can explicitly model this variation using multilevel linear models (see Chapter 21).
c3lz | 13.4.3 What to do when assumptions are violated
8bwk | A bootstrap for the model parameters and post hoc tests can be used so that these, at least, are robust (see Chapter 6). The bootstrap won't help for the F- tests though. There is a robust variant of ANCOVA that can be implemented using R, and we'll discuss this in Section 13.8.

mqot | 13.5.1 General procedure
oc99 | The general procedure is much the same as for any linear model, so remind yourself of the steps for fitting a linear model (Chapter 9). Figure 13.4 shows a simpler overview of the process that highlights some of the specific issues for ANCOVA-style models. As with any analysis, begin by graphing the data and looking for and correcting sources of bias.

b4wj | We have already looked at the data (Table 13.1) and the data file (Puppy Love.sav). To remind you, the data file is set out like Table 13.1 and contains three columns: a coding variable called Dose <LATEX>\left( 1 = c o n t r o l , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>2 = 1 5</LATEX> minutes, <LATEX>3 =</LATEX> 30 minutes), a variable called Happiness containing the scores for the person's happiness, and a variable called Puppy_love containing the scores for love of puppies from 0 to 7. The 30 rows correspond to each person's scores on these three variables.

yfv2 | variable and covariate
pujl | In Section 13.4.1, I mentioned that if the covariate and group means (independent variable) are independent then the interpretation of ANCOVA models is a lot more straightforward. In this case, the covariate is love of puppies, so we'd want to check that the mean level of love of puppies is roughly equal across the three puppy therapy groups by fitting a linear model with Puppy_love as the outcome and Dose as the predictor.
3rqe | Output 13.3 shows that the main effect of dose is not significant, <LATEX>F \left( 2 , 2 7 \right) = 1 . 9 8 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>p = 0 . 1 6 ,</LATEX> which shows that the average level of love of puppies was roughly the same in the three puppy therapy groups. In other words, the means for love of puppies in Table 13.2 are not significantly different across the control, 15-and 30-minute groups. This result is good news for using love of puppies as a covariate in the model.

You cannot enter codes to specify user- defined contrasts (but see SPSS Tip 13.1); instead you can select one of the standard contrasts that we met in Table 12.6. In this example, there was a control condition (coded as the first group), so a sensible set of contrasts would be simple contrasts comparing each experimental group to the control (this results in the same contrasts as dummy coding). Click the drop-down list ( None and select a type of contrast (in this case Simple) from this list. For simple contrasts you need to specify the reference category (i.e., the category against which all other groups are compared). By default the last category is used, which for our data is the 30-minute group. We need to change the reference category to be the control group, which is the first category (assuming that you coded control as 1). We make this change by selecting
