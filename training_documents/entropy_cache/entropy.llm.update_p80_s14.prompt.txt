You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

8dfo | Thus, in thermal equilibrium we can think of entropy as k times the log of the number of accessible states, 'corrected' so that the result doesn't change when we add a constant to the energy of every state.
lz3e | THE POWER OF THE PARTITION FUNCTION
y26m | A classical harmonic oscillator with mass m and spring constant k has energy
j0ou | p, q) = 12 + Kg 2m
zk07 | Kg2
0lr7 | Its partition function is
udsn | dp dq h
6tgb | Z(ß) = .00 00 e-BE(p,q)
7fxo | where ß is coolness and h is Planck's constant.
nzpg | From this we can find its expected energy and free energy in thermal equilibrium:
kou3 | F = - 1Inz
q8mn | (E) = - In Z dß
2n9u | and then its entropy:
xtmy | S = (E) - F T where T is temperature: $ = 1/kT where k is Boltzmann's constant.
mdfm | To test the power of the partition function, let's use it to figure out the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator. Here's the game plan. First we'll compute the partition function by doing the integral in bright red. Then we'll use it to compute the oscillator's expected energy and free energy. Then we'll subtract those and divide by temperature to get the entropy.
xjme | In fact, we've already worked out the answer to this problem:
zb9k | = k (Im (HT) +1). S
5yws | Our earlier approach led to some cool insights. But it was 'tricky', not systematic. The partition function method is systematic, so it's good for harder problems. It will also give new insight into that pesky +1.
t3fi | When we compute the entropy using a partition function, all the pain is concentrated at one point: computing the partition function! So let's get that over with.
dyg0 | HARMONIC OSCILLATOR: PARTITION FUNCTION
3n0b | A classical harmonic oscillator has energy E(p, q) = p2 + kg2 and frequency w = K /m, so its partition function is
46bq | Vm = Jm' } = VR
tocx | e-Br2 /2 rdr de
07f7 | (switching to polar)
3cv9 | (u = r2/2)
xa2i | = 1 1
xj8o | how B
gk3j | Z(()=
8vzd | Bhw
6588 | For the harmonic oscillator, the partition function is the integral of a Gaussian in two variables. A change of variables makes the Gaussian 'round', and then we use polar coordinates to do the integral.
1ms8 | The physicist Kelvin is said to have written
b1vx | ∞ e dx = VT
4i6r | on the blackboard and said "A mathematician is one to whom that is as obvious as that twice two makes four is to you." I find that rather obnoxious, but when I heard the story as a kid, I made damn sure I knew how to do this integral. The usual trick is to compute the square of this integral using polar coordinates.
a3i4 | Now we're seeing something interesting. The harmonic oscillator, whose energy depends quadratically on two degrees of freedom, is physically more important than a system whose energy depends quadratically on just one degree of freedom. And when 3 = h = w =1, the partition function of the harmonic oscillator is
heua | e .00 dx dy = | |e-+212 rdr do = 2T ~du = 2T, − 2
g2u7 | which is more fundamental than the integral Kelvin wrote down.
5l9k | HARMONIC OSCILLATOR: EXPECTED ENERGY
5zaz | A classical harmonic oscillator has partition function
pc7u | Z = Bhu Bhw
5554 | so its expected energy in thermal equilibrium is
bijr | (E) = _ 2 Inz = dß
i2gp | (E) = kT
xq5u | just as the equipartition theorem says it must be!
kbyk | Once we know the partition function of the classical harmonic oscillator, it's easy to compute its expected energy: just use
uulj | (E) = __ In Z
e3k9 | and get
5biw | (E) = - da dß In Bhw 1
n108 | β 1
nyac | We can also figure this out using the equipartition theorem. Remember, the equiparti- tion theorem applies to a classical system whose energy is quadratic. If it has n degrees of freedom, then at temperature T it has
2cn1 | (E) = KT.
c3m1 | Our harmonic oscillator has n = 2, so we get (E) = kT. Good, this matches the partition function approach!
9yo6 | HARMONIC OSCILLATOR: FREE ENERGY
kiqm | A classical harmonic oscillator has partition function
6n7u | Z(()=
codw | so its free energy in thermal equilibrium is
suvf | F = - In Z = - In B 1 Bhw 1
psc6 | F = - kT In
m69t | how
ylr1 | The partition function lets us do more! It lets us compute the free energy, too, using
7xmx | F = m Z
spty | Unlike the expected energy, the free energy involves Planck's constant:
fosi | F = - kT In
tsuw | Note kT and hw both have units of energy, so kT/hw is dimensionless, which is good because we're taking its logarithm. Also note that the free energy is negative at high temperatures! That may seem weird, but it turns out to be good when we compute the entropy.
l0hr | HARMONIC OSCILLATOR: ENTROPY
5jk8 | In thermal equilibrium at temperature T, a classical harmonic oscillator has
4cms | kT how so its entropy is
iynx | expected energy (E) = kT and free energy F = - kT In
ub6m | kT how
a67b | -
8ibh | kT + kT ln T
elv7 | S = (E) - F T
oazo | kT
l85h | + 1
he3v | how
y1kq | To compute the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator, we just use
clin | S : (E) - F T .
hiag | We get the answer we got before, of course:
wfg5 | S= k ln (In (I) +1).
f5sm | But now we can finally understand the puzzling extra +1.
yw9n | As we've seen, the entropy of any system in thermal equilibrium consists of two parts:
8u3s | 1. The free energy part, -F/T. For the classical harmonic oscillator this is
hmg7 | 2. The expected energy part, (E)/T. For the classical harmonic oscillator this is
p0a7 | (E) T
ochb | k.
pcum | The free energy part of the entropy is always k times the logarithm of the number of accessible states. For the classical harmonic oscillator, the expected energy part of the entropy must equal k by the equipartition theorem, since the oscillator's energy depends on 2 degrees of freedom. This is small compared to the free energy part when hw < kT: that is, when quantum effects are small compared to thermal effects.
bu0s | PARTICLE IN A BOX: PARTITION FUNCTION
jr8i | The energy of a classical free particle of mass m in a 1-dimensional box depends only on its momentum p:
7mby | 2,9) = 22 2m p2
a1ha | Its position q is trapped in the interval [0, L].
gkfg | Its partition function is therefore
v9o7 | Z(B) = 11º e-BE(P,q) -00 dp dq h
gq1l | h 1-00 L 100 6 1° e-Bp2/2m dp =
90in | 2Trm
8zn4 | β
exk3 | Now let's turn to our ultimate goal: computing the entropy of a box of gas. As a warmup, let's figure out the entropy of a single particle in a box. In fact, let's start with a a free classical particle in a one-dimensional box: that is, in some interval [0, L].
tx5q | The first step is to compute its partition function. As you can see, this is easy enough. But the whole idea raises some questions. Some people get freaked out by the concept of entropy for a single particle I guess because it involves probability theory for a single particle, and they think probability only applies to large numbers of things.
ly5j | I sometimes ask these people "how large counts as large?" In fact the foundations of probability theory are just as mysterious for large numbers of things as for just one thing. What do probabilities really mean? We could argue about this all day: Bayesian versus. frequentist interpretations of probability, etc. I said a tiny bit about this before, and I won't say more now.
h2rq | Large numbers of things tend to make large deviations less likely. For example the chance of having all the gas atoms in a box all on the left side is less if you have 1000 atoms than if you have just 2. This makes us worry less about using averages and probability.
