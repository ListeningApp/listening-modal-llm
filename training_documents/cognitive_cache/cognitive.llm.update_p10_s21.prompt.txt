You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

5bjs | In one of the top AIC models, Pentagon is split into Pentagon*initial and Pentagon*repeat, instead of Pentagon*area and Pentagon*side. This suggests that the distinction between the first use of a Pentagon skill in a problem and later uses of that skill in the same problem may be more significant than the distinction between the area and the side. Usually repeated use of a skill in the same problem is easier than the original use. For instance, once a student makes the initial relatively difficult determination that the Pentagon formula is relevant to a problem and recalls it, he need only use it again and perform easier arithmetic in repeated opportunities in that same problem.
uodj | 5.4 Combining the Results from Experiment 1, 2, 3
k16v | By combining the results from the three experiments, we can address question 3 -- How can we use LFA to improve the tutor and the curriculum by identifying over- taught or under-taught rules, and adjusting their contribution to curriculum length without compromising student performance?
b2lm | Parallelogram-side has a high intercept (2.06) and a low slope ( -. 01). Its initial success probability is .94 and the average number of practices per student is 14.9. Much practice spent on an easy skill is not a good use of student time. Reducing the amount of practice for this skill should save student time without compromising their performance. Trapezoid-height has a low intercept (-1.55), and a positive slope (.27). Its initial success probability is .29 and the average number of practices per student is 4.2. The final success probability is .69, far away from the level of mastery. More practice on this skill is needed for students to reach mastery.
ti7f | The advantage of LFA goes even further. An original rule may have two split rules, each of which need decidedly different amounts of practice, because they have different initial difficulty and learning rates. However, students who have appeared to master the original rule in the curriculum before even reading the second split rule might not get enough practice on the second split rule. Compose-by-multiplication is such a case, as seen in table 9.
oksu | With final probability .92 students seem to have mastered Compose-by- multimplication. However, the decomposition of the skill shows a different picture. CMarea does well with final probability .96. But CMsegment has final probability only .60 and an average amount of practice less than 2. The knowledge-tracing algorithm in the tutor may let the student go after he reaches the mastery on Compose-by-addition in the original model. But with the model found by LFA, the knowledge-tracing algorithm will be able to catch the weakness of students in acquiring CMsegment.
wtow | 6 Conclusions and Future Work
o22k | Learning Factors Analysis is a way to combine statistics, human expertise and combinatorial search to evaluate and improve a cognitive model. The system we have developed is implemented in Java and is able to evaluate a model in seconds and conduct a search evaluating hundreds of models in 4-5 hours. The statistics for each model are meaningful, and the new improved models have better statistical scores and are interpretable. We are planning to use the method for datasets from other tutors to discover its potential for model and tutor improvement.
