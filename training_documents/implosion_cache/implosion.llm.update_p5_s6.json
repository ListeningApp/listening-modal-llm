I believe that last statement is a fact; I know it is my hope and commitment. This position is not relativism; it is a principled refusal of the stacked deck that forces choice between loaded dualities such as realism and relativism.\nnwfz | TAKE A WALK ON THE WILY SIDE . . .\nnvfy | When my students read Haraway, they are often struck by the density of descriptions that span centuries and cultures, corporations and identities, without ever being nonspecific. Her stories of the bomb, gene, brain, mouse, vampire, and the like are not generic stories of mice, for instance, but of OncoMouse™ and even of particular OncoMice™ at specific labs. Students complain sometimes\nmror | about the too much information that inhabit them, and worry that the stories are biased. They often voice as criticism what Haraway takes as a principle of research: \"Stories and facts do not naturally keep a respectable distance; indeed, they promiscuously cohabit the same very material places.\" The actual liveliness, the wiliness of nature and culture as natureculture is what I wish to point to and respond with. But often this does not convince them. Instead I have found that the best way to get my students to appreciate Haraway's necessary work is to give them an assignment. I call it the \"Implosion Project,\" after her most productive methodological image. Implosion is a concept whose first dictionary definition is \"a violent collapse inward,\" as when a star collapses on its own gravity to form a black hole. Analogously, world histories are not just found inside objects, and objects do not \"point\" to them; in important ways each object is made of imploded histories: \"Any interesting being in technoscience, like a textbook, molecule, equation, mouse, pipette, bomb, fungus, technician, agitator, or scientist can-and often should be teased open to show the sticky economic, technical, political, organic, historical, mythic, and textual threads that make up its tissues.\"\nzlxc | Haraway's lists are always important constructions. Here, facts, media, things, people are equally all implosions, all material-semiotic actors, all unpackable, all full of different threads that \"can-and often should\" be teased out. The list of threads-\"economic, technical, political, organic, historical, mythic, and textual\"-appears in more or less similar forms, with economic, labor, epistemological, and other dimensions appearing. Haraway also defines implosion as a force bringing multiple dimensions together, connecting them, and as \"a claim for heterogeneous and continual construction through historically located practice, where the actors are not all human.\" So the first part of the assignment is to see how many dimensions of a particular object one knows about, to explore the vastly different stories that one can tell about it.\nk0bw | The multiple dimensions that make up objects also make up ourselves, as well as our categories. Telling the stories of an object therefore begins unpacking our own clichés, our certainties, our affects. Writes Haraway: \"The point is simple: the technical, textual, organic, historical, formal, mythic, economic, and political dimensions of entities, actions, and worlds implode in the gravity well of technoscience or perhaps of any world massive enough to bend our attention, warp our certainties, and sustain our lives.\"\naq5a | Following connections is thus the only way to proceed, no matter how worrisome the result. The physics here is serious: the world itself is warped and\nsc5y | the straight lines we see between categories may be twisted, but those twists must be carefully followed. Only in this manner can we confront the histories and the intolerable not just in objects but in ourselves, in our identities as partial, in our senses, our worries, and our common sense. As does Deleuze, though in an implosive, grounded register, Haraway seeks other ways of thinking, writing, and doing politics. \"We do not seek partiality for its own sake, but for the sake of the connections and unexpected openings situated knowledges make possible.\"\n0yab | The Implosion Project is designed to guide one through the arduous homework required to write an implosion with awareness and commitment. It consists of a series of questions, organized by dimensions to explore the tissues of an object. Following these is a set of analytic twists, each one turning the implosion on oneself, one's common sense, and on the world. The project originated while I was a teaching assistant for Haraway's \"Science and Politics\" class at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I came to see that it helped generate more interesting projects, ones that mattered to the writer, and at the same time helped explicate some aspects of Haraway's unique style and power. I have continued to experiment with it and assign it in almost all my classes. I will explain how after I outline the process.\nw95z | IMPLOSION PROJECT: The Assignment\n0i1k | Implosion Projects are attempts to teach and learn about the embeddedness of objects, facts, actions, and people in the world and the world in them. The emphasis is on details and nonobvious connections, as well as on the many dimensions with which we can analyze them: labor, professional, material, technological, political, economic, symbolic, textual, bodily, historical, educational.\ndqlg | Pick an artifact, a fact, a process as \"it.\" Make sure it is as specific as possible (not just fluoxetine, but one of those colored, branded Prozac pills that is in your medicine cabinet; not just the fact that a monkey can use sign language, but the materialized, stated claim in a nineteen ninety-nine journal article). How can it be conceptualized? What is it to different groups of people and individuals? How is it situated in the world and how is the world situated in it? Following is a hastily put-together, quite incomplete, yet apparently excessive list of possibly relevant aspects of any artifact (whether it be a social movement, a name, a grouping, a set of actions, or a process in the form of a thing, a grain of rice, a mouse, a mouse pad, an ad about a mouse, you, a fact of life, a book, a statistic, an event, a story . . . ).\np6pq | With your specific artifact, fact, object, or process in front of you, brainstorm: Go through the list slowly and try to answer each question as best you can. Diagram or make a chart if you need to. It may seem hard to know where to put different answers, as the questions are indiscrete. \"Potent categories collapse into each other. Analytically and provisionally we may want to move what counts as the political to the background and to foreground elements called technical, formal, or quantitative, or to highlight the textual and semiotic while muting the economic or mythic.\"\nzse6 | Note your form of certainty as well: whether you feel you know the answer in detail, have a good idea about it, a guess, or no idea. Take your time. It may take more than one session. Don't do any extra research at this point. Type it in so you can add more later. If there are more dimensions that strike you as needing inclusions, add them and iterate questions for them as well.\n```",
