You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

qecd | 13 Information Intermediation and Reference Services
1o7p | Editor's Introduction
cp13 | Chapter 13: Information Intermediation and Reference Services examines the changing role of reference services as information users and intermediators engage with a plethora of information in both physical and virtual formats. Reference services lecturer and coeditor of two reference books, Johanna Tunon uses her expertise to summarize reference services, highlighting it as an essential component of information services. Tunon explores the impact of new technologies on reference services and the changing methods of informa- tion intermediation and instruction, as well as strategies for addressing the decentralized and distributed roles of today's reference librarians.
bgre | The chapter begins with a history of reference services before the internet, clarifies what is and what is not considered reference services, and examines the "new normal" as reference services and information intermediation now predominantly take place online. Information seekers today are using new technologies that change the way librarians approach reference services, and Tunon provides the reader with a toolbox for navigating this changing landscape and for effectively responding to today's often complex questions.
57lp | Reference services require the flexibility to deal with "rapid political, health, climate, and work-related changes," and information professionals will need to constantly improve their skill sets, reference platforms, and information-retrieval tools. Information professionals today need to prepare for changing user behaviors, help engage patrons with new information tools and resources, and partner with other organizations to maximize both programming and services. Tunon guides the reader through this essential role of information services and provides the resources they need to engage with diverse users and even more diverse information needs.
ukth | The advent of the internet and Reference 2.0 services have changed the role of reference librarians in the last quarter century from passive purveyors of information to information intermediators and facilitators who help patrons access information in a myriad number of old and new ways. This chapter examines the changing roles of reference services and information intermediation in the twenty-first century. After completing this chapter, the reader should have an understanding of:

0myz | Reference Services Before the Internet
xh3i | Up until about 150 years ago, information professionals primarily focused on the acquisition and organization of library holdings, and libraries were premised on providing a shared and enclosed location where books, journals, and other types of information could be accessed and used (see also Chapter 2: History of Libraries, Information, and Communities). In his 1876 paper "Personal Relations Between Libraries and Readers," Samuel Swett Green1 introduced the concept of reference services as information intermediation through the process of helping users resolve a particular query, interest, task, or problem.
syiw | The pre-internet reference model provided librarian-centric reference services2 at a reference desk staffed by professional librarians who conducted reference interviews to better understand the information needs of users. Reference questions ranged from ready reference questions about discrete facts, data, or information and verification of bibliographic information to directional, procedural, technical, subject, and specialized research questions. Reference librarians were typically supported by a physical reference collection of encyclopedias, dictionaries, atlases, thesauri, handbooks, direc- tories, government documents, print indexes, and more that were housed nearby for ready access. Pre-internet roles ranged from answering various types of questions, providing library instruction on how to use library resources, and offering readers' advisory services. These roles remain essential for serving information users today and helping them meet their information needs.3 However, as reference services adapt to new trends in how information users seek information, so too must the competencies of reference services be defined, as is demonstrated in Textbox 13.1.

lvae | Reference Services for the Twenty-First Century
o9sc | Reference services in the twenty-first century continue to focus on "providing assistance by using expertise in response to an information need."4 This 2021 Reference User and Services Association (RUSA) definition puts the focus squarely on information providers who help users address informa- tion needs by helping them locate and access needed resources. Contact with an information interme- diator or library staff person can entail everything from the knowledge and use of information sources to providing recommendations, interpretations, or instruction related to those information queries.
121u | This is noteworthy because a reference transaction is defined as "knowledge, use, commendation, interpretation, or instruction in the use of one or more information sources"5 rather than in terms of the amount of time or the duration of a reference transaction.
zh03 | Reference work has traditionally been conducted at a reference desk, but big reference desks have fallen out of favor in recent years.6 One alternative has been the use of a single integrated service point for circulation, technology, and reference services staffed primarily by well-trained paraprofessionals. Another popular approach uses tiered reference ser- Check This Out vices, with paraprofessionals and student workers7 who answer routine questions (e.g., about holdings, policies, printing issues, directions to the bathroom, and more) and professional librarians who are con- tacted for more difficult questions.
1mvw | Reference help is provided to a diverse range of users, from LBGTQ+ individuals and seniors with technology questions about their smart devices to members of various minority groups and individuals who are unsheltered. Less traditional methods of providing reference help are also exemplified by the Jails and Reentry Services (JARS)8 program offered by reference librarians at the San Francisco Public Library. These librarians (with the help of library students and interns) use the old-fashioned postal mail to serve individuals who are incarcerated.
6d4s | Reference work does not include two areas of public service, however, as defined in RUSA's updated 2021 definition.9 The first area not considered reference work is the formal provision of programs and workshops because the information being provided to users is offered in anticipation of a possible information need rather than in response to user questions about specific information needed (see also Chapter 5: Information Needs). The second area of public service not included is formal library instruction (see also Chapter 18: Teaching Users: Information and Technology Literacy Instruction). Even though RUSA does clearly recognize library instruction as an important and integral part of the continuum of reference services offered to users, formal instruction is not considered a reference service per se because it is initiated in response to requests by instructors or teachers rather than in response to identified information needs of students. It should be noted, however, that RUSA does count asynchronous aids (such as LibGuides,10 subject guides, and FAQs) as providing types of reference work because these research aids respond to users' on-demand11 requests for assistance.
mqah | Tools used for reference services have expanded and continue to evolve in a number of ways. First of all, as online databases, library catalogs, and websites evolved, the line between traditional reference tools (like bibliographies, encyclopedias, dictionaries, and atlases) on one hand and online sources on the other has become less distinguishable with the result that information sources are becoming less place bound.12 Subscriptions to reference resources (e.g., JSTOR, NewsBank, and Web of Science) and free government databases (e.g., ERIC, PubMed, and EDGAR) have become common- place, whereas print reference tools (such as Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature and Books in Print) have become increasingly obsolete (see also Chapter 3: The Transformative Information Landscape).
