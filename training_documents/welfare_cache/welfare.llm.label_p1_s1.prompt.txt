You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

8r5j | Introduction
2taz | In recent decades, reforms in the welfare state and public services have been strongly influenced by New Public Management (NPM) and New Public Governance (NPG) (Fuertes et al. 2014; Jantz, Christensen and Lægreid 2015; Pollitt and Bouckaert 2017). Increasing efficiency through private sector methods has been a strong driver behind many NPM-type reforms (Aucoin 1990), and NPG ideas are reflected in intentions to make the administration more user- friendly, holistic and cooperative (Askim et al. 2011; Lægreid and Rykkja 2015; Reiter and Klenk 2019). Although the type and character of reform differ per country, an important common setting was the policy shift to 'activation' since the 1990s (Barbier 2015; Finn, Peromingo and Mwasikakata 2019), implying a change in focus from well-being to work, with a reduction of social expenditure and more flexibility of the labour market as important objectives (Hemerijck et al. 2012). 'Activation policies' often have been associated with shared governance characteristics, such as one-stop agencies, decentralisation, quasi-markets for service provision, reduced influence of social partners, performance management and the individualisation of social interventions (Fuertes et al. 2014; Knuth and Larsen 2010; Van Berkel 2009). Given the common premise of 'activation', convergence in developing similarities
o3ya | in structures and processes of welfare administrations can be expected after three decades. Nevertheless, national institutional contexts may influence reform trajectories and lead to a (re)confirmation of differences between states (Champion and Bonoli 2011; Jantz et al. 2015; Pollitt and Bouckaert 2017).
r5il | In this paper, we examine to what extent convergence and/or divergence occurs in reform of the welfare state administration, which we broadly define as administration and delivery of employment services, social services and the benefit system (Christensen et al. 2009). Unlike many studies with a shorter time horizon, we take a longitudinal, comparative approach, studying reforms in two countries over three decades. The paper takes the following questions as a starting point for a discussion of the reforms: What are the relationships and tensions between NPM and NPG, and how do we see these models reflected in the reforms in two welfare administrations? Is there growing convergence or divergence in the reform process and in current systems, and how can these tendencies be explained? We first discuss how such questions are more generally addressed in literature on public sector reform. Then we examine the reform trajectories and their consequences for the present welfare administrations, in particular on two key themes (Knuth and Larsen 2010; Weishaupt 2011): the relationship between central and decentralized governance (levels), and the role and position of key stakeholders (e.g. clients, social partners). We do this by examining two of the largest public sector reforms in Norway and the Netherlands (Champion and Bonoli 2011). With the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV) in Norway (2006) and the Structure of the Administration of Work and Income (SUWI) in the Netherlands (2002), both countries chose for a major change of their institutional framework for public welfare and employment services
5gui | Next, we review literature on public sector reform to develop our analytical framework. We provide an overview of the methods and dataset as the basis of our empirical analysis. Our
82qc | findings are presented in two steps: we analyse the reform paths in Norway and the Netherlands over the past three decades, and then compare their impact on the present welfare administrations. Finally, we draw the lessons from the reforms in the two countries, and relate our findings to theory on public sector reform.
ls7d | Theoretical context
tzt3 | Literature on public sector reform distinguishes alternative, ideal-type governance models, including: the traditional model of public administration (TPA), new public management (NPM) and the new public governance (NPG) (or post-NPM) model, also called network governance (NG) (Ferlie and Ongaro 2022; Osborne 2010; Pollitt and Bouckaert 2017).
t8vv | The TPA model has been characterized by a strict hierarchy, with permanent and neutral civil servants, who implement public policies that are determined solely by politics (Hughes 1998). Top-down planning, central regulation and control, and a high level professional expertise are main elements of the 'traditional model' that remained the most successful management model in the public sector for more than a century. Since the early 1980s, many countries have moved away from (some of) its principles and aimed to replace TPA for a rigid bureaucracy based on procedures rather than a focus on results (Hughes 1998). In the economic crisis of the 1970/80s and an expanding welfare state, more efficiency and manageability were sought and alternative models have emerged.
qvnu | The well-known alternative NPM model is a doctrine for a more efficient, cheaper public sector that is more responsive to its citizens ('customers'). NPM imported business concepts, such as management targets for performance, output measurement and contracts as main forms of coordination rather than hierarchical relationships (Hood 1991). It combined a central role for management with disaggregated organizational forms (such as business units and executive
kggw | organisations), and introduced market mechanisms such as competitive tenders and performance rankings (Hood 1991; Pollitt and Dan 2011). NPM has been very influential but showed huge variation and also received much criticism (Ehrler 2012; Lepuante and Van der Walle 2020; Pollitt and Bouckaert 2017). Its emphasis on private sector methods has been contested and NPM is criticized for centralised decision making by public managers, rather than supporting decentralization in public organizations as it claims (Mongkol 2011).
xrd1 | NPG (as a post-NPM model) promotes horizontal coordination between government and non- state actors to enhance broader legitimacy, support and resources for policy and implementation. NPG is often viewed a response to NPM-shortcomings (Klenk and Reiter 2019; Lapuente and Van der Walle 2020), but has its roots in older collaborative and network- based approaches (Ferlie and Ongaro 2022). In NPG, the pursuit of shared goals is central. Important elements are a holistic view of social problems, collaborative structures and joint leadership with cross-border skills (Van Berkel and Borghi 2007). Klenk and Reiter (2019) reveal that "the post-New Public Management idea has been very influential as an 'ideational weapon' to indicate a crisis of the New Public Management model", but they question a (large) practical impact of the post-NPM ideas.
5746 | The origins of the three models have been situated as sequential in time (TPA-NPM-NPG), but empirical studies indicate that newer models are added to prior ones rather than replace them (Christensen et al. 2009; Greve, Lægreid, and Rykkja 2016). The result of the subsequent reforms is then an increasing hybridization, where various governance principles are used at the same time (Lægreid and Rykkja 2015; Van Berkel and Borghi 2007). Studies of hybrid public organisations show that principles derived from alternative reform models are not automatically well aligned (Fossestøl et al. 2015; Van Gestel, Denis and Ferlie 2020). Tensions have been identified between NPM and NPG due to mutual incompatibility; in particular between simultaneous aims for competition and collaboration (Qvist 2016). The question of
7toz | whether and how reform ideas based on alternative public management models can be successfully combined has not yet been answered (Hartley, Sørensen and Torfing 2013; Lepuante and Van der Walle 2020). More empirical work, especially with a longitudinal and comparative view, is needed to understand the long-term trends (Finn et al. 2019; Reiter and Klenk 2019).
j346 | Comparison of welfare state reforms raises the question of whether there are general patterns in terms of "convergence" or "divergence". While convergence implies the reforms are moving in the same direction, divergence means that they are moving apart. In this paper, divergence and convergence are terms used to describe the directional relationship of the reforms in the two welfare administrations and of the current delivery systems in the two countries. For a long time, the welfare state literature has largely concentrated on substantive policies rather than pathways of reform and administrative styles (Champion and Bonoli 2011; Howlett 2002). In general, the public management literature has considered prominent patterns of transnational convergence toward NPM (OECD 1995; Pollitt and Dan 2011); though with different types and degrees in adopting NPM ideas in welfare administrations (Ehrler 2012; Knuth and Larsen 2010; Jantz et al. 2015). These differences are usually subscribed to variation in the institutional context, e.g. between unitary and federal states; liberal and social-democratic political traditions (Pollitt and Bouckaert 2017). It has been suggested that differences in the way national labour markets are governed and in the role of social partners can be explained by institutional legacies and ideological preferences (Christensen et al. 2009; Weishaupt 2011).
v8uq | Different pathways are also noticed when it comes to how NPG ideas for collaborative, integrated services have influenced reform. A large comparative study (Scharle, Duell, Minas et al. 2018) distinguishes two reform paths of welfare administrations in Europe: a comprehensive model where case management transcends various policy areas and where services and organizations are merged; and a second, more voluntary model of service
x972 | integration with considerable freedom for local decisions and variation. The study points to the relevance of the institutional context to understand these differences, suggesting the first pathway requires a base of highly developed services and a strong public administration (e.g. Germany, Ireland, UK and the Basque Country) while in the second type of reform, NPG ideas are embedded in existing institutional frameworks with services less developed and constitutional barriers or limited capacity of public administration (e.g. France, Switzerland, Romania). Although neither Norway nor the Netherlands were part of the study, the authors suggest that Norway would fit the extended NPG variant, while the Netherlands may represent Se the more voluntary model (Scharle et al. 2018). So not only patterns of convergence are observed, but also those of significant divergence in reform of welfare administrations.
cwrw | In this paper, we examine convergence and divergence in two welfare administrations and analyse how NPM and NPG can be recognized in reforms over three decades. We compare reforms in two ways: in each country over time and between the two nations. Our longitudinal study evaluates the process and administrative consequences of the NPM and NPG reforms that are controversial in theory and still little known in practice (Lepuante and Van der Walle 2020;
4i0e | Methods
h2l3 | Data for this paper are derived from key studies of both authors in analysing welfare state reforms in their respective countries between 1990 and 2020 (see Table 1).
dfzb | Table 1 Key publications on welfare state reform in Norway and the Netherlands
u6ty | The studies mainly use qualitative methods and are based on literature, interviews and documents. To illustrate, in a recent study of regional network governance in the Dutch welfare administration, 37 (group) interviews with 64 managers, professionals and stakeholders were
awvu | conducted (2019-2020)1. In Norway, we drew for recent data on the 2019 evaluation of the implementation of the white paper "NAV in a new era"2, involving interviews with employees and managers from frontline organizations and regional administrations (94 persons in total). For our studies on welfare governance reform in both countries, we also extensively reviewed public documents, such as government proposals to parliament, reports from public committees, and monitoring and evaluation reports.
on9b | Our analytical approach draws on a narrative strategy (Langley, 1999), in which we sought to construct a detailed story as a way of obtaining an overall understanding of the reform processes in each country over three decades. We used the governance models as described in the theory section to gain an understanding of whether the reform trajectories reflect NPM and NPG ideas. The following step in our data analysis was a cross-national comparison of reform ideas in different phases of the reforms and in the current welfare administrations, to identify convergence and/or divergence.
a8ge | Next, we first analyse the major reforms over the past three decades in both countries and then compare their impact on the current welfare administrations.
h27a | Growing convergence in reform paths
pdjh | Since the 1990s, remarkable changes can be mentioned in both countries. Although there lately is growing convergence in reform (since 2008), significant divergence characterizes the earlier phases. The main shifts over three decades are shown in Table 2.

bd9h | We elaborate on the reform process below.
m047 | Norway
gy8c | In the 1990s, before the NAV reform, the national insurance administration (NIA) and the public employment service (PES) were separate hierarchies; NIA more a TPA type organisation, instructing the local NIA offices, and PES more a NPM governed administration.
y4mj | Labour market programs were outsourced through a buyer-supplier model, in the expectation that this would allow for easy upscaling and downscaling of services, parallel to the economic situation. Tasks left with the PES were assessment and referral to programs. During the same period, efforts were made to transform sheltered workshops into vocational/reintegration service providers. Their services were increasingly subject to competition and tenders.
vpgq | The NAV reform followed earlier incremental efforts to stimulate local cooperation between the NIA, PES and the municipalities. These were hampered by bureaucratic boundaries at the national level, leading parliament to direct the government to propose reform. The first proposal contained only minor changes; it was rejected by parliament and sent back to government, where the new minister argued that a merger at the national level (between PES and NIA) was necessary to achieve cooperation at the local level. So we see here incremental steps leading to an impasse, followed by political pressure for a more radical shift.
ousl | Characterizing the Norwegian reform trajectory since 2000, Breit et al. (2022) identify three phases. The first phase (2000-2007) involves the establishment of the new NAV organization, and experimentation with integrated work forms. The NAV reform included a merger between the two state administrations (for National Insurance and Labour Market) and municipal welfare services in one-stop local agencies, and the PES moved from a buyer-supplier model to integration and some decentralisation. With its weight on horizontal coordination and autonomy at the local level, the NAV reform displayed traces of a NPG paradigm that frontline managers during the reform process operationalised in a more integrated office.
m4ju | In 2008-2014, a broader reform followed to increase efficiency, e.g. by re-centralization of the national insurance administration, (digital) standardized work tools for client services and performance indicators and requirements regarding documentation (Andreassen 2019; Jantz et al. 2015). This second phase involved a roll back and a return to NPM ideas, an effort to turn the frontline offices into single purpose organizations for employment services only (preferable
