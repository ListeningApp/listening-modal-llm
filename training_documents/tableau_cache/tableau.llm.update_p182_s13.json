The parameter automatically appears next to the Region Quick Filter. It would look better if the two were stacked. So, add a Vertical Layout Container to the Horizontal Container with the header and filter, and then move the Filter and parameter into it.\npiqi | Seven. Add an extra one hundred pixels of height to the dashboard.\nmjsy | Filters and Actions\n01g9 | Modifying titles\n7cm1 | We can modify the header of the dashboard to reflect the selection of a year as well. The title is hard-coded to identify carbon dioxide emissions from two thousand eight, but if we select a different year from the parameter, such as two thousand five, then we need to ensure that the title is updated.\noyk6 | We can add the parameter to the title by performing the following steps:\n3qp5 | One. Double-click on the title.\nguux | Two. Delete the hard-coded reference to two thousand eight.\nfhkp | Three. Click on the Insert button.\nur19 | Four. Select the parameter that we want to add, as shown in the following screenshot:\nytow | Since this title is actually a text object on the dashboard and not a specific worksheet title, we cannot insert field values, but we can insert parameters. It's always a good idea to make it very obvious what your user is looking at so that they don't run the risk of assuming the wrong thing.\nozjl | Filtering across multiple data sources with parameters\nxux5 | Parameters are useful when you need to filter across multiple data sources. We loaded a second data source, which contains data related to the foreign aid given to various countries by the United States since nineteen forty-eight, into our workbook. There are several fields that have the same name, namely Region, Country, and Year. We created a simple bar graph that shows the total aid in dollars over a period of time on a new worksheet called Aid Graph.\n53mt | Chapter Eight\nowo1 | We created a filtering field for this visualization that shows only the Year selected in the parameter and the thirty years before it. In this case, we're using the same Year parameter that is being displayed on the dashboard. We also created a Calculated field, referencing it in the Foreign Aid data sources, and then added it to the Filters shelf, just like we did on the map and line graph, as shown in the following screenshot:\nzz70 | We will create a new parameter that allows users to select the visualization that they wish to view in the third of the last workbook, which is where we show granular details. Currently, the Region KPIs worksheet is displayed there, but we would like to provide users with the option of deciding what to see in the workbook.\nslcr | In order to do this, we will create a new parameter. Then, we will create a Calculated field that can be used as a filter in each data sources.\nz9at | Let's create a parameter by performing the following steps:\n7dov | One. Create a new parameter and name it Select Granular Details, which is a string with a list of two possible values.\nznos | Two. We have capitalized these two values carefully because Tableau Public is case-sensitive. We will include following values in a Calculated field in the next step. The values are shown in the following screenshot:\nbngy | Degree Region Emissions KPIs\nxja2 | Three. Click on OK.\nb9a5 | Four. In the Foreign Aid data source, create a new Calculated field. This field will use a case statement to create a string output based on the parameter's selection.\nthi8 | One hundred sixty-six\nentm | Chapter Eight\nknql | Five. We named the field Granular Selection Filter, and we wrote a case statement that states that if Region Emission KPIs is selected, then the output is emissions; otherwise, it's Foreign Aid. If there were more than two values, then we would have another condition, as shown in the following screenshot:\nez57 | Six. Click on OK.\nxwza | Seven. Add the Granular Selection Filter field to the Filters shelf of the Aid Graph.\nkw2g | Eight. The string value that corresponds to the current value of the parameter will be displayed in the Filter list. Select it and click on OK.\nevst | Nine. Select Show Parameter Control and select the other value. The graph should now appear.\nr4ei | Ten. Right-click on the Granular Selection Filter field and select Copy. We'll paste it exactly as is into the data source that contains the other worksheet on that we want to work.\nv3un | Eleven. Go to the Region KPIs worksheet. In the Dimensions pane, right-click on it and select Paste. The field that you just created now exists in both the data sources.\nmmh7 | Twelve. Right-click on the Select Granular Details parameter and select Show Parameter Control. You have to do this on every sheet on which you'd like to see it.\n15mo | Thirteen. Ensure that the value selected corresponds to the graph that you're viewing.\nhaqw | Filters and Actions\n89i1 | Fourteen. Drag the Granular Selection Filter field to the Filters shelf and select emissions, as shown in the following screenshot:\ngfu5 | Fifteen. Click on OK.\nmvzl | Now, we can go back to the dashboard and add the parameter and the new visualization.\nbuwu | We will stack the visualizations into a Vertical Layout Container, and we will hide the title of each so that no space is unnecessarily taken up when it isn't selected. Then, we will modify the space in the title names of account for the parameter selection by performing the following steps:\nzsfu | One. First, add a Vertical Layout Container to the bottom of the dashboard and add the Region KPIs and Aid Dollars worksheets into it.\nhyvo | Two. When you do this, the parameters that appear in these worksheets will be added to the container with the filter and parameter at the top.\n5l9v | Three. Add a Horizontal Layout Container within the new Vertical Layout Container.\n6tv1 | Four. Change the title for this area so that it is not floating and drag it into the Horizontal Layout Container.\nl79g | Five. Drag the parameter from the top into the Horizontal Layout Container as well.\nd8ia | Six. Modify the text for the title so that it represents exactly what we can see in the following screenshot:\nv012 | Chapter Eight\ncrl5 | Seven. Right-click on the title for the Aid Graph and hide it.\nxqom | Eight. Note that when you change the parameter value, both the title and the visualization change.\nmwss | Nine. If you're having issues with the visualizations changing properly, the first thing that you need to check is the capitalization and spelling in the case statement. It's fairly common to make mistakes when writing these statements. Therefore, you should check them to ensure that you have written conditions that match the parameter values perfectly:\nqba8 | Actions\n24cj | There are three types of actions that you can create on dashboards to add context, relevance, and specificity for your users, namely Highlight, Filter, and U R L.\nkkr4 | The following list describes these three action types:\np3um | Highlight actions: These draw attention to marks related to selections in a visualization without filtering other data points on the visualization.\nfcs1 | Filter actions: These show only the selections made in a source visualization. They can be set up in such a way that when the marks in the source sheet are deselected, the target visualization shows all the marks, shows the filtered marks, or excludes all the marks.\n5rxi | U R L actions: These allow you to link to generic U R Ls or dynamically add selected field values into U R Ls to link Tableau Public dashboards to external resources. As an example, we'll show you how to insert a country's name into a U R L to directly link to its page on the World Bank's website.\ncm65 | Highlight actions do not filter visualizations, they only draw attention. U R L actions link to external websites. Therefore, they don't have implications in dashboard performance. Filter actions have the following benefits:\nux5y | They are comparably faster than Quick Filters. Tableau Public does not need to scan the contents of a field before they can function.\nc8vn | They can filter across multiple data sources without setting up join conditions ahead of time, which will be explored later on in this chapter.\nalzc | They allow users to select and view only the granular data that's important to them.\n```",
