You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

4v5o | In summary:
ha9e | . You can't always prevent Incidents - but you can take responsibility for how you respond to them
xrnt | . Incidents and crises don't 'just happen'. They develop over time, and the earlier you are aware of potential problems, the more effective you will be as a security manager
c8ra | . Complexity is the enemy of clarity. Do not allow your systems to become overly complex - especially if that doesn't add to your operational capability
p1l0 | . Even the largest and most high profile operations fail for simple reasons - breakdowns in communications, breakdowns in command structures, lack of leadership
1i8b | . Security management is not a single event, but is a never-ending process - review your own operations on a continuous basis, and keep on improving them
5sfj | 7.11 Self-assessment exercises
vk4h | Exercise 1: Identify an incident that has been the direct result of organisational complexity (it can be one of the incidents mentioned in this module, or another one of your own choosing), and analyse how and why the incident happened, and what steps could have been taken to prevent it.
nsm3 | Exercise 2: Take an organisation that is known to you, and design an Annual Security Review that will allow you to assess the level of security within the organisation, identify potential weak spots, and allow you to make recommendations as to how the system can be improved over the next management cycle.
jdfw | Exercise 3: Identify three 'Normal Accidents' that could be indicators of systemic weakness within the security management programme, and show how the underlying causes can be dealt with in order to prevent those Normal accidents from occurring, and potentially escalating into full-blown crisis status.

l0ap | 8 Adding Value
x815 | As should already be clear from the previous sections of this module, for security management to be truly effective it should be embedded into the very heart of an organisation, intricately connected with every aspect of its' operations and general management culture. However, the truth is that in many, if not most, organisations security management lacks the status of other aspects of the organisations management processes, and in many ways is seen as being something that can be considered once a year at an annual review. There are a number of reasons why that happens, which will be touched upon in this section, but it is certainly the case that the way that security management represents itself often causes it to be seen as a 'poor cousin', one lacking the status and respect that it deserves. In many organisations, security managers are seen as being involved with operational matters, rather than strategic decision makers. As such, they are considered in the same group as facility managers, fleet hire managers and other members of the 'back room staff'. If security management is to be given the central role that we believe it should, then security managers in turn must make sure that they have the skills and capabilities that will allow them to fulfil that role in an effective and appropriate manner.
epbj | 8.1 Cost or Investment?
nmn2 | One of the fundamental reason that security is not given the place it merits at the directors boardroom is that, rather than being seen as 'adding value' to an organisation, it is considered to be a 'non-productive cost'. This, in turn, causes it to become a 'grudging spend', rather than a well-supported investment. Security management is undoubtedly spend-driven - there is a need for a high level of technology, whether CCTV, fencing, lighting, control rooms, vehicles, personnel, etc, which needs to be both maintained and upgraded on a regular basis. However, there is also a case that could be made that effective security management can rationalise the security management programme, and especially in a larger organisation where security functions are spread across different sites, and can find effective cost savings without compromising security. In many cases, there is a business case to be made that by upgrading and taking advantage of newer technology, real savings can be made across the organisations' security spend.
g3tm | 8.2 Business Manager
tfra | The power of the above argument demonstrates another basic truth about the modern security manager - he or she is a Business Manager of a significant division within the organisation, and therefore should be able to bring all of the skills to the business management aspect of their role as would the equivalent head of any other division. This should be reflected in the language used to describe the value of the security division to the organisation, the way that it is presented and the supporting material that is produced. The security manager should be able to identify strategic objectives for their department, recruit the right people, develop effective protocols and manage the budget, at all times being aware of how that fits in with the wider strategic objectives of the company as a whole.
5lm9 | 8.3 Competitive Advantage
wp2c | In many situations, security management is seen as a business inhibitor rather than an opportunity enabler. For many people within the organisation, the only contact they have with the security operation is when they arrive in the building in the morning, or have a problem with their pass card. However on a wider perspective, the security management programme should be a business enabler, allowing the organisation to gain a competitive advantage over its competitors. This may be because they can gain 'First Mover Advantage' by expanding into new markets where their competitors cannot - this is especially true in what might be seen as high risk areas that could be an inhibitor to business development by organisations with less well-developed security management capabilities.
us5v | A Risk Management Framework such as shown in Figure 19, allows an organisation to assess whether it is viable to develop operations in a high-threat environment: (note the use of terminology previously covered in this module: risk assessment, likelihood and impact, avoid or transfer risk, acceptance of risk, standard operating procedures, regular review, contingency plans).
rs2m | 8.4 Subject Matter Expertise
uz9y | The security manager's role has traditionally seen to have been relatively unskilled when compared to the level of professional capability expected from the heads of the finance division, business development division, marketing and branding division, etc. This is a hangover from the era when security managers were traditionally hired on the basis of their previous police experience, and the function that they fulfilled was often little more than in-house policeman. However, that has been changing over the last ten years, and there are now a wide range of professional and academic security management training programmes available. If the security manager is to achieve the same status as comparable managers in other divisions, it is necessary for them to show that they are able to bring the same level of expertise and professional development as their equivalents would. The security manager should expect to be the point of reference for all issues relating to security within their organisation, whether it is personal, as in foreign travel, operational, as in day to day management of security operations, or strategic, as in contributing to the organisation's continued growth and development.
8ov0 | 8.5 Proactive Risk Management
mj9m | Whilst a large part of a security manager's function will naturally be involved with managing the routine tasks associated with the security team, it is also necessary for them to become part of the 'Over the Horizon' thinking that is an essential part of any strategic management project. The nature of the present world means that the risks and threats facing any organisation are radically different than those that would have been faced in previous generations. Whether it is natural disasters, technological breakdowns, political upheavals, or the 'unknown unknowns' that could strike at any time, the role of the security manager is to bring these threats to the attention of strategic decision makers and to ensure that appropriate risk management procedures are in place.
