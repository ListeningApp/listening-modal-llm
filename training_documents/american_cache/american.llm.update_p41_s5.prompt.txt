You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

qlbb | the logo map, with its simultaneous integration into alphabetic and geo- graphic training, is vividly exemplified in the needlework samplers cre- ated by American schoolgirls. Throughout the eighteenth century, formal alphabet lessons had been accompanied by needlework samplers repro- ducing the letters of the alphabet and didactic quotations. By the 1790s, however, as American literacy lessons were increasingly taking a geo-
nhsg | graphic turn, the samplers' thematic range was expanded to include the reproduction of maps. While pupils continued to embroider the alpha- bet, they also took up pen, brush, and needles to draw, paint, and stitch the United States map outline and place-names on paper and on silk.
hy0l | Hannah Cockburn's sampler, for example, displays both her needle- work and her geographic knowledge as she faithfully imitates Morse's map-reading lesson by showing the border lines and names of the union and its states, including the "Twenty League Line" separating national from international waters (Figure 41). Mary Franklin's sampler, while de- picting both the North and South American continents, nonetheless ad- vertises the national form as the heavily traced border line of the nation- state distinguishes the political territory from its larger geographic con- text (Figure 42).41
4jmz | Both samplers demonstrate that, because the national map shaped the methodologies of formal literacy instruction, the nation's outline had be- come internalized and was now shaping practices of self-representation and political identification. The samplers' representation of the national territory-using blazes of color, thicker thread, or wider brush strokes- privileged the outline map as the recognizable sign through which young Americans were taught to express their national identity. The samplers' materiality even suggested that the text of the national map was begin- ning to be understood quite literally as the nation's material texture.
b7cq | Indeed, the logo functioned like a universal signifier when it was mass- produced and valorized as a sentimental object. As early as 1792, Ameri-
0b39 | cans imported milk jugs on which enterprising Englishmen had printed the map-as-logo, surrounding it with the likenesses of two founders, George Washington and Benjamin Franklin (Figure 43). Americans thus appear to have viewed the cartographic image of the nation as more than a desirable consumer object. Considering the widespread circulation of national maps, citizens endowed the logo image with the kind of political- aesthetic value of "Americanness," which significantly would retain
qecd | and generate its sacred aura despite the fact that the logo was mass- produced.42
1o7p | Central to this aura is that, emerging from within the postcolonial cul- ture, the map logo assumed the very communicative properties so eagerly sought after by the proponents of a new American language scheme. But while language reformers concentrated on the alphabetic construction of a newly nationalized English, it was through the everyday popular use of the national map that its territorial outline became an emblem rivaling the letters displayed in the ABC books. Instead of redefining the alphabet so that "A stands for America," mapmakers and pupils discovered in the map logo the ideal sign representing the nation unambiguously and in diverse textual contexts: the national outline literally became a legible sign, a ready-made icon that was easily transported into the process of mediation and national identification.
cp13 | Reduced to the shape of a logo, the map became the communicative agent through which a multitude of individuals were taught not only to imagine but to "read" themselves as parts of a national whole. Every time citizens recited "American" letters in spellers or drew or stitched the map image of the nation, they contemplated themselves as a local representa- tion contingent upon a national geography. If the outline map established the nation as a material artifact, then during the 1780s and 1790s it func- tioned as a sign that American citizens were trained to recognize as we today are trained to recognize the logo of McDonald's golden arches. The most compelling description of a realized and representative model of an American linguistic community derives from the fact that people as dif- ferent as John Jay and Hannah Cockburn simultaneously "read" the ver- nacular of the map logo. If nationalism invented the American people, it was common readers who inaugurated the nation by poring over geo- graphic texts that produced and reproduced their cultural community as a geographic reality, as a recognizable American sign.
