In the case of a monovalent receptor (complex stoichiometry one to one), the reaction of receptor saturation shown in equation one is sufficient, while polyvalency of the receptor imposes the existence of multiple stages. In order to represent the saturation of n-valent receptor n, equations have to be written as equation two, where i refers to subsequent numbers from one to n. The exact formulas for each stage are given in the Supporting Information.\ngc7v | [M thirteen minus (TnT) semicolon negative one] plus TnT less than or equal to [M thirteen minus (TnT) semicolon] Ri\nwqfv | (two)\nj30a | In an equilibrium state, formation and dissociation reactions occur at the same rate. Therefore, concentrations of particular reagents remain constant. The ratio of products and substrates concentrations (as approximations of activities) is constant under defined conditions (pH, ion strength, temperature) and is called a reaction constant. For the reaction depicted in equation one, the reaction constant may be written as equation three where Ka refers to the dissociation constant.\n7bdk | Ka equals [M thirteen minus (TnT) one] [M thirteen].[TnT]\nfim0 | (three)\nojro | In the case of polyvalent receptor saturation, for each stage an equilibrium state is established and defined in equation four.\nl6t9 | Ka i equals [M13 minus (TnT) semicolon negative one].[TnT]' [M13 minus (TnT) semicolon] equals (Ka)i (four)\n1ujy | According to the geometry of phage particle pIII end, if all peptides are properly synthesized and exposed, they should not affect each other. Currently, there is no evidence that any allosteric effect might be present between peptides. Therefore, each stage dissociation constant equals Ka of the isolated TnT-peptide complex defined in equation three. Moreover, the cumulative dissociation constant of particular stage saturation may be\nqzor | expressed as equation four where Ka refers to the dissociation constant of a single complex as equation three.\na0by | For every case, the equation for TnT mass conservation may be written for both one to one and one to n stoichiometry, as stated in equation five.\nu1ky | i\nhtm9 | y\n8hul | i.\n87vz | k\nym66 | [TnT] equals co minus Co TnT M thirteen.\nl0a3 | [TnT]\nu8nw | one plus Di equals one k\nl2v9 | (five)\nafbe | {\n78r8 | The free TnT equilibrium concentration ([TnT]) was expressed as a difference between total TnT concentration [TnT] and the sum of phage-bound TnT.\n320g | After the assumption of varying saturation levels and complex stoichiometry, each complex concentration may be expressed by total phage concentration (c thirteen) and TnT-dependent saturation fractions. This equation is explained in the Supporting Information. In the case of the monovalent receptor, also presented by Friguet, equation five may be written as equation six.\ntp8g | [TnT] equals cJnT minus co M thirteen d one plus [TnT] K, { k i [TnT] y\ngxfd | (six)\ns2v1 | ELISA is a widely applied technique in biochemistry that enables the determination of biomolecule concentration. ELISA may be used to determine M thirteen phage concentration using TnT-coated wells and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M thirteen antibodies. The signal is generated proportionally to the number of phages bound to surface-immobilized TnT. The presence of soluble TnT causes competition between this form and the surface-immobilized form, which leads to a signal decrease. If the signal measured with a predefined concentration of soluble TnT is called a and the signal of the same concentration of phages in the absence of TnT is a zero, the fraction of occupied active sites (saturation) may be found (equation seven).\njkp9 | (n minus i)\nz8tt | a zero n times one plus\n9g22 | [TnT] Ka\n41fx | (seven)\n7um8 | An explanation of the derivation of ratios is presented in the Supporting Information. Equation seven is derived in the Supporting Information. This approach (first proposed by Friguet) enables the comparison of a signal from total phage active sites and partially saturated phages. The ratio (equation seven) refers to the ratio of the signal recorded for partially occupied phage's active sites in a mixture of TnT and phage (a) and the signal recorded in the absence of soluble TnT (a zero) which may be interpreted as a signal from all active sites. Experimental determination of the ratio is necessary to calculate the [TnT] Ka ratio, which is crucial for further analysis.\nuow2 | Theoretically, a correlation between the concentration of phage-exposed active sites and a measured signal may be approximated in at least two ways.
