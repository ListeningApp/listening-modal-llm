You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

40ry | Tableau Public Interface Features
d1j2 | Since the functionality is limited online and that is where your users will interact with your work, we will condense the discussion of the Page shelf:
wstc | The workspace control tabs of Tableau Public
ba1e | The tabs at the bottom of the Tableau Public screen are either sheet or dashboard tabs. The tabs with a series of rows and a column on them are sheet tabs, where you can design objects that fit on one sheet. The tabs with a rectangle divided into four quadrants are dashboard tabs, where you can add one or more sheets in order to form a unified dashboard. When you click on one of the new (blank) worksheet or dashboard tabs, that tab opens and names the sheet or dashboard the next sequential name, such as Sheet 3 or Dashboard 2. The sheet or dashboard is blank when you first open a new tab.

l3do | www.it-ebooks.info
u9bo | Chapter 2
7avo | A dashboard is really just a group of worksheets on the same page. You can assemble a dashboard after creating the various component worksheets that it will contain. Dashboards are assembled and configured by using the Dashboard tabs in Tableau Public, which are available in the lower row of the tabs in the Tableau Public interface.
uzo6 | 1
89b4 | The lower-right hand side of the Tableau Public interface also contains three workspace control tabs, as shown in the following screenshot:
5f7e | Let's take a look at each of these tabs:
h83u | . Show Sheet Sorter: This shows the sheets in your workbook and allows you to reorder them easily
kjoa | . Show Filmstrip: This shows the visualization with the thumbnails of other worksheets, which is shown in the previous screenshot
wb1c | . Show Tabs: This shows the default view of the visualization and the named tabs of other worksheets, as shown in the previous screenshot
ak13 | The Show Me tool
s7el | A very useful tool in Tableau Public is the Show Me tool, which is available as a floating window when you click on the Show Me button on the upper-right hand side of the Tableau Public interface.

sfcf | [ The Show Me tool is an optional tool. Charts can be created without any help from this tool.
nuxs | The Show Me tool also contains a list of tips to add data to shelves and cards, such as the number of dimensions and measures necessary to create the desired chart type.
umx0 | The Show Me tool also suggests graph types based on the view that the user has created and/ or the fields that the user has selected from the Data window. Based on the selections and the chart type selected in Show Me, the tool also instructs the user what field types are needed to create a certain graph type.
o306 | For example, selecting a continuous date field will make the Show Me tool prompt the suggestion of a line graph. Selecting a geocoded or latitude/longitude field will make it prompt the selection of a geographic map.

axix | Summary
05y4 | In this chapter, we learned the Tableau Public user interface, from the welcome screen to the worksheet and dashboard tab views. We discussed the concepts of shelves and cards, walked through an example of how the Marks card affects a data visualization, and had a look at how to create a dashboard from the various worksheets created in a Tableau Public workbook. Lastly, we discussed the Show Me tool and how it can aid you in choosing appropriate data visualization types for your data.
2fb0 | In the next chapter, we will discuss the various chart types that you can create in Tableau Public and what some of the best practices and uses are for the chart types.

u5ws | Connecting to Data
onkh | Visualizations depend on the data in them, and however aesthetically pleasing your visualization might be, it may be misleading or even wrong, unless the data has been formatted, aggregated, and properly represented.
8t55 | This chapter discusses the major elements of finding, cleansing, understanding, formatting, and aggregating data that you will need to understand in order to produce accurate visualizations that tell compelling stories, including the following elements:
7imw | . Where you can get publicly available data and how to use it
lf1t | · What tables and databases are
tze7 | . The data formats that Tableau Public connects to
ryvv | · Databases, tables, dimensions, facts, and field formats and conventions
zdrh | · Preparing data to load it into Tableau
osmo | . Connecting to the data from Tableau Public
0b8v | · Using the data interpreter
fucs | · Pivoting fields
yply | Public data
75n5 | The data sets that are publicly available or the ones that you have compiled on your own, are ideal for Tableau Public. Since all users will be able to download this data and create their own visualizations once you have published your workbook, your data set should not contain information that may be considered sensitive, which can be anything that can be used to identify a private individual or reveal confidential corporate information or intellectual property.

4rhy | Connecting to Data
092d | Public data is readily available online. Tableau Public maintains a catalog of publicly available data. Much of this data is produced by various governments, economic groups, and sports fans, along with a link to, and a rating for each source. This catalog is updated monthly, and it is a great introduction to using publicly available data. You can find it at http://public.tableau.com/s/resources.
94ul | The Google Public Data Explorer has a large collection of public data, including economic forecasts and global public health data. This tool is unique because it allows users to make simple visualizations from all the original data sources without having to investigate the source data, though most of it is available by linking available resources.
0vdu | There are several tools available for the scraping of data from public sites too, such as ScraperWiki, import.io, and IFTTT, among others. These industries and such tools pertaining to the industry evolve rapidly. Therefore, we will not discuss any specific tool. Social media applications, such as Twitter, have made it possible for individuals and companies to build application programming interfaces (APIs) to connect to their data streams. This is useful for nonprogrammers because it's often free of cost if you wish to scrape data about specific topics, hashtags, or users with a minimal amount of coding.
a230 | Not all data is public data, and it's very important to determine whether a data set is public before using it. None of us wants to end up being sued, with a ruined reputation, or as a victim. If your source data set has identifying characteristics, first and last name, address, and financial, geolocation, medical, or federally or state protected data, it should be removed or de-identified and then saved separately before saving the visualization to Tableau Public (or not used at all). Each state has guidelines on what is considered protected information, and it's a good idea to check the restrictions in case there's even the slightest chance that your data set has sensitive information in it.
dvoe | Additionally, data from a corporation should never be used unless the corporation has given the permission to use it. (Did we mention lawsuits? Being fired also isn't any fun.)
677t | Tables and databases
5hk6 | Once you have found the data set that's ideal for your visualization, it's helpful to know how data stores are structured and what the different terms are.
viei | Data is stored in tables. A table is an array of items, and it can be as simple as a single word, letter, or number, or as complicated as millions (or more) of rows of transactions with timestamps, qualitative attributes (such as size or color), and numeric facts, such as the quantity of the purchased goods.

g5at | Chapter 3
re3j | Both a single text file of data and a worksheet in an excel workbook are tables, though this may not be apparent. When grouped together in a method that has been designed to enable a user to retrieve data from them, they constitute a database. Typically, when we think of databases, we think of the Database Management Systems (DBMS) and languages that we use to make sense of the data in tables, such as Oracle, Teradata, or Microsoft's SQL Server. Currently, the Hadoop and NoSQL platforms are very popular because they are comparatively low-cost and can store very large sets of data, but Tableau Public does not enable a connection to to these platforms. They are considered enterprise tools that should be used with Tableau Desktop Professional. Therefore, our discussion about these tools is limited.
6z45 | Tableau Public is designed in such a way that it allows users in a single data connection to join tables of data, which may or may not have been previously related to each other, as long as they are in the same format. In other words, multiple CSV files or worksheets can be joined in the same excel workbook. Then, users can specify the conditions under which they need to retrieve data from the tables and how to aggregate it (examples are given in following section). Thus, that data connection becomes a de-facto database.
20af | The most common format of publicly available data is in a text file or a Character-Separated Values (CSV) file. CSV files are useful because they are simple. The rows of data, which may or may not contain a header row, are separated by line breaks. The fields within each row can be separated by a character. Typically, this character is a comma, pipe, or tab. Commas present difficulties because the content of the fields can contain them, which causes the text to shift into a new column.
huae | Many public data sources do allow data to be downloaded as Excel documents. The World Bank has a comprehensive collection, and we will demonstrate the connective capabilities of Tableau Public using one of its data products. Tables can be joined in Tableau Public by manually identifying the common field among the tables.
rblh | The data sources that Tableau Public connects to
gl5i | Tableau Public connects to four different data sources, namely Access, Excel, text file (CSV or TXT), and OData; the first two data sources are bundled with Microsoft Office (in most cases), and the second two are freely available to everyone, regardless of the operating system that they are using. Text files are the default source of origin for most of the data that we will discuss, and anyone can create and distribute them.

htcn | Connecting to Data
86d4 | Tableau Public does not connect to enterprise tools such as Teradata, Oracle, or Hadoop, and it does not connect to SQL Server Management Studio, though it does connect to flat files' output from these tools and other Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) systems. SQL Server Management Studio is free for noncommercial use, and it's common to use it to design basic star schemas and clean noncommercial data. Tableau Public is free because it's assumed that people use it only for their personal endeavors and not projects that generate revenue for their employers. If this is not the case, they should upgrade to the Tableau Desktop Professional edition.
z7qp | The databases, tables, dimensions, facts, field formats and conventions
6t1g | Data that is retrieved from different sources will invariably have different structures. Some of these data resources need more formatting than others in order to turn them into clean, usable tables.
cpls | As previously mentioned, a table might be as simple as having a single digit in a text file. As long as users know what that digit represents, they can assign a qualitative or quantitative value to it. Imagine a situation where you are collecting rainfall measurements. Entering the amount of rainfall as subsequent rows of text into a new file constitutes a table.
m50n | The amount of rainfall is a measure; it is a quantitative fact. A dimension is a field that contains qualitative data. In this case, both the time of the day and the location of the measurement will be dimensions. Dimensions are typically formatted as date, string, or character fields, while measures are formatted as numbers. Text files do not have field formats, which are considered metadata, but Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Access do contain this information.
eztf | It's important to make sure that the formats for fields of the same type (the date or the primary/ foreign key) are consistent between worksheets in a workbook or tables in an Microsoft Access database, because Tableau Public automatically joins only the fields with the same format and the exact same name (including capitalization). If your field names are not the same but they should be joined using join conditions, you can join them manually.
bwsu | [40 ]
oqod | www.it-ebooks.info
tey0 | Chapter 3
ghiv | Another common dimension is a unique identifier, which assigns a non repetitive value to each object in a set. A phone number is a unique identifier as it is related to only one phone at a time. The same is the case with a social security number. Within a data set, a person's name will be considered a unique identifier if it is not repeated; if it were, then a different unique identifier would be used to identify individual people. Thus, it's common to use numerical fields as primary keys for individuals, and these numerical fields can be used across multiple tables and across different dimensions.
o5ts | Tables need to be structured so that the field names (dimensions and facts) go across and the rows of data (the dimension values and measure facts), go down the table. There are some databases that transpose data because their querying engines are optimized to search across columns rather than down the rows, but most DMBSes are not columnar, and Tableau is not built to search rows.
hd7d | The following table is a great example of a table that is structured properly. This is the 2012 NFL performance data that is freely available:
ehux | Each column is a field; the dimensions are Player and Team, and the measures are Receptions, Yards, and Average. The primary key is Player. There is only one row for each player. Team is the foreign key, as it may be the primary key in other tables, such as the aggregations by team.
poxj | [ 41 ]
2xvb | www.it-ebooks.info
m1hx | Connecting to Data
9psh | Conversely, knowing what not to do is as instructive as knowing what to do. The following table, which shows the population (in millions) by country, is a good example of what not to do:
aiqv | The problem with this table is that the years, which actually are qualitative descriptions of when each population measurement was made, are used as separate columns even though the year is a dimension and should run down the page. (Dates are dimensions too and not facts, because they describe something qualitative). If we loaded this table in Tableau Public, we would see a separate measure field for each year because Tableau Public recognizes each column as a distinct field. (In one of the following examples, we will use Tableau Public's new data interpreter to structure the data source properly).
4klz | The correct structure for this table will have three columns, namely [Country], [Year], and [Population], with a separate row for each combination of country and year.
xz5d | Connecting to the data in Tableau Public
erwx | Tableau Public has a graphical user interface (GUI) that was designed to enable users to load data sources without having to write code. Since the only place to save Tableau Public documents is in Tableau's Cloud, data sources are automatically extracted and packaged with the workbook. (The ability to save extracts as separate documents or open extracts and share them with different users is a feature of Tableau Desktop Professional).
