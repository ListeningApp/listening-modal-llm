It's also, most of the time, the wrong decision for the business.\n9ogk | Getting people to buy is NOT the objective of a business. Making money is. And lowering price is a one-way road to destruction for most - you can only go down to zero dollars, but you can go infinitely high in the other direction. So, unless you have a revolutionary way of decreasing your costs to one-tenth compared to your competition, don't compete on price.\nypjv | So the goal of our Grand Slam Offer will be to get more people to say yes at a higher price by increasing our value to price discrepancy. In other words, we will raise our price only after we have sufficiently increased our value. This way, they still get a great deal (think buying one hundred thousand dollars of value for ten thousand dollars). It's 'money at a discount.'\nkegn | FREE GIFT NUMBER THREE: BONUS TUTORIAL AND FREE DOWNLOADS: Charge What It's Worth\npu1o | Why You Should Charge So Much It Hurts\nt2ag | Most business owners are not competing on price or value. In fact, they're not actually competing on anything at all. Their pricing process typically goes something like this:\n1a77 | One. Look at marketplace\nkras | Two. See what everyone else offers\nktuk | Three. Take the average\np4za | Four. Go slightly below to remain \"competitive\"\nr437 | Five. Provide what their competitors offers with a \"little more\"\nmqfd | Six. End up at a value proposition of \"more for less\"\ng6we | And the big secret: those competitors they are copying are dead broke. So why on earth copy them?\nb6if | Pricing where the market is means you're pricing for market efficiency. Over time, in an efficient marketplace, more competitors enter offering \"a little more for a little less,\" until eventually no one can provide any more for any less. At this point, a market reaches perfect efficiency, and the business owners participating make just enough at the end of the month to keep going. The bottom ten to twenty percent of operators get washed out or lose the will to fight. Then fresh business owners enter with no idea and repeat the process of their forefathers. And around and around they go.\ngccv | In plain words, pricing this way means you are providing a service at just above what it costs for you to stay above water. We are not trying to stay barely above water. We are trying to make egregious amounts of money that will have your relatives asking if what you are doing is legal. Again, we are not trying to get the most customers. We are trying to make the most money.\nvi11 | That being said, since there is no strategic benefit to being the second-lowest priced player in your marketplace. Allow me to give you a brief overview of why I see premium pricing as not only a very smart business decision, but a moral one. Furthermore, it's the only choice that will allow you to truly provide the most value, a unique and strong position in the marketplace. Let me introduce you to the virtuous cycle of price.\n7apu | Virtuous Cycle of Price\nm9ca | VIRTUOUS VERSUS VICIOUS CYCLE OF PRICE\nweud | YOUR CLIENTS\nh3u6 | PRICE\nijlq | YOUR BUSINESS\natn2 | DECREASE DECREASE DECREASE DECREASE DECREASE\nubo6 | PROFIT PERCEIVED VALUE OF SELF PERCEPTION OF IMPACT RESULTS SERVICE LEVELS SALES TEAM CONVICTION\nzue6 | I have used this framework in most of the materials I release because it needs to be consistently reinforced. The forces of the marketplace will grate on your belief system. You must stay strong and ignore them! Here's the basic premise of why you need to charge a premium if you want to best serve your customers.\nw027 | When you decrease your price, you . . .\ncibw | . . . Decrease your clients' emotional investment since it didn't cost them much\n8lrx | . . Decrease your clients' perceived value of your service since it can't be that good if it's so cheap, or priced the same as everyone else\ne9ut | . . . Decrease your clients results because they do not value your service and are not invested\ntbja | . . . Attract the worst clients who are never satisfied until your service is free\n0m6e | .. Destroy any margin you have left to be able to actually provide an exceptional experience, hire the best people, invest in your people, pamper your clients, invest in growth, invest in more locations or more scale, and everything else that you had hoped in the goal of helping more people solve whatever problem it is that you solve.\ncbgu | In essence, your world sucks. And to make matters worse, your service probably sucks because you are squeezing blood\nuzqg | PRICE\nshuh | from the proverbial stone. There's just not enough money left over to make something exceptional. As a result, you fall in line with the armies of average businesses that race to the bottom. I've lived that life. It's terrible. If you love your customers and your employees, please stop short-changing them when there is a better way.\n5p1h | Here's the reverse. This is what happens when you raise your prices.\n7ay7 | When you raise your prices, you . . .\n2wa8 | . . Increase your clients' emotional investment\nazez | . . . Increase your clients' perceived value of your service\nkn5c | . . Increase your clients' results because they value your service and are invested\nmqu9 | . Attract the best clients who are the easiest to satisfy and actually cost less to fulfill, and who are the most likely to actually receive and perceive the most relative value . .\ni0lj | . Multiply your margin because you have money to invest in systems to create efficiency; smart people; improved customer experience; scale your business; and, most importantly of all, to keep watching the number in your personal bank account go up, month after month, even with reinvesting in your business. This allows you to ultimately enjoy the process for the long haul and help more people as you grow, rather than burning out and shriveling into obscurity. . .\nfdab | To swing the argument even further in favor of higher prices, here are a few interesting concepts. When you raise your price, you increase the value the consumer receives without changing anything else about your product. Wait, what? Yes.\n07he | Higher Price Means Higher Value (Literally)\nv1de | In a blind taste test, researchers asked consumers to rate three wines: a low-priced wine, a medium-priced wine and an expensive wine. Throughout the study, the participants rated the wines with the prices visible. They rated them, unsurprisingly, in order of their price, with the most expensive being the \"best,\" the second most expensive being \"second best,\" and the third, cheapest option, being rated as \"cheap wine.\"\n7mej | What the tasters didn't know is that the researchers gave them the exact same wine all three times. Yet, the tasters reported a wide discrepancy between the \"high priced\" wine and the \"cheap\" wine. This has deep implications for the direct relationship between value and price.\njw4n | In essence, raising your prices can directly enhance the value you provide. What's more, the higher the price, the more allure your product or service has. People want to buy expensive things. They just need a reason. And the goal isn't just to be slightly above the market price - the goal is to be so much higher that a consumer thinks to themselves, \"This is so much more expensive, there must be something entirely different going on here.\"\n9qfg | That is how you create a category of one. In this new perceived marketplace, you are a monopoly and can make monopoly profits. That is the point.",
