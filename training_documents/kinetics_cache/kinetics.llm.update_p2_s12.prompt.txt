You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

df3e | The first level represents the measurement process for the observed count Yeg conditional on the true expression level Neg of gene g in cell c, with a conditional probability distri- bution (Supplementary Figure S1b):
53eu | (2) Ycg| Neg ~ Pmeas (y |n ) .
a5u1 | The Pmeas(y|n) describes all aspects of the technical noise produced in the measurement process for a given true ex- pression level Neg, and is suggested as a Binomial distribu- tion or Poisson distribution which is supported by empirical analyses and theoretical arguments in many existing meth- ods (47,48). By adding an extra sampling probability Àcg in the sequencing process, we characterize the sequencing depth and assume that intercellular molecules are indepen- dent of each other and only the proportional products are captured and sequenced using Binomial distribution
ry7u | Ycg | Neg ~ Binomial (n, 1cg) . (3)
5mda | In our calculations, we set the sampling probability Àcg = 1 = 0.5 without loss of generality since the setting of Acg does not influence our qualitative results.
i4li | The second level is the true expression level of gene g across cells, which is assumed to follow a probability dis- tribution
r8sm | Neg ~ Pgene (n) . (4)
cuin | The underlying model describes the intrinsic dynamics of stochastic gene expression. How an appropriate gene- expression model Pgene(n) is chosen is critical. In general, this choice needs to satisfy two basic requirements: (i) the model should capture the essential gene-expression dynam- ics of interest (e.g. transcriptional burst kinetics); and (ii) the inference based on the model should be effective and scalable to large numbers of cells and genes. As combin- ing mechanistic models to infer the entire gene regulatory
n1i7 | network would lead to sophisticated models that become intractable, we simplified the gene regulatory network to a feedback loop, which is the most common form existing in gene expression systems. For these purposes, we adopt a model of stochastic gene expression (Supplementary Text 1.1, Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1c), which si- multaneously characterizes transcriptional burst kinetics and auto-regulatory feedbacks with the below distribution
0r5m | Pgene (n) = N N
ne2o | 0 ∞ Poisson (n |x) xa(1+€)-1e-x/b (1 + (x/k) }) - a/ dx, (5)
sqxn | where N is a normalization factor. Note that the discrete gene expression distribution (Equation (5)) is a Poisson rep- resentation in form, i.e. Pgene(n) = " Poisson(n\x) f(x)dx, where f(x) is a kernel density function that has the same form as the continuous distribution of proteins in (49). As il- lustrated in Figure 1B, this kernel function f(x) can extract several kinetic parameters, denoted by 0 = (a, b, c, k, h), of the steady-state gene-product distribution from a dy- namic model with auto-regulatory feedback described by some meaningful kinetic parameters: switching rates be- tween inactive and active state (kon, koff), mRNA transcrip- tion rates (Ksyn) and degradation rates (kdeg). Here, a is the number of bursts per cell cycle (burst frequency), and b is the mean number of gene products generated per burst (burst size), and h is a vital parameter of capturing the feed- back regulation dynamics of gene products, which is ac- tually a Hill coefficient. Furthermore, this model can de- scribe two most common feedback loops in gene expres- sion: positive-feedback loop (i.e. hlt; 0) and negative feed- back loop (i.e. h > 0). It should be noted that the auto- regulatory feedbacks involve gene products, which directly or indirectly regulate the corresponding target gene itself through feedback loops, resulting in a repressing or activat- ing expression. The small leakiness proportion of the pro- moter & contains the information on the baseline bursts in the absence of regulation, and k contains the information on the equilibrium binding constant (see details in Sup- plementary Text 1.1). Overall, Equation (5) is a mecha- nistic model, which can simultaneously describe the burst- production and feedback-regulation processes of gene ex- pression. More importantly, as a special case of this model, h = 0 corresponds to the negative binomial distribution of gene expression Pgene(n) (i.e. non-feedback).
6pmo | By combining Equations (3) and (5) and substituting into Equation (1), the discrete probability distribution of Yeg can be computed but is expressed in an integral form (see details in Supplementary Text 1.1):
195r | P(Y = y ;- )= 10 00 Pmeas (y |n ) Pgene (n)dn
kqmi | = 10 .00 Poisson (Y=y|\x)f(x)dx
g8rd | =N. .00
nns9 | (1x) -1x2a(1+€)-1e-x/b(1 +(x/k)})~/ dx. (6) y!
9uwy | For the case of non-feedback, we employ the negative bi- nomial distribution, which is then given by
srly | = y;)= [0(av) -ht (1.x).y bar (a) 1 xa-12-x/bdx. (7) where I' (.) is the Gamma function.
dl6i | Maximum likelihood estimation of parameters
89ub | Here we introduce a method of estimating the kinetic pa- rameters in our hierarchical model using the expression data of each gene. For a given expression read of observed cells, the most common parameter estimation method is the maximum likelihood estimation, which can be formulated as the following optimization problem of five parameters 0 = (a, b, c, k, h) in our case
dhle | arg min (-L(y;0)) = arg min θ -In(P(Y=y;0)), (8) y where P(Y = y;0) is described in Equation (6).
2nib | Because of the complex integral and unnormalized prob- ability mass function in Equation (6), calculating the inte- gral directly through the MCMC method (50) would be at a high cost of computation, and in particular, it is hard to use in the analysis of genome-wide data. Therefore, we ap- ply the Generalized Gauss-Laguerre Quadrature Rules (51) to Equation (6) instead of the use of the MCMC method, realizing a rapid calculation in inference:
naev | P(Y= y; 0)=N [(x) e-x,a(1+)-1-x/b (1+(x/k) dx 0
