You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

5rcb | The cubic coordination can also be realized by the cation Eo. Eo6O12 has the optimal solution correspond- ing to the zirconia structure shown in Fig. 5(e). The cation Eo can also make the coordination polyhedra of

xd3m | Op4Ht4O12 has the optimal solution corresponding to the crystal structure of YFeO3 which is composed of coordination polyhedra of capped trigonal prisms as shown in Fig. 6(a). YFeO3 and the optimal solution shown in Fig. 6(b) have the same symmetry, but the latter structure is composed of 5 LGCs, and capped trigonal prisms in the structure share the faces. The manner of atomic distribution in YFeO3 is the same as LaMg_ Ta1-201+3x N2-3x which can be employed for overall water splitting at wavelengths of up to 600 nm [40]. The correspondence implies the applicability of our method to mixed anion compounds. On the other hand, we could not find the optimal solution correspond- ing to the crystal structure of Sr2PdO4 in the optimal solutions of Op4HdO16. However, the optimal solution, which has 4 LGCs and the Pbam symmetry shown in Fig. 6(c), is similar to the crystal structure of Sr2PdO4; they have the same symmetry, and the difference only comes from the kind of linking between octahedra and capped trigonal prisms. In the optimal solution, octahe- dra and capped trigonal prisms share the faces, while in the crystal structure of Sr2PdO4, they share edges. In general, our algorithm tends to generate polyhedra shar- ing as many common bridging atoms as possible.
8qb6 | Finally, Pe2Sh1O4 has the optimal solution corre- sponding to the crystal structure of InGaZnO4. However, it may be difficult to form trigonal bipyramidal coordi- nation polyhedra using the cation Pe, which possesses a hard cationic radius of C5. Note that in the hexago- nal closest packing of oxygen ions, the center of trigonal bipyramid is identical with the interstice between three atoms in the hexagonal layer, and accordingly, the axial atoms of the bipyramid are 41% more distant than the equatorial atoms from the central atoms. Also, note that C5 is same as C6.
wkbn | In summary, we propose a novel method to enumer- ate crystal structure prototypes using the paired math-
ftfg | ematical programming, subject to a set of constraints on atomic distances, and demonstrate its applicability to find a broad range of crystal structures of oxides. The method consists of two optimization problems. The first is the minimization problem of the volume of the unit cell under the geometrical constraints that are the minimum and maximum distances between every pair of atoms, while the second is the maximization problem of the number of chemical bonds. The constraints of the two problems make every optimal solution satisfy a series of empirical rules systematized in inorganic structural chemistry [24, 25]. The two optimization problems are solved alternately to find a proper structure where every cation satisfies its bonding needs by transpositions of ge- ometrical constraints as sillium approach for amorphous silicons [28-31]. We find that the linear relaxations of inequality constraints are effective, and accordingly, the small computational cost enables the exhaustive search for the optimal solutions of large-scale systems. We apply the mathematical programming to cases with 18 compo- sitions, find the optimal solutions for each case success- fully, and identify the corresponding real crystal struc- tures. Our result strongly implies that the number of op- timal solutions in the mathematical programming seems to be much smaller than the number of local minima in the total energy by ab-initio simulations. A small number of optimal solutions, identified through the mathemati- cal programming, can be easily validated using ab-initio simulations to assess their stability. We anticipate that these optimal solutions may lead to the discovery of novel materials. The successful reproduction of a broad range of oxide crystal structures may suggest the emergence of a universal rule, potentially resulting from the precise refinement of the Pauling rules as demonstrated in this study. Given the proven success with oxide cases, it is anticipated that this method could be extended to other cases such as chalcogenides, mixed anionic compounds, intermetallic compounds, and borides, provided that ef- fective principles are established.
7xi5 | I. METHODS
w8r5 | Our mathematical programming formulation is based on inorganic structural chemistry that describes crystal sructures. As references for our basic idea, see the text- books [U. Müller, Inorganic Structural Chemistry, Sec- ond Edition (John Wiley & Sons, Ltd, 2007)] and/or [A. F. Wells, Structural Inorganic Chemistry, Fifth Edition (Oxford University Press, 1984)].
ybik | A. Geometrical constraints
gii5 | Figure S1(a) shows the optimal solution of Hd4Og cor- reponding to the rutile structure. Every oxygen makes three chemical bonds with Hd, while every Hd makes six chemical bonds with oxygens. Parallel linear strands of edge-sharing octahedra are joined by common octa- hedron vertices. Oxygen ions constitute the hexagonal closest-packings, and the structure is reproduced by the anionic constraints between every pair of oxygen ions. Figure S1(b) shows the optimal solution of Hd4Og cor- reponding to the a-PbO2 structure. The zigzag chains of edge-sharing octahedra are also joined by common vertices. If a pair of oxygen and Hd is not connected by a chemical bond, a non-bonding constraint connects them. Every Hd makes ten polyhedral constraints, and two of them correspond to edge-sharing. These two op- timal solutions, which correspond to the rutile structure and the a-PbO2 structure, respectively, have the same structural fingerprint, because the two structures have the same number of LGCs of the same type, where a fingerprint of a LGC enumerates the element symbols of the adjacent atoms linked by chemical bonds, polyhedral constraints, and anionic constraints in dictionary order, respectively. Figures S1(c) shows the optimal solution Ht4O6 correponding to the corundum structure. There are pairs of face-sharing octahedra, and every octahe- dron shares three edges within a layer and three vertices with octahedra from the adjacent layer to which it has no face-sharing connection.
