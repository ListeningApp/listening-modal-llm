        "content": "0qs3 | Sensitivity to the impact of business fragmentation has been in short supply. Nearly all multilateral agencies-the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, OECD, the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, and others-have published reports on the centrality of business-government dialogue and collaboration in industrial policy, usually with reference to past successes in Ireland, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. Yet these studies say little or nothing about the types of structural cleavages within the business community that might impede such collaboration. They do not mention, for one, that foreign firms were not included in earlier business-government forums, except when pressured to join state-initiated coalitions, as in Ireland and Singapore.\n\nz8f7 | Four. The absence of upgrading coalitions in education\n\n7w7j | Given the universal consensus on the need for more and better education, one might think that this would be the area where resistance to reform in middle-income politics would be easiest to overcome. And the historical precedents are clear: big push education politics were evident in countries that escaped middle-income in the late twentieth century. Yet broad, effective education coalitions have not been forming in today's middle-income countries. In the case of education upgrading, most large firms and many workers share a lack of concern over public school performance, though the sources of their interests diverge.\n\n51vd | To get at the institutional challenges to upgrading education, it is worth remembering that the politics of expanding low-quality primary education are relatively simple in the process of growing from low-income to middle-income. The costs of building schools and hiring teachers (with minimal training and salaries) are low, and the political benefits to local politicians are high. By contrast, rapidly improving quality of schools through twelve years of basic education requires costly upgrading of facilities, replacing ineffective teachers (often in opposition to powerful teachers unions), and training new teachers. Moreover, getting the right sorts of education, especially technical (often vocational) education, requires knowledge of the local economy, coordination with business, and ongoing curricular revision. Politicians reap few visible benefits and must manage costly distributional conflicts, especially with teachers, over pay and performance. In sum, the task of achieving profound and lasting\n\nbaj1 | educational reform takes decades, extending well beyond the terms of incumbent politicians.\n\nn1wo | These costs and challenges mean that a strong, broad-based, durable coalition is required to keep upgrading reforms going, but it comes at precisely the time when interests are quite divergent. Under high levels of inequality, the wealthy tend to favor public investment in tertiary, often nontechnical education, rather than in secondary and postsecondary technical training. Moreover, the wealthy and the professional middle class in most middle-income countries can send their children to private schools and have little interest in paying more in taxes for the education of poorer children.\n\n5bq3 | Inequality, along with informality, also discourages poorer workers from investing their own funds in education. The costs of education to them (relative to their minimal disposable income) are high, as are opportunity costs (relative to employment options in the informal economy). The returns on education for poor households are therefore often uncertain. Workers are also split over education between those in low-tech or informal jobs that require few skills and those in the labor elite in capital-intensive firms. And although those in the labor elite have more skills, many were acquired on the job and so these workers have little interest in pushing for higher taxes to provide more schooling for others. Some evidence for the lack of interest among workers and the poor in upgrading reforms in education comes from opinion surveys across Latin America. Summarizing the findings, the IDB study thought it \"rather disturbing\" that two-thirds of all respondents (seventy-two percent of poorer respondents) were satisfied with their local schools, despite evidence of the shortcomings of their overall educational systems.\n\nezla | Even without bottom-up pressure, unified business support for investment in human capital might be sufficient to push for major upgrading in education. If a large proportion of big businesses agreed\n\nrsbu | Middle-income trap\n\nmagd | that their long-term future depended on an increasingly more skilled workforce, that the cost of this education was too high for firms to bear (especially if they are in competitive international markets), and that therefore the cost had to be \"socialized\" and borne by the government, this coalition might be able to push state actors to provide the necessary upgrading policies and institutions. This is close to the story usually told about business support for education in Korea.\n\ntb74 | The fissures within big business in middle-income countries make such a unified voice improbable, however. First, the interests and capacities of domestic firms and multinational corporations are different. Many multinational corporations can move their investments to other countries, those with more human capital, rather than invest in upgrading education. Multinational corporations that are less mobile, either because they are investing in natural resources or are in countries with large domestic markets, usually have sufficient resources to pay internally for training their typically small workforces. In the rare cases of countries that made it into high-income with significant foreign direct investment (Hong Kong, Ireland, Singapore, and Spain), earlier investments in education (often motivated by other political considerations, to be discussed below) preceded rapid growth in foreign direct investment. Many multinational corporations were in fact drawn to these countries precisely because of their high levels of education.\n\n8l69 | Nor do most of the largest domestic firms have strong interests in educational upgrading. As noted earlier, most such firms are diversified business groups with large subsidiaries in commodities, natural resources, regulated utilities, and other services. In these sectors, firms need either small numbers of skilled workers in capital-intensive sectors that can be covered by in-house training, or large numbers of less-skilled workers. Service firms and others in nontradable sectors might have a generic interest in education, but they do not feel competitive pressures from international markets for more urgent action. In surveys of problems and needs, firms in Latin America usually do not list skills as a major concern. Across all upper middle-income countries, lack of skills was not among the three most severe problems facing firms. Although most business associations regularly list education as one of their policy priorities, their advocacy is in practice too feeble to support a business-led coalition that would impose the heavy costs required to upgrade education.\n\n1jyv | In sum, after getting most children into schools, the challenge for middle-income countries is to improve the quality of education and expand higher education and vocational training. The shift from quantity to quality takes time (beyond the horizons of most politicians), resources, and political resolve to confront entrenched interests in education bureaucracies and teachers unions. For all these reasons, cohesive, enduring coalitions matter, but just at a time when workers and big business are seriously fragmented.\n\nolce | Five. Further comparisons\n\nerx1 | Comparative analysis across several dimensions provides further insight into institution building and coalitions in escaping the middle-income trap. This section briefly considers comparisons one, within our nine large middle-income countries, with a focus on exceptional instances of sectoral upgrading; two, across our nine countries, highlighting differences between Malaysia and Thailand; and three, with more recent graduates to high-income in the twentieth century. The section closes with a brief consideration of some significant ways in which China differs from countries in the middle-income trap.",
