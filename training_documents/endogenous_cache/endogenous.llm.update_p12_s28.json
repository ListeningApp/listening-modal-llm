        "content": "bi1x | the soluble fraction. This analysis identified only four proteins which show significant\nbnve | increases in the insoluble fraction relative to the soluble fraction: Ckmt1, Tau, Taf15, and\n7gvc | Hspb1 and one protein which significantly increases in the soluble fraction and showed no\njf19 | change in the insoluble fraction, Plk2. Of note, Taf15 has previously been observed in detergent-insoluble fractions of brains from Alzheimer's patients, correlated with both Amyloid\n6hx6 | Beta and Tau insolubility. Ckmt1 has also been found in neurofibrillary tangles and interacting with phosphorylated Tau inclusions.\nxcql | \nxcxb | Neuroproteasomes are differentially regulated by ApoE isoforms to determine formation of endogenous sarkosyl-insoluble Tau inclusions.\nci51 | \njaj7 | Our findings raise the intriguing possibility that a fraction of endogenous mouse Tau becomes\nuc0w | sarkosyl-insoluble following neuroproteasome inhibition. We sought to validate these findings\n494y | by immunoblot and extend them to determine if the same principle would hold for human Tau isoforms, without pathogenic and aggregation-driving mutations. We therefore cultured primary\n5whs | mouse cortical neurons from either wild-type or hTau-KI mice. The entire mouse Mapt sequence\nkigc | is replaced with the human Mapt sequence, including upstream gene regulatory elements at the\nk5st | endogenous locus in hTau-KI mice. hTau-KI mice express all six human isoforms of Tau protein\nd8e8 | using the endogenous Mapt regulatory elements and therefore, hTau is expressed at normal physiological levels. Day twelve to fourteen neurons were treated with either the neuroproteasome\ngb7b | inhibitor iBEp or the cell-permeable proteasome inhibitor Epoxomicin. We then performed\njxu0 | sarkosyl fractionations to separate treated neurons into soluble and insoluble fractions and\nl1bb | immunoblotted these fractions for total Tau and GAPDH. The R two two nine five antibody reacts against both total human and total mouse Tau and is highly specific, making it the ideal tool to monitor\ni3e0 | endogenous Tau in wild-type and hTau-KI samples. We observed no Tau signal in primary\n78dj | neurons cultured from Tau knockout mice, demonstrating the specificity of our\nc1pj | antibodies and approach. We found a significant increase in sarkosyl-insoluble\n6v9y | Tau from both the wild-type and hTau-KI neurons treated with iBEp.\ndeen | Intriguingly, we find no change in sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in neurons treated with the cell-\n27bo | permeable Epoxomicin compared to DMSO controls, despite the fact that Epoxomicin inhibits\n72k6 | cytosolic proteasomes and neuroproteasomes. We reason that Epoxomicin inhibits\nemhp | neuroproteasomes and likely induces the formation of Tau inclusions, similar to iBEp, but these\ntcgw | Tau inclusions cannot be detected because simultaneous inhibition of cytosolic proteasomes\n4d8s | induces autophagy and other compensatory mechanisms which can clear these inclusions. This\n1cmq | \nu8s6 | claim is supported by an extensive body of work on Tau clearance mechanisms. We\n86m5 | posit that such compensatory mechanisms are not triggered when neuroproteasomes are\nlzzv | specifically inhibited, which is consistent with our observations that Epoxomicin induces p62 expression whereas iBEp does not.\n623p | \n50lp | Many of our experiments rely on the use of iBEp because the biotin tracer on an irreversible and\ni4nn | specific inhibitor allows us to track which proteasomes are inhibited. However, we wanted to\nnuk3 | validate our findings using a proteasome inhibitor with a distinct mechanism of action from\ny2cn | Epoxomicin. We therefore modified M G one thirty-two, a reversible peptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitor, with a sulfonated biotin linker on the nonreactive N-terminus. This negatively charged water-soluble linker renders Sulfo-M G one thirty-two cell-impermeable, much like the historical\nhgm4 | \nnc42 | use of sulfonated linkers to perform surface biotinylation. We observe efficient conjugation by HPLC analysis. All molecules were HPLC-purified as single peaks and confirmed by L C MS analysis. We find significant inhibition of proteasomes using SulfoMG despite the moderate loss of efficacy compared to M G one thirty-two as a consequence of\ntbfm | the linker. M G one thirty-two is a reversible inhibitor and therefore, we cannot detect the\nok18 | covalent modification of the proteasome subunits. Instead, we turned to cellular and functional\npgqe | readouts of permeability. We found a similar induction of autophagy markers in neurons treated with M G one thirty-two as with epoxomicin and a similar lack of induction with SulfoMG as with iBEp. Confident in its use as a chemically orthogonal cell-impermeable proteasome inhibitor, we next incubated day thirteen primary hTau-KI neurons with SulfoMG. We find that SulfoMG induces similar partitioning of hTau into the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction as iBEp.\nqo9m | \ne7zz | Moreover, we find that M G one thirty-two, like Epoxomicin, does not affect the sarkosyl-insoluble accumulation of Tau.\nlhzk | \nwdpw | Next, we examined whether neuroproteasome inhibition would induce sarkosyl-insoluble\ntwiq | endogenous Tau inclusions in vivo. Here, we only used iBEp and not SulfoMG for three reasons: first, because SulfoMG is reversible and is therefore subject to being washed out by CSF flow in\ncchx | vivo; second, because we could biochemically monitor iBEp permeability using the presence of\n2vma | the biotin signal; and third, because Epoxomicin is a more specific proteasome inhibitor than\nz4aw | M G one thirty-two. We tested iBEp permeability in vivo by stereotactically injecting iBEp into the CA one region of the mouse hippocampus for seventy-two hours. Hippocampi were microdissected and separated into cytosolic and membrane-enriched fractions and samples were immunoblotted. We fail to observe penetration into the cytosol until we inject sixty-four micromolar, so we chose to inject at ten-fold \nmo0p | under this dose as our maximal concentration. This in vivo dose is consistent with and\ntyxr | far lower than previous studies using Epoxomicin alone: nine point zero and thirteen point five millimolar. We\ntxaa | performed stereotactic injections of six point four micromolar iBEp and contralateral injections of the vehicle\nqz8s | zero point zero seven percent DMSO into the hippocampus of hTau-KI and Tau-KO mice. After seventy-two hours, we\ny7de | collected the hippocampi and performed sarkosyl extractions into soluble and insoluble fractions.\nrukn | We fail to observe any detectable Tau in the Tau-KO mice in DMSO- or iBEp-injected\n5tu7 | hippocampi. Mirroring our data in primary neurons, we find a strong increase of\nvqgg | sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in hippocampi from hTau-KI mice injected with iBEp.\nsbs5 | \nn413 | In our experiments, we find that inhibiting neuroproteasomes to saturation induces the\nmvxd | accumulation of sarkosyl-insoluble Tau.
