The firm was California-domiciled, and there were no drag-along rights. The founder reported that the VC-controlled board paid the CEO and other employees to exercise underwater options to acquire and vote common stock in favor of a trade sale for about eighty million dollars. In addition to this stick, the VCs used a carrot: they provided a four million dollar carve-out to common shareholders. The founder sued the VCs, alleging vote buying and improprieties associated with a presale financing round. The case was settled for an undisclosed amount.\nn0ly | Of course, implicit and essentially undetectable vote buying might be occurring through management bonuses because of the considerable overlap between shareholders and executives. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that vote buying was occurring in other firms in our sample.\nnzx3 | CARROTS AND STICKS\nift6 | CONCLUSION\n2s5a | Trade sales by VCs are actually much more common than initial public offerings and, in the aggregate, are likely to be just as financially important to VCs. However, unlike initial public offerings, trade sales do not trigger the intense public-disclosure requirements of the securities laws. As a result, we know relatively little about them.\nxg9o | In this Article, we seek to shed light on how VCs arrange to sell startups in trade sales. In particular, we investigate how VCs induce the founder, other executives, and common shareholders to go along with a trade sale that they might otherwise have an incentive to resist.\nxpyj | We identify the types of bribes (carrots) and coercive tools (sticks) that VCs might use to induce a reluctant entrepreneurial team to support, or at least not impede, a trade sale. We then investigate the use of carrots and sticks using a hand-collected database of fifty VC-backed Silicon Valley firms sold to acquirers in two thousand three and two thousand four. We find, in our sample, a relatively heavy reliance on carrots. Carrots are used in forty-five percent of the firms, with carrots averaging nine percent of deal value in these firms. We also find some use of sticks, such as threats to blacklist founders who refuse to cooperate and attempts to undermine common shareholders' voting rights. But the overt use of these sticks is relatively infrequent.\nv7gp | Our study makes three contributions. First, it sheds light on an important but underexplored aspect of corporate governance in private, VC-backed firms. In particular, it highlights the potentially conflicting interests of the different players in VC-backed firms around trade-sale exits and shows that VCs frequently must overcome potential opposition to these sales by founders, executives, and common shareholders.\nbn2x | Second, our study provides further evidence that managers of target firms can extract value by holding up a sale of the firm. Research has documented the frequent use of side payments to induce executives to participate in the sale of publicly traded firms. We show that such carrots are used not only in public firms with dispersed ownership but also in closely held private firms.\noi5b | Third, our study provides some evidence on whether venture capitalists are constrained from abusing their power in startups. Although venture capitalists have considerable power in startups, the relatively infrequent overt use of sticks in our sample provides support for the view that reputational or other nonlegal considerations constrain misbehavior by Silicon Valley venture capitalists. We hope that our work is useful to practitioners and academics seeking to better understand the corporate governance of VC-backed firms.\nwjst | This table provides descriptive statistics for our fifty sample firms. Panel A reports industry classification for each firm as provided by the respective data source. Panel B reports the mean and median period of operation, number of financing rounds, amount invested, and sale price. Panel B also shows the aggregate liquidation preferences of VC investors at the time of sale. Panel C shows the preferences given in each round of financing. The first column lists, for each round, the number of firms granting one times liquidation preferences. The second column lists, for each round, the number of firms granting liquidation preferences between one times and two times. The third column lists, for each round, the number of firms granting liquidation preferences greater than two times. The final column lists financing rounds where the liquidation preferences of earlier investors are waived or reduced (a \"recap\" financing). Panel D shows, at the time of sale, the relationship between aggregate liquidation preferences and the sale price.\nojin | This table reports the distribution of corporate governance rights in our sample firms. Panel A reports the mean and median board representation for (one) common shareholders, (two) VCs, and (three) independent (outside) directors. Panel B shows board control at the time of sale. If the VCs (or common shareholders) control a majority of the board seats, we classify the VCs (or common shareholders) as having \"Control.\" If the board has an even number of seats and the VCs (or common shareholders) appoint exactly half the directors, we treat this as \"Blocking.\" \"Shared Control\" means that the VCs and the common shareholders each appoint fewer than fifty percent of the directors, with outside directors providing the tie-breaking vote. Panel C shows the state of incorporation at the time of sale.\nkv7q | This table describes the frequency and magnitude of common carve-outs and management bonuses in our sample firms. Panel A provides summary statistics for all sample firms. Panel B reports summary statistics only for those firms that provided a common carve-out and/or a management bonus. Data are presented in millions of dollars and as a percentage of the sale price. The included summary statistics are mean, dollar-weighted mean (D W Mean), standard deviation (S D), minimum, and maximum. D W Mean is weighted by the firm's sale price.\n8ruo | Table Four reports the identity of the CEO in our sample firms (founder or replacement), as of the end of each year of the firm's operation. Panel B illustrates the frequency of CEO replacement over time. The horizontal axis represents the lifespan of each firm from formation to sale, normalized to one unit, and the vertical axis represents the percentage of sample firms that have replaced the CEO.\n```",
