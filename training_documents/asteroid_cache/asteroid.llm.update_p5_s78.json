U-Pb chronology of phosphates in the unbrecciated achondrites\nma93 | In Agoult, euhedral to rounded grains of F-rich apatite with sizes of ten to one hundred micrometers were observed homogeneously throughout the studied section. Their U-Pb age can be determined more precisely compared to those of the other brecciated eucrites. The seven grains with ten spot analyses yielded a <LATEX>2 3 8 U - 2 0 6 P b</LATEX> isochron\nc6hh | age of four three five zero plus or minus two nine zero mega annum (M S W D equals one point two) and a <LATEX>2 0 7 P b - 2 0 6 P b</LATEX> isochron age of four five three zero plus or minus seventeen mega annum (M S W D equals two point zero). The model <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> ages are between approximately four thousand five hundred sixty mega annum and four thousand five hundred four mega annum, with a weighted mean of four five two four point eight plus or minus nine point seven mega annum.\ny7ea | Ibitira is characterized by numerous spherical vesicles with sizes of one hundred to five hundred micrometers in its unbrecciated recrystallized area. On the wall of the vesicle, an approximately one hundred fifty micrometer round-shaped grain of merrillite was identified. Smaller grains (approximately twenty micrometers) of merrillite were also found in its igneous textures. The five merrillite grains with seven spot analyses did not define a <LATEX>2 3 8 U - 2 0 6 P b</LATEX> isochron or <LATEX>2 0 7 P b - 2 0 6 P b</LATEX> isochron age with meaningful precision, primarily because of the overlapping of the data. The model <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> age was calculated at four thousand five hundred sixty-three to four thousand five hundred fifteen mega annum, with a weighted mean of 4552 plus or minus 8.8 mega annum.\nnav4 | Five. Discussion\ngem8 | Five point one. Two ages in Juvinas: older apatite and younger merrillite\ne8nr | Only Juvinas presents two distinctly different ages for apatite and merrillite. The model <LATEX>2 0 7 P b ^ { * } / 2 0 6 P b ^ { * }</LATEX> ages are four thousand five hundred sixteen point nine plus or minus ten point four mega annum for the apatite and four thousand one hundred fifty point three plus or minus eleven point six mega annum for the merrillite. Most apatite (except for Juv-1) and all merrillite grains are located in a close area, even though they recorded completely different timings. One possible explanation is that the U-Pb system in merrillite can more readily be reset than that in apatite so that only merrillite records the four thousand one hundred fifty mega annum event. Although we know the U-Pb closure temperature of apatite (discussed later), unfortunately, there is no available information for merrillite at this moment. Previous SIMS U-Pb studies have not found such age differences between meteoritic apatite and merrillite. It is likely that the U-Pb systems in apatite and merrillite record the same events in regular cases. Another, more plausible case is that the reheating temperature in the four thousand one hundred fifty mega annum event was heterogeneous and that it locally reached higher temperatures. The relationship between the apatite and merrillite and the adjacent silica polymorphs supports this interpretation. Tridymite is a high-temperature silica phase (stable at eight hundred seventy to one thousand four hundred seventy degrees Celsius under one atmosphere; Fenner, nineteen thirteen). The tridymite in Juvinas has a smooth surface and euhedral to subhedral shapes, suggesting that it recrystallized from primary mesostasis (or its partial melt) during a high temperature reheating (greater than eight hundred seventy degrees Celsius) and subsequent rapid cooling process. We assume this event to be identical to the merrillite <LATEX>2 0 7 P b ^ { * } / 2 0 6 P b ^ { * }</LATEX> age, because all of the merrillite grains are located close to the tridymite. It is likely that they suffered local heterogeneous thermal metamorphism at four thousand one hundred fifty mega annum. Similar metamorphic origins of tridymite have been suggested for several basaltic eucrites. Conversely, the porous and anhedral quartz may be a relic of igneous mesostasis, consistent with observations of other basaltic eucrites. Considering that the apatite is located close to the mesostasis quartz, as well as in the lithic clast, the apatite should be an igneous relic mineral.\nk78w | Five point two. Brecciated eucrites are consistent with a continual collisional history\ng9du | What do the two ages found in Juvinas mean? Both the apatite (approximately four thousand five hundred twenty mega annum) and the merrillite (approximately four thousand one hundred fifty mega annum) in Juvinas are significantly younger than the crystallization age of Juvinas whole rock dated by the <LATEX>Mn-Cr</LATEX> system at four thousand five hundred sixty-two point five plus or minus one mega annum (Lugmair and Shukolyukov, nineteen ninety-eight). The U-Pb age of the Juvinas zircon recorded a thermal event at four thousand five hundred forty-five plus or minus fifteen mega annum, consistent with the ubiquitous crustal metamorphism of Vesta at four thousand five hundred fifty-four point five plus or minus two mega annum. The four thousand five hundred twenty mega annum Juvinas apatite is expected to have recorded either a slow cooling process subsequent",
