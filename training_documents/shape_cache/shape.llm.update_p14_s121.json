        "content": "0x0s | Our finding's implications are vital because clothing academics and ergonomics researchers are using the FFIT as the theoretical basis of their body shape analysis. Nevertheless, this paper proves that the FFIT's measurement definition and classification methodologies are limited as the FFIT uses Hip and Waist definitions that deviate from measurements defined in standards and in product development. The FFIT provides a foundational approach to body shape classification by key circumferences. Nevertheless, FFIT is prone to variability in application, where two practitioners can classify the same body into different shapes. We support this through replacing the FFIT's Hip definition with an anatomically correct Hip definition - as the SizeUK Measurement Extraction Protocol uses, producing different body shape classifications while still within the FFIT's loose\n4exe | measurement definitions. Practitioners' use of FFIT is not necessarily flawed if the same measurement definitions are used within comparisons. Instead, problems arise when a practitioner unknowingly uses different measurements in their work to that of the research they are comparing their results against. Nevertheless, few publications utilizing FFIT provide sufficient specificity to allow practitioners to avoid such potential error. Ergonomists, academics, and garment construction practitioners must give further critical consideration to the reliability and suitability of all comparative research reliant upon body shape - especially the FFIT - within their work.\n0myz | This paper shows that a person's shoulder-to-shoulder (horizontal) measurement cannot be inferred from the FFIT body shape alone. As shoulders are one of the critical measurement zones for some upper-body clothing, FFIT cannot describe a body's form that is entirely suitable to garment selection, as with fashion retail's virtual fit/garment size prediction tools. There is, therefore, a need to develop more complex body shape identification systems that include shoulder measurement and addresses the needs for standardization to avoid classification changes because of small discrepancies in measurement location.\nxh3i | Conclusion\nsyiw | We set out to assess the stability of FFIT's body classification system for ergonomists, garment construction practitioners, and scientific researchers. In these fields, practitioners often classify measurements by name, meaning definitions can be challenging to ascertain. In pursuing this aim, we prove that slight differences in measurement placement definition lead to different shape classifications of the same body. Because two practitioners can use two different sets of measurements sharing the same name, but with slight differences in definitions within the FFIT's tool, the FFIT body shape classification can lead to inconsistent conclusions. FFIT can reduce, or remove, this inconsistency by publishing their measurement placement definitions in a non-equivocal and replicable format.\nkg3t | Relating body shape to garment construction, horizontal shoulder measurements - one of the critical measurement zones for some upper-body clothing - only exhibits a medium association with body shape classifications.\nlvae | A higher level of association with the torso measurements used to establish body shape by FFIT would have provided an opportunity to use the FFIT system to predict the torso's broader morphology, including the shoulder region. This indicates a need for any reliable and authoritative body classification system to include a wider variety of shoulder anthropometry.\no9sc | The FFIT applied without consistent use of the same definitions is limited. Further research is needed to achieve a reliable and appropriate body classification system for scientific research or garment construction. The results provide a detailed examination of the variable approaches to defining body measurement and how these affect results. It highlights the need for researchers from all fields to work together to agree on more standardized approaches to anthropometric and ergonomic practices.\n121u | Our finding's mean clothing ergonomics academics and garment construction practitioners must question the authority of their practice that depends upon systems that have loose measurement definitions - like FFIT. They must seek to ensure measurement definitions are consistent, even when names are the same. We must, therefore, rethink and build on the last decade of progress in nationality-based body shape comparisons, body shape-based health estimations, and consumer self-perception that have drawn from the FFIT. Systems like FFIT would benefit from defining measurements by averaging over regions, reducing the influence of localized changes. Such systems could lead to more stable body shape classification systems. Researchers may have exposed between-study differences in body shape classification, but the researchers' interpretation of the FFIT's measurement placement may drive the differences, instead of genuine population body shape differences.\nzh03 | Ergonomics academics and garment construction practitioners need a more reliable and repeatable body classification system than currently exists. Including shoulder anthropometrics into a new body classification system should, if produced through rigorous empirical methods, create a system with direct application in clothing's development and construction processes. Then, maybe even online fashion retail's virtual try-on systems can meaningfully utilize body shape and three D Body Scanning.\n1mvw | Limitations and further research\n6d4s | This paper raises important questions about how ergonomists, garment construction practitioners, and researchers categorizes body forms and how the field must consider body shape in the future.\nmqah | While we prove that slight differences in measurement placement definition lead to different shape classifications of the same body, our investigation is limited to the FFIT and its relevant measurements. Exploring a more comprehensive range of body categorization systems with a broader range of alternative measurement definitions will determine the generalizability of our findings outside of the FFIT.\nxxr8 | Our research does not develop a new - more appropriate - body shape classification system. We, instead, set out clear arguments for any development in body shape classification to include unequivocal measurement definitions, apply to garment's construction practices, and include the body's additional regions aligning to contemporary ISO standards. Our work with FFIT has inspired the need for empirical investigation to define those shapes' measurements, algorithm, and classification needs. To propose a system without such rigor would be inappropriate.\nrl4j | Future classification systems must provide a higher degree of specificity with a lower degree of alternative interpretation for measurement location and collection compared to the FFIT. Such work must use sophisticated computational analysis that may have been unavailable to Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan - who used elementary logic. Our results have begun this process by showing such a new body shape classification system should include shoulder circumferences. Nevertheless, more complex additional measurements than the FFIT, and this paper, considers - such as pitch, slope length, and front-to-back depth - may lead to more appropriate body classifications for ergonomists, garment construction practitioners, and researchers to work with a higher level of precision. Other body anthropology, such as the breast, should be included as body classification has, historically, focused on the female form.\nvz32 | Disclosure statement\nncb0 | No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author or authors.",
