On this both Trump appointees and career officials could agree.\nb7cq | A forty-year-old lawyer with little government experience, he joined the administration in twenty nineteen and rose rapidly. Each new title set off new alarms.\n0b39 | When Patel was installed as chief of staff to the acting secretary of defense just after the twenty twenty election, Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, advised him not to break the law in order to keep President Donald Trump in power. \"Life looks really shitty from behind bars,\" Milley reportedly told Patel.\nqecd | When Trump entertained naming Patel deputy director of the FBI, Attorney General Bill Barr confronted the White House chief of staff and said, \"Over my dead body.\"\n1o7p | When, in the final weeks of the administration, Trump planned to name Patel deputy director of the CIA, Gina Haspel, the agency's head, threatened to resign. Trump\ncp13 | Who was this man, and why did so many top officials fear him?\nbgre | It wasn't a question of ideology. He wasn't a zealot like Stephen Miller, trying to make the bureaucracy yield to his agenda. Rather, Patel appeared singularly focused on pleasing Trump. Even in an administration full of loyalists, Patel was exceptional in his devotion.\n57lp | This was what seemed to disturb many of his colleagues the most: Patel was dangerous, several of them told me, not because of a certain plan he would be poised to carry out if given control of the CIA or FBI, but because he appeared to have no plan at all-his priorities today always subject to a mercurial president's wishes tomorrow.\nukth | What wouldn't a person like that do, if asked?\nkpvt | Most Americans had no idea Patel existed, yet rarely a day passed when administration leaders weren't reminded that he did. In a year and eight months, they had watched Patel leapfrog from the National Security Council, where he became senior counterterrorism director; to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, where he was principal deputy to the acting director; to the Department of Defense, where his influence rivaled that of the acting secretary himself.\njie2 | But in the officials' warnings about the various catastrophic ways the rise of an inexperienced lackey to the highest levels of government might end, all Patel seemed to detect was the panic of a \"deep state\" about to be exposed. Such officials understood, as Patel later wrote, that he \"wouldn't sit quietly and accept their actions to stonewall direct orders from the president.\"\nd0ik | Patel was ultimately denied a role at the pinnacle of the national-security establishment, but Trump has promised to learn from his mistakes. Should he return to the White House, there will be no Milleys, Haspels, or even Barrs to restrain him as he seeks revenge against his political enemies. Instead, there will be Patels-those whose true faith and allegiance belong not to a nation, but to one man.\n0x0s | Kash Patel Will Do Anything for Trump - The Atlantic \"Get ready, Kash,\" Trump said before a gala of young Republicans this past December. \"Get ready.\"\n4exe | A CURSORY APPRAISAL of Patel's activities since the Trump administration might suggest that his days as a senior official in the United States government are behind him-that Patel, like countless others on the right, has learned the art of commodifying his association with the former president.\n0myz | There is, for example, merch: \"the official K dollar sign h wine!\" (two hundred thirty-three dollars and ninety-nine cents for six bottles) and the Fight With Kash Punisher Intarsia Reversible Scarf (twenty-five dollars), which Patel wore for his remarks at this year's Conservative Political Action Conference. There are TAKE A LAP RHINO tank tops (thirty-five dollars), JUSTICE FOR ALL number sixteen PC tees (also thirty-five dollars), and Kash Krew Golf Polos (fifty to fifty-three dollars).\nxh3i | There are the books. Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth, and the Battle for Our Democracy is Patel's account of his years fighting the \"corrupt cabal\" of federal officials trying to take down Trump. And in The Plot Against the King, a children's book, Patel tells the story of a wizard named Kash who sets out to save King Donald from the sinister machinations of Hillary Queenton and a \"shifty knight.\" Head over to fightwithkash.com, and for a \"special low offer\" of nineteen dollars and ninety-nine cents, one can purchase playing cards (\"the collector's item of the century\") featuring the story's characters; the king card belongs to \"Kash, the distinguished wizard and corruption combatant.\"\nsyiw | There is at least one song: Patel produced \"Justice for All,\" a version of the national anthem sung by jailed January sixth defendants and played by Trump at his first twenty twenty-four campaign rally. Patel professes to make no money from the song or the merch-he says proceeds go to January sixth defendants and their families, or to the Kash Foundation. Few details are available about the charity, but according to Patel, it has funded meals for needy families and defamation lawsuits on behalf of Ric Grenell, Patel's friend and former boss at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence,\nkg3t | Kash Patel Will Do Anything for Trump - The Atlantic and Daniel Bostic, a \"Stop the Steal\" activist.\nlvae | All the while, Patel churns out promotional content on Truth Social-for a conservative cellphone carrier (\"Freedom in cell phones, switch today\") and a Christian payment processor (\"Why not just give your money to the enemy, or switch now\")-and hawks pills that he says \"reverse\" the effects of COVID vaccines (\"m RNA detox, reverse the vaxx and get healthy\").\no9sc | He has also worked as a national security adviser to Trump (bringing in more than three hundred thousand dollars over the past two years from the former president's Save America PAC, according to campaign-finance records) and as a consultant for Trump Media & Technology Group, the owner of Truth Social (one hundred thirty thousand dollars last year, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing). In addition, Patel has spoken of work abroad, though public paper trails are hard to come by-he has claimed, for example, that he worked as a security consultant for Qatar during the two thousand twenty-two FIFA World Cup, in Doha.\n121u | Nevertheless, Patel has at times vented that he deserves more, according to two people I spoke with. \"He complains about money all the time-like, he doesn't have any money, can't make any money, nobody will hire him,\" a longtime Trump adviser told me. \"Anybody who was as big of a deal as he was in the past administration would come out and they'd be on the board of Raytheon and Boeing.\" \nzh03 | From the time Patel left the administration, he appeared committed to finding opportunities to reinforce his loyalty to Trump. In spring two thousand twenty-two, after the FBI opened a criminal investigation into Trump's handling of federal records at Mar-a-Lago, Patel insinuated himself into the story, telling Breitbart News that he witnessed Trump verbally declassify \"whole sets of materials\" before leaving the presidency. The claim ensured a starring role for Patel throughout the probe-ending with Patel testifying before a federal grand jury in exchange for a grant of limited immunity. More\n```",
