You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

4uik | With a view to eliminate the necessity of forming and invert- ing the Hessian, Kim et al. (2010) extend TMP to utilise a quasi-Newton update with asymptotic convergence guaran- tees in the convex setting. Also in this vein, Xie & Wright
e0rl | (2023) considered "projected Newton-CG", which entails a combination of the projected gradient and the inexact New- ton steps that preserve the simplicity of projection onto <LATEX>\mathbb{R} _ { + } ^ { d } .</LATEX> In particular, Newton-CG steps are based on the capped CG procedure of Royer et al. (2018). Unfortunately, the gradient and Newton-CG steps are not taken simultaneously. Instead, the algorithm employs projected gradient steps across all components until optimality is attained in the approximately active set. Only at that point is the Newton-CG step applied in the approximately inactive set. This implies that the algo- rithm may take projected gradient steps at most iterations, potentially impeding its practical performance.
7hew | Hessian-free Inexact Methods. In high-dimensional set- tings, storing the Hessian matrix may be impractical. More- over, an approximate direction can often be computed at a fraction of the cost of a full Newton step. In this con- text, Hessian-free inexact Newton-type algorithms leverage Krylov subspace methods (Saad, 2003), which are partic- ularly well-suited for these scenarios. Krylov subspace solvers can recover a reasonable approximate direction in just a few iterations and only require access to the Hessian- vector product mapping, <LATEX>\mathrm { v } \mapsto \mathrm { H } \left( \mathrm { x } \right) \mathrm { v } .</LATEX> The computational cost of a Hessian-vector product is comparable to that of a gradient evaluation and does not require the explicit forma- tion of H. Indeed, <LATEX>\mathrm { H } \left( \mathrm { x } \right) \mathrm { v }</LATEX> can be computed by obtaining the gradient of the map <LATEX>\mathrm { x } \mapsto \langle \mathrm { g } \left( \mathrm { x } \right) , \mathrm { v } \rangle</LATEX> using automatic differentiation, leading to one additional back propagation compared to computing
onvv | <LATEX>\mathrm { g } \left( \mathrm { x } \right) .</LATEX> Complexity in Optimisation. Recently, there has been a growing interest in obtaining global worst case iteration complexity guarantees for optimisation methods, namely a bound on the number of iterates required for the algo- rithm to compute an approximate solution. For instance, in unconstrained and nonconvex settings, gradient descent produces an approximate first-order optimal point satisfying <LATEX>\| \mathrm { g } \left( \mathrm { x } \right) \| \leq \epsilon _ { g }</LATEX> in at most <LATEX>\mathcal{O} \left( \epsilon _ { g } ^ { - 2 } \right)</LATEX> iterations for objectives with Lipschitz continuous gradients (Nesterov, 2004). This rate has been shown to be tight (Cartis et al., 2010). Without additional assumptions, similar rates have also been shown for second-order methods (Cartis et al., 2022). However, for objectives with both Lipschitz continuous gradient and Hes- sian, this rate can be improved to <LATEX>\mathcal{O} \left( \epsilon _ { g } ^ { - 3 / 2 } \right) ,</LATEX> which is also shown to be tight over a wide class of second-order algo- rithms (Cartis et al., 2011b). Second-order methods which achieve this rate include cubic regularised Newton's method and its adaptive variants (Nesterov & Polyak, 2006; Cartis et al., 2011c;a; Xu et al., 2020a), modified trust region based methods (Curtis et al., 2016; 2021; Curtis & Wang, 2023) and line search methods including Newton-CG (Royer et al., 2018) and Newton-MR (Liu & Roosta, 2022b) as well as their inexact variants (Yao et al., 2022; Lim & Roosta, 2023). Many of the above works also provide explicit bounds on the operational complexity, that is, a bound on the number

unxh | In the constrained setting, direct comparison between bounds is difficult due to differences in approximate op- timality conditions; see discussion in Xie & Wright (2023, Section 3) for the bound constraint case. However, the al- gorithms in Cartis et al. (2020); Birgin & Martínez (2018) achieve O(Eg 3/2) for a first-order optimal point with certain types of constraints, which is shown to be tight in Cartis et al. (2020). More specific to the bound constraint case, the Newton-CG log barrier method of O'Neill & Wright (2020) achieves a complexity of O(deg I-1/2 2 + €g 3/2), while the projected Newton-CG algorithm of Xie & Wright (2023) obtains a rate of O(Eg ) under a set of approximate opti- mality conditions similar to this work.
