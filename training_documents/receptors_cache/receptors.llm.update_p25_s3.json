        "content": "yfv2 | Chemokine receptor-ligand dynamics locally within the tumor microenvironment and more broadly, in a systemic fashion can strongly influence tumor behaviour. These dynamics can drive dysregulated autocrine and paracrine signaling loops in cancer collectively referred to as oncocrine signaling. Interestingly, chemokine receptors and ligands are often aberrantly expressed at common sites of metastasis, driving tissue tropism during metastatic spread. This has been well studied in the context of breast cancer, where it has been found that the chemokine receptors CXCR four and CCR seven are overexpressed. Interestingly, their respective ligands, CXCL twelve/SDF-one and CCL twenty-one are highly expressed in the main sites of breast cancer metastasis, such as bone marrow and lung, driving the metastatic profile of this cancer. Indeed, CXCR four/SDF-one signaling has been found to potently drive breast cancer migration and metastasis. This signaling axis is so potent that tumoral expression of CCR seven is one of the most prominent predictors of metastasis and poor prognosis in several different cancer types. Numerous other chemokine and chemokine receptor dynamics have been found to impact metastasis in different settings, including CCR nine, CCR ten, and CXCR five, in addition to playing complementary and significant roles in driving inflammation in the tumor microenvironment.\npujl | Targeting CXCR four/SDF-one signaling using pharmacological inhibitors such as plerixafor, which is an FDA approved CXCR four antagonist for the treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma, has shown to be effective in numerous cancer types, supporting the therapeutic potential of targeting this signaling axis. In addition to the well-established role for CXCRs in metastasis, other classes of GPCRs have also been extensively shown to act as metastatic drivers, including PARs, LPAR, and S one PRs, and this list will likely expand as we gain a better understanding of GPCR-driven signaling networks.\n3rqe | Concomitant with this, there is mounting evidence supporting the role of GPCRs as mediators of the oncocrine signaling networks driving tumor growth and neural innervation, particularly in prostate and stomach cancers. For example, activation of the beta-two adrenergic receptor by adrenaline and noradrenaline has been found to promote secretion of nerve growth factor by both cancerous and pre-cancerous cells. Release of nerve growth factor and other neurotrophins potently promote axonogenesis and subsequent tumor innervation, which establishes a paracrine signaling axis via the secretion of noradrenaline by nerves in the tumor microenvironment. This creates a dynamic feed-forward signaling mechanism by acting on cancer cells, in turn, stimulating their growth, promoting resistance to therapy, and reinforcing the expression of nerve growth factor. The autocrine activation of muscarinic receptors is a similar oncocrine signaling axis in prostate and other cancers. Enhanced secretion of acetylcholine leads to aberrant activation of the M three muscarinic receptor, which has been shown to drive cancer cell proliferation and migration. Aligned with this, amplification or gain of the M one and M three muscarinic receptors have recently been found to correlate with worse progression free survival in prostate cancer patients, and is more frequent in castration-resistant prostate cancers, which are significantly more challenging to treat compared to hormone-sensitive tumors. Strikingly, activation of M one and M three signaling has recently been found to induce castration-resistant growth of prostate cancer cells, through the activation of a conserved FAK-YAP signaling axis. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK was found to prevent YAP activation and castration-resistant growth, representing a promising therapeutic strategy against innervation-driven castration-resistance growth of prostate cancer.\nnsi3 | GPCRs and Tumor Angiogenesis\nnil3 | Stimulation of angiogenesis is a key component of cancer progression for solid tumors. Angiogenic factors released by the tumor, including prostaglandins and thrombin, often act on GPCRs in the stroma and surrounding endothelial cells, such as S one PR, PAR one, and CXCR four-seven, to trigger stimulation of angiogenic mediators such as vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. Thrombin-mediated stimulation of PAR two, for example, induces expression and release of vascular endothelial growth factor, increased vascular permeability, and cleavage of fibrinogen to create a favourable environment for vascularization. EP three stimulation on endothelial cells in particular, can stimulate production of matrix metalloproteinases, which degrade extracellular matrix proteins, enabling neovascularization. Release of chemokines such as CCL two, CCL three, and CCL five can act similarly on the stroma in addition to recruiting immune cells to drive angiogenic growth.\n68a1 | In particular, interleukin eight, encoded by CXCL eight and known to bind CXCR one and CXCR two, is a potent pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory chemokine that can be released from the tumor, the stroma, and from neutrophils, which together can create a robust feed-forward mechanism to elicit angiogenesis.\nseik | These dynamics are typically fine-tuned processes with robust responses induced by minute expression of signaling factors. As such, it is no surprise that tumor cells must co-opt these complex signaling networks to stimulate vascularization and drive cancer progression. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment using the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab is commonly incorporated into cancer treatment approaches. Moreover, co-targeting the apelin receptor APLNR in addition to vascular endothelial growth factor blockade has shown to be a promising strategy to improve antiangiogenic therapies, particularly in glioblastoma, where APLNR has been shown to have a proangiogenic role. The dependency of tumors on vascularization, and the centrality of GPCRs to several aspects of angiogenesis have made them an attractive target for the cancer therapy toolbox. Inhibition of PAR one, CXCR two, CXCR four, and angiotensin receptors AGTR one and AGTR two have shown promising results and are all under current investigation as antiangiogenic cancer therapeutics. Targeting GPCRs in combination with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs may be an effective strategy to extend the clinical efficacy of each treatment alone by preventing the development of drug resistance and bridging the gap for patients with refractory cancer types.\noq7c | GPCRs and Genome Instability",
