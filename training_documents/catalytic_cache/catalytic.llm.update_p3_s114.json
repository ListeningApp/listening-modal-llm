Three. Results and discussion\n7fqw | Three point one. Formation of carbon spheres\nrhaz | The brown powder synthesized through hydrothermal carbonization of glucose are spherical particles. It is worth noting that the formation of carbon spheres is influenced by hydrothermal temperature, reaction time and the concentration of glucose. SEM observations indicated that when the hydrothermal temperature decreased from two hundred degrees Celsius to one hundred eighty degrees Celsius, the diameter of carbon spheres showed a decreased trend. Moreover, the particle size distributions demonstrated that the particle sizes of G one dash two hundred dash ten and G one dash one eighty dash ten were four hundred ninety nanometers and two hundred thirty-five nanometers accounted for a large percentage. Lower hydrothermal temperature would lead to the formation of smaller carbon spheres. By adjusting the parameters of the synthesis process, we could obtain carbon spheres with the calculated average particle diameter of around one hundred ninety nanometers. However, no solid product of carbon spheres were formed except brown solutions in the case of lower hydrothermal temperature one hundred forty degrees Celsius even with a longer reaction time of twenty hours. The brown solution without the formation of carbon spheres suggested that aromatic compounds and oligosaccharides were formed in the \"polymerization\" step, while none of the nuclei was generated and to be continued growing. To investigate the graphitization transformation process better, carbon spheres with a diameter of around one hundred ninety nanometers were chosen as the precursor.\nwak1 | Three point two. Graphitization process\nwtfz | The fabrication procedures of graphitic samples of FC-one-eight and FC-one-eight-HCl through K two FeO four activation and catalyst graphitization were illustrated in Figure one. Cheap and commercially available glucose was chosen as the carbon source to synthesize amorphous carbon spheres through hydrothermal carbonization. The as-obtained carbon spheres were then mixed with K two FeO four providing activation agent KOH and Fe OH three as eqn two.\nqy1i | Four K two FeO four plus ten H two O equals eight KOH plus four Fe OH three plus three O two. Two.\n1k9e | In this step, KOH would react with carbon spheres and develop pores on the surface of samples. The graphitization transformation is as follows: the Fe species are transformed to Fe three O four when annealed from four hundred degrees Celsius to six hundred degrees Celsius. In the case of seven hundred degrees Celsius, Fe three O four is converted to metallic Fe as a result of the reduction of amorphous carbon by H two or CO produced during the pyrolysis process and when the temperature is further increased to eight hundred degrees Celsius, graphitized carbon is formed under the catalysis of Fe. Apart from the existence of metallic Fe, a portion of Fe transforms into well-crystallized Fe three C. It was reported that the metallic Fe and pyrolytic carbon lead to the formation of Fe three C. Therefore, the results verified that the FC-one-eight sample was consisted of Fe three C/Fe and graphitic carbon. As displayed in Figure two a, the diffraction peaks locating at thirty-seven point six degrees, forty-two point nine degrees, forty-three point seven degrees and forty-five point nine degrees correspond to Fe three C with the standard PDF card of JCPDS number thirty-five dash zero seven seven two. Two diffraction peaks are detected at forty-four point six degrees and sixty-five point zero degrees, which belong to the one hundred ten and two hundred planes of Fe. Furthermore, carbon in the whole process was partly oxidized to CO/CO2 and carbonate and as a result, the porous structure was obtained. Obviously, graphitic carbon could be formed when annealed at the temperature of eight hundred degrees Celsius.\n5bjs | To investigate the function of K two FeO four, carbon spheres annealed without the treatment of K two FeO four FC-zero-eight were studied for comparison. From the XRD pattern in Figure two a, two relatively broad peaks were existed in the pattern of FC-zero-eight, implying that the dominant component of the above was amorphous carbon. Validated by the XRD pattern of FC-one-eight-HCl, Fe three C/Fe composites were removed successfully. According to the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms plotted in Figure two b, FC-one-eight-HCl showed four-type adsorption-desorption isotherm with H4-type hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of mesopores. The SSA of the obtained FC-zero-eight is four hundred seventy-nine point eight square meters per gram, while the chemical activation treatment with K two FeO four developed more pores making it increased to five hundred forty-five point five square meters per gram for FC-one-eight. FC-one-eight-HCl showed the largest SSA up to two thousand eight hundred thirteen point six square meters per gram, resulting from the pores caused by the removal of Fe three C/Fe nanoparticles. The pore size distribution in Figure two c revealed that the pore diameter of these samples was around three nanometers, suggesting these samples were rich in mesopores.",
