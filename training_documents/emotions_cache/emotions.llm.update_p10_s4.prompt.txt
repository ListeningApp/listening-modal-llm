You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

rxrg | Studies 1-3 provide evidence against the vacillation hypothesis, which holds that previous studies have yielded evidence for mixed emotions only because subjects vacillated between happiness and sadness more quickly than those studies' static measures could detect. They also provide evidence against the notion that people report mixed emotions only because they think the researchers want them to (Study 2) or because they hold the lay belief that people can experience mixed emotions (Study 3). Taken together, the results of Studies 1-3 provide evidence for the ESM's conten- tion that happiness and sadness can co-occur and against the valence-arousal model's contention that happiness and sadness are mutually exclusive. More broadly, in contrast to Bain's (1859) assertion that valence is irreducible to the experience of emotion and that pleasantness and unpleasantness "destroy" each other, our results indicate that positivity and negativity are separable in experience (Hume, 1739/2000; Ebbinghaus, 1902, cited in Wohlgemuth, 1919).
tf43 | Part 2: Reactive Measurement
fcco | In Studies 1-3, we explicitly asked people whether they felt happy and whether they felt sad. Such closed-ended questions are commonly used to measure emotions (R. J. Larsen & Fredrickson, 1999), but they may have unwelcome consequences. People gen- erally test hypotheses by seeking confirmatory evidence (e.g., Klayman & Ha, 1987), so asking people whether they are experi- encing a particular emotion may prompt them to seek evidence that they are feeling that emotion. Sandberg and Conner (2009) found that women asked to indicate how much they would regret not getting a cervical smear were more likely to get a cervical smear within 4 months than those in a control group. This finding suggests that simply asking about anticipatory regret can elicit anticipatory regret.
8uji | Sandberg and Conner's (2009) findings give rise to a potential alternative interpretation for prior evidence for mixed emotions. For example, by asking them whether they felt happy after Life Is Beautiful, J. T. Larsen et al. (2001) may have inadvertently elicited happiness by prompting subjects to think about the pleasant events that occurred near the end of the film (e.g., the boy's reunion with his mother). Similarly, by asking them whether they felt sad, J. T. Larsen et al. may have elicited sadness by prompting subjects to think about the unpleasant events that occurred near the end (e.g., the father's death). According to this reactive measurement hy- pothesis, J. T. Larsen et al.'s subjects experienced mixed emotions only because J. T. Larsen et al. asked them whether they felt happy and sad. We tested this alternative interpretation in Studies 4-6 by asking subjects open-ended questions about their emotions (e.g., "How do you feel?") rather than closed-ended questions (e.g., "Do you feel happy?").
df3e | Study 4: Emotion Listings
53eu | In Study 4, we asked subjects to list the emotions they were experiencing immediately after watching one of the two clips from
a5u1 | Life Is Beautiful. We reasoned that if people can feel happy and sad at the same time, they would be more likely to spontaneously report experiencing mixed emotions after watching the bittersweet clip than after watching the control clip. The control clip ends on an especially sad note, so its ending might be especially unlikely to elicit mixed emotions. Thus, we included a group of subjects who watched no clip at all. Because the emotion listings were insensitive to the time course of emotions, we supplemented the emotion listings with a retrospective measure of the time course of subjects' positive and negative emotions.
ry7u | Method. Subjects were 116 University of Colorado, Boulder, undergraduates (54 women; 47%).
5mda | Subjects were seated in separate cubicles and randomly assigned to watch the bittersweet <LATEX>\mathrm { c l i p } \left( n = 3 3 \right) ,</LATEX> the control <LATEX>c l i p \left( n = 3 4 \right) ,</LATEX> or neither clip <LATEX>\left( n = 4 9 \right) .</LATEX> Computerized instructions provided the cover story but made no mention of emotions. For subjects who watched either the control or bittersweet clip, the computer pro- vided the following prompt immediately after the clip ended: "Emotions can affect language comprehension, so before we go on we need to know what-if any-emotions you are feeling right now, at this very moment. Are you feeling any emotions right now?" Those who selected "yes" were instructed to "list ONE emotion that you are feeling right now, then press 'Enter."" After entering an emotion, they were asked, "Are you feeling any other emotions right now?" Those who selected "yes" were instructed to list another emotion. These steps were repeated until subjects indicated that they did not feel any other emotions.
i4li | To collect a retrospective measure of the time course of sub- jects' positive and negative emotions, the computer next told subjects that
r8sm | Some people mention feeling both happy and sad after the movie. If you mentioned feeling both happy and sad (or some other pair of positive and negative emotions), we're interested in how your feelings played out over time during the last few moments of the movie and up until now if the movie is still affecting your emotions.
cuin | The computer then displayed a figure with four panels, each plotting different patterns of happiness and sadness across time (see Figure 6). Figures 6A, 6B, 6C, and 6D depicted happiness and sadness as nonadjacent, adjacent, partially overlapping, and completely overlapping, respectively. Subjects were then asked which figure best captured the time course of their emotions at the end of the clip. Subjects were also given the option to indicate that they had not "mention[ed] feeling positive and negative emotions."
n1i7 | Subjects who were assigned to watch neither of the clips re- ceived the cover story and completed the emotion listing task immediately thereafter. For these subjects, the instructions for the retrospective time course measure made no mention of the clip.
0r5m | Results and discussion. Subjects generated a variety of words to describe their emotions. The percentage of subjects in each condition who reported happiness or its synonyms (i.e., glad, happy, joy, overjoyed, "feel rejoiced") and sadness or its syn- onyms (i.e., depressed, despair, sad, saddened, sadness, sorrow) is shown in Table 2. A chi-square test on the happiness data revealed an effect of condition, <LATEX>\chi ^ { 2 } \left( 2 , N = 1 1 6 \right) = 5 5 . 9 7 ,</LATEX> Cramér's
