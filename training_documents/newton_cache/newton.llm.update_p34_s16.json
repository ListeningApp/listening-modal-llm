There exists tau greater than zero and L sub g squared divided by (L sub g squared plus eta squared) less than nu less than or equal to one such that for any x in the nonnegative real numbers to the d with g not in Null H at least one of the following statements (i)-(iii) must hold.\nshub | (i) If psi sub plus is greater than or equal to one and psi sub i is greater than or equal to one then there exists one less than or equal to i less than or equal to psi sub plus and psi sub plus plus psi sub zero plus one less than or equal to j less than or equal to psi such that\nzjn5 | min {lambda sub i, negative lambda sub j} greater than or equal to tau, norm (U sub i plus U sub j plus transpose + U sub j minus U sub j minus transpose) g norm squared greater than or equal to nu norm U U transpose g norm squared.\nw8ia | (ii) If psi sub plus is greater than or equal to one then there exists one less than or equal to i less than or equal to psi sub plus such that\n4vej | lambda sub i greater than tau, norm U sub i plus U sub i plus intercal g norm squared greater than or equal to nu norm U U intercal g norm squared.

Recall that UUT, U sub j minus U sub j minus intercal and U sub i plus U sub i plus intercal represent a projection onto corresponding eigenspaces. Each part of Assumption D point one has a natural interpretation as a requirement that there is at least one large enough magnitude g-relevant eigenvalue for which the projection of the gradient onto the corresponding eigenspaces is not too small. This is a significant relaxation of a more conventional uniform bound on the magnitude of the eigenvalues. For example, a uniform bound on the smallest magnitude eigenvalues\nqze0 | min {lambda sub psi sub plus, negative lambda sub psi sub plus plus psi sub zero plus one} greater than or equal to tau, immediately implies Assumption D point one-(i) with i = psi sub plus, j = psi sub plus plus psi sub zero plus one and nu = one. See Liu and Roosta for further discussion of this assumption.\no3m2 | Assumption D point one allows us to bound the number of Hessian vector products that are required for MINRES to satisfy ten. Indeed, assuming g not in Null H, we appeal to Liu and Roosta to bound the number of iterations until the MINRES termination tolerance ten is satisfied as\nkro9 | T sub S O L equals min {ceil {sqrt L sub g divided by mu by four log {four divided by eta squared divided by L sub g squared plus eta squared minus (one minus nu)}} plus one, g}, where g denotes the grade of g with respect to H. We note that T sub S O I has a logarithmic dependence on the inexactness tolerance,\ni438 | eta. On the other hand if psi sub minus is greater than or equal to one and Assumption D point one-(iii) holds, we appeal to Liu and Roosta to bound the iterations required to obtain a N P C direction as",
