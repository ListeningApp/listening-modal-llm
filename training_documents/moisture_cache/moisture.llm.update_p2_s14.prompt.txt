You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

57lp | MATERIALS FOR MOISTURE IMPERVIOUS SHEATHS
ukth | Plastic Coated Metallic Tapes
kpvt | For many years, a plastic coated aluminum product has been in widespread use as a moisture barrier in telecommunication cables and low voltage power, control and instrument cables.6, 7 The aluminum is coated with a copolymer of polyethylene which forms a highly moisture resistant bond to the aluminum.8
jie2 | The copolymer is adhesively compatible with low, linear low, medium and high density polyethylene jacketing materials as well as chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) and the zero- halogen jacketing materials. These latter two materials are used when ignition suppression is required. As noted in the previous section, coated aluminum is the laminate of choice in combination with neutral wires or wire shields. The use of coated aluminum tapes minimizes the added cost for moisture barrier protection.
d0ik | Plastic coated copper is the material of choice when the moisture barrier serves a dual role of both shield and moisture barrier. Coated copper offers several benefits as a moisture barrier. First it forms terminations having excellent electrical stability. Second, it offers corrosion resistance. Third, because of its conductivity, it allows the moisture barrier to be used as the neutral in many instances. The modified copolymer used on the copper forms a long term moisture resistant bond.9
0x0s | This copolymer is also compatible with the wide variety of polyethylene jackets in use by the industry as well as chlorinated polyethylene and the zero- halogen materials.
4exe | A new family of coated aluminum, steel, or copper products has been developed which are adhesively compatible with PVC. 10
0myz | Cushion Layer
xh3i | A cushion layer is used between the core and moisture barrier sheath to absorb the thermal expansion of the core during load cycling. One type of material is a non-woven textile tape which incorporates a swellable powder to achieve water blocking. "1 A swell- able powder is applied to a non-woven substrate and a very thin, porous, non-woven cover is laminated on top. Upon contact with water, the powder absorbs up to 500 times its weight and swells. The swelling produces a jelly that exudes through the porous cover. This jelly forms a dam in the cable interstices that eliminates the longitudinal water flow under the moisture barrier. The intrinsic porosity of the non-woven textile allows immediate wetting of the powder and allows migration of the jellied powder to fill all interstices of the cable. If heat generated within the cable drives the water out, the jelly returns to powder form. It is reactivated when contacted again with water.
syiw | The non-woven aspect of the tape also allows it to act as a cushion layer to protect the moisture barrier sheath from expansion and contraction of the insulation that occurs during electrical loading of the cable. These tapes are rated 90°C for continuous use and can withstand 150℃ during short term emergency use. They can also withstand the 230°C or so exposure that can occur during cable manufacture. Non-woven tapes can be impregnated with carbon black to provide good semi-conducting properties.
kg3t | More recently, another type of cushion layer has been developed based on a semi- conductive cross-linked polyethylene foam.
lvae | Adhesives For Sealing
o9sc | A hot melt adhesive is inserted into the overlap of the metallic moisture barrier to aid in the sealing of the overlap. The use of hot melt adhesives provides a reliable method of sealing the overlap during continuous cable production. The desirable characteristics of hot melts for use in moisture barrier cable include (1) adhesive compatibility with the coated metal laminate used as the moisture barrier; (2) compatibility with any lubricating oils used to facilitate forming of the laminate; (3) moisture resistant bonds; (4) bond stability; and (5) low viscosity to allow uniform spreading within the overlap. Adhesion and cable performance studies have indicated that a hot melt based on a blend of polyamide and ethylene vinyl acetate are suitable for application in power cable 12.
121u | Strand Filling Material
zh03 | A recent technological advance in materials for power cable has been the development of filling materials for the conductors. These materials are applied by an extrusion process or pumped into place during the stranding operation. The fillers block the longitudinal migration of moisture in the conductors. They prevent accumulation of moisture in the strand during cable manufacture, storage, installation and use. These materials have no adverse effect on splicing and termination procedures. 13
1mvw | Jackets
6d4s | As noted in the section describing the coated metal laminates, it is most important that jackets for use on moisture barrier cable have adhesive compatibility with the coatings on the laminate. Another key requirement is the degree of ignition suppressance required for the cable. Polyethylene jackets in a variety of densities and types are chosen when flame resistance is not a consideration. Chlorinated polyethylene is selected when flame resistance and chemical resistance are required. Zero-halogen jackets are selected when there is a need to minimize the emission of smoke and corrosive fumes. Polyvinyl chloride jackets are chosen for general purpose applications where ignition suppression and lower cost are the main considerations.
mqah | STANDARDIZATION ACTIVITIES WITH MOISTURE IMPERVIOUS CABLE
xxr8 | Background
rl4j | There are several industry groups working on standardization of moisture impervious cable. These activities are taking place during the introductory and developmental stages of moisture impervious cable, before widespread commercialization. The standards- making process is helping to shape the moisture impervious cable technology, rather than just reacting to the developing technology. The process is dynamic, coming from the top-down.
vz32 | IEC Activities
ncb0 | IEC 840, "Tests for Power Cables with Extruded Insulation for Rated Voltages above 30 kV up to 150 kV" was published in 1988. At that time, the "Water Penetration Test" (Paragraph 5.6.16) was under consideration. An International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) working group is defining this test. A draft document 20A (CO) 99, under the six months rule, was published as a secretariat document under 20A (Secretariat) 164. This document describes a water penetration test for those cables where barriers to longitudinal penetration have been included. The test is applicable to barriers applied over the core
8mp0 | and within the conductor. The water penetration test is applied after a length of cable has been subjected to the bending test. A 50 mm wide ring is removed from the center of the length including layers external to the insulation screen or, alternatively, the conductor. A tube at least 10 mm in diameter is placed vertically over the exposed ring and sealed to the surface of the oversheath. Normally tap water is used to fill the tube. A period of five minutes is allowed for filling. The height of the water in the tube is 1000 mm above the center of the cable. The water is allowed to stand for 24 hours. The sample is then subjected to 10 heating cycles. The conductor is heated until it reaches a temperature not less than 5° C or more than 15° C above the maximum rated temperature of the insulation in normal operation. The heating cycle is 8 hours on and 16 hours off.
