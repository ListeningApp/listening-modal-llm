You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

The reconstructed composition (RC) of the altered sample was calculated for each element by multiplying its concentration in the altered sample (nor- malized to 100% volatile free) by the EF. Finally, the mass change for each element in the sample was calculated by sub- tracting the precursor concentration of that element in the least altered sample from the RC. The largest mass changes are associated with moderate to intense alteration, generally increasing with depth (App. Figs. A26, A27). Mass changes for each assemblage are outlined below (Fig. 17; Table 5):

8p6h | Mass dilution effects caused by anhydrite and pyrite precip- itation were partially mitigated through handpicking of indi- vidual altered clasts, avoiding veins and cement/infill. Despite this procedure, not all of these materials could be omitted, thus contributing CaO, Fe2O3, and S and accounting for some apparent loss of SiO2. The main difference between the low- temperature alteration stage (dominated by illite/smectite + pyrite) and the higher-temperature alteration stage (domi- nated by chamosite + corrensite) is the mass change of MgO (higher in chamosite) and K2O (higher in illite/smectite), typi- cal of VMS-style alteration in permeable volcaniclastic rocks (e.g., Shikazono et al., 1995; Franklin et al., 2005).

43ia | Fluid inclusions were investigated in five samples of hydro- thermally altered volcaniclastic rocks recovered in drill hole TKAD001 between 14.8 and 19.3 m b.s.f. Details of the petrography and microthermometry are provided in Appen- dix Table A4. Fluid inclusions occur in three distinct para- genetic stages: early anhydrite in veins and rimming altered volcanic clasts, sphalerite at the margins of the early anhydrite veins in the deepest samples (MA13-090 and P005), and later infills of anhydrite and barite.

tp8g | (Fig. 19A) and salinities from 2.8 to 3.4 wt % NaCl equiv (Fig.
gxfd | 19B). However, it is known that barite can stretch during
s2v1 | heating (e.g., Ulrich and Bodnar, 1988), so these homogeniza-

z8tt | ping temperatures of primary fluid inclusions in sphalerite are up to 298℃ (Fig. 19C) with salinities of 2.6 to 4.5 wt % NaCl

41fx | The highest inclusion trapping temperatures are only ~10°
7um8 | to 20℃ lower than the minimum temperature of boiling for Tinakula fluids (308°-311℃ at 1,070-1,204 m water depth; Fig. 20), and the highest salinities clearly exceed that of seawa- ter. Although coexisting vapor-rich and brine fluid inclusions
uow2 | associated with boiling were not encountered in the investi-
iat7 | gated minerals, elevated salinities in several inclusions likely

z8f7 | at depth (e.g., 350℃ for typical end-member hydrothermal
