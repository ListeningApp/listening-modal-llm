You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

3lgb | where we have reinstated the dimensionful variables. We therefore recover the "on mass-shell" path integral (30) obtained earlier. Note the importance of including the determinant (19) in order to obtain the <LATEX>\partial _ { x x } ^ { 2 } V</LATEX> term in the Schrödinger potential
ttwt | <LATEX>\bar { U } .</LATEX> Before proceeding to the next sections we should add a comment regarding the above path integrals. Beyond being expressions that allow formal manipulations, they can also be understood as limits of large multi-variate integrals arising from the discretization of time evolu- tion into small discrete time intervals. In general, this
x5l2 | discretization results into apparent ambiguities [25]1. In our case this can also be linked to the discretization of the Langevin equation (8) (the index i refers to the <LATEX>i ^ { \mathrm { t h } }</LATEX> time interval)
ilrs | <LATEX>x _ { i } = x _ { i - 1 } + V ^ { \prime } \left( x _ { i } ^ { \star } \right) \Delta t + \int _ { t _ { i - 1 } } ^ { t _ { i } } d s \xi \left( s \right)</LATEX> (49)
0a03 | where <LATEX>x _ { i } ^ { \star } = \alpha x _ { i } + \left( 1 - \alpha \right) x _ { i - 1 } .</LATEX> In the above discus- sions and manipulations we have tacitly assumed <LATEX>\alpha = 1 / 2</LATEX> (Stratonovich) which, in the continuous limit is equiva- lent to setting <LATEX>\Theta \left( 0 \right) = 1 / 2</LATEX> [22]. It is well known however that, as long as the noise amplitude does not depend on <LATEX>x</LATEX> (known as additive noise), the solution to the Langevin equation is unique, as is the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. Our path integrals respect this and all results derived from them are independent of the choice of <LATEX>\alpha .</LATEX> Calculations with the discrete version, show that contri- butions from terms involving <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> cancel. For example, one can start from the discretized path integral with an ar- bitrary choice of <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> and obtain a unique Fokker-Planck equation - see e.g. [22]. In the continuum formulation, the supersymmetry discussed in subsection IID below imposes the cancellation of terms where the ambiguous quantity <LATEX>\Theta \left( t = 0 \right)</LATEX> appears. This is also reflected in the path integral (48) through the special form of the poten- tial <LATEX>U \left( x \right)</LATEX> in terms of the "superpotential" <LATEX>V \left( x \right) .</LATEX> Overall, this non-dependence on <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> ultimately stems from the in- clusion of the determinant detM in (13). These consid- erations support the view that the formal path integrals considered here are well defined and free from any ambi- guity.
auae | C. Correlation functions from the generating functional
5b6y | One way to compute correlation functions is through the use of objects called generating functionals. In this subsection we will outline how these generating function- als yield correlators in practice. We will then outline in section III how the fRG can be used to compute these generating functionals in the first place and therefore how to obtain correlation functions in section
1y10 | <LATEX>I V .</LATEX> The first generating functional we examine is the parti- tion functional <LATEX>\mathcal{Z} \left( \mathrm { J } \right)</LATEX> which depends on source terms <LATEX>\mathrm { J } \left( t \right)</LATEX> (in analogy with a magnetic field source term <LATEX>M \left( x \right)</LATEX> in spin systems)
6mnx | <LATEX>\mathcal{Z} \left( \mathrm { J } \right) = \int \mathcal{D} \Phi \exp \left[ - \mathcal{S} _ { B M } \left[ \Phi \right] + \int d t \mathrm { J } \Phi \right] ,</LATEX> (50)
tynp | which, under variation w.r.t. J will give any required correlator. In the above functional integral, <LATEX>\Phi</LATEX> stands
ob0u | collectively for <LATEX>\left( \varphi \left( t \right) , \widetilde { F } \left( t \right) , \rho \left( t \right) , \bar { \rho } \left( t \right) \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>\mathrm { J } \left( t \right)</LATEX> for all the corresponding currents
50o1 | <LATEX>\int d t \mathrm { J } \Phi \equiv \int d t \left( J _ { \varphi } \varphi + J _ { \widetilde { F } } \widetilde { F } + \bar { \rho } \zeta + \bar { \zeta } \rho \right)</LATEX> (51)
cw76 | The only constraint we will require of the currents is that they satisfy <LATEX>\mathrm { J } \left( t _ { \mathrm { i n } } \right) = \mathrm { J } \left( t _ { \mathrm { f } } \right) = 0</LATEX> at the initial and final times <LATEX>t _ { \mathrm { i n } }</LATEX> and
lkk5 | <LATEX>t _ { \mathrm { f } } .</LATEX> The averages of the fields are defined by
molj | <LATEX>\langle \Phi \left( t \right) \rangle \equiv \int \mathcal{D} \Phi \Phi \left( t \right) \exp \left[ - \mathcal{S} _ { B M } \left[ \Phi \right] \right]</LATEX> (52)
5pto | <LATEX>= \frac { \delta \mathcal{Z} \left[ \mathrm { J } \right] } { \delta \mathrm { J } \left( t \right) } | _ { \mathrm { J } = 0 } ,</LATEX> (53)
mo6k | the two point correlation function is:
zh6q | <LATEX>\langle \Phi \left( t _ { 1 } \right) \Phi \left( t _ { 2 } \right) \rangle \equiv \frac { \int \mathcal{D} \Phi \Phi \left( t _ { 1 } \right) \Phi \left( t _ { 2 } \right) \exp \left[ - \mathcal{S} \left[ \Phi \right] \right] } { \int \mathcal{D} \Phi \exp \left[ - \mathcal{S} \left[ \Phi \right] \right] }</LATEX> (54)
