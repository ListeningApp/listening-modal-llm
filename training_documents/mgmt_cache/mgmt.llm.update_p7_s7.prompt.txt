You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

z8tt | The Making of Rendanheyi
9g22 | Not satisfied with past achievements, Haier's senior management had the ambition to become the global industry leader and to create a truly innovative global company that competes on the basis of new product innovations. In 2005, Yang Mianmian, group president at the time, said, "We are number three in the world for white goods, we want to be number one."22 Around that time, Zhang first used the word "Rendanheyi," which was aimed at achieving (in Zhang's words) "zero distance to the customer," whereby the entire corporate structure is
41fx | Management Innovation Made in China: Haier's Rendanheyi
7um8 | dedicated to serving customers, giving them personalized products and services, by creating independent entrepreneurial units that operate as small quasi-inde- pendent firms (within the boundaries of the company) and have market rela- tionships among themselves.
uow2 | Key to the development of Rendanheyi was the spirit of curiosity and experimentation that originated with Zhang Ruimin-the central change agent. Rendanheyi essentially includes a collection of organizational practices that have evolved over time (see Table 1 for Rendanheyi's key characteristics). From 2005, Haier went through a ten-year period of intensive experimentation with organi- zational structure and performance management. During 2005-2009, Haier estab- lished strategic business units and implemented new IT solutions and performance measures to connect the organization to customers. In 2009, Haier announced its strategic transformation from being exclusively a manufacturing company to becoming a service-oriented company, meaning that it considers manufacturing as only one means of satisfying customer needs.
iat7 | In 2010, Haier established the first ZZJYT, which operated like a virtual team (i.e., its offices were not necessarily physically close) with typically ten to 20 employees from different functional and hierarchical levels, brought together for the project. ZZJYTs enjoyed operational autonomy, including recruiting employ- ees for the team, setting compensation rules, and determining bonus payments. But Zhang was not satisfied with the performance of ZZJYTs, as he felt that they presented "a closed mechanism" without sufficient involvement of outsiders. He
ywwr | also felt they hindered faster entrepreneurial development because employees were still paid a basic salary (even though bonuses were added to it) and lacked sufficient autonomy.
0i6j | In 2014, the entire corporate structure was re-organized, breaking the organization into a network of independent micro-enterprises called "xiaowei" to replace the ZZJYTs. The owner-CEO of a xiaowei (typically 6-8 members, but it can be larger) has a small ownership stake (some xiaowei are majority Haier- owned, but some xiaowei are not, and Haier is currently requiring "continuous dilution" of its holdings). The owner-CEO operates as an entrepreneur with abso- lute autonomous decision making (including all contracting, budgeting, and recruitment decisions). The performance of a xiaowei is measured against a com- bination of financial key performance indicators (KPI) and user value added. The remuneration of xiaowei members no longer depends on a salary and is entirely tied to performance. Going beyond the ZZJYT, the xiaowei leader has total auton- omy, like a CEO of an independent company, and is not subject to headquarters approval of any decisions. A xiaowei is not forced to use internal suppliers. Furthermore, the xiaowei are actively encouraged to seek the involvement of external partners and partial external funding for projects.
87cq | The xiaowei naturally vary greatly in terms of their function. Around 200 xiaowei are direct, user-facing micro-enterprises developing, for example, new white goods products, entirely new products such as water purification equip- ment, and financial products. They actively use numerous online platforms with millions of customers participating in the process of designing, producing, and using Haier products, while keeping the platforms open to external entrepreneurs to join as partners. Most of the other xiaowei are "node micro-enterprises," which provide products and services to user-facing micro-enterprises (for example, xiao- wei of road transport providers and supply chain xiaowei of factory workers).
0qs3 | The corporate headquarters provides support for all of these xiaowei, allo- cates corporate resources, and sets the strategic direction for the entire organization. The corporate headquarters fulfills the conventional strategy-setting headquarters functions and provides corporate services such as HR and marketing through dedi- cated platforms. However, it is also partly organized as a xiaowei. For example, the corporate legal team operates as a xiaowei that can draw up standard contracts between other micro-enterprises for a fee, while a xiaowei of the communications department develops a cartoon series to help increase merchandise sales and gener- ate additional revenues (Table 2 contains a simplified organizational structure).
z8f7 | The latest iteration of Haier's management practice has been labeled "Rendanheyi 2.0" and is close to Zhang's vision of Haier's organizational form in the twenty-first century. Rendanheyi is, therefore, a platform management inno- vation, that is, it contains a number of specific, interrelated practices. In a histori- cal perspective, this is a logical third phase in Haier's development as a management innovator. In the first phase, prior to Rendanheyi, the company primarily copied management practices developed elsewhere (such as Business Process Engineering), with varying degrees of success. In the second phase, Rendanheyi

51vd | 1.0, the company first created some of its own stand-alone management practices. Now, with Rendanheyi 2.0, Haier is successfully creating a number of inter-linked practices. Haier is likely to continue to create specific new practices under the Rendanheyi platform.
baj1 | It may be somewhat premature to discuss the effectiveness of Rendanheyi, in particular, the effectiveness of xiaowei that have only been in existence since 2014. However, the success of Rendanheyi can possibly be gleaned from Haier's growth in profit margins. When Rendanheyi was first introduced in 2005, Haier Group's profit margins were estimated at below 3% to 4% compared with 6% to 8% for rivals such as Whirlpool. In 2015, the net profit margin of Qingdao Haier Co. Ltd. (one of two listed Haier Group companies) was 5.7% compared with Whirlpool Corp.'s 3.9%. And with Rendanheyi 2.0, Haier Group's profits increased 12.8% to 20.3 billion yuan (US$2.9 billion) between 2015 and 2016, while the group's revenue rose 6.8% to 201.6 billion yuan (US$29.3 billion). A key element of Rendanheyi 2.0 has been the Internet platforms that connect Haier with its users-the volume of transactions on such platforms rose 73% to 272.7 billion yuan (US$39.6 billion) between 2015 and 2016.
