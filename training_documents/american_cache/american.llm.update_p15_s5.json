        "content": "78r8 | More than simply illustrating the alphabet, the figure of the map worked conceptually to teach abstract principles of literacy. This is suggested by the primer The Mother's Gift; or, Remarks on a Set of Cuts for Children. This primer presents the student reader with a picture of a map, a subtitle spelling out the words, \"A Map,\" and a narrative description: \"MAP. As you get forward in the study of geography you will find great entertainment in maps. How pleasant is it to trace the progress\n320g | of a traveller of whom we read; and still more interesting where a friend is on a voyage or journey.\" Here, map literacy is taught as a reading skill and a life skill: maps are understood to inform the student's future geography lessons; they are considered textual companions of the leisured reader who consumes travel narratives and novels; maps provide the material link through which friends and families communicate with each other. As the titles of primers like The Mother's Gift suggest, alphabetic literacy was the product of a domestic ideology in which the child was the focus of alphabetic instructions provided by the ideal republican mother; in this context the map was introduced to the child reader by the most intimate member and designated disciplinarian of the early national household.\ntp8g | But the alphabetic lesson surrounding the map was not only the pedagogic means of embedding the student inside a social network. The picture primer's rationale also created a visual narrative in which individual bodies were circumscribed by cartographic signs. In The Uncle's Present: A New Battledoor the letter Z is depicted by a street peddler who is carrying different sized maps while calling \"Zealand, or England, and a\ngxfd | Map of the World.\" While in this picture alphabet the map appears in the form of a consumer article, the map also ties the market economy to the anthropomorphized ABCs. As the human figure associates maps with the alphabetic sign, it establishes a somatic link between the reader's body, the alphabetic reading material, and cartographic writings. Like the human alphabet, which instituted the notion that the body was subject to the authority and discipline of the written sign, in this example the alphabetized individual becomes intrinsically part of a largely commercial cartographic archive and expanded notion of geographic literacy.\ns2v1 | While American primers were establishing a deep structural nexus between alphabetic and map literacy, one of the more influential geography books consciously developed this nexus into a national form of print language. In the best-selling textbook Geography Made Easy, the Federalist minister and geographer Jedidiah Morse tested the relationship between alphabetic and cartographic literacy. He pursued the question of how maps could aid the literary process of making the idea of\njkp9 | nation a permanent inscription in the minds of American students. \"Calculated particularly for the Use and Improvement of SCHOOLS in the United States,\" the textbook was the first in a series of books whose intended goal was explicit: \"That our youth of both sexes, at the same time that they are learning to read, might imbibe an acquaintance with their own country, and an attachment to its interests.\" To demonstrate a possible means for attaching youngsters to a national imaginary, Morse inserted two kinds of maps in his first edition of Geography Made Easy, experimental word maps and a conventional national map.\nz8tt | The word maps, advertised as \"newly constructed Maps, adapted to the Capacities and Understanding of Children,\" demonstrate how Federalists like Morse imagined the geographic process of national unification as purely alphabetic. Each of these four maps, representing South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia, consists of a blank rectangular frame. Into this spatially delimited tabula rasa Morse spells out the names of existing nation-states, arranging the printed letters to indicate their geographic dimensions and relations. Having thus jettisoned the usual elements of map reading necessary for one's orientation and self-location-the geographic grid, local place names, and pictographic symbols-Morse represents each continent as the verbal approximation of political rather than geographical locales. In each continental map, the elaborately printed names of nations appear as synecdochic figures of actual places. Conversely, the geographical order of the world is upheld by the alphabetic construction of nations. More specifically, the word map subordinates the implied cartographic image to the machine-made appearance of the printed text, and the representation of continents and geopolitical entities to the conventions of print typography. With these word maps, Morse's geography imitated a spatial order derived from print technology, an order according to which \"typographic control typically impresses more by its tidiness and inevitability: the lines perfectly regular, justified on the right side, everything coming out even visually.\"\n9g22 | Yet-and this is the dilemma that Morse's experimental maps demonstrate-for the nation to become the perfectly regular alphabetic environment, the word maps had to reconcile a strain that lies at the heart of all cartographic representation: their formal arrangement had to negotiate the reader's imaginary freedom of movement offered by the hybrid textuality of the map. By reading the map as a quasi-blank and verbally\n41fx | elastic text, the apprentice map reader was able to create a space of his or her own. Just as the alphabet enabled politicians to organize the world into political spaces, the unorthodox arrangement of Morse's letters undercut the fantasy of territorial control. The word maps established national alignment as a ludic activity; just as the printer's apprentice shuffled the typeface inside the letterbox, Morse's students learned how to playfully scramble the verbal markers of political territories. Through a random shuffle, nations vanish or become reconstituted as a different word.\n7um8 | In order to better control the reader's alphabetic literacy, Morse exploited the pedagogic (and political) authority by which the mapmaker shaped the signification and interpretation of political geography. It is telling that at the historical moment of seventeen eighty-four, when language threatened to upend the new nation, the alphabet and alphabetic maps seemed to be insufficient tools for stabilizing the new American nation. Instead of adding a fifth word map that spelled out the constitutive names of the United States, Morse turns to the conventional map and the iconic outline of the new federal state as the dominant lesson signifying the union. Upon opening the textbook, the student readers were greeted with the first picture of the nation, A Map of the United States of America, seventeen eighty-four. This map by Amos Doolittle was one of the first national maps published in the United States immediately following the Peace of Paris. The map is thus designed to show exclusively the territory of the nation-state, tracing its international borders from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Mississippi River in the west, and from British Canada to the north and Spanish Florida to the south.\nuow2 | To the lower right of the map, a cartouche introduces through its visual\niat7 | narrative the relationship between map and alphabetic literacy. Hovering in a swirl of billowing clouds, the female figure of Liberty (or perhaps Columbia), together with the American eagle, lifts a banner inscribed \"Per Aspera ad Astra\" in order to unveil the new nation's name (in bold print) while the land is strategically placed underneath (in a rough sketch). When considered in juxtaposition to the map image, the cartouche suggests that as long as they are viewed separately the two discursive modes of either word or image foster imaginings that are easily clouded and distorted. If used jointly, however-as the dual gesture of\nywwr | unveiling the geographic name of the nation and by analogy of the map image itself indicates-the cartouche celebrates the mixed language of geography as the ideal literary means for representing the nation in clear and unambiguous terms.",
