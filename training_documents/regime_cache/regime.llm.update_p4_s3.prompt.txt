You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

We then introduce the notion of synthetic forcings in Section 3, where we also give examples and discuss them in more detail. We next demonstrate the possibly dramatic benefits in terms of statistical error with some numerical results in low dimensions in Section 4, namely one and two-dimensional overdamped Langevin dynamics, and one-dimensional Langevin dynamics. We finally discuss in Section 5 the extensions and perspectives of this approach.
4gqa | 2. Linear response and associated computational techniques. In this sec- tion, we review linear response theory and the computational techniques allowing to compute transport coefficients. The framework we consider is that of stochastic dy- namics, ergodic for the Boltzmann-Gibbs measure, which are perturbed by external forcings.
mpgz | We start in Section 2.1 by setting up the framework for general time-homogeneous SDEs, and the specific dynamics we consider, namely (non)equilibrium overdamped Langevin and Langevin dynamics. We then review in Section 2.2 linear response theory, the definition of transport coefficients and discuss the associated standard numerical techniques to estimate these coefficients. We finally present the numerical analysis of nonequilibrium molecular dynamics in Section 2.3.
gf06 | 2.1. Reference dynamics and perturbation. We start by describing in Sec- tion 2.1.1 the general setting for linear response theory for a general stochastic differ- ential equation (SDE). We introduce in particular some assumptions on the dynamics which will be used in the analysis throughout this paper. We next describe the dynam- ics and their nonequilibrium perturbations for overdamped Langevin and Langevin dynamics in Sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.3, respectively.
75hv | 2.1.1. General setting.
tbiu | Reference dynamics. Consider a general time-homogeneous SDE defined on the state-space X, where X is typically the full space Rª or a bounded domain with periodic boundary conditions Tª (with T = R/Z the one-dimensional torus):
413q | (2.1) dXt =b(Xt) dt +o(Xt)dWt,
8wkl | for a given initial condition xo E X, a standard Brownian motion Wt E R™, and where b: X -> Rª and o : X -> Rdxm are assumed to be such that there exists a unique solution to (2.1). A simple setting is to assume that b and o are C00, hence locally Lipschitz, which is used to prove existence and uniqueness of the solution [40, 33, 22]. The SDE (2.1) is associated with the following infinitesimal generator
next | (2.2) Lo = 6TV + =0OT : V2,
3dfm | where : denotes the Frobenius inner product, and V2 is the Hessian operator. More explicitly, for some given Co test function y: Rd -> R, the operator Lo acts as
hjmm | LO6 = >bid =Q + ; i=1 d d d m
s0s6 | We assume that the dynamics (2.1) has a unique invariant probability measure with a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure denoted by o(x). This density satisfies

tl2g | Perturbation of the reference dynamics. We next consider a perturbation of the reference dynamics (2.1), obtained by adding to the drift field b some smooth nongra- dient forcing F : X -> Rª of magnitude n E R:

q0se | The generator of (2.4) is denoted by Cn = Co + nCphys, where Cphys is the generator associated with the physical perturbation:
tz7u | Čphys = FTV.
jszk | We assume that b, o and F are such that the following assumption holds.
egkh | ASSUMPTION 1 (Uniqueness of the invariant measure). The dynamics (2.4) admits a unique invariant probability measure for any n E R, with a smooth density un with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Moreover, trajectorial ergodicity holds: for any observable R E L1 (Vn), and any initial condition X",

5jom | Note that Un solves the Fokker-Planck equation

o1k9 | Sufficient conditions for Assumption 1 to hold are discussed after Assumption 2 below. Although Un can be shown to uniquely exist, its analytical expression is generally not known. Note that in the case n = 0, the dynamics (2.4) reduces to the reference dynamics (2.1).
s1uu | We need to make precise some estimates on the evolution semigroup associated with (2.4) for the analysis presented in Section 2.3. We consider to this end weighted spaces of bounded functions. To define them, we first introduce a family of Lyapunov functions denoted by (Kn)nEN, with Kn : X > [1, +00) such that
