You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

hafg | Q: But how can a person acquire the balance to derive just so much self-satisfaction from the Stage of Service, and no more, so that he will have 'savings' of constructive service to be of future avail to him?
jrh1 | A: There are five requirements which make it possible:
74vj | 1. The man (or woman) must be able to allow that the foregoing analysis may be correct.
a6rv | 2. He must familiarise himself with the argument, remembering that shallower contentions about analysis of situations and the nature of service are already rooted in his brain.
f0oi | 3- He must realise that merely supposing that he understands the foregoing is often simply a prelude to forgetting it.
0cm7 | 4- He has to undergo specialised exercises which help to make it possible for his brain to work consistently in another manner as well as in the conventional one which is now customary to it
eoa3 | 5- He has to examine himself to see whether he is expecting too much from his studies or from life in the immediate reward sense,
bagj | and hence being forced to devour valuable experiential nutrition as emotional stimulus to assuage the tensions caused by his random expectations.
utkw | As to the matter of wisdom and repentance, it is important to note that theologized thinking has assumed that religious people repent in order to gain Divine wisdom or acceptance.
6yad | But if you realise that numerous authoritative Sufis make a point of the perenniality of Sufism, you will see that there is a stage apart from the current religious frame. In other words, the Sufis claim that before religion must come sense and understanding. Anything else is mechanical or emotional with a likelihood of insufficient depth of understanding.
y2oh | There are a large number of texts in which this point is made, so we can merely adduce one significant instance here. Abu-Nasr Sarraj in his important Kitab al-Luma, explains, after saying that Sufism stems from an era preceding the present Islamic one, that wisdom comes from repentance, partly. Repentance, for the Elect, the mystic, is repentance for forgetting God. But for disciples, learners, wisdom is through repenting one's own short- comings. Before the religious life and understanding comes, the mass of psychological blocks which cause shortcomings must be dealt with. The service situation, about which you have asked, involves activities which cut through these blocks, many of which are concerned with a fixation upon oneself.
m4v4 | The matter of balancing the amount of personal stimulus which is permissible is dealt with in Book Six of Saadi's Boston in a memorable passage which enables one to keep the matter in mind. There was once an enlightened man who was given a silken scarf by the King of Khotan. He expanded like a blossom from pleasure, but kissed his hand and said: 'How good the honour of the Shah of Khotan - but how much better one's own [Sufi] mantle!'
kyvd | I find this an interesting illustration, because it accords one the right to a necessary degree of emotional stimulus while maintaining the relative importance of the rest of life. This principle is seldom noted in theologized literature, where all things of the world are condemned very often without regard for the necessity for a certain degree of environmental stimulus.
topm | Ritual and Practice
adk2 | Q: I have been told that you have said that it is not always worthwhile to discuss with questioners the status and value of rituals and practices of cults. Why is this?
ewaz | A: It is only worthwhile discussing these with people who have the necessary basic information about cult-behaviour and human groups. This is, of course, already available in popular editions of sociological and psychological texts.
xrmn | Time is wasted if one has to explain elementary ideas to people who have come for advanced ones.
gy2l | It is possible to communicate useful materials only to people who have taken the trouble to inform themselves about what is already known about, say, the social character of cult-groupings.
4byn | So many people who have in fact taken this trouble exist and want more advanced information and discussions, that it is unfair to them to try to perform at their expense the elementary educa- tional task which is just as well done by mass-circulation books.
4ors | It is lazy and unworthy of people to come for such information to people who are trying to do more advanced things. It is pre- posterously ignorant of people who are trying to teach to imagine and to lead others to believe that they can teach everyone.
gsos | If the applicants have not learnt the first steps, which they can do so easily from readily available materials on cult-formation describing pitfalls and imaginings about cults, what reason has anyone to suppose that they will be able - or willing - to learn the second steps? Such attitudes do not work in any other field; there is no evidence known to me which indicates that they work in our area.
prya | People who are willing to learn for themselves what they can on a lower level are thereby giving us evidence that they are ready to learn more. If we are given the reverse evidence, would we not be fools to try to teach them?
dhlb | PRICE OF THE FIRST LESSON
ggfl | It is worth remembering the tale of Nasrudin when he wanted to learn how to play a musical instrument The fee was five silver pieces for the first lesson, and three for the second and sub- sequent ones. 'Very well,' said the Mulla, 'I'll start with the second lesson.'
i888 | People talk and think endlessly about what rituals and other practices do for them or do not do for them. But what are then- qualifications for assessing such things?
zcil | Rumi gives us an arresting passage in Fihi ma Fihi when he recalls that someone may embrace a pillar in the dark, mistaking it for a loved one. He thinks, for that moment, that this is an experience of love. But what is it really?
dzwl | A person, he continues, may have a whole range of vivid experiences in a dream, which cause him great sorrow. When he wakes up he finds that it was a dream and he loses all his regrets in an instant, even though seconds before they were very real to him. Now he may have an exactly similar dream again, with all the former sorrow recurring. In his sleeping state he does not remember that it was a dream: this, then, becomes for the time being, 'reality' for him.
sjbu | To be Present
ukqq | If you believe that mechanical regularity in studies, or physical presence, are basic to higher knowledge, you are mistaking them for something else. This other thing is either a reversion to school repetition-learning days, or an unthinking assumption based upon your experience of imitators.
6l57 | Either realise this, and satisfy your attention-demanding and comfort-seeking appetites separately from your studies; or realise it and accept whatever the Teaching can offer you.
e7vr | In the latter case, you will have to follow a course dictated in its conditions and forming by effectiveness and not sentiment.
umbl | It is the true discrimination between diversion and gen line aspiration which generally precedes the emergence of the capacity to learn.
vc35 | Physical presence is not always real presence.
pjz3 | Mechanical performance of actions and reliance on totemistic objects and slogans, which is in fact what many people do and imagine that they are following a teaching, are forms of attachment to what are or amount to objects. Of course, genuine aspiration is hard to maintain, and it is the falling by the wayside of the people ('the birds') in Fariduddin Attar's classic Mantiq al-Tair, the 'Conference of the Birds', which is caused by their craving this attachment.
xl2e | Even the intellect, as he reminds us in that book, cannot help - only what is called by the Sufis Love; and yet this itself is love of something to which one cannot attach as to a person or even to a familiar concept. Many Sufi practices, carried out in accordance with the right directions, aim at defeating this mechanical ten- dency and awakening the capacity for attachment to the Real.
