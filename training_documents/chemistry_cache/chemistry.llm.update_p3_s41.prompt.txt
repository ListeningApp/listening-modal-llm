You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

b8hf | The largest amount of silver and bromide were determined on the side of the membrane in contact with Ag substrate, whereas for the other side, mainly bromide and potassium signals were detected.
hntf | If the reference membranes were placed directly on GC or Au substrate, unpredictable and unstable potential values were recorded (see Table S-2).
99fo | 4. EIS Spectra for Electrodes with REF-Br Membranes Deposited on Silver or Nonsilver Substrate. The influence of the Ag phase was inspected by electrochemical impedance (EIS).
y5r7 | A striking difference in the impedance spectra for electrodes with reference membranes deposited on Ag substrate or nonsilver substrate was observed. Namely, the difference is manifested by a disappearance of a low-frequency branch for the membranes deposited on Ag substrate which is present if the substrate is a nonsilver one. The EIS results indicate a slower electrochemical process rate in the membrane without dispersed Ag. The appearance of Warburg type behavior at lower frequencies can be attributed to a slower ion-transport in the membrane. It can be hypothesized that dispersed silver facilitates the overall electrochemical process.
lrry | The EIS spectra illustrating this effect, recorded for electrodes with REF-Br-photo membranes deposited on a bare GC substrate and for the GC substrate covered with Ag are presented in Figure S-2.
hvhm | 5. Mechanism of the Br-REF Response. Undoubtedly, the fact that the metallic silver, both as the layer on the substrate and in the form of dispersed nanosilver in the membrane, significantly contribute to stabilizing the potential of the REF-Br systems is of general importance to solid contact
863b | ion-sensor technology with heterogeneous membranes. The composite-like heterogeneous membrane serves as the reservoir of Ag, AgBr, KBr, and respective silver bromide complexes. The coexistence of these three solid phases coupled through the contact with the respective ions (silver, potassium bromoar- gentate, and bromide ions) saturating pores and slow electrolyte outflow from the membrane is the prerequisite of the stability observed. Interestingly, the mean standard potential of the REF-Br electrodes (-157 mV vs Ag/AgCl/3 M KCI (Eº = +210 mV vs NHE)) indicates that the composite reference electrode works as the analogue of the Ag/AgBr reference electrode immersed in the heterogeneous membrane, which plays the role of a stable electrolyte bridge. The bridge provides a stable electrochemical matrix, in respect to the coexistence of the phases, ion concentrations, single ion diffusion, and activity coefficients. Generalized mathematical interpretation which reduces potential stability of the REF-Br electrodes to the fundamental Gibbs' Phase Rule and Eº set by Ag+/Ag redox pair will be provided by the authors in a separate paper.
fj24 | From the technical perspective, though, the system in focus is sufficiently attractive to be of choice in different analytical applications as shown below.
uz3c | 6. Calibration of the REF-Br Electrodes in KBr and MX Solutions. A crucial question regarding the conceptual and analytical validity of the REF-Br is their insensitivity toward bromides. Figure 3 shows the potential changes of the five
d5bi | electrodes with REF-Br-photo membranes as well as Br-ISE recorded during calibration with KBr solution. A striking difference provides direct proof of the invention reported.
ba4l | Negligible potential changes were observed for electrodes with REF-Br-nano, REF-Br-QB, and REF-Br-photo reference membranes during up-down-up as well as down-up-down calibrations in KCI solutions with concentration ranging from 1 M up to 10-5 M. As an example, the potential values measured during up-down-up calibration are presented in Table S-3. Similar results were also obtained during calibration in LiCl, NaCl, KBr, KNO3, and CaCl2 solutions. The influence of lipophilic ions was also checked using the representative perchlorate ion. No statistically significant effect was observed between the calibrations performed in chloride and perchlorate salts, see Figures S-3 and S-4.
ffx8 | 7. Redox Sensitivity of the Electrodes with REF-Br Membranes. The presence of elemental silver can induce undesirable redox sensitivity of the REF-Br membranes. Therefore, all the membranes were studied in the calibration using the mixture of K3[Fe(CN)6]/ K[Fe(CN)6] with total concentration 0.01 M but different molar ratios. Before and after redox calibration, additional measurements in 2 M KBr were performed to check the potential stability. The redox insensitivity was proved for all the REF-Br membranes and different substrates, as shown in Table S-4. The redox effect was not observed as well in the solutions saturated with O2, CO2, and Ar (Figure S-5).
s6su | 8. Potential Stability of the REF-Br Electrodes during Prolonged Contact with Deionized Water. For every reference electrode, the test of its behavior in water is most challenging and analytically relevant. For this reason, all the electrodes equipped with REF-Br-nano, REF-Br-QB, or REF- Br-photo reference membranes were tested in deionized water. After a due period of soaking, the potential of the REF-Br electrodes was measured for 10 min versus the commercial silver chloride reference electrode (Metrohm). A very good potential stability was observed, and the potentials measured were practically invariant at least for several hours of contact with water (or even up to a few days for some of the electrodes). The results are summarized in Table S-5.
y219 | 9. Multisolution Calibration Experiment. To judge the performance of the reference electrodes in real analysis, a multisolution calibration was carried out following the protocol shown by Mousavi et al.15 The potential of the electrodes with REF-Br-nano, REF-Br-QB, and REF-Br-photo reference membranes was measured in several solutions to check the influence of ion concentration, pH and ion mobility. The potential in each solution was recorded for 10 min. After each test, the electrodes were rinsed with deionized water and immersed in the subsequent solution. The exemplary results obtained for electrodes with REF-Br-photo reference mem- branes deposited on Ag substrates and the potential values measured at the end of each 10 min period are shown in Figures 4 and S-6 and collected in Table S-6.
06ht | 10. Influence of pH: Potential Stability of the Electrodes with REF-Br Reference Membranes during Acid-Base Titration. To check the pH influence on the potential of the reference electrodes, the REF-Br-photo reference membranes and pH-ISE were employed in the titration of 1 mL of 0.1 M NaOH with 0.1 M HCl, Figure 5. As required, both reference membranes are insensitive to pH changes in the course of the titration performed.
v3r2 | 11. Performance of the Microcell with REF-Br Reference and Potassium-Ion Selective Electrodes. In this measurement, a homemade multielectrode platform with a body made of epoxy resin was used. The platform contained five gold wire electrodes (Au 99.99 obtained from Johnson Matthey Company) with a diameter of 0.8 mm. The external diameter of the epoxy body was 8 mm.27-29 All the gold discs were electrochemically covered with silver, and the REF-Br- photo membranes and potassium-selective membranes were deposited by solution cast on selected discs. Negligible potential changes were recorded for both electrodes with REF-Br-photo membranes used and close to theoretical potential changes were recorded for K-ISE, Figure S-7. These results indicate that employing the reference electrodes described here for designing a complete multielectrode microcell is feasible. Moreover, the junctionless REF-Br reference electrode is used in two roles as the external reference electrode and the internal solid-contact of the ion- selective electrode. Interestingly, a similar dual role has been reported by the authors before.30 However, in that case, the same conducting polymer film was employed either as the solid contact or as the electroactive membrane of an ion-selective electrode.
