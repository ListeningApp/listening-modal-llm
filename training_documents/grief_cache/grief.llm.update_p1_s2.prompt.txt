You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

gipz | GRIEF COUNSELING and GRIEF THERAPY FIFTH EDITION
b4wj | A Handbook for the Mental Health Practitioner
5xlt | PREFACE
9bz4 | The idea for this book came out of a series of workshops that I presented at the University of Chicago for mental health professionals who spent 2 days of continuing education time exploring their own loss history as well as learning a model-the task model-for understanding grief, bereavement, and the process of mourning. These workshops began in 1976; they were offered twice a year for groups of 100 and were oversub- scribed each year. Over time we offered such workshops in other parts of the United States. The first edition of the book was published in 1982 and contained much of the material presented at these grief workshops,
yfv2 | The title of the book came out of a lecture that I presented at the University of Florida, Gainesville. I was invited to present the annual Arthur G. Peterson lecture for a large group of mental health profession- als. I titled my lecture "Grief Counseling & Grief Therapy." This was the first time that I had made such a distinction, but it made sense to me and its usefulness has persisted over the years. Grief counseling refers to the interventions counselors make with people recent to a death loss to help facilitate them with the various tasks of mourning. These are people with no apparent bereavement complications. Grief therapy, on the other hand, refers to those techniques and interventions that a pro- fessional makes with persons experiencing one of the complications to the mourning process that keeps grief from progressing to an adequate adaptation for the mourner. Often there are conflicts of separation with the deceased that need to be addressed. This requires more skill, under- standing, and training than doing grief counseling, which can often be facilitated by a skilled friend or family member.
pujl | Do we really need grief counselors? I had asked this question in the first edition of this book 35 years ago and said that I don't believe
3rqe | that we need to establish a new profession of grief counselors. I still believe this. D. M. Reilly (1978), a social worker, says, "We do not neces- sarily need a whole new profession of . . . bereavement counselors. We do need more thought, sensitivity, and activity concerning this issue on the part of the existing professional groups, that is, clergy, funeral direc- tors, family therapists, nurses, social workers, and physicians" (p. 49). To this, Lloyd (1992) adds, "Skills in working with grief and loss remain core essential tools for professionals who are not necessarily specialist counselors" (p. 151). I agree with this. What I want to do in this book is address those of you in these traditional professions who are already in a position to extend care to the bereaved and have the knowledge and skills required to do effective intervention and, in some cases, preven- tive mental health work.
nsi3 | In this fifth edition of Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy, new information is presented throughout the book. Previous information is updated when possible. The world has changed since 1982 when the first edition of this book was published. There are more traumatic events, drills for school shootings, and faraway events that may cause a child's current trauma. There is also the emergence of social media and online resources, all easily accessible by smartphones at any time. Bereavement research and services have tried to keep up with these changes. In the following pages I have tried to present what is current for your consideration so that you, as a mental health professional, can be most effective in your interventions with bereaved children, adults, and families.
nil3 | INTRODUCTION
68a1 | Over the 35 years since the first edition of this book was written, there have been a number of new concepts introduced into the field of grief, loss, and bereavement. Before we get into the content of this current edition, I would like to highlight some that I believe are worth noting. Many of these appeared during the past 20 years, and some of these I discuss in more detail in the book. Although tempted to put these into the top 10 in order of importance, I will merely list them. They are all important.
seik | SOCIAL MEDIA AND ONLINE RESOURCES
oq7c | One emerging trend is the use of social media and other online resources to help people who are grieving. These cyber mourning resources can be used (a) as ways to remember the deceased, (b) as ways to conduct intervention for the bereaved, and (c) as a way to do further research on bereavement and the mourning process (Stroebe, van der Houwen, & Schut, 2008). Let me outline several ways that social media and online resources are currently being used.
z4mi | 1. Online memorials. Families, friends, and others can go online and post thoughts about the deceased and send condolences to the family and friends of the deceased. These memorial pages are often set up by the funeral director who served the family or by non-funeral-related groups such as Open to Hope (www. opentohope.com) or nonprofit organizations such as Heal
hkft | Grief (www.healgrief.org) where individuals can light online memorial candles or post eulogies, memorial art, or photo projects. There are also Facebook Memorial pages that can be used to announce the death or funeral service, post memories, and celebrate the life of the deceased. For some reason, these pages may attract strangers who did not know the deceased but will follow the entries and sometimes post messages (De Groot, 2014).
jai3 | 2. Internet-based intervention. Websites have been set up to offer online treatment for people suffering from various types of losses and diagnoses. Such interventions are conducted by a therapist. These include such conditions as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and prolonged grief disorder. They can also assist people who are experiencing disenfranchised grief from losses that are difficult to talk about, such as a loss during pregnancy or LGBT partner loss. Anonymity that can promote self-disclosure seems to be one of the key attractions for this type of therapy, but this can be fraught with danger. If the patient becomes suicidal or homicidal, it is important that the therapist be able to contact the patient directly and provide direct resources. This type of treatment is not suitable for all patients, and a careful online or telephone-based diagnosis must be made before treatment begins.
p57i | 3. Internet bereavement support groups. These can be found online, and are set up to address special types of losses such as suicide deaths (Feigelman,Gorman, Beal, & Jordan, 2008), while others are established to help those with a general variety of bereavement losses (M. Post, "Grief in the Digital Age" seminar, November 2, 2016). These groups are led, or at least monitored, by professionals who are able to admit or reject people from participation (Paulus & Varga, 2015). Outcome measures can be used pre- and postgroup to measure change due to participation in the group (van der Houwen, Schut, van den Bout, Stroebe, & Stroebe, 2010).
u5ug | 4. Peer-support web pages. Such self-help pages are set up after natural disasters (floods, hurricanes, earthquakes), mass shootings, and other catastrophes, allowing those interacting with the site to express feelings and questions, and to generally feel a part of a community grappling with these events (Miller, 2015). These sites offer no personalized professional feedback. However, they can be particularly effective for helping the person who cannot find help elsewhere (Aho, Paavilainen, & Kaunonen, 2012).
