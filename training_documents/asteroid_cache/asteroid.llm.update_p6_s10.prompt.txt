You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

Conversely, the 4150-Ma merrillite accompanied by tridymite may represent the timing of an intense impact reheating event. The U-Pb systems in the Juvinas pyroxene and plagioclase were also severely disturbed (Galer and Lugmair, 1996). Their 207 Pb-206Pb mineral isochron age was reported at 4320.9 ± 1.7 Ma (Galer and Lugmair, 1996), which may be the result of an incomplete U-Pb reset at a later reheat- ing event (i.e., the 4150-Ma event). The K-Ar system was further disturbed (the 40 Ar-39 Ar age around ~4100-4000 Ma; Kaneoka et al., 1995), implying a weaker event. To summarize, Juvinas likely suffered severe impacts at 4320-4150 Ma and weaker reheating at ~4000 Ma. The metamorphic history of Juvinas can be ex- plained as follows: (i) original crystallization at 4563 Ma, (ii) ther- mal crustal metamorphism and formation of secondary zircons at ~4550 Ma, (iii) closure/reset of the apatite U-Pb system at ~4520 Ma through slow cooling or reheating, (iv) a later reset of the U-Pb system in merrillite <LATEX>a t \sim 4 1 5 0</LATEX> Ma through impact reheat- ing, and (v) a final disturbance of the <LATEX>K - A r</LATEX> system at ~4000 Ma possibly due to a weaker impact.
li1k | The U-Pb systems in the Camel Donga apatite are severely dis- turbed. Even though the mean model <LATEX>2 0 7 p b * / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> age was de- termined to be 4491.4 ± 13.5 Ma, the youngest outlier <LATEX>\left( C m d - 4 \right)</LATEX> recorded an age of <LATEX>4 3 7 2 \pm 2 6 M a</LATEX> (Fig. 4). No apparent cor- relation was observed between the <LATEX>2 0 7 p b * / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> ages and the textural properties of the individual apatite grains (Figs. 2 and S2). The mean age of <LATEX>\sim 4 4 9 0 \quad M a</LATEX> is ~30 Myr younger than the <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } | ^ { 2 0 6 } P b ^ { * }</LATEX> age of the Agoult apatite (4525 Ma; Fig. 4). This time <LATEX>\log \text { of } \sim 3 0 M</LATEX> between Camel Donga and Agoult is similar to the U-Pb systems in their zircons (Table 1: Camel Donga, <LATEX>4 5 3 1 \pm 1 0</LATEX> Ma; Agoult, <LATEX>4 4 5 4 . 5 \pm 2 . 0 M a</LATEX> Zhou et al., 2013; lizuka and oxides (Camel Donga, <LATEX>5 . 4 3 \pm 0 . 4 2 M a</LATEX> Agoult, 4532.39 ± 0.87 Ma; Iizuka et al., 2019). The 4490-Ma apatite is consis- tent with a previous interpretation that Camel Donga resided in a distinct region on the parent body and underwent the thermal metamorphism at crust ~20 Myr later than the other eucrites (lizuka et <LATEX>\left. a l . , 2 0 1 9 \right) .</LATEX> In addition, the presence of young apatite at <LATEX>4 3 7 2 \pm 2 6 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> indicates that there was a distinct reheat- ing event at <LATEX>\sim 4 3 7 0 \quad M a ,</LATEX> which caused an incomplete disturbance of the U-Pb system. Conversely, the <LATEX>4 0 \quad A r - 3 9 \quad A r</LATEX> age in the Camel Donga plagioclase was completely reset at <LATEX>3 7 4 9 \pm 2 5 M a</LATEX> because of an independent impact (Iizuka et al., 2019). This last event at <LATEX>\begin{array}{} { \sim 3 7 5 0 \text { Na } } \\ { \text { thaush th } } \end{array}</LATEX> caused diffusion and brecciation of the host rock, even reheating temperature was not high enough to reset the U-Pb system in the apatite. To summarize, the metamorphic history of Camel Donga can be described as follows: (i) initial crys- tallization at 4564 Ma (Hublet et al., 2017), (ii) high-temperature thermal metamorphism in the crust at 4530 Ma, (iii) subsequent slow cooling until 4490 Ma, (iv) an additional impact causing an incomplete disturbance of the apatite U-Pb system at 4370 Ma, and (v) final impact brecciation at 3750 Ma, where only the K-Ar system was
pbea | The mean <LATEX>\begin{array}{} { \text { eset. } } \\ { 2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / 2 0 6 p b } \end{array}</LATEX> age of the Stannern phosphates also recorded young metamorphism at <LATEX>4 1 4 3 . 0 \pm 1 2 . 5 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> (Fig. 4), sug- gesting that they experienced severe impact reheating at this time. In contrast to Juvinas, both the apatite and merrillite in Stan- nern yielded identical ages. This may be because the host rock of Stannern was reheated more homogeneously to the U-Pb re- set temperature. According to geochemical studies of the trace in- compatible element trends, the geological backgrounds of Stannern and Juvinas should be different, which means that they resided at different locations on Vesta (e.g., Barrat et al., 2007). Their identi- cal reheating ages of ~4150 Ma indicate that there were two (or more) impact events on Vesta during this period, where the re-
