You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

kggw | If We Could Just Join Hands: Led Zeppelin as Supergroup
xrd1 | R ock music's unprecedented international success from the mid- 1960s onward, in terms of economic impact, media notice, and critical respect, was marked by the growing numbers of acts com- prised of members sprung from bands that had already enjoyed some mea- sure of popularity. The term supergroup was first applied to Blind Faith in 1969, made up of Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker of Cream, Steve Winwood of Traffic, and Rick Grech of Family, all of them (especially Cream) with strong histories of record and ticket sales. Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young were another example of the phenomenon (they too debuted in '69), as David Crosby had emerged from the chart-topping Byrds, Graham Nash from the Hollies with their own string of hits ("Bus Stop," "Carrie-Anne"), and Stephen Stills and Neil Young from the Buffalo Springfield ("For What It's Worth"). Later the "supergroup" label was put to various highly successful bands, but it was most accurately employed as a description of ensembles made up of musicians boasting proven backgrounds in the business: Beck, Bogert & Appice; Emerson, Lake and Palmer; Asia; Damn Yankees; the Traveling Wilburys; and so on.
5746 | By some standards, Led Zeppelin was a supergroup, but by most they were not. Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham were all full-time working players when they joined forces in 1968; Page and Jones had established solid reputations as session men, and Page had been a member of the world-touring Yardbirds; Plant had recorded and released songs under the CBS label; and by '68 Bonham was drumming for the rising star Tim Rose as well as catching the ears of other comers such as Joe Cocker and Chris Farlowe. The 1968 Atlantic Records press release that announced the label's signing of Led Zeppelin boasted that the group "consists of four of the most exciting musicians performing in Britain today," portraying Plant as "one of England's outstanding young

j346 | blues singers" and claiming that Bonham "caused a sensation with his drum solos." In contrast to previous generations of rock 'n' roll groups, Zeppelin were not a gang of teenage friends who'd worked their way up together playing dances, parties, and clubs in their home town-they were adult veterans signed on into serious performing and recording commitments from the start, and they were expected to deliver.
v8uq | On the other hand, of all the men of Led Zeppelin only Page had been connected to a truly successful act, and it was his link to the Yardbirds that was put front and center in the group's earliest publicity handouts. Though Jones would certainly have continued to have an access to the higher levels of music production and management had Zeppelin not taken off, and though Plant and Bonham might have eventually found their own footings in the British music scene had Page taken on Terry Reid and B. J. Wilson as vocalist and drummer, respectively, none of them would have had the star factor of genuine supergroup recruits. If anything, it was generous of Page and Peter Grant not to extract a Jimmy Page Group or a Jimmy Page and the Mad Dogs out of the defunct Yardbirds, although in the long run the equal billing would give the foursome more credibility. Groomed to be a lucra- tive project of seasoned experts, Zeppelin nevertheless can't be properly put into the supergroup category. Surviving members have been involved in supergroups, though: Jones in Them Crooked Vultures, alongside Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age and Dave Grohl of Nirvana and the Foo Fighters, and Page in the Firm, with Paul Rodgers of Bad Company.
x972 | Have You Heard the News: Led Zeppelin as "Hype Band"
cwrw | Just as Zeppelin's "supergroup" status may be confused by Page and Peter Grant's registering their music publishing company as "Superhype," so did the name virtually invite accusations that the band itself was no more than a product of corporate manipulation and capitalist greed. The charge is not without foundation, but neither is the way Led Zeppelin conclusively disproved it.
4i0e | Following the watershed impact of Sgt. Pepper and the groundbreaking attractions of Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the record industry of 1968-69 had begun to codify some of the market trends observable during the era. Albums could be as lucrative as singles; artists didn't need Top 40 hits to draw a steady audience; blues-based, improvisatory electric guitar workouts were followed reverently by college-age fans; sexual, chemi- cal, or other countercultural references in the music and on the record covers could be more and more overt; talking up the "mind-blowing" poten- tial of new acts was a valid sales strategy. Atlantic Records took all these into
h2l3 | But in the Long Run
dfzb | account when signing Led Zeppelin in 1968 for a trade-headline-grabbing $220,000, a huge amount at the time and a sum few new acts have been granted since. With Cream disbanding and Jimi Hendrix, Iron Butterfly, Fleetwood Mac, the Who, and Vanilla Fudge more than demonstrating the continuing appeal of their heavy rock formula, Zeppelin looked and sounded like a good investment.
u6ty | From the point of view of many punters, however, and certainly of many of the youthful reviewers writing for US rock magazines like Rolling Stone, Creem, and Crawdaddy, Led Zeppelin seemed to be a calculated ploy-a deliberately packaged band whose sound and style were designed to resemble those of a roster of famous acts, touted in the pseudo-groovy language that was even then creeping into the lexicon of Wall Street, Madison Avenue, and Hollywood. The aforementioned Atlantic press release, ascribed to Bob Rolontz of the label, told of the "hot new group" whose "pulsations" had caught the ears of "top English and American rock musicians," prompting comparisons "to the best of Cream and Hendrix." "Led Zeppelin is the eighth British group to be signed by Atlantic during the past 24 months," the statement closed. "The others are Cream, Bee Gees, Julie Driscoll-Brian Auger & The Trinity, The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, The Marbles, The Magic Lanterns, and Jimmy James & The Vagabonds." Oh yes, the incomparable Marbles and Magic Lanterns. Led Zeppelin's first promotional flyers and zeppelin-shaped giveaway balloons were replete with slogans like "The Only Way to Fly," "Isn't that a gas!" and "Led Zeppelin 2 . . . Now Flying!"
awvu | This was all hype-PR efforts to stimulate interest in a fresh act Atlantic Records had already wagered a lot of money on and which had to earn its keep. Around this time other big entertainment companies had tried to push the countercultural authenticity of their artists or movies and were met with suspicion by the hip youth market. There was MGM's "Bosstown Sound" attempts to sell Boston-based bands like Ultimate Spinach, Kangaroo, and Chameleon Church, all of whom flopped; ditto "now" Hollywood films like Getting Straight and Zabriskie Point, attempting to cash in on 1967's blockbusting The Graduate and 1969's Easy Rider. In this climate, given the kind of promo motifs used to introduce Led Zeppelin to North America, listeners had a right to be skeptical. An early Creem review called the band "only redone joplinshake heavybody drughendrix," while Rolling Stone dismissed the premier Led Zeppelin album as a template taken up in "the aftermath era of such successful British bluesmen as Cream and John Mayall."

h27a | as an attempt to show how wrong the "hype" slander was. The untitled album usually designated Led Zeppelin IVwas Jimmy Page's bid to refute any notion that it was the hype itself that drew fans: "We wanted to demonstrate that it was the music that made Zeppelin popular; it had nothing to do with our name or image." Ultimately they succeeded in winning over the rock intelligentsia through a respectably consistent career of albums and concerts, but their initial backing by a powerful media company, brag- ging of the potential they had yet to realize (let alone exceed), was not an uncommon problem for artists in the late 1960s. "All that stuff about us being a hyped band . .. ," John Paul Jones has reflected. "That didn't help us early on." The point is not that Zeppelin were not enthusiastically pitched by Atlantic Records and its field agents-they were-but that for once the act was worthy of the enthusiasm. Whenever salesmen have tried to plug a cool new product to a cohort resistant to the very notions of salesmen and products, red flags are raised (similar populist scorn greeted many of the post-Nirvana "grunge" acts signed out of Seattle in the early 1990s). Truly, every mass-marketed assembly of musicians, from the Texas Playboys and the Ink Spots to U2 and Public Enemy, has been a "hype band," even the ones that catered to the audience's conceits of integrity and independence. Insofar as Led Zeppelin was hyped, the gambit was one that backfired, and the group ended up having to make its case through music alone-which it more than did.
pdjh | I Don't Know, But I've Been Told: Led Zeppelin as Heavy Metal
xmgs | As late as the 1983 Rolling Stone review of Coda, Led Zeppelin was praised as "the greatest heavy metal band that ever strutted the boards." Around the same time they were included with other "Great Heavy Metal Bands" in The Book of Rock Lists, alongside Thin Lizzy, Uriah Heep, Blue Cheer, Grand Funk Railroad, and AC/DC, and a 1982 Hit Parader article titled "Heavy Metal: The Hall of Fame" decreed that "[quite simply, Led Zeppelin is, was, and will always be the ultimate heavy metal masters." The tag was stuck on the band early in their working life and they were saddled with it through the 1970s and beyond. Rock critics such as Dave Marsh and Lester Bangs included Zeppelin in their own definitions of the genre, and the average high school fan of 1974 would likely have classified the group's music as heavy metal. One Zeppelin tune, "Trampled Underfoot," actually uses the term in its lyrics, albeit as an automotive pun. Sociologist Donna Gaines's Teenage Wasteland: Suburbia's Dead End Kids (1991) reported on the alienation and aggression of the adolescent heavy metal cliques she interviewed in

m047 | New Jersey, calling them "The Children of Zoso," after Jimmy Page's runic signature from Led Zeppelin IV. Even today, few scholarly or popular studies of heavy metal as a social or musical subculture will fail to mention the centrality of Led Zeppelin.
gy8c | This would not be such an issue if the members of Zeppelin themselves were not disappointed to be put into the company of Grand Funk Railroad and their ilk. "There was nothing heavy about that at all," Robert Plant said of the Led Zeppelin album in Musician magazine. "It was ethereal." To the New York Post in 1988 he also dismissed most of Zeppelin's imitators: "It's mindless, it's not a reflection of something sociological. I don't think Zeppelin was their inspiration-Tiny Tim was. .. . But this is some kind of demented dwarf giving strange hand signals as he walks out of a volcano onstage. It's tacky." Plant later told writer Chuck Klosterman that John Bonham had described acts like "Deep Sabbath" as "a conglomerate of English, sketchy, blues-based thud. . . . It was inane and no mystery to it at all." The other survivors, Jones and Page, have made equally distancing remarks about the band's relationship to the heavy metal format, Page pointing out the lack of "light and shade" dynamics in competitors like Black Sabbath, and Jones sneering at the "glowering, Satanic crap" of most metal acts. Page was quoted as saying, "I can't relate [the heavy metal term] to us because the thing that comes to mind when people say heavy metal is riff-bashing, and I don't think we ever just did riff-bashing at any point." "No one ever compared us to Black Sabbath after this record," was the bassist's blunt conclusion of Led Zeppelin IV's impact. Yet even pundits who concede "Zep was always too arty and eclectic to be considered a real metal band" (Guitar World's "Top 50 Heavy Metal Albums") allow that "[f]or sheer power chord mania and horny, guttural hoo-ha, it doesn't get any better than 'Whole Lotta Love' or 'Heartbreaker.'"
y4mj | Jimmy Page and his bandmates were not alone in rejecting whatever pigeonhole they were consigned to. Most rock musicians at some point have complained about industry or critical simplifications of their work, a protest which usually tends to enforce their reputations all the more. "You cannot classify anything," Plant avowed to Chuck Klosterman. "Classification is a killer." Most artists in any medium, indeed, will resist being slotted into some or other stereotype, saying that their work is only their self-expression and that any generalization will miss the personal subtleties they try to impart to it; yet the defense of artistic freedom on the part of the creator is about as predictable as the inclination to format and sort on the part of the spectator or listener. As Led Zeppelin's players sought to demonstrate that they had more to offer than the one-dimensional boogie of Grand Funk-Led Zeppelin III was an early example of this-professional and

ousl | amateur audiences strained to define their songs as something, and heavy metal was still the handiest option.
