You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

y04s | A: If there is any, it is this: serious people are prepared to start at the beginning and go a step at a time, to 'start the jour- ney of a thousand miles with one single step'; people who are not serious are looking for miracles and stimuli and 'advanced work'.
3n8m | Q: What produces, and what sustains, this unsuitability ?
caum | A: Vanity, which is why most systems require humility.
npun | Q: If most systems require this, why does it not work?
rj3c | A: Because most systems end up by making imagined humility into a form of vanity, so they end up with vanity just the same.
5rgk | You can perceive a person's aspiration if it is genuine, because this creates a change in the emanations from such a person.
xf8w | USELESS PRAYER
565e | Omar Khayyam said:
w4zl | They went, and none returned again
vav7 | To tell you the telling of that beyond
o1cs | You won't gain anything through automatic prayer
adhe | Prayer is worthless without sincerity and true aspiration.
bbzd | This second question, about unsuitability, interests me rather more than the first, about 'Quick, rule-of-thumb methods.' Has the enquirer ever asked himself what he could do with such a method?
xhrf | Q: But surely prayer, properly carried out, can prepare for proper learning?
zkpf | A: 'Properly learned' is the operative phrase. People who pray and who do not attend to the necessary change in themselves as its basis, are not the same as those who really do pray. People who pray have to be altered by prayer, and this alteration is partly manifested in their behaviour and temperament.
atab | Many Sufi teachers have insisted that disciples observe psycho- logical and social development before even allowing them to pray, or, at least, before acknowledging that they are capable of effec- tive prayer. Khwaja Muinuddin Gharib Nawaz Chishti actually equates prayer with right thought and right action on the ordinary human level:
j9tq | 'Prayer consists,' he said, 'in hearing the complaints of the aggrieved and to assist them; to help the needy and the oppressed; to feed the people and to set free the captives from captivity. All these things, Gharib-Nawaz emphasised, are of great importance .**
fvqy | When Criticism can Stop
vfqb | Q: When do people stop criticising what others are doing?
we1w | A: When Jalaludin Rumi started to recite his couplets of wis- dom, it is reported, people had not had enough time to form any opinion of him.
k81g | Some were interested, some were not. Others, following an in- evitable human pattern, resented him. They said: 'We hope that you do not think that you are a second Aesop or something.'
k2jg | WESTERN SAGE
jhhg | According to one sage of the West, criticism has to go through these stages: -
g8qm | 1. It is impossible
t3iv | 2. It is possible, but it is useless
4psv | 3. It is useful, but I knew about it all the time.
jm2w | Criticism can then stop.
yilw | THE SICK MAN WHO CURSED
g67e | Enduring the criticism of others may be part of doing good to them. You can read in The Boston of Saadi the story of the sick man whom the great Sufi Maaruf of Karkh was helping. He cursed Maaruf, whose wife asked him why he continued to serve one who was so ungrateful.
anld | Maaruf answered that this patience was part of the help for the sick: the patient, he had observed, could not find rest until after he had been allowed to vent his wrath.
27s7 | I am not myself much interested in the stopping of criticism. How about interesting oneself in improving the quality of critic-
8j2x | ism; so that it can be more useful? Much of it is so bad that even undesirable things criticised are not effectively criticised, especially when the critic shows his spleen or bias instead of be- ing constructive.
l5gt | Sheikh Abdullah Ansari, of Herat, the great Sufi teacher, has rightly said:
relm | The evil of another person can be averted:
xr8d | There is no escape from one's own ...
rd18 | Information and Experience
kdwe | Q: Why do you stress the importance of information as well as of experience?
efmr | A: There is a saying that, according to what a person's men- tality is, even an angel may seem to him to have a devil's face.
goxa | It is also useful to note that whereas an angel may seem to have a devil's face, and a devil an angel's face, there are other forms of this complaint.
kxhc | INFORMATIONBEFORE OPINION
tlbz | People tend to form opinions about people, things and ideas, only on the basis of the information and prejudice which they already have. If you show, say, a camera to a child or a primitive man, he might think that it was a monster.
zfbe | What people need is information, more often than they realise. This is the reason why generations of Sufis have laboured to broaden the basis of information and experience available to man. With information and experience, man may make more reliable judgments about people, ideas and things. The less information he has, the less likely he is to be able to understand. To try to teach anyone who is in a condition of insufficient information is futile, never attempted by real teachers, and wasteful of time and energy to both parties.
92nl | INSTITUTION WITHOUT INSIGHT
ol2n | 'Halls and colleges and learned discourses and porch and arch, says Hafiz, 'what advantage are they when the wise heart and seeing eye are absent?' And to make real sense of experience, information must be there as well.
5ho2 | The Teaching is a Matter of Conduct
1u6m | Q: Can people pursue a form of study in Sufism without being trained and constandy stimulated, as they are in all systems which I have examined?
oe9t | A: This famous saying from our tradition repays the closest possible attention: 'The Teaching is a matter of Conduct'.
29gd | By acting in a certain manner, a person may be able to give the impression that he is enlightened, studious, worthwhile, valuable or many other impressive things. All teachings, in their lower ranges, seek to teach people to adopt acceptable conduct and behaviour.
tkgd | CONDUCT, HERE, DOES NOT MEAN CONFORMISM
zazs | Because of this emphasis upon conduct, misunderstandings arise very easily. People come to imagine that if they seem to be con- forming, they are acceptable, or that they are progressing.
yuw3 | The fact is, of course, that conformism is a part of the civilising of people. If they conform to the rules of the culture which sur- rounds them, larger numbers of people can associate together more easily. Strife is generally reduced. Communication between people becomes possible when, for instance, they are not all talking at once.
yoa7 | It may be necessary to conform to certain kinds of expected behaviour in order to learn something. But when this conformism becomes the only, or major, characteristic of the people, the teaching has stopped taking effect. Instead of learning, we have practice: practice of conformism.
4c4x | Conformism has two possible evils: (i) that people will mistake it for 'higher' behaviour; (2) that people will believe that all they have to do is to appear to conform, and that as a consequence they will get 'a place in Heaven'.
iil3 | We are all familiar with human systems in which either or both
sizo | of these deteriorations are evident. They are so persistent, indeed, that conformism may be taken as the outward mark of organisa- tion. But not only need this not be so: it may be positively dangerous to the potential function of the group.
4z4z | Then why do we say 'The Teaching is a Matter of Conduct'?
gdvl | KNOWLEDGE AND ACTION ARE RELATED
0rbh | First, because when a form of conduct is laid down in the Teach- ing, whether it be doing a task or carrying out a study or exercise, the relationship between mental 'set' and bodily action is specific. It helps the exercise or undertaking to operate correctly.
