        "content": "dqlg | Music and its admirers were ever contemned by him and Swift; but, having neither taste nor judgment in this art, they were surely unqualified to censure it. Few conquerors ever aimed at universal monarchy, compared with the number of authors who have wished to be thought possessed of universal knowledge; and yet these great writers, who discover, in what is within their competence, a vigour of mind, and elevation of genius, which inclines mankind to regard them as beings of a superior order, whenever they hope by the power\np6pq | A GENERAL HISTORY OF MUSIC\nzse6 | of thinking to supply the place of knowledge, discover an imbecillity, which degrades them into common characters.\np2n3 | I will not, however, over-rate musical sensations so far as to say, with the poet, that the man who cannot enjoy them \" is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils\"; there being, perhaps, among mankind, as many persons of bad hearts that are possessed of a love and genius for music, as there are of good, that have neither talents nor feeling for it: but I will venture to say, that it has been admired and cultivated by great and eminent persons at all times and in every country, where arts have been cherished; and though there may be no particular connection between correctness of ear, and rectitude of mind, yet, without the least hyperbole it may be said, that, ceteris paribus, the man who is capable of being affected by sweet sounds, is a being more perfectly organized, than he who is insensible to, or offended by them.\nohh7 | But, as the Constable in Much ado about Nothing says, \"these are gifts which God gives,\" and lovers of music should be content with their own superior happiness, and not take offence at others for enjoying less pleasure than themselves. However, it is no uncommon thing for the rich to treat the poor with as much insolence, as if it were a crime not to be born to a great estate; yet, on the other hand, to be proud of beggary and want, is too ridiculous for censure.\nvbni | With respect to the present work, there may, perhaps, be many readers who wish and expect to find in it a deep and well-digested treatise on the theory and practice of music: whilst others, less eager after such information, will be seeking for mere amusement in the narrative. I wish it had been in my plan and power fully to satisfy either party; but a history is neither a body of laws nor a novel. I have blended together theory and practice, facts and explanations, incidents, causes, consequences, conjectures, and confessions of ignorance, just as the subject produced them. Many new materials concerning the art of Music in the remote times of which this volume treats, can hardly be expected. The collecting into one point the most interesting circumstances relative to its practice and professors; its connection with religion; with war; with the stage; with public festivals, and private amusements, have principally employed me: and as the historian of a great and powerful empire marks its limits and resources; its acquisitions and losses; its enemies and allies; I have endeavoured to point out the boundaries of music, and its influence on our passions; its early subservience to poetry, its setting up a separate interest, and afterwards aiming at independence; the heroes who have fought its battles, and the victories they have obtained.\ndgcw | If the titles of my chapters should appear too general and miscellaneous, and the divisions and sections of my work too few; if method and minute exactness in the distribution of its several subjects and parts should seem wanting; the whole is, perhaps, the more likely to be read for these deficiencies; for a history, of\ngvwz | PREFACE\nsk5m | which the contents are symmetrically digested, separated by chapters, and subdivided into sections, may be easily consulted, but is no more likely to be read throughout, than a dictionary.\nqws8 | My subject has been so often deformed by unskilled writers, that many readers, even among those who love and understand music, are afraid of it. My wish, therefore, is not to be approached with awe and reverence for my depth and erudition, but to bring on a familiar acquaintance with them, by talking in common language of what has hitherto worn the face of gloom and mystery, and been too much \"sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought\"; and though the mixing biographical anecdotes, in order to engage attention, may by some be condemned, as below the dignity of science, yet I would rather be pronounced trivial than tiresome; for Music being, at best, but an amusement, its history merits not, in reading, the labour of intense application, which should be reserved for more grave and important concerns.\n877u | I have never, from a vain display of erudition, loaded my page with Greek; on the contrary, unless some disputable point seemed to render it necessary, or the passage was both remarkable and short, I have industriously avoided it, by referring my learned readers to the original text. The modesty of citation may, however, be carried to excess; for quotations of remarkable passages are very amusing and satisfactory to learned readers, and often prevent suspicions of misrepresentation. There is no pedantry in a margin; and the ancients are perhaps never so entertaining as in the fragment way of quotation. As I pretend not to such a profound and critical knowledge in the Greek language as to depend entirely upon myself, in obscure and contested passages, I have, when such occurred, generally had recourse to the labours of the best translators and commentators, or the counsel of a learned friend. And here, in order to satisfy the sentiments of friendship, as well as those of gratitude, I must publicly acknowledge my obligations to the zeal, intelligence, taste, and erudition of the reverend Mr. Twining; a gentleman whose least merit is being perfectly acquainted with every branch of theoretical and practical music.\nrzhj | As ancient Greek Music had its technical terms, as well as the modern Italian, with which many excellent scholars and translators from that language, for want of an acquaintance with Music, and Greek musical writers, have been utter strangers, I may venture to observe that I have tried, and I hope not always without success, to trace these terms in ancient authors, in order to discover their original acceptation.\nbfax | It would be a false, and perhaps offensive modesty, if I were here to trouble the reader with apologies for the length and frequency of quotations from the Iliad and Odyssey, and other ancient poets besides Homer; as it will be shown, that history has no other materials to work upon in times of high antiquity, than those poems, which have always been regarded as historical; prose\nf2y8 | A GENERAL HISTORY OF MUSIC\no7qm | compositions having been utterly unknown in Greece for three hundred years after most of them were written.\nd52l | I have never had recourse to conjecture, when facts were to be found. In the historical and biographical parts, I have asserted nothing without vouchers; and I have made the ancients tell their own story as often as was possible, without disputing with them the knowledge of their own history, as many moderns have done; for I cannot help supposing them to have been full as well acquainted with their own affairs two thousand years ago, as we are at present. An ancient Greek might, with almost equal propriety, have pretended to foretell what we should be, at the distance of two thousand years, as we determine now what they then were.",
