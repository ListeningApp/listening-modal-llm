You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

sc5y | In sum, the Netherlands initially took an opposite reform trajectory than Norway in the 1990s, with a move to NPG for PES instead of Norway with a more traditional administration (TPA) combined with a principal-agent model (NPM). In the next decade, both countries switched their system in opposite directions, with the SUWI reform in 2002 (TPA/NPM) and the NAV reform in 2006 (NPG). Reform in both countries thus shows major divergence, both over time and between the two nations. Since 2008, we have seen more convergence as both nations have adopted (or extended) NPM to increase efficiency. Subsequent convergence is also visible in reforms (2015) for decentralization and street-level professionalism (NPG); and most recently in recentralization and standardization (NPM) alongside a continued push for collaborative, person-centred services (NPG). So there is growing hybridity, but not necessarily more balance in welfare state governance.
0yab | Divergence between Norway and the Netherlands in the current welfare administrations
w95z | Despite growing convergence in reform trends over the past 15 years, there is significant divergence between the current two welfare administrations. We focus here on two key themes:
0i1k | the relationship between central and decentralized governance (levels) and the role and position of key stakeholders (clients, social partners).
dqlg | Divergence in the relationship between governance levels (see Table 3)
p6pq | At the ministry level in Norway, both the state and the municipal part of NAV are the responsibility of Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion. From the establishment of NAV in 2006, there were 456 local/regional offices, small and large. NAV consists of two hierarchies: 1) a state hierarchy of the directorate (national agency), regional offices and frontline offices, governed hierarchically, by instructions (although with a certain level of local autonomy), 2) a relationship from the national level (the directorate), via supervision authorities at the regional level inspecting that municipalities fill their legal obligation to provide social services to the citizens. Cooperation at the local level can be voluntarily extended with other municipal social services, for example social housing, dept counselling, or for integration of newly arrived
zse6 | municipal services such as services for people with problems on (mental) health and drugs abuse.
p2n3 | The NAV governance system is complicated in more ways: The regional offices (at the provincial level) are only "state" offices, with no role for municipalities. Also, the NAV directorate is both the highest management (of employment services and national insurances) with instructional authority, and supervisor (of municipal social services) but without instructional authority.4 As a result of mergers between municipalities and formalized cooperation between many NAV offices, the number of first-line offices was reduced to 268 since 2020, with a simultaneous increase in scale to enable more "robust", professional offices. This will probably result in more internal specialization and less voice for the municipalities.
ohh7 | Table 3 Central and decentralized governance in two welfare administrations
vbni | The Dutch welfare administration is managed differently, but the relationship between levels of government is just as complicated. Unlike the NAV, the national state agency UWV and the 342 Dutch municipalities (2023) are separate public agencies. There is a split in regulation, clients and tasks: UWV is responsible for social benefits and employment services to the insured population of unemployed and disabled. Municipalities are responsible for social assistance and related services to the unemployed without acquired rights for insurance based benefits or other income means (partner income, savings, house etc.). As a national executive agency, UWV is governed within ministerial authority (but with a certain leeway). But municipalities have formal autonomy, even though many tasks are delegated and financed by the central state. The UWV and municipalities in 35 labour market regions are obliged to
dgcw | cooperate with social partners for the Jobs Agreement Act 2015 (and for regional labour market projects subsidized by national government), but neither the central level nor the local government (or social partners) have instructional authority and they will all have to arrive at shared goals and decisions.
gvwz | Divergence between Norway and Netherlands in relationships with key stakeholders (Table 4) Increasingly the NAV offices are serving clients with reduced work capacity (not only caused by health conditions). Contact between jobseekers and employers is digitised and based on self- service. Retirement pension is digitised, so is income security under parental leave. Related to the NAV reform, the Directorate established "user councils" at the central, regional, and local level with members representing associations of clients as well as the employers (although not particularly well-functioning at the local level). New mandates for the councils were given in 2015. At the central level, the council is now described as a collaborative forum and an advisory body.
sk5m | The Dutch UWV is serving only the insured clients with a work history. Contact between jobseekers and UWV is digitised and based on self-service, with face-to-face contact especially for the 'hard-to-place'. Municipalities serve clients on social assistance. With the SUWI reform, the Ministry established "user councils" at the central and local level with members representing associations of clients. Municipalities also have client councils, often volunteers. At the central level, the client council (LCR) is described as an advisory body. They are only asked for advice by the government on policy implementation, not on policy or legislation itself.
qws8 | Table 4 Welfare administrations: Relationships with clients and partners
877u | In Norway, social partners do not have a governing role in the welfare administration for long now. Before 1999 the Directorate of labour had a board with members of the social partners; in 1999 this board was replaced by an advisory council, with additional employer and employee associations. The ministry argued that this was in compliance with the ILO obligations. From 2004 the Ministry has had a council for labour market and pension policy with social partners as members. Another kind of involvement of the social partners is the steady progress of so- called tripartite agreements on a more inclusive working life (the first concluded in 2001), aimed at preventing and reducing absenteeism and withdrawal from working life, previously also at the inclusion of people with disabilities and other groups outside the labour market. The latter goal has been removed from the agreement and replaced by a so-called "Inkluderingsdugnad" - a type of voluntary joint effort, introduced in 2018.
rzhj | In the Netherlands, before 2002, social partners had a strong governing role in the welfare administration. With the SUWI reform, the social partners lost all their power in the executive
bfax | bodies of social benefits and the PES, which was a major shock in the Dutch corporatist landscape. The former governing role of the social partners in social benefits was moved to a national state agency (UWV) and their major role in the PES board was 'replaced' by an advisory body (the Council for Work and Income, 2002-2012). In 2013, the social partners reached a so called "social agreement" with the government, including a Jobs Agreement for people with (physical/mental) disabilities. In 2015, this led to a certain return of social partners in the governance of the Dutch welfare administration, as members of the Central and Regional Work Chambers of the 35 Dutch labour market regions. Despite this role, their current position is much less direct and powerful than it was before 2002.
f2y8 | In short, divergence between current systems is expressed for both 'levels' and 'stakeholders'. Compared to the Netherlands, the Norwegian system has a much stronger degree of (compulsory) cooperation between the state and the municipalities (levels). However, the role of the social partners in the governance of the activation policy is stronger in the Netherlands. Clients are represented in advisory bodies in both countries, without a direct governing role.
