You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ojro | De-extinction
l6t9 | What should be done after extinctions have already occurred? Besides more conventional species conservation practices, there is a broader discussion on the ethics of developing and using biotech- nologies for conservation purposes and beyond (Ehrenfeld, 2006; Basl and Sandler, 2013; Kaebnick and Murray, 2013; Oksanen and Siipi, 2014; Preston, 2018). Setting these larger concerns aside, more technology-focused conservation approaches - if justifiable in cer- tain cases - should be seen as complementary rather than alterna- tives to conventional conservation practices (Sandler, 2021b). Accordingly, the subject of debate concerns whether there are certain cases where such technological means are appropriate and desirable at all.
1ujy | For example, a topic that has recently been gaining attention is the evaluation of the possibility of engineering species (via gene drives, cloning, etc.) either with the purpose of avoiding their extinction, such as by genetically adapting them to new climatic conditions or by increasing the genetic diversity of a population (see discussions by Palmer, 2016; Rohwer, 2018; Sandler, 2019; Preston, 2021; Sandler, 2021b; Welchman, 2021), or as means to eradicate invasive species (Thresher, 2022).
qzor | Related to proposals in favour (or critiques) of altering species to avoid (or cause) their extinction, a second body of work focuses on how and whether methods such as back-breeding, cross-species cloning and genetic engineering can be employed to appropriately address extinctions once they have occurred. Thus, the possibility of de-extinction by bringing a species 'back' from extinction has captured the imagination of many environmental philosophers (amongst many others, see Cohen, 2014; Oksanen and Siipi, 2014; Turner, 2014; Diehm, 2015; Minteer, 2015; Campbell and Whittle, 2017; Kasperbauer, 2017; Oksanen and Vuorisalo, 2017; Sandler, 2017; Browning, 2018; Preston, 2018; Katz, 2022; Sandler et al., 2022; for an alternative narrative, see also Odenbaugh's, 2023 recent review of the ethics of de-extinction).
a0by | This topic has become the centre of a lively debate in the ethics of extinction, which is noteworthy in so far as de-extinction is only a minor subject within the broader field of conservation ethics and debates (see also section "Extinction studies"). Of concern are, for example, different moral values and goods that might be supported or hindered by de-extinction projects (e.g. Cohen, 2014; Haught, 2017; Smith, 2017; Welchman, 2017; Rohwer and Marris, 2018), which also include anthropocentric reasons in favour of the de-extinction of certain species, such as their potential value for ecosystem functioning, their economic value or their scientific value.
u1ky | Non-anthropocentric attempts to provide a qualified justifica- tion for this approach include providing a list of criteria for its employment (e.g. Kasperbauer, 2017) or by trying to make the idea useful for other normative purposes such as whether de-extinction might be a way of enacting a reparative duty towards nonhuman species or individual animals after extinctions have occurred. While thinking about de-extinction in terms of reparation or restitution might be intuitively appealing and constitute an argument occa- sionally engaged by conservation professionals, concerns about de-extinction as a form of reparation or retribution are shared by many authors (such as Oksanen and Siipi, 2014; Diehm, 2015; Lean, 2020; Welchman, 2021; yet for an argument in favour of a prima facie obligation to re-create species, see Jebari, 2016), while more might be said in favour of de-extinction as ecological restoration (Turner, 2014). Overall, while some authors argue that de-extinction can be ethically permissible in certain circumstances (Sandler, 2019), the debate on the desirability of de-extinction has been rather sceptical. Three common (not exhaustive) critiques of de-extinction fall into the following three categories.
htm9 | Firstly, it has been frequently pointed out that the resulting species is not the same species as the previously extinct species, but only constitutes a copy (which concerns the species' 'identity', Blockstein, 2017; Siipi and Finkelman, 2017; Lean, 2020). Actual 'resurrection' is not considered to be possible - or only possible by drawing on a very specific species concept (Oksanen and Siipi, 2014) and related metaphysical commitments to resolve the 'res- urrection paradox' (Delord, 2014) - which leaves any de-extinction proposal wanting (Diehm, 2017) and reintroduces the abovemen- tioned considerations about the ontology of species (Beever, 2017).7 However, other writers argue that de-extinction technologies should not be understood as aiming to re-create extinct species in the first place (Lean, 2020), which weakens this critique aimed at de-extinction while also reducing its intuitive appeal.
8hul | Secondly, concerns about animal welfare have been raised (Gamborg, 2014; Oksanen and Siipi, 2014; Kasperbauer, 2017; Turner, 2017; Browning, 2018; Browning and Veit, 2022), which regards, for example, the welfare of the animals used for laboratory testing, of the animals that are (re)introduced into ecosystems and of the animals already living in the target ecosystems. Distinct from but related to such worries are also concerns regarding the eco- logical risks of (re)introducing species into ecosystems and, thus, what this means for ecosystems beyond the de-extinct species in question (Oksanen and Siipi, 2014; on the more general relation- ship between biodiversity conservation and resurrecting species, see Oksanen, 2014).
87vz | Thirdly, we can find a range of worries raised against de-extinction on a more abstract level of analysis concerning the human-nature relationship (Kohl, 2017; Katz, 2022). That is
ym66 | linked, in turn, to worries about naturalness (Gamborg, 2014) in terms of artificiality and authenticity (Katz, 2022; discussed in Campbell, 2022; Lean, 2022; Preston, 2022; Reydon, 2022; Turner, 2022, but for an argument against this concern, see Campbell and Whittle, 2017) as well as concerns about instrumentalist 'techno- optimist' conservation strategies more generally as exemplified by de-extinction (Diehm, 2015).
