        "content": "1ujy | We solve the above Hamiltonian numerically by means of matrix product state simulations on different two-dimensional Bravais lattices with open boundary conditions consisting of lattice sites R equals the sum of N sub I A sub I spanned by basis vectors A sub one point two with A sub Z comma I equals zero. For details on the implementation and on the two-dimensional to one-dimensional mapping required for using matrix product states, we refer to the Appendix. The D M I vectors read\nqzor | D sub R minus R equals D times E sub Z cross R prime minus R.\na0by | with a positive D M I vector amplitude D greater than zero. For triangular and square lattices, we depicted the orientation of the D M I vectors in Figure one.\nu1ky | We apply the external magnetic field B parallel to the lattice plane normal E sub Z. Without loss of generality, we assume negative values B less than zero such that field-polarized spins are eigenstates of S sub R superscript Z with eigenvalue plus one-half and therefore align with the plane normal. For convenience, we will express interatomic distances in units of the lattice constants A sub I equals absolute value of A sub I and energies in units of D, with hbar equals one.\nhtm9 | The Hamiltonian one may be seen as the quantum counterpart of typical classical spin models which give rise to magnetic skyrmions. In this work, we discuss the emergence of quantum skyrmions and quantum skyrmion lattices in two-dimensional triangular and square lattices at zero temperature and with different open boundary shapes.\n8hul | Three. Individual Quantum Skyrmions\n87vz | For small system diameters L less than or approximately five A, the exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the full Hamiltonian can be computed numerically, for instance by the Lanczos or Arnoldi algorithms, and we first cross-checked our own exact diagonalization codes by reproducing the results of previous research. To ensure the correctness of our findings, we further compared expectation values computed from the matrix product states obtained by D M R G with exact diagonalization results for all system sizes amenable for exact diagonalization and found quantitative agreement up to\nym66 | a self-imposed accuracy delta. We thereby checked that finite-size ground states of the spin one-half Hamiltonian can be approximated faithfully with matrix product states. In fact, the reliability of D M R G for two-dimensional spin one-half quantum Heisenberg models has already been demonstrated in numerous works, with a strong bias toward frustrated antiferromagnets and spin liquids, which are prime examples of the most demanding systems to simulate numerically due to the presence of topological order and long-range entanglement. In this work, we focus on the computationally less demanding scenario of magnetically ordered phases hosting skyrmions and field-polarized states in the ferromagnetic regime\nl0a3 | J less than zero. Beyond a critical system diameter of L approximately eight A, we find values of D and B for which the ground state of the Hamiltonian H hosts skyrmion-like spin textures confined in the interior bulk of the lattice, which we display in Figure two. We checked that these skyrmion wave functions correspond to approximate eigenstates of the Hamiltonian by computing the energy variance E and performed a linear extrapolation toward results without numerical errors.",
