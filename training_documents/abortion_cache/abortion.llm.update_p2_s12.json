        "content": "68xu | An important consideration for people who self-manage is the safety and effectiveness of the method they are using. Since twenty eighteen, self-managed abortion using mifepristone and misoprostol has been available through online telemedicine in the U.S. via a non-profit service called Aid Access. The service received fifty-seven thousand five hundred six requests from people in the U.S. in its first two years of operation. While clinic-based and physician-led telemedicine models that provide medication abortion within the formal healthcare setting are also available in some U.S. states, Aid Access is distinct from these service models because it offers self-managed abortion, operating outside of the formal U.S. healthcare setting in all fifty states. Provision of self-managed medication abortion using similar services, such as Women on Web and Women Help Women, has been explored in other countries, but outcomes have not been studied in any U.S.-based population. Using data from Aid Access, the objective of this study is to examine the safety, effectiveness, and acceptability of self-managed medication abortion provided via online telemedicine in the U.S.\nhd35 | Methods\n2zpk | Data\nepu7 | Aid Access currently provides medication abortion up to ten weeks gestation at the time of request, which is made using an online consultation form. A doctor reviews the form to ensure no contraindications and provides a prescription of two hundred milligrams mifepristone to be taken orally and eight hundred micrograms misoprostol to be taken sublingually, along with an additional eight hundred micrograms of\n7od1 | misoprostol for use if needed, according to the World Health Organization recommended dosage regimen for medication abortion. A partner organization then mails the medications along with usage instructions. A donation of one hundred ten dollars to support the service is requested, but those who cannot afford it are asked to donate what they can. An online non-clinical helpdesk team is available to answer questions. Four weeks after receipt of the medications, users are invited to report their abortion outcomes using an online evaluation form or via an email to the helpdesk.\n0bqy | Our dataset includes all U.S. residents to whom abortion medications were shipped between March twentieth, twenty eighteen and March twentieth, twenty nineteen. Since Aid Access is the sole organization of its kind serving the U.S., our sample represents the universe of people in the U.S. self-managing a medication abortion using online telemedicine outside the formal healthcare system. De-identified data from the online consultation form, follow-up form, and emails were provided by Aid Access. All individuals in the sample consented to the anonymized use of their data at the aggregate level for research purposes.\nb780 | The online consultation form includes self-reported information about age, weeks' gestation, parity, feelings about the decision to have an abortion, any medical contraindications, whether or not a person has had an ultrasound scan for the current pregnancy, knows someone who can be with them during their abortion, and lives within sixty minutes of a hospital. We categorized age as \"Under twenty years\", \"Twenty to twenty-four years\" and into five-year increments thereafter, with a final group of \"Forty years and over\". Gestation was reported as \"Less than seven weeks\" or \"Seven to ten weeks\", which represents gestation at the time of the consultation. Those who did not have an ultrasound scan used a pregnancy calculator based on their last menstrual period. Number of children was reported numerically, and we constructed categories of \"zero\" and \"one or more\". Feelings about the decision to have an abortion were reported as \"I can cope with my feelings regarding my decision\" and \"I have some worries about my decision and would like further information\". Those who expressed worries were directed to appropriate sources of information. Medical history questions included the presence of any contraindications (e.g. bleeding disorders, inherited porphyrias, allergies to mifepristone or misoprostol) or medical conditions that required additional medical screening (e.g. having an IUD in place or having a suspected STI).\nccmb | The evaluation form is based on similar follow-up instruments used in the clinical setting and is sent to participants four weeks after receipt of the medication. Available information included the number who confirmed delivery of the medications, the number who confirmed whether or not they used the medications, and the outcome of the pregnancy or abortion. Those who confirmed using the medications were asked about\nma93 | gestation at the time of use, whether or not they were still pregnant, whether or not they received any clinical intervention to help end the pregnancy (Dilation and Curettage or vacuum aspiration), and any other treatment they received for a possible serious adverse event following their abortion. Those who confirmed not using the medications were asked about the outcome of their pregnancy.\nc6hh | Analysis\ny7ea | We compared available clinical and demographic characteristics among those who provided follow-up information and those who did not. We conducted chi-squared difference of proportions tests using an alpha level of zero point zero five to indicate statistical significance to check for any systematic differences between the two groups that might affect the outcome of their abortions.\nnav4 | Among those for whom self-reported information on outcomes was available, we examined these in the overall sample as well as constructing two groups: those who reported a gestation of ten weeks or fewer at the time of using the pills, and those who reported a gestation of over ten weeks. This threshold was chosen to allow comparison with outcomes of medication abortion in the clinic setting, where the mifepristone-misoprostol combined regimen is approved by the FDA through seventy days gestation. While requestors must be ten weeks pregnant or less at the time of filling out the consultation form, the medications may take one to three weeks to arrive and thus some individuals may be over ten weeks at the time of use. We first examined the proportion who reported that they were no longer pregnant, and then the proportion for whom medication abortion was successful according to the standard definition of success in the Medical Abortion Reporting of Efficacy Guidelines, i.e. the proportion who were able to expel their pregnancy without the need for surgical intervention. Next, we examined the prevalence of reported serious adverse events, following to the extent possible the categories defined by Cleland et al. Information was available on receipt of IV antibiotics and blood transfusion and we also assessed whether any deaths were reported, recognizing that we are relying on reporting by friends, family members, the authorities, or the media. We calculated point-estimates and exact binomial ninety-five percent confidence intervals both for the overall population and for the binary gestation categories available in our dataset. To compare outcomes between the two gestation groups we used Fisher's exact test and considered findings statistically significant at an alpha level of zero point zero five.\ngem8 | The follow-up form also included a series of \"yes or no\" questions asking about the abortion experience, including satisfaction with the service, and whether: using it had been the right choice; affording the full donation (which at the time of data collection was ninety dollars) had been difficult; enough information had been provided about\ne8nr | the abortion process; and enough support was available from family and friends. We calculated the proportions of people answering \"yes\" and \"no\" to each question.\nk78w | Data analysis was conducted using Stata version fifteen point one. The Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas at Austin approved the study.\ng9du | Role of the funding source\nf682 | Neither funding source that supported the investigators during the study had any involvement in study design, data collection, analysis or interpretation, and had no role in the writing of this manuscript or the decision to submit for publication.\nli1k | Results",
