        "content": "gocl | Pure GS estimates additive effects and neglects non-additive allelic effects and non-allelic epistasis. For outcrossing species, these non-additive effects were, however, important for the improvement of various traits. A hierarchical epistasis of MdSAUR37/MdPP2CH/MdALMTII was identified to control fruit malate content. To link MAS and GS, an additive Bayesian QTL analyses model was developed for apple fruit firmness, the GS accuracy (zero point five seven to zero point nine four) was higher than that of genomic best linear unbiased prediction model (zero point seven two to zero point seven seven). These data drew attention to QTL-based GS, which is sometimes called genomics-assisted prediction. Compared with map-based QTL mapping and GWAS, bulked segregant analysis via sequencing is considered as a cost-efficient QTL detection approach and has been effectively used in apple.\nob1z | The objective of the present study was to develop GAP models for flesh firmness and crispness retainability. Towards this, QTLs were identified from three apple F one hybrid populations using bulked segregant analysis via sequencing approach. To convert significant QTL-based markers to diagnostic markers, candidate genes were predicted from QTL intervals, assisted by using RNA sequencing and parental re-sequencing. Then, the allelic variations in candidate genes were validated to confirm the function of the variations. The results can facilitate\nm4cb | dissecting the genetic variation network and obtaining functional markers for apple flesh firmness and crispness retainability.\nm61y | Results\nu2ob | Segregation and correlation of flesh firmness or crispness at harvest and post-harvest\n2gnm | Both the initial flesh firmness and the crispness of apples at harvest segregated extensively with a Gaussian distribution within the three populations, implying a minor-effect polygenic control of these two traits. The broad-sense heritability H squared was seventy-five point two four to eighty-three point zero six percent and eighty-six point nine one to ninety-four point four three percent for the initial flesh firmness and crispness, respectively. Similarly, the H squared was seventy-five point zero four to eighty-three point eight five percent and seventy-five point eight seven to eighty-three point six four percent for retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively. However, the frequency distributions of retainability of flesh firmness and crispness were not Gaussian. The majority of hybrids lost flesh firmness and crispness within one or two months. The frequency of hybrids with long flesh firmness (greater than or equal to seven kilograms per square centimeter) and crispness (greater than or equal to zero point seven kilograms per square centimeter) retainability was higher in the population of 'Zisai Pearl' by 'Red Fuji' than the other two.\nemgw | The Pearson's correlation coefficient was highest between flesh crispness and firmness retainability (zero point eight zero two four; N equals two thousand six hundred fifty one), followed by that between initial flesh firmness and crispness (zero point five eight nine two; N equals two thousand five hundred seven). The correlations between the initial flesh firmness or crispness at harvest and the corresponding flesh firmness or crispness retainability after cold storage were relatively low (zero point three three nine two to zero point four six nine two). The hybrids with long flesh firmness retainability did not generally have the same or longer flesh crispness retainability. Among the two hundred seventeen hybrids with six to seven months long flesh firmness retainability, one hundred forty (sixty-four point five percent) had the same or longer flesh crispness retainability. However, among the one hundred fifty-seven hybrids with six months or longer flesh crispness retainability, one hundred forty (eighty-nine point two percent) showed six to seven months flesh firmness retainability. These data indicated that long retainability of flesh firmness was likely a prerequisite for flesh crispness retainability.\nxaqt | Pattern of flesh firmness and crispness at harvest and post-harvest\n5rcb | Regarding the changes in flesh firmness and crispness during cold storage, three extremity dynamics were distinctly observed. Type One: acceptable flesh firmness (seven kilograms per square centimeter) or crispness (zero point seven kilograms per square centimeter) lost already at harvest. Type Two: acceptable flesh firmness or crispness maintained until the sixth month after a rapid softening during the first month of cold storage. Type Three: acceptable flesh firmness or crispness maintained after the sixth months of cold storage with constantly slow softening rate. Ethylene production in type One hybrids was higher than that in types Two and Three during cold storage, whereas type Three hybrids produced lowest level of ethylene. These suggested that low ethylene emission was associated with flesh firmness and crispness retainability.\n524j | QTL identification using bulked segregant analysis via sequencing\nxd3m | By the three segregant bulks from the three phenotype types of flesh firmness retainability, ten, five and seventeen significant QTLs for flesh firmness retainability were identified from bulk pairs of type Three versus type One, type Three versus type Two, and type Two versus type One, respectively. These QTLs were located on chromosomes three, eleven, twelve, fifteen, sixteen and seventeen. Of these QTLs, F-F zero three point two",
