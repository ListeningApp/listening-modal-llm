You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

epyi | To compute a filtering estimate, the ensemble of forecasts is adjusted using an innova- tion term and gain matrix as in Eq. (20.19). There is only one observation y(i) avail- able, but it turns out that using it unchanged for all innovations in the ensemble tends to underestimate the variability of the filtering distribution. Hence, the innovation term y(i)-Hi Mili-1 in the ordinary Kalman filter is replaced by an innovation ensemble y(i) + e .- H;x, where the perturbations e; are simulated observation errors with the same dis- tribution as the errors in the data model (20.17). One can therefore compute an ensemble of simulated filtering states,
y51p | Ex ¡- 1 +R; (y(i) +e; - H[-]. (20.27)
x95m | This ensemble is used to produce estimates &j ; of the filtering mean and 2 ;; of the filtering covariance matrix. One then uses N( *¡ , [i) as an estimate of the filtering distribution at time step i, and the algorithm has completed a step. There is also a reanalysis version of this method.
yfum | If the process model is actually linear, such that Eq. (20.23) reduces to Eq. (20.16), then the ensemble Kalman forecasting and filtering estimates converge in the limit of large ensemble size to those of the ordinary Kalman filter algorithm. However, if the M; are nonlinear, then the forecasting and filtering distributions become non-Gaussian, and there will be biases from the ensemble approach that do not disappear with large ensemble size. These biases must be assessed or possibly corrected separately.

qf11 | If the space of process variables is high-dimensional <LATEX>\left( 1 0 ^ { 6 } \right.</LATEX> or <LATEX>1 0 ^ { 8 }</LATEX> is not uncommon), the ensemble approach successfully avoids the problem of high-dimensional integration and the manipulation of huge covariance matrices. However, typically the ensemble size is much smaller, perhaps <LATEX>m = 0 \left( 1 0 ^ { 2 } \right) .</LATEX> Then the sample covariance matrices have rank at most <LATEX>m</LATEX> and cannot possibly give all covariances correctly. On the other hand, in such situations the process vector <LATEX>\mathrm { x } \left( i \right)</LATEX> may describe physical quantities at different locations across a region or around the globe. Then one often multiplies <LATEX>\sum _ { i | i - 1 } ^ { \wedge }</LATEX> or <LATEX>\sum _ { i | i } ^ { \wedge }</LATEX> elementwise with a "cut-off" matrix <LATEX>C</LATEX> whose entries are small far from the diagonal (for component pairs that have little to do with each other). This trick eliminates spurious large correla- tions at distant locations and at the same time tends to restore full rank to the estimated covariance matrices. Care must be taken to avoid destroying teleconnections.
