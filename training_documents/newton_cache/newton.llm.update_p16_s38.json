Firstly, we give some scalar expressions for the quantities of interest in nine and ten in the MINRES algorithm\nrnor | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimisation with Nonnegativity Constraints\n3tz7 | Lemma A point one MINRES scalar updates. We have the following\ne02w | Proof. Sixteen a follows from the construction of the MINRES algorithm. The proof of sixteen d, sixteen c, and sixteen b is given in Liu and Roosta.\n0ldf | Next we give some helpful properties of the SOL and NPC steps.\n4rgq | Lemma A point two D Sub type equals SOL. Any iterate of MINRES, s super t, satisfies\nsrag | and\nvm1l | Suppose that negative curvature has not been detected up to iteration T. Then,\n2ulk | Further, consider Assumption three point one and suppose there exists some rho greater than zero such that for any v in K sub t of H, g, we have <v, H v> is greater than or equal to rho ||v|| squared. Then,\noc27 | where\nxv2d | C sub rho, L sub g is defined as rho over L sub g squared. Proof. The relation seventeen follows from Liu and Roosta, while eighteen follows from the fact that zero is in K sub t of H, g and s super t minimizes eight. Also, nineteen follows from Liu and Roosta. For the right-hand-side of twenty, we use seventeen and the fact that s super t is in K sub t of H, g to get\n0yfu | rho ||s super t|| squared is less than or equal to <s super t, H s super t> is less than or equal to ||s super t|| ||H s super t|| is less than or equal to ||s super t|| ||g|| implies ||s super t|| is less than or equal to ||g|| over rho. We show the left-hand-side of twenty using a monotonicity argument. In particular, consider the first iterate s super one. It is easy to see that the solution to eight over the Krylov subspace K sub one of H, g is Span{g} is given by\n2icd | the minimum of s in K sub one of H, g ||H s + g|| squared equals the minimum of beta in real numbers ||beta H g + g|| squared implies beta equals negative <g, H g> over ||H g|| squared. The step is therefore given by\nln4r | s super one equals negative <g, H g> over ||H g|| squared g. We can apply <g, H g> is greater than or equal to rho ||g|| squared and ||H g|| is less than or equal to L sub g ||g|| to obtain\n1iz9 | ||r super t|| equals phi sub t. Sixteen a\no5cc | <r super t minus one, H r super t minus one> equals negative c sub t minus one gamma sub t ||r super t minus one|| squared, ||H s super t minus one|| equals the square root of phi sub zero squared minus phi sub t minus one squared, ||H r super t minus one|| equals phi sub t minus one square root of gamma sub t squared plus delta sub t plus one squared. Sixteen b, Sixteen c, Sixteen d\nb430 | ||H s super t|| is less than or equal to ||g||. Seventeen\n5k15 | <s super t, H g> is less than or equal to zero. Eighteen",
