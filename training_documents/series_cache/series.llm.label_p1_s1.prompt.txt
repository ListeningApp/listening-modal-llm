You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

hffd | About the series
29tz | Studying death can tell us an incredible amount about life. More specifically, it can illuminate a seemingly endless evolving relationship between humans and mortality. From sense-making and rituals around dying to how deceased persons are disposed of and even interwoven within human/nonhuman grief as ecologies shift, studying deaths not only deepens our understandings about loss and endings, but also of societies and culture. By attending to these matters, this book series seeks to shine a light on the cultural and social dimensions of death, exploring the wider contexts in which it is experienced, (re)presented and understood.
vfdc | At a time when recognising the differences inherent in these broader sociocultural contexts has never been more important, the series adopts a broad use of the term 'culture' to enable us to bring together a rich multidisciplinary set of monographs and edited collections. We appreciate that the concept of culture has long been debated in several disciplines, most notably within anthropology, as well as contested in terms of how to optimally study 'culture'. While this series will acknowledge this, we do not seek to replicate some of these wider theoretical and epistemological debates. Rather, we want to open out 'culture' to include anthropological, sociological, historical and philosophical perspectives as well as drawing on media and culture studies, art and literature. By adopting such an open position to what culture is and how it can be known, we welcome both the sharing of new empirical work within the series as well as theorising about how engagements with death (re)shape understandings of what culture is, how it operates and what the future of culture(s) may be.
4lum | As social scientists spanning anthropology, sociology, criminology and cultural studies, and supported by an international editorial board that includes experts in death, dying and the dead our default position when thinking about death is typically two-fold. First, that death and dying are
lxht | inherently social; that is, they are not only about biological or material processes and endings. Second, by attending to and foregrounding 'the social' when it comes to death, issues of culture and cultural practices necessarily organically come to the fore. Such is the importance of culture to death, that the topic does not 'fit' neatly into one discipline over another. It is a truly interdisciplinary issue that affects everyone who has lived, is living, or will live in the future; all life on the planet; and Earth itself.
psc7 | This series launched in 2018 with Emerald Publishing, but relocated in 2021 to Bristol University Press. The series represents a commitment to empirically building our collective understandings about death and culture across time and places, in monographs and edited collections. As editors, we want to take this moment to thank existing and previous editors and authors, the presses we work with, and the wider academic and professional communities that facilitate the flourishing of studies of death and culture. It is only through this collective endeavour that books like this can be made, read and built upon, and we are excited to see the series grow. We welcome enquiries about future volumes, and hope that you enjoy reading this book.
6d4z | About the book
2ww3 | Death's Social and Material Meaning Beyond the Human is an edited collection by Jesse D. Peterson, Natashe Lemos Dekker and Philip R. Olson with nearly 20 international contributors. Central to this collection is an in- depth handling, and detailed accounts of the entangling, of social meanings and materialities of dying and death. And importantly, this is 'beyond the human' - the limits are not the physical body that dies and how people make sense of this in finite terms. But across the volume readers learn to think about wider ecologies, technologies, politics and ethics. As outlined in the Introduction by the editors, across the 13 chapters they have provided material to enable us to see and discuss 'new forms of deathly concern'. Specifically, recognizing death as something that affects the entirety of the earth system and requires a more-than-human interdisciplinary dialogue to fully appreciate and act within these new forms.
l0zc | This is a timely contribution to the Death and Culture series. Not a month goes by without news reporting about global warming and the ecological emergency that looms large: potential of mass death projected on the now and future. And yet, societally and internationally we are still learning how to think about this beyond questions of climate-friendly action. There is a desperate need to find new ways of being within and part of the earth system than what we currently inhabit, and as this collection shows, how we die within it. These new ways must be pluralistic, inclusive and draw on multiple forms of knowledge. The detailed and careful articulations in the chapters of this book illustrate how we may begin to do this as well as why this is important.
7h2f | SERIES EDITORS' PREFACE
td95 | From considering dying seas to COVID-19 to transforming the waste of corpses into trees, each section within the book shows what is at stake. Cleverly, the editors and authors do not assume that what is at stake is a given or universally appreciated, nor is it situated purely around a nature/ culture binary. Instead, they expertly unfold how the objects of their study matter and the ways in which they are understood by people. Culture here is not a monolithic external factor. Within some chapters, culture is something that is made visible through practices and values, a collective that is both regularly repeated by individuals and changed over time. In other chapters, authors talk about 'deathcare cultures' that represent dominate modes, discourses and professions that exert power over what it means to be human and the importance of death in certain contexts. Across these, by taking a more-than-human approach, the entanglements between culture and nature are made apparent.
9rkk | For those more familiar with more-than-human approaches to academic study, the mighty and humble fungi will not be an unexpected companion in this text. If at this point an eyebrow is raised querying what is meant by that last sentence, dear reader you are in for a treat that spans dinner plates to forest floors and afterlives.
el7h | Introduction
2tkd | Jesse D. Peterson, Natashe Lemos Dekker and Philip R. Olson
2lig | The third and final plate of mushroom risotto arrived. We were seated together at a Stockholm restaurant on the eve of a workshop on death and dying titled 'Dying at the margins: A critical exploration of material-discursive perspectives to death and dying', organized by Natashe Lemos Dekker and Jesse D. Peterson, with funding provided by the KTH Environmental Humanities Laboratory as part of the Environmental Humanities for a Concerned Europe innovative training network. The multidisciplinary workshop would bring together 16 scholars from nine different countries to connect scholars around research exploring how dying 'bodies' - broadly understood to include humans, animals, plants, things and places - challenge natural and normative notions of a 'good' death. Joining Natashe and Jesse at dinner was Phil Olson, who would give the next morning's keynote address. It seemed fitting that each of us would settle on fungus to nourish our minds and bodies during our first in-person meeting. After all, fungi are a symbol of decay, dissolution and putrefaction, fruiting harbingers that, by confronting their observers with the transformation of death back into life, challenge the definitions of the living, dying, alive, dead, not-alive, undead, and more. Reflecting on this moment, we can say that it was this very challenge that brought us together.
3b9j | Though the three of us operate in different fields - Jesse in environmental humanities, Phil in science and technology studies, and Natashe in anthropology - we confirmed over the course of the next two days of workshop activities that we and the rest of the workshop participants were asking similar questions about how materialities, practices and stories challenge and complicate standard human conceptions of death and dying. Such questions are deeply important, as death's social and cultural meanings in society underscore practices ranging from efforts to defer death to preparations for funeral and burial rites; from practices of grief and mourning to forensic efforts to understand the causes of death; and from intervening in the processes of death and decomposition to interrogating the agentic dynamics of death and decomposition.
cyef | Enthused by a successful workshop, we three organized a 2020 4S/EASST (virtual) conference panel on the same theme but with all new contributors, some of whom have contributed to this volume. At this conference, entanglements between human and nonhuman death emerged, again, as a central theme. The growing COVID-19 pandemic inflected much of the conversation at the conference, but presenters on our panel shed light on the ways in which individuals, governments and other interest groups negotiate with non-pandemic forms of dying, including the disappearance of loved ones, the loss of a child before birth, the inability to care for oneself due to dementia, the planned eradication of an invasive plant, the successive extinction of multiple species, and the death of a river or lake. While we all must face our own inevitable deaths, we also encounter the countless deaths of others throughout our lives. By meeting the messiness of death and dying, we, as scholars, hope to stay with the complexity of loss, grief, relief, struggle and release that attend our many encounters with the demise and cessation of all lives.
bcz3 | After a successful 4S conference we were approached by a publisher other than Bristol University Press about possibly creating an edited volume around the topics explored in our panel. Having enjoyed working together, and feeling now some optimistic momentum, we were keen to explore the possibility of editing a volume together. Our call for proposals was met by over 50(!) submissions, indicating considerable interest in the subject matter of our call. We deliberated collectively about which press we should approach with a book proposal, and settled on Bristol University Press, to which the 'Death and Culture' series had recently moved.
y4ss | Framing this book
ihy3 | This book explores the social meanings and materialities of death and dying by attending to death as a state, an event, a process, and as a site for political, scientific, medical, environmental and ethical negotiations regarding the significance of mortality. But across all these investments, the book underscores the relationality of death, for the primary motivation behind this project is to articulate (both in the sense of stating and in the sense or establishing connections between) new forms of deathly concern that affect not only humans but the entire earth system and that necessitate new thinking and interdisciplinary exchange for situating death, and human relationships to it, in more-than-human terms.
pjrx | Death studies typically take the death of the human subject as its object of study, thereby overlooking the wider networks of relations involved in social and natural processes surrounding death. Yet, as the COVID-19 pandemic and the climate crisis have shown, human death intermingles with microorganisms, environmental conditions, developments in science
z9ml | and medicine, and more. Additionally, as a result of anthropogenic changes to the planet Earth, humans must also deal with the nonhuman deaths we cause and the complicated material, emotional and practical consequences that the loss of nonhuman creatures and entities may entail. While death as a more-than-human affair - as a category built upon human emotions and knowledge, as well as human relationships with technologies, more- than-human beings and socio-ecological environments - has existed at the margins of death studies research, we see more scholarly attention devoted to the ecological, material and queer aspects of death and dying. For instance, the recent emergence of queer death studies challenges the primacy of human death as the only kind of death of interest as well as focuses on the 'necropolitics' surrounding the dead (Mbembé, 2003; Radomska et al, 2019: 5). Scholars working in this arena explore 'queer' bonds between the living and dead as well as 'queer' this relationship (Radomska et al, 2019: 6). They point to the epistemological and symbolic violence that marks some deaths as more valuable than others (Radomska et al, 2020). Additionally, scholars working in extinction studies look beyond the death of the individual human to explore how species extinctions - driven by humans - complicate and transform understandings of death, time and generations (Heise, 2016; Rose et al, 2017). While others working on environmental issues continue to explore the degradation of environments (Tsing et al, 2017; Lidström et al, 2022), the poisonous toxicities and wastes that infiltrate human and other creatures' bodies (Alaimo, 2010; Armiero et al, 2019; Muller and Nielsen, 2022), and the political, social and cultural moves which make some lives 'killable' (Haraway, 2008: 77-82; Beisel, 2010; Mehrabi, 2020). In the natural sciences, additional philosophical and conceptual conversations that define life as ecosystemic rather than organismic (Fiscus, 2001) or as flows of energy masses (Wei et al, 2022) also present unique formulations for application by scholars researching dying and death. Each of these various strands of research dealing with the death of people, places and other beings offers fruitful ground for extending human knowledge and practices surrounding the dying and the dead.
evmg | This collection brings these marginal matters into focus, centring discussion of the death of nonhuman others, the relational materiality of the human corpse, new narratives about the work of death caretakers, and newly emerging deathcare practices and technologies. The transdisciplinary and transnational character of this collection reveals how deeply human death is intertwined with the lives and deaths of nonhuman things, objects, places and discourses. By shedding light on deaths and dyings that exist in many unlooked-for places, this collection challenges death studies' focus on human death, as well as the norms that govern standard approaches to studying human death. Thus, this volume addresses urgent questions facing death research, including:
ajzn | · What boundary work takes place to construct and maintain the categories of alive, not-alive, dead, dying and undead for places, objects and beings?
gpc2 | · How do modes of existing between life and death affect normative categorizations of the living, the non-living and the dead?
4h3w | · What are the implications of reconfiguring understandings of death to a more ecological frame that accommodates more-than-human lives and deaths?
7vce | · How do such challenges alter ethical approaches and values attached to dying and death?
g3ed | The contents of this book
4evh | This volume draws together diverse material-discursive perspectives on socio-ecological networks of the dying and dead. In addition to gathering a wide range of international perspectives - contributors hail from North America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania - this collection showcases a range of theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of death and dying from scholars doing cutting-edge research in death studies, feminist and queer studies, new materialism and waste studies, plant and animal studies, and non-Western or indigenous studies. In so doing, this volume broadens the scope of conventional research on death and dying, and focuses the discussion towards death as a more-than-human affair. Thinking and writing along the themes of mediation, care and power, the collection further challenges normative understandings and categories of life and death.
8zr0 | The organization of edited volumes always involves choices about how best to draw out certain contents by grouping specific chapters in distinct parts, and in particular orders. Recognizing that these choices always take place among a field of possible alternative arrangements, we have organized the book's chapters into three parts, which, respectively, highlight the themes of (I) ontologies and epistemologies of death and dying, (II) care and remembrance, and (III) troubling agencies.
