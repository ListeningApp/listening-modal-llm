You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

s6su | ASSUMPTION 4 (Stability of smooth functions by the perturbation oper- ator). The generator <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } }</LATEX> of the perturbation is such that <LATEX>\mathscr{S}</LATEX> is stable by <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } ,</LATEX> and
y219 | <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } ^ { * } \mathscr{S} \subset \mathscr{S} _ { 0 } .</LATEX> Assumption 4 is easily seen to be satisfied for perturbations <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } }</LATEX> of the form <LATEX>F ^ { T } \nabla</LATEX> when <LATEX>F</LATEX> has components in <LATEX>\mathscr{S} ,</LATEX> which is assumed here and for the remainder of this work. A simple computation based on integrations by parts shows that <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } ^ { * } \mathscr{S} \subset \mathscr{S} _ { 0 }</LATEX> when <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } 1 = 0 .</LATEX> Indeed, for <LATEX>\varphi \in \mathscr{S}</LATEX> , using the definition of the

v3r2 | <LATEX>\int _ { \mathcal{X} } \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } ^ { * } \varphi \psi _ { 0 } = \int _ { \mathcal{X} } \varphi \left( \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } 1 \right) \psi _ { 0 } = 0 .</LATEX> One function of particular interest in the range of <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } ^ { * }</LATEX> is the conjugate response function
nv42 | (2.10)
xags | <LATEX>S = \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } ^ { * } 1 ,</LATEX> which we introduce here as it will be useful later. Note that the expression <LATEX>\mathrm { f o r } S</LATEX> comes from the generator <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } }</LATEX> of the perturbation, and not the observable <LATEX>R .</LATEX> Let us emphasize that beyond the case of physical forcings <LATEX>F ^ { T } \nabla ,</LATEX> Assumption 4 will be needed for more general operators in Section 3.
jc47 | Assumptions 1 through 4 are natural for overdamped Langevin and Langevin dynamics, which we present in the next two sections.
ko3c | 2.1.2. Overdamped Langevin dynamics. One typical dynamics used in mo- lecular dynamics is overdamped Langevin dynamics, which evolves only the positions <LATEX>q</LATEX> of the system.
xek3 | R. SPACEK AND G. STOLTZ
bbpr | Reference dynamics. Mathematically, the overdamped Langevin dynamics corre- sponds to the following SDE with nondegenerate noise:
5zyf | Î² 2 dWt,
9own | (2.11) dqt = - VV (qt) dt + V
bqfb | where B > 0 is proportional to the inverse temperature, and V is a smooth potential. The generator associated with (2.11) is given by
wwdt | (2.12) Lo = - VTV + -A,
mn1r | with L2(X)-adjoint
5vqw | Ch = div(VV.) + BA.
meyw | The dynamics (2.11) admits the Gibbs measure with density
2e62 | 40(4) - 20-BV(a), 2 Z = 1x x e-BV(I)dq < +00
75y3 | as its unique invariant probability measure. It can indeed be checked that Lovo = 0, so that yo is a stationary solution to the Fokker-Planck equation. Here and in the remainder of this work, we assume that e-BV E L1(X). Note that the generator (2.12) is self-adjoint on the Hilbert space L2(0), as Lo =- B-1V*V.
s2g2 | Nonequilibrium perturbation. The perturbed overdamped Langevin dynamics cor- responding to (2.4) reads
q1q2 | (2.13) dqf =(-VV(q")+nF(q"))dt+ V Î²
cb7r | It has generator Cn = Lo + ne phys, where Cphys = FTV. Recall that F is assumed to be nongradient, so that in general there is no explicit expression for the invariant probability measure of (2.13) when such a measure exists.
68xu | Remark 2.1. One of the only cases where a closed form for y, is known is the one- dimensional case for overdamped Langevin dynamics, where the associated Fokker- Planck equation is directly solvable, as discussed for instance in [13], which generalizes the computations of [39, Section 2.5].
hd35 | Conditions for assumptions to be satisfied. We now discuss the conditions under which Assumptions 1 through 4 are satisfied for the perturbed overdamped Langevin dynamics (2.13), which correspond to standard results in the literature.
2zpk | . If the space X is compact, then it is trivial to satisfy the Lyapunov condi- tion (2.8) by choosing Kn = 1. In the case of unbounded spaces, a typical choice is Kn = 1 + |q|", with the condition that there exist A > 0 and B E R such that
epu7 | (2.14) qTVV (q) â¥ Alq|2 - B.
7od1 | Condition (2.14) is satisfied for potentials V(q) that behave as |q|k for k â¥ 2 at infinity. This ensures that the dynamics returns to some compact region around the origin.
0bqy | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS
b780 | Â· Assumption 1 can be shown to hold using Lyapunov techniques and a mi- norization condition [34, 40, 24]. It can thus be shown that the dynam- ics (2.13) has a unique invariant probability measure with positive density with respect to the Lebesgue measure, and therefore that trajectorial ergod- icity holds.
ccmb | Â· Assumptions 2 and 3 hold under some conditions on the potential <LATEX>V ,</LATEX> which include (2.14); see [24] for a precise discussion.
ma93 | . Lastly, Assumption 4 is trivially satisfied, as <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } = F ^ { T } \nabla _ { q }</LATEX> leaves <LATEX>\mathscr{S}</LATEX> stable when <LATEX>F \in \mathscr{S} ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } ^ { * } \mathscr{S} \subset \mathscr{S} _ { 0 }</LATEX> in view of (2.9).
c6hh | 2.1.3. Langevin dynamics. Another dynamics of interest used in molecular dynamics is Langevin dynamics, which can be seen as a Hamiltonian dynamics per- turbed by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on the momenta. Mathematically, it corre- sponds to an SDE with degenerate noise, as the noise acts on the momenta only (i.e. the diffusion matrix does not have full rank).
y7ea | Reference dynamics. At equilibrium, Langevin dynamics evolves positions <LATEX>q</LATEX> and momenta <LATEX>p</LATEX> according to the SDE
nav4 | <LATEX>\left\{ \begin{array}{} d q _ { t } = M ^ { - 1 } p _ { t } d t , & \\ d p _ { t } = - \nabla V \left( q _ { t } \right) d t - \gamma M ^ { - 1 } p _ { t } d t + \sqrt { \frac { 2 \gamma } { \beta } } d W _ { t } , & \end{array} \right.</LATEX> (2.15)
gem8 | where <LATEX>\gamma > 0</LATEX> is the friction coefficient and <LATEX>M \in \mathbb{R} ^ { d \times d }</LATEX> is a positive definite matrix, called the mass matrix. The state-space <LATEX>\mathcal{X}</LATEX> is either <LATEX>\mathbb{T} ^ { d } \times \mathbb{R} ^ { d }</LATEX> or the full space
e8nr | <LATEX>\mathbb{R} ^ { d } \times \mathbb{R} ^ { d } .</LATEX> The infinitesimal generator associated with (2.15) is the following degenerate el- liptic operator
k78w | <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { 0 } = \mathcal{L} _ { \mathrm { h a m } } + \gamma \mathcal{L} _ { \mathrm { F D } } ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { \mathrm { h a m } }</LATEX> is the generator of the Hamiltonian part of the dynamics, and <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { \mathrm { F D } }</LATEX> is the generator of the fluctuation-dissipation part, i.e. the Gaussian process on the momenta, also known as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process:

f682 | <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { \mathrm { h a m } } = p ^ { T } M ^ { - 1 } \nabla _ { q } - \nabla V ^ { T } \nabla _ { p } , \quad \mathcal{L} _ { \mathrm { F D } } = - p ^ { T } M ^ { - 1 } \nabla _ { p } + \beta ^ { - 1 } \Delta _ { p } .</LATEX> The <LATEX>L ^ { 2 } \left( \mathcal{X} \right)</LATEX> (X)-adjoint of <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { 0 }</LATEX> acts
li1k | <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { \dagger } \psi = - \mathcal{L} _ { \mathrm { h a m } } \psi + \gamma \mathrm { d i v } _ { p } \left( M ^ { - 1 } p \psi + \beta ^ { - 1 } \nabla _ { p } \psi \right) .</LATEX> A simple computation shows that the dynamics (2.15) admits the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution as an invariant probability measure, which is in fact unique. The density of this measure satisfies the stationary Fokker-Planck equation <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { \dagger } \psi _ { 0 } = 0 ,</LATEX> where
pbea | <LATEX>\psi _ { 0 } \left( q \right) = \frac { 1 } { Z } \mathrm { e } ^ { - \beta H \left( q , p \right) } , \quad Z = \int _ { \mathcal{X} } \mathrm { e } ^ { - \beta H \left( q , p \right) } d q d p . ,</LATEX> Overdamped Langevin dynamics can be obtained from Langevin dynamics in two limiting cases: in the high friction limit <LATEX>\gamma \rightarrow + \infty ,</LATEX> upon rescaling time as <LATEX>\gamma t</LATEX> or in the small mass limit <LATEX>m \rightarrow 0 ,</LATEX> as discussed in [36] and [30, Section 2.2.4].
