You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

3ewf | While having routines is definitely important in our attachment-based relation- ships, having times where we also break out of our routines can be just as signif- icant. We can easily fall into default patterns and ruts in our relationships. Remem- bering the importance of stepping out of our day-to-day cycles, focusing on some novelty, play and adventure can revivify and strengthen our connections with part- ners.
5iea | Questions to Consider
62l5 | . What are the routines my partners and I already have that are meaningful to
shub | me and support me in feeling safe and secure together?
zjn5 | · What rituals have we participated in or what relationship rites of passage have we gone through that have brought us closer?
w8ia | . How do I like to be celebrated or to celebrate others?
4vej | . Are there any daily or regular routines that would support me in feeling more secure with my partners?
8ut1 | . Are there any relationship rites of passage or rituals that could further deepen our bond?
6o35 | . What do you and your partners each need to reconnect with each other after being apart?
8r63 | . Are there ways of checking in or saying goodbye before going on a date with another person that would create more safety and security? How do you want to connect or be approached afterwards?
qze0 | Things to Try and to Experiment With
o3m2 | . Create bedtime or waking rituals with your partners, whether or not you live together. Make sure to also support and allow space for your nesting partners to create their own bedtime and waking rituals with other partners.
kro9 | . Celebrate birthdays, anniversaries and accomplishments with your partners. When it comes to birthdays, communicate ahead of time about what your hopes and desires are for your birthday and be careful about expecting your partner to be with you on their birthday just because that's what you would prefer. Give your partners the autonomy to spend their birthday however and with whomever they would like. It's not your day to claim.
i438 | · Grieve losses and transitions together.
yr7b | Create holiday rituals that honor the relationship, whether or not they are on the actual day of the holiday.
60hk | . Create standing dates and dedicate time to regular activities together. Be transparent with partners about any standing dates you already have with other partners or any standing dates that you are looking to create. Also, be
5djf | transparent with your partners about specific activities or terms of endearment that are designated just for certain relationships. Some polyamorous people believe that you should never have certain things or places that only belong to one relationship, while other people have few qualms about this. I take the middle path on this issue because I don't know if it is completely realistic to abolish all expressions of "what's ours" from a relationship (some forms of couple identity can be very healthy in polyamory) and I've also seen the pow- erful healing effect that can happen when people are allowed to ask for some- thing they want to stay within a certain relationship. As long as it's transparent and understood to everyone involved what things belong to a certain rela- tionship and why, it can work well. It is additionally important that all relation- ships have the freedom to be able to organically create their own version of the things or activities that are theirs. It's key that requests are reasonable (e.g., we like to listen to this specific podcast together or please call only me "sugar puff" rather than limits such as you can't go to Mexico with anyone else or you can only do this sexual position with me). Allocating certain things to relationships can be workable, but definitely tread carefully and trans- parently, because these waters can become dangerous and hierarchical very quickly.
hem5 | . Create pet names and special terms of endearment for each other. It's OK to ask that some names or terms of endearment are only shared with each other. But again, be reasonable and very conscious and inclusive of as many partners as possible when setting up such agreements.
vfd9 | . Have a commitment ceremony with your partner. Currently in the United States, people can only get legally married to one person at a time, but there is nothing that stops you from having commitment ceremonies with other partners. You can create your own ceremony that you conduct together, you can have friends, family members, mentors or other partners officiate a cere- mony for you, or you can find an officiant friendly to nonmonogamy to help you co-create and perform a ceremony that is meaningful to you and your
jkgk | partners.
8nom | . Step out of your routines and rituals. Set aside a day that is unscheduled to spend together, whether at home or doing something out in the world that you normally don't do together.
vsjd | T: TURNING TOWARDS AFTER CONFLICT
tucm | In any relationship, ruptures are inevitable. Relationships are not static but an ongoing flow of harmony to disharmony, rupture and repair, connection, discon- nection and back into connection again. We are all different from each other and so we are all eventually going to slip up, make mistakes, say things that we wish we could take back or forget things that are important to our partners. Even if we want- ed to be, we can't be perfectly present and attentive to our partners all the time, every time. What matters is not that we have ruptures, but how we repair them. When there is conflict and disagreement or when attunement and connection have been lost, it is how we repair and find our way back to our partners that builds se- cure attachment and relational resilience. Conflicts left unrepaired can leave lasting effects on our sense of trust, safety and security. In terms of attachment styles, people functioning from a secure style are more likely to use constructive and mutually beneficial problem-solving strategies than people who are more anxiously attached. They are also more likely to accommodate their partners than people who are avoidantly attached, demonstrating their joint concern for their own interests and their partner's interests as well as for enhancing the relationship.
prly | The Gottman Institute has conducted decades of research on couples and found that the main difference between happy couples and unhappy couples is not that happy couples don't have arguments or make mistakes, but that they are better and faster at doing the repair work when breaches have occurred.71 Couples that are described as the masters of relationships, versus what the Gottman Institute names the disasters of relationships, still experience episodes of yelling, being mean to each other, defensiveness, being critical or shutting down, but these cou- ples are also willing to admit responsibility for their part in the conflict so they can
2epy | begin the process of healing their bond. The masters of relationships are able to learn from what went wrong and see that repairing the relationship is more impor- tant than the problem itself. The Gottman Institute also found that how skillful someone's repair attempt was did not necessarily predict how effective the repair was. Repairs didn't have to be perfectly executed as much as they had to be gen- uine. I often tell couples and multiple-partner relationships that you can have all the communication techniques and conflict resolution skills in the world, but they do nothing if you still have an attitude of wanting to either be right or prove your partner wrong. I still recommend acquiring more communication and conflict reso- lution skills, but even without these, the right attitude-one of repair responsibility, humility and openness-goes far.
v55t | The Gottman Institute also found that resilience after conflict was related to how much a couple was making regular "deposits into their emotional bank ac- count." Repair attempts are much more successful when there is a pre-existing relationship culture of understanding each other, expressing gratitude and regularly doing nice things for each other, which supports the relationship in being better able to withstand the inevitable storms. Relationships that are regularly distant or disrespectful have much less success with their repair attempts, no matter how beautiful the attempt is. If you are already doing the HEAR of the HEARTS of secure functioning, you will find that conflict may still arise, but the repair work goes much more smoothly and even brings you closer together in the end.
53fa | Questions to Consider
nnb3 | . Are there certain themes to the conflicts that you have with your partners?
s943 | . When there has been a rupture, do you and your partners already repair well? How do you do this?
o7zd | . How are you at offering a repair? What comes easily to you and what feels difficult?
thxo | . How are you with receiving a repair from your partners?
b67w | · When there has been a rupture, what things could you do differently to better repair with your partner? What requests do you have for your partners around
hoze | this?
hd71 | Things to Try and to Experiment With
eix9 | . If a conflict begins over text, pause until you can either get face-to-face with each other or voice-to-voice, which will help in preventing further misunder- standings and spiraling out.
h4p4 | Don't be afraid to take a time-out if things get too heated. Many people know that taking a breather when conflict is high would probably be a good idea, but they keep trying to talk or process anyway, even though it is getting them nowhere or already getting nasty. When disagreements and conflict escalate to a point where you feel stuck, when you are triggered, or when there is name-calling, criticism or blaming, take a pause. Just make sure not to walk away without saying anything to your partners. Instead, let them know that you need to cool off and together decide when you'll come back together to address the issues at hand. What I'm describing here is the difference be- tween a reactionary or habitual fleeing and withdrawing, which can be counterproductive, and consciously taking a breather, which can be very pro- ductive when conflicts get too hot.
asp2 | · Keep your desire to be right in check. Remember your desire to be in the rela- tionship and as best as you can, try to stay rooted in being respectful to your- self and your partners, not just one or the other.
8d1n | . Check out the The Five Languages of Apology, by Gary Chapman.
559s | . If you experience regular conflict with a partner (or maybe it's less frequent conflict but very destabilizing when it arises), when not in conflict have a con- versation about what each of you needs, where you see sticky points that can be avoided or mitigated and what each of you needs for repair.
rhb6 | . Seek the support of a third party if conflicts are recurrent or seem unsolvable.
dpdb | . Check out the R.A.D.A.R relationship check-in method as developed by the Multiamory podcast crew to support regular check-ins and conflict manage- ment.

i22c | In this chapter, we explored how to cultivate polysecurity in your multiple attach- ment-based relationships. Implementing the suggestions in this chapter could take months or even years. Because of this, I suggest that you start where you are. In an ideal setup, you would take a certain amount of time to focus on each letter in HEART (e.g., two weeks on being here with your partners and then two weeks on ex- pressed delight, and so on), so that you can really dive in and get the lived expe- rience of what each of these components feels like and looks like. You may find that you already do some of these letters really well but other letters, not so much. You can skip around based on the needs of your particular relationship, but I would not recommend skipping over a letter entirely. Each one relates to and builds upon the previous in ways that are important for you and your partners to be polysecure. Some of you may also need to begin with the next chapter, on creating secure attachment with yourself before you are ready to apply the HEART of polyse- curity in a relationship.
ofle | * Since voice is so important to attachment, I don't want to dismiss that there are people who have never met in person, but do fall in love or start to feel intense at- tachments to each other just by talking on the phone or even messaging. However, I would put those experiences into the category of new relationship energy, limer- ence or possibly idealization, rather than include them in the formation of actual secure attachment.

tpiw | CHAPTER NINE
dgkq | THE S IN HEARTS-SECURE ATTACHMENT WITH SELF
hxjr | IT IS TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT to have relationships with partners where you are able to put into practice the HEART of being polysecure. Being seen, understood, appreciated and loved by another who is turning towards you with their presence and warmth is invaluable in its potential to offer the corrective attachment experi- ences that so many of us need. But healing attachment does not stop there. While I will not diminish the power that secure relationships with others have to heal our past and to bring alive our own secure ways, the establishment of a secure rela- tionship with our self is needed to fully embody healthy attachment with others, so much so that it requires its own chapter.
2yv3 | When we have experienced attachment insecurity with caregivers-whether in childhood, in our adult relationships or as disruptions in any of the levels dis- cussed in the nested model of attachment and trauma-our primary relationship with our self can become severed and the development of certain capacities and skills can become compromised. Attachment ruptures and trauma can also leave lasting marks on our psyche, distorting our sense of self through the beliefs that we do not matter, that we are flawed, broken, unworthy or too much while, simulta- neously, not enough. This is what needs to be repaired, and in many ways it is the only aspect of our healing that we are truly in control of, since the HEART of being polysecure requires partners to practice with and the other levels require group-or collective-based processes that typically go beyond the individual level.
opoe | Internal attachment healing is needed for the HEART of secure functioning to become possible and then take root in our relationships. Even in the most remark- ably secure relationships, being together forever is not a given. Your lives might still take you in different directions, partners can die, and even when partners are actively involved with you it is unrealistic to expect them to be there for you every time you are in need. When we are relating from attachment insecurity we can eas- ily (and often unconsciously) put too much onto our partners. We can make our
vr2v | partners into the source of our hope, love, strength, ability to feel or regulate our own emotions, as well as the source of our meaning and purpose in life. Our part- ners can be the inspiration for these things, as well as the objects or focus of our love, but they should not be the source of it. You are the source of your happiness, love, courage, emotional regulation and purpose, and the sooner that you can re- lease your partner from being the source of these experiences the better for every- one involved (metamours included).
m4jl | Knowing how to stand securely on your own two feet and how to be your own safe haven and secure base is fundamental to building your internal secure attach- ment. I would say this to anyone practicing monogamy, but it is even more imper- ative in nonmonogamous relationships. In polyamory, we need the internal secu- rity of being anchored in our inner strength and inner nurturer to navigate a rela- tionship structure that is considerably less secure. Inner security is also imperative because depending on a certain partner as our only go-to support system regarding our relationship with another partner, a shared partner or one of their partners can be triangulating, messy, inappropriate, divisive and even damaging. You must be a priority in your own life. Secure attachment with yourself means being aware of your feelings and desires, as well as being able to tend to your own needs and knowing how to advocate for them in relationships. In the absence of this, your relationships can be built upon a false premise, or, at the very least, will struggle to be sustainable.
