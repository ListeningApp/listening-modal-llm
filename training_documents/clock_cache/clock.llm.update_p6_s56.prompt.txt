You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

0fpw | Once the activated iron center, whatever it may be, is dis- charged, product is released with concomitant formation of the diiron(III) form of the hydroxylase that enters another cycle in the catalysis (Scheme II). A peroxide shunt, analogous to that found in the P-450 enzyme, has been reported for the M. tri- chosporium OB3b MMO16 and confirmed by us in the present work. As indicated in Scheme II, the use of hydrogen peroxide permits hydroxylation reactions to occur in the absence of the coupling and reductase proteins. Addition of hydrogen peroxide to hydroxylase isolated from the M. capsulatus (Bath) organism, however, displays only 5-10% of the activity measured with the complete, three-protein system.59
dqn8 | Mechanistic Considerations: The Hydroxylation Reaction. Scheme IV presents six possible mechanisms for substrate hy- droxylation following generation of the dioxygen-activated diiron center. In all cases except the last, O-O bond cleavage occurs prior to the C-H bond breaking step. The six possibilities are (A) direct insertion of the oxygen atom of a high-valent iron oxo species into a C-H bond; (B) concerted addition of the C-H bond to the high-valent iron oxo species to form a metal-carbon bond followed by reductive elimination of the alcohol; (C) heterolytic attack of a high-valent iron oxo species on the R-H bond followed by recombination to afford product; (D) homolytic attack of a high-valent iron oxo species on the R-H bond followed by return

lhkq | of the hydroxyl group from iron to the alkyl radical, a so-called oxygen rebound step; (E) abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the substrate by hydroxyl or another radical within the active site to form an alkyl radical, which then adds to the iron-bound oxygen atom; and (F) electrophilic attack of an n2, n2-peroxide or related species (Chart II) on the substrate to form a carbon-oxygen bond followed by release of product. Mechanisms D and E involve transient formation of a substrate-derived alkyl radical, which could rearrange as shown in Scheme I, and it is these pathways that are directly addressed by the present investigation. The carbocation shown in mechanism C(2) could also rearrange, and its involvement in the hydroxylation reaction would similarly be revealed by our studies.
82ju | Experiments reported here and previously9,15 with MMO from M. trichosporium OB3b indicate that a radical is formed in the catalytic cycle, and a paper has recently appeared reporting results that are consistent with a radical or carbocationic intermediate.45 No ring-opened products are observed during the hydroxylation of substrate probes 1-4 with MMO from M. capsulatus (Bath), however. There are several possible explanations for these results. The simplest is that radicals and carbocations do not form and that pathways C(2), D, and E can be excluded for the reaction mechanism for MMO from this organism. Alternatively, radicals could form but recombine rapidly with the high-valent iron oxo moiety before they have a chance to ring open. Although this alternative is reasonable for probes 3 and, possibly, 4, it is not a viable explanation for 1 and 2 since it would require a radical rebound rate constant greater than 4 × 1013 s-1. This conclusion is only valid, however, provided that the hydroxylase active site does not perturb the ring-opening rate constant of probes 1 and 2. Moreover, there are other potential problems arising in probe substrate oxidations within enzyme active sites, as delineated in a recent report of cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme oxida-
y2qo | tions.22 In that study, two "poorly behaved" probes gave much less than the expected amount of rearranged product. In addition to decreasing the rate constant for radical rearrangement owing to steric effects, the low yields of rearranged products might arise from a possible change in mechanism, for example, the onset of an insertion reaction, an increase in the rate constant of oxygen rebound, or reaction of the rearranged radical with another site on the enzyme.
1piq | Two of these potential problems can be excluded as the reason for the failure to detect ring-opened alcohols in the present study. Because the rearrangement of radical U' to R' (Scheme I) is fast enough to compete with any other process, it is not possible that acceleration of the oxygen rebound step without a diminution in the rate constant for the radical rearrangement could subvert the rearrangement. Furthermore, if ring-opened radicals were to react with another position in the enzyme active site, then the probe would most likely have deactivated the enzyme as a suicide substrate inhibitor. Although an extensive analysis of enzyme activity was not conducted for these substrates, there did not appear to be a noticeable loss of activity over the 15-min time course in these studies.
7fqw | The other possibility, that constraints of the enzyme active site alter the rate constant for radical rearrangement, is subtle and cannot be excluded. It is possible, for example, that the orientation of the phenyl group in enzyme-bound probe 1 is controlled by the steric confinement of the active site so as to preclude coalignment of the 7-system of the phenyl ring with the bond of the cyclo- propane ring that is cleaved. The imposition of such a stereoe- lectronic effect on the ring-opening reaction might result in a marked reduction in the rate constant for ring opening of the radical derived from 1. In the extreme case where the T-system of the phenyl ring is oriented perpendicularly to the cyclopropyl ring bond that is opened, the contribution of a phenyl resonance effect to the cyclopropyl-carbinyl bond breaking step would be eliminated, leaving only an inductive effect.
rhaz | The manifestation of an active site constraint enforced ster- eoelectronic effect on the kinetics of ring opening can be estimated semiquantitatively via Marcus theory.60-62 We have shown42 that the rate constants for reactions of the parent system, ring opening of the cyclopropylcarbinyl radical (5) to the 3-butenyl radical (6) and cyclization of radical 6, can be used to predict rate constants for ring openings of substituted cyclopropylcarbinyl radicals. In brief, the rate constant for ring opening of 5 at 25 ℃ (k, = 5 × 107 s-1 for cleavage of one bond)64-67 and that for cyclization
