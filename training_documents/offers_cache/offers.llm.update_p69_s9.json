Some immediate benefits after ten to twenty minutes (assuming you don't get frustrated)\nf8ht | Effort & Sacrifice\nq2it | Physical discomfort (numb body limbs often). Mental discomfort (feeling like you are failing at it constantly). Time sacrifice (you have to set time aside everyday to do it).\npiqi | Overall Value\nmjsy | Low\n01g9 | And that is why Xanax is a multi-billion dollar product while I know of almost no multi-billion dollar meditation businesses . . . value.\n7cm1 | I'm not here to argue about whether meditation is better than Xanax (obviously it is) but that doesn't mean it's perceived as more valuable.\noyk6 | This is also the reason that the supplement industry is twice the size of the health club industry. They both accomplish the same perceived objectives - \"being healthy,\" \"losing weight,\" \"looking good,\" \"increased energy,\" etc. - but one is perceived as more valuable because it has lower \"costs.\"\n3qp5 | People are more willing to pay two hundred dollars for supplements than they are a twenty-nine dollars per month membership. Taking a pill, or drinking a shake, is so much faster and easier than going to the gym everyday. Hence . . . valued.\nguux | Score\nfhkp | \"Relaxation\" \"Decreased\nur19 | One out of one\nytow | Zero out of one\nozjl | Point five out of one\nxux5 | Zero out of one\n53mt | One point five out of four\nowo1 | Xanax\nzz70 | Anxiety\" \"Feelings of\nslcr | well-being\"\nz9at | High, since most people are confident that if they take the pill, it will make them feel more relaxed\n7dov | Fifteen minutes for effects to\nznos | be felt\nbngy | Swallowing the pill\nxja2 | High four out of four\nb9a5 | Score\nthi8 | One out of one\nentm | One out of one\nknql | One out of one\nez57 | One out of one\nxwza | Crazy world we live in.\nkw2g | And you can either sit there and make \"complain\" posts about how people \"ought\" to be a certain way. Or you can take advantage of the way people are and capitalize. This book is for those people who want to be victors, not victims of circumstances.\nevst | You can either be right or you can be rich. This book is for getting rich. If that bothers you, just put this down and go back to arguing against human nature. Hint: You're not gonna change it.\nr4ei | Now, that being said, knowing what people value versus what is good for them is key. It means you can find ways to monetize the things that people value in order to give them what they really need.\nv3un | Win-win.\nmmh7 | You can make your dent in the universe while making a profit.\n15mo | FREE GOODWILL\nhaqw | People who help others (with zero expectation) experience higher levels of fulfillment, live longer, and make more money. I'd like to create the opportunity to deliver this value to you during your reading or listening experience. In order to do so, I have a simple question for you ...\n89i1 | Would you help someone you've never met, if it didn't cost you money, but you never got credit for it?\ngfu5 | If so, I have an 'ask' to make on behalf of someone you do not know. And likely, never will.\nmvzl | They are just like you, or like you were a few years ago: less experienced, full of desire to help the world, seeking information but unsure where to look .... this is where you come in.\nbuwu | The only way for us at acquisition dot com to accomplish our mission of helping entrepreneurs is, first, by reaching them. And most people do, in fact, judge a book by its cover (and it's reviews). If you have found this book valuable thus far, would you please take a brief moment right now and leave an honest review of the book and its contents? It will cost you zero dollars and less than sixty seconds.\nzsfu | Your review will help ....\nhyvo | one more entrepreneur support his or her family.\n5l9v | one more employee find work they find meaningful.\n6tv1 | one more client experience a transformation they otherwise would never have encountered.\nl79g | one more life change for the better.\nd8ia | To make that happen ... all you have to do is .... and this takes less than sixty seconds .... leave a review.\nv012 | If you are on audible - hit the three dots in the top right of your device, click rate & review, then leave a few sentences about the book with a star rating.\ncrl5 | If you are reading on kindle or an e-reader - you can scroll to the bottom of the book, then swipe up and it will automatically prompt a review.\nxqom | If for some reason they have changed either functionality - you can go to the book page on amazon (or wherever you purchased this) and leave a review right on the page.\nmwss | PS - If you feel good about helping a faceless entrepreneur, you are my kind of people. I'm that much more excited to help you crush it in the coming chapters (you'll love the tactics I'm about to go over).\nqba8 | PPS - Life hack: if you introduce something valuable to someone, they associate that value with you. If you'd like goodwill directly from another entrepreneur - send this book their way.\n24cj | Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Now back to our regularly scheduled programming.\nkkr4 | Your biggest fan, Alex\np3um | VALUE OFFER: THE THOUGHT PROCESS\nfcs1 | I want to do an exercise with you right now. I want to show you the difference between convergent and divergent problem solving. Why? So that you can actually create the Grand Slam Offer that will become the cornerstones of your business.\n5rxi | Convergent & Divergent Thinking\ncm65 | In simple terms, convergent problem solving is where you take lots of variables, all known, with unchanging conditions and converge on a singular answer. Think math.\nux5y | Example:\nc8vn | You have three salespeople who can each take one hundred calls per month each.\nalzc | It takes four calls to create one sale (including no shows).\n0dos | You need to get to one hundred ten sales . . .\nbc48 | How many sales people must you hire? Deduced Information:\nf3v7 | One salesperson equals one hundred calls\n8s6f | Four calls equals one close\nx7h9 | One hundred calls divided by four calls per close equals twenty-five Closes Per one hundred Calls\nygmb | Twenty-five closes per rep\n0o5y | Goal: one hundred ten sales total divided by twenty-five sales per rep equals four point four\ndnu3 | Since you can't hire four point four reps, you decide you must have five.\ndsty | ANSWER: And since you have three, you hire two more.\nci0z | Math problems are convergent. There are lots of variables and a single answer. We are taught all our lives in school to think this way. That is because it's easy to grade.",
