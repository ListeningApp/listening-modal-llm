        "content": "8oqt | In contrast to the pro-tumorigenic role of many GPCRs, GPCR-driven signalling has in some cases, been shown to play a tumor suppressive role, highlighting the complexity and the cell-context dependency of these signalling events. This is highly aligned with tumor suppressive roles for heterotrimeric G proteins in certain contexts as well. For example, inactivation of Ga-thirteen signalling, either by inactivating mutations in the Ga-thirteen-coupled Sphingosine-one-phosphate receptor two, or in Ga-thirteen itself have both been identified to enhance tumor progression in diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Moreover, the Kisspeptin receptor has been widely\n6zah | implicated as a metastatic suppressor in numerous cancer types. Similarly, GPR68 was first found to be a metastatic suppressor in prostate cancer and was found to be significantly downregulated in metastatic tumors; however, further work has shown that GPR68 is highly upregulated in pancreatic cancer-associated fibroblasts and represents an emerging drug target in this cancer type (Figure one). In another case, targeting of dopamine receptors in cancer has been shown to have highly tumor-type specific effects, where both activation and antagonism have been found to have anti-tumor effects. However, in the particular case of glioblastoma, targeting of the dopamine receptor DRD-two has shown to be a highly promising drug target, with the compound ONC-two-zero-one being investigated in clinical trials. Finally, ADGRB-one-three, also known as the BAI family GPCRs, are silenced or mutated in numerous cancer types (Figure one). See below (GPCRs and Genome Instability) for more details on the effect of BAI-one loss on genomic instability.\n4v5o | Mutations in heterotrimeric G Proteins in Cancer\nha9e | The unanticipatedly high frequency of mutations in GPCRs coupled with their complex expression and mutation patterns in different cancer types highlight the previously underappreciated role of GPCR signalling in cancer. Detailed work on the functional impact of GPCRs in cancer, exploiting novel computational biology pipelines, structure-function predictions, and functional analyses of the impact of cancer-associated mutations in GPCRs will contribute to establishing GPCRs as cancer-specific drivers. In contrast, the presence of hotspot mutations in heterotrimeric G proteins defines them as driver oncogenes in specific cancer types. Here we will summarize the role of heterotrimeric G proteins in cancer and as cancer drivers.\nxrnt | Signalling through Gaq G proteins- The GNAQ oncogenes\nc8ra | The Gaq family of heterotrimeric subunits, encoded by GNAQ, GNA-eleven, GNA-fourteen and GNA-fifteen, and their coupled receptors, are responsible for transducing many of the mitogenic signals initiated by growth factors acting on GPCRs. Members of the Gaq family activate phospholipase-C-beta, which cleaves PIP-two into diacylglycerol and inositol one-four-five triphosphate. Generation of these second messengers triggers the mobilization of cytosolic calcium and all together, elicit the activation of numerous downstream signalling events via regulated kinases and transcriptional networks. Mutation of the Gaq subunit into a GTPase defective, constitutively active conformation was originally modelled based on previous studies examining mutations in the ras oncogene. These Gaq mutants induced malignant transformation in NIH-threeT-three cells and were found to be tumorigenic in nude mice.\np1l0 | Since this original discovery, aberrant Gaq activity has been found to be involved in diverse pathological conditions including congenital hemangiomas, leptomeningeal melanocytic lesions, Sturge Weber syndrome, and recent cancer sequencing efforts revealed that GNAQ and GNA-eleven are significantly mutated in uveal melanomas. More specifically, activating mutations in Gaq or Ga-eleven, predominantly at Q-two-zero-nine, are collectively found in greater than ninety percent of uveal melanomas where they act as driver oncogenes. The Gaq family is also mutated in roughly ten percent of skin cutaneous melanomas. Uveal melanoma is the primary cancer of the eye in adults, affecting roughly two thousand five hundred patients in the United States each year. Nearly five percent of uveal melanoma patients who lack mutation in Gaq or Ga-eleven, possess mutually exclusive activating mutations in other levels of the Gaq pathway, including in CYSLTR-two, a Gaq-coupled GPCR, or PLC-beta-four, a downstream effector of Gaq, firmly establishing hyper-activation of the Gaq-pathway as the oncogenic driver of uveal melanoma. Uveal melanoma caused by mutation and hyperactivation of CYSLTR-two remains one of the most striking examples of a GPCR-driven cancer type to date (Figure one).\n1i8b | Studies investigating the mechanisms by which aberrant Gaq signalling drives tumorigenesis have revealed that compared to the transient stimulation of second messengers and mitogenic kinases after canonical Gaq stimulation, mutant Gaq requires a protein-protein interaction with the Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor TRIO in order to sustain persistent signalling. In in vivo uveal melanoma models, knockdown of TRIO phenocopies reduction of Gaq expression based on cell proliferation assays, tumorigenic potential as well as activation of JNK, p-thirty-eight and AP-one-mediated transcription. Remarkably, this signalling circuitry was independent of PLC-beta, the best-known target of Gaq and led to the activation of YAP, a transcriptional co-activator regulated by the Hippo pathway. The Hippo pathway is a tumor suppressive pathway, broadly involved in cell proliferation and organ size control, and has been found to be frequently altered in cancer. In uveal melanoma, YAP activity was demonstrated to be necessary for tumor growth and proliferation. Recently studies have shown that Focal Adhesion Kinase, is a central mediator of the Gaq-driven oncogenic signalling circuitry by controlling the activation of YAP, thereby representing a potential therapeutic target for patients with uveal melanoma.\n5sfj | \nvk4h | Mutations in Gaq/eleven at residue R-one-eight-three, the second most commonly mutated site in GNAQ have been found to cause Sturge-Weber Syndrome, a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by facial port-wine stains and ipsilateral occipital leptomeningeal angiomas, and are also sometimes found in uveal melanoma patients (Figure two A,B). Similar to Q-two-zero-nine, R-one-eight-three is located in the GTP-binding region of\nnsm3 | This article is protected by copyright.

Activating Gaq mutants have also been associated with congenital hemangiomas, and frequently found in a subset of other melanocytic neoplasms, including blue nevi, nevi of Ota, and primary melanocytic tumors of the central nervous system.",
