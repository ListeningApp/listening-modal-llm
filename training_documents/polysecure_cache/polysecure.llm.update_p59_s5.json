        "content": "ozp5 | When we start to dig into the current research on CNM and attachment, we find the research is extremely limited. As I write this book in twenty twenty, there are less than a handful of studies that examine the relationship between attachment and CNM. From a research perspective, this is insufficient. The good news is that what little research has been done thus far demonstrates that people in CNM relationships are just as likely to be securely attached as people in monogamous relationships. In a survey conducted with over one thousand three hundred people, Moors, Conley, Edelstein and Chopik examined whether there were any differences in attachment styles for people who were either in monogamous, swinging or polyamorous relationships. They found that there was no difference in attachment anxiety levels between people who were monogamous versus those that were CNM, and that people in CNM relationships were actually lower in attachment avoidance than the people in monogamous rela- tionships were. This research suggests that people in CNM relationships exhibit characteristics of secure attachment, maybe even more so than people in monog- amous relationships. A smaller study of one hundred seventy-nine gay men similarly found no difference in attachment styles between the participants who were in in monogamous rela- tionships and those in nonmonogamous relationships. A two thousand fourteen doctoral disser- tation investigated whether there was any difference in the attachment styles of\ndf15 | people who identified as polyamorous compared to people who identified as monogamous and found that there was no statistically significant difference in attachment-related anxiety or avoidance between the two groups.\ntuu3 | In a two thousand nineteen study, Moors, Ryan and Chopick examined the attachment styles of over three hundred fifty polyamorous people who were currently in at least two different relationships. They found that people practicing polyamory exhibited secure attachment styles with both of their partners and, interestingly, having more of an insecure style with one specific partner did not affect the attachment functioning of their other relationships. Similar to how a child can be securely attached to one parent, while simultaneously insecurely attached to another parent, polyamorous adults can have different attachment styles with different romantic partners that are independent of each other. While the current research on CNM and attachment is encouraging, the shortage of studies to reference creates a massive gap in the current attachment literature, as well as many unanswered questions about the rela- tionship between attachment and CNM.\n4lo0 | When it comes to advice on how to cultivate secure attachment in nonmonog- amous relationships, the literature is practically nonexistent. Some nonmonog- amous bloggers and podcasters have used their platforms to educate audiences about the different attachment styles as something beneficial to be aware of in non- monogamous relationships, but the conversation usually ends there. The only literature I could find on anything related to how to create a secure attachment in CNM relationships is an online article by Clinton Power titled \"How Secure Functioning Can Help Polyamorous Couples.\" The article is geared towards therapists working with polyamorous couples and it explains how to work with these couples based on Stan Tatkin's Psychobiological Approach to Couple Therapy (PACT). The PACT method is well-researched and has been designed to help adult romantic rela- tionships securely function. In the article, Power uses a case example of a married heterosexual couple in an open marriage. The wife is struggling because the hus- band is experiencing an increase in feelings and intensity with his secondary partner. Power proposes that the couple is struggling because they are breaking several\nyskz | of the secure functioning PACT principles, which advise us that CNM couples should:\n1y6b | . Put your primary relationship first before all other relationships.\nihhb | . Have clear relationship boundaries that support the health of the primary relationship.\nxvgt | . Go to your primary partner first with important news or life events.\nk2yr | . Manage thirds (meaning the third person, or in this case the secondary partner) to protect the primacy of the main relationship.\ny5vm | . Never threaten the security of the primary relationship.\ngraj | . Resolve conflict by finding solutions that work for both partners.\nstgo | When I present the suggestions from this article to an audience at CNM confer- ences, the room usually starts to rumble with disapproving laughs, grunts and even boos. Before offering my own opinion, I ask the audience to tell me what they think about these suggestions. The first critique that people usually offer is that this article promotes a very hierarchical version of polyamory that puts the couple in a position of power over the secondary partner, who would have no rights or say in the boundaries that were set or the solutions that were created, even though they directly impact her and the relationship she is in. People in the audience are often also irritated by how this article only speaks to one version of CNM, which might work for people practicing hierarchical polyamory or open marriage, but that com- pletely overlooks people who are solo poly, nonhierarchical polyamory or rela- tionship anarchist. When the audience contains experienced therapists or coaches who work with nonmonogamous couples, they will also often add that part of the issue here is that this couple is functioning from two different forms of non- monogamy (the wife wanting more of an open marriage style of nonmonogamy and the husband being more polyamorous in his approach), and that the article is encouraging them to take on her style over his without deeper discussion.\nr4hn | In addition to the feedback that the audience has to offer, my critique of this article is that it is relying too much on the structure of the relationship to ensure and safeguard secure attachment instead of the quality of relating between partners\n7nts | to forge secure attachment. When we rely on the structure of our relationship, whether that is through being monogamous with someone or practicing hierar- chical forms of CNM, we run the risk of forgetting that secure attachment is an embodied expression built upon how we consistently respond and attune to each other, not something that gets created through structure and hierarchy. Secure at- tachment is created through the quality of experience we have with our partners, not through the notion or the fact of either being married or being a primary partner. The narratives people have about love, marriage, primary partnership and how to achieve relationship security are powerful, so much so that just the idea of being in love, married or in a primary partnership can lead us to think we are experiencing attachment security when in reality we might not be. We often assume that having more structural ties in a relationship means more security. In some cases it does, but as the high rates of divorce and cheating demonstrate, even a monogamous marriage that typically represents the pinnacle of relationship security is not necessarily any more secure than other forms of relationship. People can commit to being married for life, but still feel universes away from the person they share a bed with. Two people can consider each other primary partners but still experience relational neglect even though they might technically be able to wield veto power over other partners or have first choice on how holidays are spent. Relationship structure does not guarantee emotional security.\n68kv | I've witnessed many couples who have measured their sense of personal and relationship security based on the fact of having shared finances, being legally married, running a business together, co-owning a home or how many carats the engagement ring has. These more structural demonstrations of security can be signs of genuine commitment and they undoubtedly make it more difficult for someone to just pick up and leave one day, but they do not ensure the high-quality attunement, presence and responsiveness that foster secure attachment at the inter- personal level. Here are some signs that might indicate that you are relying more on the structure of your relationship for your attachment and security than the emotional experience of your relationship:\n0b1o | . You theoretically know your partner loves you and is ultimately committed to you, your marriage and/or your family, but you don't feel personally valued, seen or cherished.\n```",
