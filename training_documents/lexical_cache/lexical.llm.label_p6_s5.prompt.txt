You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

m047 | Over nearly 50 years, however, perceptual studies have elaborated but not fundamentally altered the early claims concerning the suprasegmental dimen- sions involved. Syllables are perceived to be stressed if they exhibit F0 excursion (Fry, 1958), whereby the timing of the F0 movement within the syllable can be crucial for determining stress perception (Thorsen, 1982, for Danish), and some types of F0 movement may require more excursion than others (Hermes & Rump, 1994, for Dutch F0 rise versus rise-fall). Greater syllable duration is likewise associated with perceived stress (Fry, 1955). These two factors are the most strongly related and the least controversial.
gy8c | More controversial is the common finding that amplitude manipulations only weakly affect stress perception (despite psychoacoustic research showing that quite small changes in this dimension are indeed perceptible; Sorin, 1981). Turk and Sawusch (1996) found listeners' perception of duration and amplitude variation to be non-orthogonal; importantly, they observed effects of irrelevant durational variation on judgments of loudness to be greater than effects of ampli- tude variation on judgments of relative length. This, they argued, provided a rationale for why prominence judgments should be based on duration, or on duration and amplitude together, but not on the latter alone.
y4mj | Beckman (1986) proposed that a measure of total amplitude (across a syllable) could capture effects on stress judgments, but as pointed out by Sluijter, van Heuven, and Pacilly (1997), such a measure is inevitably confounded with syllable duration. An indirect amplitude effect may however exist, in the factor which Sluijter and van Heuven (1996) termed spectral balance; stressed vowels have more energy in the higher frequency regions of the spectrum than unstressed vowels do. A linear discriminant analysis of their measurement data suggested that the most reliable correlate of the presence of stress was durational lengthen- ing, with this spectral balance effect next in importance; overall amplitude had the usual weak impact on the analysis. A perceptual study of the spectral balance effect by Sluijter et al. (1997) showed that manipulations of this factor had a moderate effect when speech was presented to listeners over headphones, but a greatly increased effect when the speech was presented via loudspeakers! Sluijter et al. concluded that spectral balance directly reflects articulatory effort, in rehabil- itation of the claim that perceived loudness is the most reliable cue to stress.
vpgq | 270 Anne Cutler
ousl | Campbell and Beckman (1997), however, failed to replicate the acoustic effect in English; they found spectral differences as a function of focal accent, but not as a function of lexical stress in the absence of accentual variation; this would there- fore rule out analogous perceptual effects in English. On this issue, the last word may not yet be spoken.
m4ju | 11.2 Language-Specificity of Stress and Its Perceptual Consequences
a0mb | 11.2.1 Stress in phonological systems
ki8m | The empirical evidence summarized in Section 11.1 was taken exclusively from studies of West Germanic languages. The evidence is similar across languages because the stress systems of these closely related languages are, although not identical, quite similar (see Figure 11.2). However, Germanic languages do not serve as a yardstick for languages across the world. First, stress characterizes the word-level phonology of only a subset of the world's languages. Second, there is considerable variation in word stress patterning even within stress languages, most obviously in the contrast between freely varying (as in the Germanic lan- guages) and fixed-stress placement. Fixed-stress systems are considered in more detail below.
km8w | Little acoustic and perceptual evidence exists for non-Germanic free-stress lan- guages. Measurements of segmentally matched stressed and unstressed syllables in Arabic by de Jong and Zawaydeh (1999) revealed duration and F0 correlates "remarkably like" the results reported for English (p. 20). In Spanish, stress is perceived if cued by F0 and duration or by F0 and amplitude, but not by any one cue alone (Llisterri et al., 2003); syllable weight and lexical analogy also affect stress perception (Face, 2000, 2003). Williams' (1985) experiments on synthesized Welsh minimal stress pairs found strong effects of duration on listeners' stress judgments, but inconsistent effects of F0. In Thai (a tone language), stress is signaled effectively by duration alone (Potisuk, Gandour, & Harper, 1996). It should be noted that some forms of English can also show other patterning than that described in Section 11.1. For instance, in Indian English (Bansal, 1966) and Welsh English (Williams, 1985) F0 movement can be decoupled from stress; in each case this can induce stress misperceptions by speakers of other varieties of English, who may for instance be led by F0 peaks or movements on unstressed syllables to judge those syllables as stressed.
wzno | In general, stress realization (and its perceptual reflection) will be dependent on other features of a language's phonological system. As Potisuk et al. (1996) point out, F0 does not vary as a function of stress in Thai because of its preemption by the tone system. Shen (1993) also observed that prominence in Mandarin is signaled by means other than F0. And just as tone preempts F0, so quantity distinctions in the segmental system render durational variation less useful for other purposes such as signaling stress. Berinstein (1979) found that speakers of Mayan languages with fixed final stress could learn to use duration variation as a position-independent cue to stress judgment, producing similar performance to

iwn5 | Figure 11.2 Distribution of lexical stress placement in three closely related languages: English, German, Dutch (from the CELEX lexical database; Baayen, Piepenbrock, & Van Rijn, 1993); monosyllabic words (Mono) versus polysyllabic words with stress on the first (Poly 1), second (Poly 2), third (Poly 3) or fourth or later syllable (Poly <LATEX>\left. 4 / + \right) .</LATEX> The proportion of polysyllabic words is higher in the latter two languages; this is because the criteria for lemma inclusion admit many compounds in German and Dutch which are listed as separated lemmas in English. The tendency to word-initial stress in all three languages can be appreciated further when statistics for secondary stress are added. In English, secondary stress occurs on the initial syllable of about one-third of words with primary stress on the second syllable (7.7% in 25.2%), and most words with primary stress on the third (10.7% in 10.9%) or later syllable (2.3% in 3.6%). For German and Dutch, the values are similar: German 15.4% in 19%, 6.2% in 10.1%, and 3.5% in 6.8%; Dutch 12.7% in 20.1%, 8.1% in 10.5%, and 4% in 5.6%. Together, monosyllabic words and words with primary or secondary stress on the first syllable comprise 81% of the English lexicon and 89% of the German and Dutch lexicons.
uooz | speakers of English, but only if their language did not have vowel quantity distinctions - i.e., only if their language had not already preempted durational variation as a cue to something other than stress.
pxbq | 11.2.2 Culminative vs. demarcative functions of stress
jfsr | Lexical stress variation has the word as its domain. In each word, only one syllable bears primary stress (although a few languages may not conform to this general- ization; see Hyman, 1977, for further discussion). Thus stress is sometimes termed culminative within the word.
u15r | The single primary stress constraint does not rule out further distinctions among syllables which do not bear primary stress. Phonological accounts of the metrical structure of stress languages can encompass fine-grained distinctions of promin- ence within utterances (see Van der Hulst, 1999, for descriptions of the metrical structure of a range of European languages). Thus in English PRESident, primary
lq35 | 272 Anne Cutler
3g9w | stress falls on the initial syllable, whereas it falls on the third syllable in presiDENtial. But the remaining three syllables of presiDENtial are not all un- stressed; the first syllable is said to bear secondary stress. The vowel in the initial syllable is not reduced, whereas those in the second and final syllables are likely to be; however, the possibility of vowel reduction is not a prerequisite for a contrast between secondary and lesser stress (consider Spanish presidente, which exhibits the same relative salience across its four syllables as English presidential, although Spanish has no vowel reduction). It is an empirical issue whether dis- tinguishing between syllables with primary versus secondary stress (for example, in presi- from English president versus presidential) is perceptually necessary; this will be considered further in section 11.3 below.
d09o | The culminative function of stress may be contrasted with the so-called demarcative function, a term applying to stress which falls always at a particular position within the word. Again, one syllable within a polysyllabic word is the location of this fixed stress. The term demarcative refers to the potential for fixed- position stress to function as a marker of word boundaries (perhaps especially in languages with fixed word-initial stress, such as Finnish, Hungarian, Czech). Note, however, that fixed placement of stress of course implies that stress is not contrastive, i.e., cannot distinguish one word from another.
ylhz | These properties are potentially important in perception. If stress can distinguish between words, listeners may use cues to stress in identifying spoken words; but if stress cannot help in this way, there is no reason for listeners to use it in word recognition. Similarly, if stress can signal word boundaries, listeners may use stress cues for segmenting continuous speech into words; but if stress were to have no systematic relation to position within the word, it could not be of use in segmentation.
a3td | 11.2.3 Free stress and segmentation
ex5k | Most research on the role of stress in the segmentation of speech has in fact been conducted in free-stress languages: notably in English and Dutch. Although both these languages are classified as having free stress, the place where stress will fall is not arbitrary, but is determined by considerations of syllable weight; morpho- logical factors then conspire to place the designated stress-bearing syllable more often than not, as Figure 11.2 showed, in word-initial position. In typical conver- sational speech in English, the tendency to word-initial stress is even stronger than in the lexicon (Cutler & Carter, 1987). Listeners' behavior shows effects of this regularity; nonwords with initial stress can be repeated more rapidly, and attract higher word-likeness ratings, than nonwords with final stress (Vitevitch et al., 1997). The distributional asymmetry, combined with listener sensitivity to the pattern, opens the way for stress to be useful in segmentation in these languages, too.
9d4o | Indeed, a substantial body of evidence from both English and Dutch indicates that listeners do treat stressed syllables as probable word onsets. Missegmentations of speech are more likely to involve stressed syllables being erroneously taken for word-initial and unstressed syllables being erroneously taken for word-internal than the reverse pattern, both in English (Cutler & Butterfield, 1992) and Dutch

5esx | (Vroomen, Van Zon, & De Gelder, 1996). Thus a must to avoid heard as a muscular boy is a natural error - the stressed last syllable is taken as a new word, while the unstressed two syllables preceding it are taken as internal to another word. Similarly, English listeners find word-spotting - detecting a real word in a spoken nonsense sequence - difficult if the word is spread over two strong syllables (e.g., risk in [riskib]) but easier if it is spread over a strong followed by a weak, unstressed syllable (e.g., risk in [rIskab]) (Cutler & Norris, 1988; see Quené & Koster, 1998, and Vroomen et al., 1996, for analogous evidence from Dutch). The difficulty in the former case is explained as resulting from division of the sequence at the onset of the second strong syllable on the strategy that any such syllable (with primary or secondary stress) is likely to be a new word; consequently, detection of risk in [riskib] requires that its component phonemes be reassembled, while no such delay affects detection of risk in [rskab]. These findings suggest that listeners use distributional consistencies of stress placement to segment speech even in languages in which stress is not strictly demarcative. So far, however, similar studies of segmentation in fixed-stress languages are not available.
m5ka | 11.2.4 Fixed stress discriminability
byu8 | In fact, there are reasons for caution with the superficially appealing notion of a demarcative role for stress cues in listening. One relevant consideration is that the acoustic realization of stress in fixed-stress languages is "weak" (Dogil, 1999; Rigault, 1970) in comparison to stress in free-stress languages. Early measure- ments of Hungarian (fixed initial stress) by Fonagy (1966) found the unstressed final syllables of bisyllabic words to be both longer and louder than the stressed initial syllables. Janota (1967) reported that F0 did not serve as a perceptual cue to stress in synthesized nonwords for Czech listeners (fixed initial stress); Rigault (1970) found in both Czech and French (fixed accent on final syllable of rhythmic groups) an absence of systematicity in stress realization. For Polish (fixed penul- timate stress), Jassem (1962, cited in Morton & Jassem, 1965 and in Dogil, 1999) found no effective acoustic correlate of stress other than in F0. Dogil (1999) observed that Jassem's study was confounded with intonational variation, and conducted measurements of the same Polish words in different intonational frames; he found no consistent acoustic correlates of stress at all, and also no consistent reflections of putative rhythmic stresses in this language. Dogil proposed that in Polish, word stress has no other expression than as the abstract feature marking positions with which intonational movement may be associated. In contrast to lexical-stress languages, then, fixed-stress languages may not dis- tinguish stressed from unstressed syllables at all in the absence of intonational realization of the abstract difference.
76b0 | Another consideration is that although fixed stress is sometimes located at a word boundary, this is not always so (as in Polish, where stress is on the penul- timate syllable). Given that the process of spoken-word recognition involves con- tinuous exploitation of incoming acoustic information (see Frauenfelder & Floccia, 1998, for a review), fixed stress other than at a word edge will involve additional processing complexity. A third consideration is that fixed stress may affect all words irrespective of word class, or may be sensitive to grammatical factors.
