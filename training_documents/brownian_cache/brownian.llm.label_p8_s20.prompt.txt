You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

4exe | This is a modified Fluctuation-Dissipation relation with the term on the rhs accounting for the initial condition. Sending <LATEX>t _ { \mathrm { i n } } \rightarrow - \infty</LATEX> makes the rhs vanish and we recover the Fluctuation-Dissipation relation at equilibrium [26]:
0myz | <LATEX>\frac { d } { d \tau } \langle \varphi \left( t ^ { \prime } \right) \varphi \left( \tau \right) \rangle = i \frac { \sqrt { \Upsilon } } { 2 } \left( \langle \widetilde { x } \left( \tau \right) \varphi \left( t ^ { \prime } \right) \rangle - \langle \widetilde { x } \left( t ^ { \prime } \right) \varphi \left( \tau \right) \rangle \right)</LATEX> (79)
xh3i | III. APPLYING THE FUNCTIONAL RENORMALISATION GROUP
syiw | The fRG has already been applied to study non- equilibrium physics, see e.g. [28-39] for an incomplete se- lection of references. Recently, the fRG has further been used for averaging fluctuations in the temporal domain of Langevin dynamics in [40] but without direct use of the supersymmetry. As discussed in [41], the physically inspired conditions the authors of [40] require of their flow equations are straightforwardly imposed by the Su- persymmetric flow. The Supersymmetric flow equation itself was first derived in [16] but without making any connection to stochastic dynamics. This connection was made independently in [35] - see also [27] - which how- ever considered a field theory in extended spatial dimen- sions and smoothing the corresponding spatial fluctua- tions, not temporal fluctuations as we do here. In fact, the authors of [16] obtain a slightly different flow equa- tion when wavefunction renormalisation is included since they do not connect the action functional they study to Brownian motion and the corresponding equilibrium Boltzamnn distribution. This Supersymmetric fRG flow has only been very recently utilized in the context of stochastic dynamics in early universe inflation [41-43].
kg3t | The formulation of the fRG involves the Wetterich equation [4] which is a functional (infinite dimensional) integro-differential equation describing the flow of the ef- fective action between the microscopic and macroscopic scale. This flow is controlled by a parameter <LATEX>k</LATEX> that ranges from the UV cutoff <LATEX>\Lambda</LATEX> down to the IR regime as <LATEX>k \rightarrow 0 .</LATEX> In our Brownian motion scenario, microscopic regime refers to a small timestep to a long timestep. The definition <LATEX>\Lambda \sim 1 / \Delta t</LATEX> <LATEX>\Lambda \sim 1 / \Delta t</LATEX> the Condensed Matter interpretation of the cutoff being inversely proportional to the lattice size, the only differ- ence here being that the Condensed Matter lattice is in space and ours is in time. We will use the fRG ultimately to calculate correlation functions of the particle position. As this derivation uses known techniques and results we refer the busy reader to our basic equations and main re- sults of this section: equation (88) for the Local Potential Approximation to the RG flow and when we also include Wavefunction Renormalisation they are (95) and (96).
lvae | The fRG formulation adds a regulating term to the action in our definition of the generating functional:
o9sc | <LATEX>\mathcal{Z} _ { k } \left( J \right) = \int \mathcal{D} \Phi \exp \left[ - \mathcal{S} \left[ \Phi \right] - \Delta \mathcal{S} _ { k } \left[ \Phi \right] + \int _ { t } \mathrm { J } \Phi \right]</LATEX> (80)
121u | where the regulating term <LATEX>\Delta \mathcal{S} _ { k } \left[ \Phi \right]</LATEX> is quadratic in
zh03 | <LATEX>\Phi :</LATEX> <LATEX>\Delta \mathcal{S} _ { k } \left[ \Phi \right] = \frac { 1 } { 2 } \int _ { t , t ^ { \prime } } \Phi \left( t \right) R _ { k } \left( t , t ^ { \prime } \right) \Phi \left( t ^ { \prime } \right)</LATEX> (81)
1mvw | Crucially <LATEX>R _ { k }</LATEX> is an <LATEX>\mathrm { I R }</LATEX> regulator that depends on a Renor- malisation scale <LATEX>k</LATEX> and the modes. The precise form of <LATEX>\begin{array}{} \text { mentum/trequency } p \text { ot th } \\ R _ { k } \text { is not crucially impor } \end{array}</LATEX> tant and it is chosen in order to optimize calculations but it should suppress IR modes and vanish as <LATEX>k \rightarrow 0 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\lim _ { k \rightarrow 0 } R _ { k } = 0 ,</LATEX> ensuring that the full effective action is recovered in this limit. By defining the mean field as <LATEX>X \left( t \right) \equiv \langle \Phi \left( t \right) \rangle</LATEX> we can construct the Regulated Effective Action:
6d4s | <LATEX>\Gamma _ { k } \left[ X \right] = \int _ { t } \mathrm { J X } - \mathcal{W} _ { \mathrm { k } } \left[ \mathrm { J } \right] - \Delta \mathcal{S} _ { \mathrm { k } } \left[ \mathrm { X } \right]</LATEX> (82)
mqah | where <LATEX>\mathcal{W} _ { k } \left[ \mathrm { J } \right] = \ln \left( \mathcal{Z} _ { k } \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>X</LATEX> refers to all the relevant mean fields.
xxr8 | From the Regulated Effective Action one can obtain the Wetterich equation
rl4j | <LATEX>\left[ 4 , 5 \right] :</LATEX> <LATEX>\partial _ { k } \Gamma _ { k } \left[ X \right] = \frac { 1 } { 2 } \mathrm { S T r } \left\{ \int _ { t , t ^ { \prime } } \partial _ { k } R _ { k } \left( t , t ^ { \prime } \right) \left[ R _ { k } + \Gamma _ { k } ^ { \left( 2 \right) } \right] ^ { - 1 } \right\}</LATEX> (83)
vz32 | which is a functional equation determining how <LATEX>\Gamma _ { k }</LATEX> changes as <LATEX>k \rightarrow 0 .</LATEX> <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { \left( 2 \right) }</LATEX> is the second functional deriva- tive w.r.t. the relevant fields and STr refers to the su- pertrace - see [16] for details. The equation evolves <LATEX>\Gamma _ { k }</LATEX> from the microscopic scale <LATEX>\left( k = \Lambda \right) ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>\Gamma _ { \Lambda } = \mathcal{S} ,</LATEX> down to the IR regime <LATEX>\left( k = 0 \right)</LATEX> where the full effective action <LATEX>\Gamma \left[ \chi \right] = \Gamma _ { k = 0 } \left[ \chi \right] ,</LATEX> encoding the effect of all fluctuations, is obtained. A simplified derivation for one degree of freedom at equilibrium, which however captures all the relevant manipulations, can be found in Appendix
ncb0 | <LATEX>\mathrm { A } .</LATEX> As demonstrated in the previous section, our Brownian motion problem is actually SUSY QM. We can therefore apply the fRG technology and incorporate the effect of thermal fluctuations by following the flow of the effective action <LATEX>\Gamma _ { k }</LATEX> via the Wetterich equation. Synatschke et. al have analysed a system with action <LATEX>\mathcal{S} _ { S U S Y }</LATEX> in light of its underlying symmetries in [16] - see also [35]. We adopt their results here. They find that from a supersymmetric perspective, the appropriate regulating term takes the form
8mp0 | <LATEX>\Delta \mathcal{S} _ { k } = \int _ { \tau \tau ^ { \prime } } r _ { 2 } \left( k , \Delta \tau \right) \left[ - \dot { \phi } \left( \tau \right) \dot { \phi } \left( \tau ^ { \prime } \right) + F \left( \tau \right) F \left( \tau ^ { \prime } \right) - i \bar { \psi } \left( \tau \right) \dot { \psi } \left( \tau ^ { \prime } \right) \right]</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. + 2 i r _ { 1 } \left( k , \Delta \tau \right) \left\lceil \phi \left( \tau \right) F \left( \tau ^ { \prime } \right) - \bar { \psi } \left( \tau \right) \psi \left( \tau ^ { \prime } \right) \right) \right\rceil</LATEX> (84)
xjyk | where <LATEX>\Delta \tau \equiv \tau - \tau ^ { \prime } .</LATEX> Such a form was also suggested in [40], however we will see that compatibility with the Boltzmann distribution suggests setting <LATEX>r _ { 2 } \rightarrow 0 .</LATEX> The flow equations of [16] are discussed below.
mt0f | A. Local Potential Approximation
awab | In practice, calculating <LATEX>\Gamma _ { k }</LATEX> exactly is usually impos- sible and we must consider a truncation to make the
ixcc | functional equation (83) tractable. The most common approximation is the so-called derivative expansion. The Local Potential Approximation (LPA), the leading order in the derivative expansion, is the assumption that the only part of the effective action that depends on our mo- mentum scale <LATEX>k</LATEX> is the superpotential <LATEX>W .</LATEX> The effective action then takes the form:
8p6h | <LATEX>\Gamma _ { k } \left[ \phi , F , \bar { \psi } , \psi \right] = \int d \tau \left[ \frac { 1 } { 2 } \dot { \phi } ^ { 2 } + \frac { 1 } { 2 } F ^ { 2 } + i F W _ { k , \phi } \left( \phi \right) \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. - i \bar { \psi } \left( \partial _ { t } + W _ { k , \phi \phi } \right) \psi \right]</LATEX> (85)
pmgl | such that <LATEX>\Gamma _ { k = \Lambda } \quad = \quad \mathcal{S} _ { S U S Y }</LATEX> under the condition <LATEX>W _ { k = \Lambda } \left( \phi \right) = W \left( \phi \right)</LATEX> with
90no | (86)
jt0y | <LATEX>\phi \equiv \langle \varphi \rangle , \quad F \equiv \langle \widetilde { F } \rangle , \quad \psi \equiv \langle \rho \rangle , \quad \bar { \psi } \equiv \langle \bar { \rho } \rangle</LATEX> are the mean fields, and we also denote <LATEX>\chi \equiv \langle x \rangle = \sqrt { \Upsilon } \phi .</LATEX> In this approximation the only thing changing with <LATEX>k</LATEX> directly, progressively incorporating the effect of fluctua- tions on different timescales, is <LATEX>W _ { k } .</LATEX> This means we only have one flow equation to solve which turns out to be [16]:
qb7o | <LATEX>\partial _ { k } W _ { k } \left( \phi \right) = \int _ { - \infty } ^ { \infty } \frac { d p } { 4 \pi } \frac { \left( 1 + r _ { 2 } \right) \partial _ { k } r _ { 1 } - \partial _ { k } r _ { 2 } \left( r _ { 1 } + \partial _ { \phi } ^ { 2 } W _ { k } \left( \phi \right) \right) } { p ^ { 2 } + \left( r _ { 1 } + \partial _ { \phi } ^ { 2 } W _ { k } \left( \phi \right) \right) ^ { 2 } }</LATEX> <LATEX>\begin{array}{} \text { We notice that if we set } r _ { 2 } = 0 \text { and choose a local-in-time } \\ r _ { 1 } \left( k _ { - } \tau - \tau ^ { \prime } \right) = k \delta \left( \tau - \tau ^ { \prime } \right) \text { the so-called Callan-Symanank } \end{array}</LATEX> <LATEX>r _ { 1 } \left( k , \tau - \tau ^ { \prime } \right) = k \delta \left( \tau - \tau ^ { \prime } \right)</LATEX> regulator then this choice2 effectively adds a quadratic term to the potential <LATEX>W \rightarrow W + k \phi ^ { 2 }</LATEX> and leads to a relatively simple flow equation:
oae5 | <LATEX>\partial _ { k } W _ { k } \left( \phi \right) = \frac { 1 } { 4 } \cdot \frac { 1 } { k + \partial _ { \phi } ^ { 2 } W _ { k } \left( \phi \right) } .</LATEX> (87)
