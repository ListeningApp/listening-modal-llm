You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

e7zz | Preface
lhzk | Why this book on revival and its fruitage? Many today have a hunger for something more than just "playing church" and going through the motions of the Christian life. They want a genuine experience with Christ-for themselves and for the church.
wdpw | In these pages you will find Ellen G. White addressing these longings, pointing the way to that deeper experience and warning of some pitfalls along the way. She shows that God is calling those who say they are followers of Jesus Christ to forsake the ways of the world and to recommit their lives to Him. It is time for a genuine revival and reformation in God's church. There is a work to be done, a world to be warned of its coming end.
twiq | This can happen only under the power of God's Spirit, and God's Spirit cannot be given to those who profess to be His people until they know by experience what repentance and reformation is. Ellen G. White wrote, "The Spirit and power of God will be poured out upon His children" (True Revival, 19). But it is the responsibility of His children to seek this gift. According to Ellen White, "the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the church is looked forward to as in the future; but it is the privilege of the church to have it now. Seek for it, pray for it, believe for it. We must have it, and Heaven is waiting to bestow it" (Evangelism, 701).
cchx | Being born again, justified, converted-this is the beginning. But what about growing up into Christ? What about that lifetime experi- ence we sometimes call sanctification? Truly born-again Christians not only talk about Christ but live lives that testify that they are, in fact, followers of the Lord Jesus Christ. Revival is being born again; reformation is living a life of obedience through the power of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit that "Heaven is waiting to bestow."
2vma | The Spirit-filled life results not only in personal victory over sin but also in a fresh desire and ability to share the Christian life and hope with others. Filled with the power of the Holy Spirit, God's faithful ones will proclaim the final message that will prepare a

mo0p | people for the Lord's return. Satan will do everything in his power to stop it. He will try to convince us that there are shortcuts-easier ways to have the fellowship with God that leads to an empowered Christian life. He will introduce counterfeits for the power of the Spirit-counterfeits so deceptive that if God's people do not maintain a deep, living relationship with Him, based on the Word of God, they will be deceived. This book will, among other things, help the reader to distinguish between the true and the false.
tyxr | For more than 100 years Ellen White's much-loved book Steps to Christ has been a best seller. Young and old have accepted its appeal for commitment to Christ. For many, True Revival: The Church's Greatest Need will serve as a companion book, offering further guidance toward a life of genuine revival and renewal. Chapters 2-8 are taken from the little book A New Life (originally published as Revival and Beyond), and chapters 1, 9, and 10 are taken from several chapters on revival and reformation in Selected Messages, book 1, pages 121-152.
txaa | In these closing moments of earth's sinful history, surely God's Holy Spirit is ready to give us the power to finish our work for others and the work necessary for ourselves. Can it be that you will be one through whom God will do something special? May this book help you to experience the revival and reformation that will prepare you for the latter rain and the soon return of our Lord.
qz8s | Chapter 1-Calls for a Revival
y7de | The Church's Greatest Need
rukn | A revival of true godliness among us is the greatest and most urgent of all our needs. To seek this should be our first work. There must be earnest effort to obtain the blessing of the Lord, not because God is not willing to bestow His blessing upon us, but because we are unprepared to receive it. Our heavenly Father is more willing to give His Holy Spirit to them that ask Him, than are earthly parents to give good gifts to their children. But it is our work, by confession, humiliation, repentance, and earnest prayer, to fulfill the conditions upon which God has promised to grant us His blessing. A revival need be expected only in answer to prayer. While the people are so destitute of God's Holy Spirit, they cannot appreciate the preaching of the Word; but when the Spirit's power touches their hearts, then the discourses given will not be without effect. Guided by the teachings of God's Word, with the manifestation of His Spirit, in the exercise of sound discretion, those who attend our meetings will gain a precious experience, and returning home, will be prepared to exert a healthful influence.
5tu7 | The old standard bearers knew what it was to wrestle with God in prayer, and to enjoy the outpouring of His Spirit. But these are passing off from the stage of action; and who are coming up to fill their places? How is it with the rising generation? Are they converted to God? Are we awake to the work that is going on in the heavenly sanctuary, or are we waiting for some compelling power to come upon the church before we shall arouse? Are we hoping to see the whole church revived? That time will never come.
vqgg | Calls for a Revival
sbs5 | searching our own hearts, putting away our sins, and correcting our evil tendencies, our souls will not be lifted up unto vanity; we shall be distrustful of ourselves, having an abiding sense that our sufficiency is of God.
n413 | We have far more to fear from within than from without. The hindrances to strength and success are far greater from the church itself than from the world. Unbelievers have a right to expect that those who profess to be keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, will do more than any other class to promote and honor, by their consistent lives, by their godly example and their active influence, the cause which they represent. But how often have the professed advocates of the truth proved the greatest obstacle to its advancement! The unbelief indulged, the doubts expressed, the darkness cherished, encourage the presence of evil angels, and open the way for the accomplishment of Satan's devices.
