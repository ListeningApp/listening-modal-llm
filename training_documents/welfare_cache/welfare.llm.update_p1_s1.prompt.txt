You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

nhsg | Common path or continuing divergence in welfare state reform:
hy0l | A longitudinal study of Norway and the Netherlands (1990-2020)
4jmz | Introduction
b7cq | In recent decades, reforms in the welfare state and public services have been strongly influenced by New Public Management (NPM) and New Public Governance (NPG) (Fuertes et al. 2014; Jantz, Christensen and Lægreid 2015; Pollitt and Bouckaert 2017). Increasing efficiency through private sector methods has been a strong driver behind many NPM-type reforms (Aucoin 1990), and NPG ideas are reflected in intentions to make the administration more user- friendly, holistic and cooperative (Askim et al. 2011; Lægreid and Rykkja 2015; Reiter and Klenk 2019). Although the type and character of reform differ per country, an important common setting was the policy shift to 'activation' since the 1990s (Barbier 2015; Finn, Peromingo and Mwasikakata 2019), implying a change in focus from well-being to work, with a reduction of social expenditure and more flexibility of the labour market as important objectives (Hemerijck et al. 2012). 'Activation policies' often have been associated with shared governance characteristics, such as one-stop agencies, decentralisation, quasi-markets for service provision, reduced influence of social partners, performance management and the individualisation of social interventions (Fuertes et al. 2014; Knuth and Larsen 2010; Van Berkel 2009). Given the common premise of 'activation', convergence in developing similarities
0b39 | in structures and processes of welfare administrations can be expected after three decades. Nevertheless, national institutional contexts may influence reform trajectories and lead to a (re)confirmation of differences between states (Champion and Bonoli 2011; Jantz et al. 2015; Pollitt and Bouckaert 2017).
qecd | In this paper, we examine to what extent convergence and/or divergence occurs in reform of the welfare state administration, which we broadly define as administration and delivery of employment services, social services and the benefit system (Christensen et al. 2009). Unlike many studies with a shorter time horizon, we take a longitudinal, comparative approach, studying reforms in two countries over three decades. The paper takes the following questions as a starting point for a discussion of the reforms: What are the relationships and tensions between NPM and NPG, and how do we see these models reflected in the reforms in two welfare administrations? Is there growing convergence or divergence in the reform process and in current systems, and how can these tendencies be explained? We first discuss how such questions are more generally addressed in literature on public sector reform. Then we examine the reform trajectories and their consequences for the present welfare administrations, in particular on two key themes (Knuth and Larsen 2010; Weishaupt 2011): the relationship between central and decentralized governance (levels), and the role and position of key stakeholders (e.g. clients, social partners). We do this by examining two of the largest public sector reforms in Norway and the Netherlands (Champion and Bonoli 2011). With the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV) in Norway (2006) and the Structure of the Administration of Work and Income (SUWI) in the Netherlands (2002), both countries chose for a major change of their institutional framework for public welfare and employment services
1o7p | Next, we review literature on public sector reform to develop our analytical framework. We provide an overview of the methods and dataset as the basis of our empirical analysis. Our
cp13 | findings are presented in two steps: we analyse the reform paths in Norway and the Netherlands over the past three decades, and then compare their impact on the present welfare administrations. Finally, we draw the lessons from the reforms in the two countries, and relate our findings to theory on public sector reform.
bgre | Theoretical context
57lp | Literature on public sector reform distinguishes alternative, ideal-type governance models, including: the traditional model of public administration (TPA), new public management (NPM) and the new public governance (NPG) (or post-NPM) model, also called network governance (NG) (Ferlie and Ongaro 2022; Osborne 2010; Pollitt and Bouckaert 2017).
ukth | The TPA model has been characterized by a strict hierarchy, with permanent and neutral civil servants, who implement public policies that are determined solely by politics (Hughes 1998). Top-down planning, central regulation and control, and a high level professional expertise are main elements of the 'traditional model' that remained the most successful management model in the public sector for more than a century. Since the early 1980s, many countries have moved away from (some of) its principles and aimed to replace TPA for a rigid bureaucracy based on procedures rather than a focus on results (Hughes 1998). In the economic crisis of the 1970/80s and an expanding welfare state, more efficiency and manageability were sought and alternative models have emerged.
kpvt | The well-known alternative NPM model is a doctrine for a more efficient, cheaper public sector that is more responsive to its citizens ('customers'). NPM imported business concepts, such as management targets for performance, output measurement and contracts as main forms of coordination rather than hierarchical relationships (Hood 1991). It combined a central role for management with disaggregated organizational forms (such as business units and executive
jie2 | organisations), and introduced market mechanisms such as competitive tenders and performance rankings (Hood 1991; Pollitt and Dan 2011). NPM has been very influential but showed huge variation and also received much criticism (Ehrler 2012; Lepuante and Van der Walle 2020; Pollitt and Bouckaert 2017). Its emphasis on private sector methods has been contested and NPM is criticized for centralised decision making by public managers, rather than supporting decentralization in public organizations as it claims (Mongkol 2011).
d0ik | NPG (as a post-NPM model) promotes horizontal coordination between government and non- state actors to enhance broader legitimacy, support and resources for policy and implementation. NPG is often viewed a response to NPM-shortcomings (Klenk and Reiter 2019; Lapuente and Van der Walle 2020), but has its roots in older collaborative and network- based approaches (Ferlie and Ongaro 2022). In NPG, the pursuit of shared goals is central. Important elements are a holistic view of social problems, collaborative structures and joint leadership with cross-border skills (Van Berkel and Borghi 2007). Klenk and Reiter (2019) reveal that "the post-New Public Management idea has been very influential as an 'ideational weapon' to indicate a crisis of the New Public Management model", but they question a (large) practical impact of the post-NPM ideas.
0x0s | The origins of the three models have been situated as sequential in time (TPA-NPM-NPG), but empirical studies indicate that newer models are added to prior ones rather than replace them (Christensen et al. 2009; Greve, Lægreid, and Rykkja 2016). The result of the subsequent reforms is then an increasing hybridization, where various governance principles are used at the same time (Lægreid and Rykkja 2015; Van Berkel and Borghi 2007). Studies of hybrid public organisations show that principles derived from alternative reform models are not automatically well aligned (Fossestøl et al. 2015; Van Gestel, Denis and Ferlie 2020). Tensions have been identified between NPM and NPG due to mutual incompatibility; in particular between simultaneous aims for competition and collaboration (Qvist 2016). The question of
