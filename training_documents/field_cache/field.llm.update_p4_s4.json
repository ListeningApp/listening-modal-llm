        "content": "4jmz | More recent examples of framed field experiments within economics include my study with Jason Shogren exploring the efficacy of the contingent valuation method to estimate economic values of nonmarketed goods and services; Lucking-Reiley's study testing theoretical predictions concerning various auction formats; and Fryer's study of students' responses to an experiment offering some of them financial incentives for good academic performance. More recently, the wave of field experiments or \"randomized control trials\" executed in developing countries are often framed field experiments, which typically are geared toward advancing policy.\n\nb7cq | Of course, a plausible concern is that when subjects know they are participating in an experiment, whether as part of an experimental group or as part of a control group, they may react to that knowledge in a way that leads to bias in the results. A \"natural field experiment\" occurs in the environment where the subjects are naturally undertaking certain tasks, and where the subjects do not know that they are participants in an experiment. Such an experiment combines the most attractive elements of the experimental method and naturally occurring data: randomization and realism.\n\n0b39 | By combining randomization and realism in this manner, natural field experiments provide a different parameter estimate than do laboratory, artefactual, and framed field experiments. One possible source of bias in these other experimental approaches is that generally the subjects who choose to participate in the experiment are those who expect to gain the most (perhaps because they believe they are likely to get good results from the treatment). As a result, the estimated causal effect from these other experimental types, while valid, might not generalize to the target population of interest-which of course includes the subpopulation (often the majority) that did not volunteer for the experiment when offered the opportunity.\n\nqecd | Natural field experiments address this problem. Because subjects do not make a choice about whether they will participate, the treatment effect obtained from natural field experiments is, in the best-case scenario, an estimate that is both causal and broadly generalizable. Put simply, since participants in the natural field experiment are a representative, randomly chosen, non-self-selected subset of the treatment population of interest, the causal effect obtained from this type of experiment is\n\n1o7p | the average causal effect for the full population-not for a nonrandom subset that choose to participate.\n\ncp13 | Natural field experiments have recently been used to answer a wide range of questions in economics. By now, natural field experiments have touched nearly every subfield of economics. Papers in this symposium reveal how they have affected our understanding of theories in labor economics as well as in industrial economics. In List, I review a broader set of my own natural field experiments that have: One, explored the economics of charity. Two, extended Vernon Smith's seminal work to explore market mechanisms in the field. Three, measured preferences to advance our knowledge of issues ranging from benefit-cost analysis to why people discriminate in markets. And four, provided a means to test the implications of behavioral and neoclassical theories.\n\nbgre | Natural field experiments have addressed many other areas as well. More recent examples of clever natural field experiments include those of Karlan and Zinman, who use variations in how credit is provided in a developing country context to explore tenets of principal-agent theory. Using door-to-door salespeople in Zambia, Ashraf, Berry, and Shapiro explore how product pricing affects not only the quantity purchased, but also whether the product is ultimately used by the consumer. Finally, Hossain and Morgan use an Internet natural field experiment to examine how treatment of shipping and handling charges affects online shopping.\n\n57lp | Although my discussion in this section divides experimental studies according to whether they are artefactual, framed, or natural field experiments, these lines can become blurred. Indeed, in List, I present a series of field experiments-from artefactual to framed to natural-in an actual marketplace to provide an empirical framework for disentangling the animus and statistical theories of discrimination. In some cases, comparing behavior across different kinds of field experiments permits crisp insights into whether behavior is different across the lab and the field, and why such differences exist. In List, I used a similar approach, parsing the roles of gift exchange and strategic reciprocity in markets to explore whether, and to what extent, fairness concerns affect actual market transactions.\n\nukth | Over the past decade or so, field experiments in economics have matured to the point that they now readily One, measure key parameters to test theory and, when the theory is rejected, provide information to inform a new theory. Two, extend to both nonprofit and for-profit firms. Three, aid in bridging laboratory and nonexperimental data. And four, inform policymakers. A snapshot of this work is cited and discussed in the three papers in this symposium.\n\nkpvt | What Happened to Informed Consent?\n\njie2 | What issues arise when experimenting with subjects who do not know that they are part of an experiment? I have discussed this issue elsewhere-but it is worth briefly summarizing some of those\n\nd0ik | thoughts here. The Nuremberg Code of nineteen forty-seven was created as a way to prevent the sorts of immoral experiments conducted by Nazi doctors during World War Two. One of the principle protections devised for participants in studies was voluntary consent. Voluntary consent required that subjects one, are physically able to provide consent. Two, are free from coercion. And three, can comprehend the risks and benefits involved in the experiment. In experiments that can affect the physical health of the participants, voluntary consent remains essential. However, the case for voluntary consent in economic experiments is less clear-cut.\n\n0x0s | For example, consider a study that attempts to measure racism by sending people of different races but otherwise similar appearance to car dealers and then observing the prices that car dealers offer. The car dealer suffers no physical injury from participating in this experiment; indeed, the dealer may forever be unaware of having participated. Moreover, if the car dealer were aware of the experiment, that could quite possibly lead to different behavior. In a number of situations, behavior often changes when people know they are being observed. Clearly, natural field experiments should be subject to clear-cut and severe ethical oversight. In United States colleges and universities, there are often Local Research Ethics Committees and Institutional Review Boards to serve as effective advocates for the rights of subjects. With the benefit of such oversight, there are valid arguments for not making informed consent an ironclad rule in natural field experiments. That said, the costs and benefits of covert experimentation is not a settled issue and the interested reader should see Dingwall and Punch.\n\n4exe | The Promise of Field Experiments in Economics\n\n0myz | The empirical gold standard in the social sciences is to estimate a causal effect of some action, but amidst the complexity of the real world, this is easier said than done. Economists have long worked on approaches that seek to separate cause and effect in naturally occurring data. A few decades ago, a standard approach was to use multiple regression analysis in an attempt to hold other factors constant. But economists have now taken to heart the old maxim that \"correlation doesn't imply causation,\" and have in recent decades sought out a variety of other approaches.\n",
