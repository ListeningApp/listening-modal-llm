        "content": "ed6e | The lack of an effective learning process was manifested in other forms as well. A major cause for the failure to provide a timely warning in June nineteen fifty was the mistaken perception of the Communist bloc as a monolithic one. By this logic, a local North Korean military initiative was unlikely as long as the USSR was not ready for a global conflict. Five months later, the belief in a monolithic Communist world remained. For example, in the terminology of the FEC G-2 priority requirements, China was not defined as an independent entity but as \"Soviet satellite China.\" As in the past, this belief was supported by military considerations, primarily the assumption that the PLA's inferiority in firepower and air power made an all-out Chinese intervention unlikely \"without material assistance by Soviet naval and air-power.\" Since such a move by the Soviets would mean World War Three, the probability of a massive Chinese intervention was low. The fact that a rather similar conception had proved wrong five months earlier had little impact on this estimate.\n6qqm | A large percentage of the studies of the American intelligence failure in November nineteen fifty focus on the processes in Washington that led to authorizing MacArthur to cross the thirty-eighth parallel. Richard Neustadt emphasized that the unification of Korea had become the prime war goal despite being ranked very low on President Truman's order of priorities. Irving Janis, who regarded the crossing into North Korea as \"the Truman administration's Bay of Pigs,\" convincingly used his groupthink hypothesis to explain how sober and experienced policymakers \"could succumb to the 'intoxication of success,' indulge in 'wishful thinking,' and collectively take enormous risks in a state of 'euphoria and optimism.'\" Others emphasized the dominance of MacArthur's wishful estimation, which reflected Willoughby's underestimation of the Chinese threat. Another explanation involved the influence of the hawkish group, primarily John Allison, Dean Rusk, and John Foster Dulles (also known as the \"Acheson group\") in the State Department's discussions and the insufficient impact of Soviet and Chinese affairs' experts, such as George Kennan, \"Chip\" Bohlen, and George Butler. The military urge, particularly after the humiliating retreat in the first stage of the war, to exploit success and advance into North Korea proved irresistible, and public opinion supporting escalation and the atmosphere of McCarthyism in the country at the time contributed to this outcome as well. Some explanations focus less on the atmosphere in which the decision was made and more on the role of the mistaken perception of the Communist world as monolithic, or on the American tendency toward mirror-imaging when asserting the Chinese war intentions.\nonum | This study does not focus on the decision-making processes in the JCS, the State Department, or the White House, but on the more significant failure, the one attributed mainly to FEC G-2, to warn of an incoming massive Chinese counteroffensive prior to MacArthur's \"home by Christmas offensive.\" This failure is, indeed, striking in light of Beijing's public and diplomatic warnings, repeated reports from POWs that the PLA had crossed the Yalu, and the military confrontations of October twenty-five through November eighth, which proved that a massive Chinese intervention had already taken place without any earlier intelligence warning. It was this unrealistic and overly optimistic estimate that convinced Washington's policymakers to approve MacArthur's renewed offensive to the Yalu. And it was this estimate, which proved to be a major mistake, which facilitated the strategic military fiasco and the loss of so many additional American lives.\n3iir | The issue at stake\n7a0a | In contrast to the situation prior to the beginning of the war, when the Korean Peninsula ranked low in American intelligence priorities, the issue of Chinese intervention was considered critical and was ranked accordingly. Section Two in the presidential directive of September twenty-seventh allowed MacArthur to cross the thirty-eighth parallel provided that by this entry there was \"no entry into North Korea by major Soviet or Chinese Communist forces, no announcements of intended entry, nor a threat to counter our operations militarily.\" Although a latter directive expanded his room for maneuverability, the closer his forces advanced to the Yalu, the more critical the Chinese reaction became.\no1qp | The importance of the Chinese factor was manifested in the FEC G-2 intelligence requirements priority list. On October fifth, when the UN forces started crossing the thirty-eighth parallel, the possibility that the Chinese would send reinforcements to the KPA forces ranked the highest. Although it dropped to the second and the third ranks in the week that followed, President Truman's concern about Chinese intervention during his meeting with MacArthur brought the issue back to the top in the aftermath of the Wake Island conference. \"Strangely enough,\" as Appleman put it, the Chinese factor dropped to second place on October twenty-fifth, the day the CPVF launched its First Campaign.\njrik | The CPVF campaign constituted a clear answer to the question of whether China intended to intervene independently or not. But the command G-2's miscalculation of the CPVF OB led the JCS and the White\nxv78 | House to misperceive the motivation behind it. The Chinese factor continued to loom large in November and hindered the political and military approval for the UN advance to the Yalu. When the approval was given, it was not because of disregard of the Chinese threat but because of a mistaken intelligence estimation of its magnitude.\nsdks | The quality of the intelligence information\ny8fb | The quality of the intelligence information on the coming Chinese intervention was uneven. Sigint and Humint had provided a reasonable coverage of the PLA deployment in Manchuria in the months that preceded its crossing of the Yalu. As Willoughby's sharp critic noted, FEC G-2 \"accurately identified the massive Chinese build up in Manchuria, and recognized that PLA forces may have been committed in Korea by mid-October.\" The failure was in identifying the massive CPVF crossing into Korea. One FEC G-2 report typically illustrates both success and the failure: The success was the reporting of the October nineteenth warning, from a source in Hong Kong, that four hundred thousand PLA troops were ready to cross the Yalu, reported by the FEC G-2 on October twentieth. With it came the failure: the report also indicated that reconnaissance flights revealed no indications of a massive Chinese military crossing into North Korea. By this point, thousands of Chinese soldiers had already crossed the Yalu. Aerial photography failed to identify them because the flights took place during daytime over main roads, while the Chinese forces crossed at night using back roads and trails. Sigint was not much better. It provided indications of the concentration of forces in Manchuria but due to a combination of effective Chinese radio security and ineffective American Sigint collection, failed to provide indications for the CPVF massive crossing and deployment in Korea. Ineffective learning from the Sigint failure to provide information on the KPA's deployment five months earlier played a significant role here as well.\n521q | The poor quality of intelligence collection on the CPVF deployment can account for the American surprise in the First Chinese Campaign. But it cannot explain the surprise of the Second Campaign of late November. As Appleman argued, \"It is obvious that the FEC was in possession of a great amount of intelligence concerning the Chinese and their relations to the Korean War.\" Haynes was even sharper, arguing, \"By the end of the first week of November nineteen fifty, the FEC G-2 had enough data to identify the Chinese order of battle in Korea and should have been able to determine that the Chinese Communists had fully committed to entering the Korean War.\" Indeed, the battles that took place during the First Campaign and the reports provided by POW interrogations sufficed to warrant a conclusion that the CPVF OB in Korea was far larger than Willoughby's estimates indicated.",
