What comes easily to you and what feels difficult?\nw7j4 | How are you with receiving a repair from your partners?\nq8xw | When there has been a rupture, what things could you do differently to better repair with your partner? What requests do you have for your partners around\n1m55 | this?\n2zaa | Things to Try and to Experiment With\n4iwf | If a conflict begins over text, pause until you can either get face-to-face with each other or voice-to-voice, which will help in preventing further misunderstandings and spiraling out.\ngrmv | Don't be afraid to take a time-out if things get too heated. Many people know that taking a breather when conflict is high would probably be a good idea, but they keep trying to talk or process anyway, even though it is getting them nowhere or already getting nasty. When disagreements and conflict escalate to a point where you feel stuck, when you are triggered, or when there is name-calling, criticism or blaming, take a pause. Just make sure not to walk away without saying anything to your partners. Instead, let them know that you need to cool off and together decide when you'll come back together to address the issues at hand. What I'm describing here is the difference between a reactionary or habitual fleeing and withdrawing, which can be counterproductive, and consciously taking a breather, which can be very productive when conflicts get too hot.\nmrk0 | Keep your desire to be right in check. Remember your desire to be in the relationship and as best as you can, try to stay rooted in being respectful to yourself and your partners, not just one or the other.\nbash | Check out the The Five Languages of Apology, by Gary Chapman.\nxseo | If you experience regular conflict with a partner (or maybe it's less frequent conflict but very destabilizing when it arises), when not in conflict have a conversation about what each of you needs, where you see sticky points that can be avoided or mitigated and what each of you needs for repair.\n3oxf | Seek the support of a third party if conflicts are recurrent or seem unsolvable.\ngvhw | Check out the R.A.D.A.R relationship check-in method as developed by the Multiamory podcast crew to support regular check-ins and conflict management.\n4ta1 | In this chapter, we explored how to cultivate polysecurity in your multiple attachment-based relationships. Implementing the suggestions in this chapter could take months or even years. Because of this, I suggest that you start where you are. In an ideal setup, you would take a certain amount of time to focus on each letter in HEART (e.g., two weeks on being here with your partners and then two weeks on expressed delight, and so on), so that you can really dive in and get the lived experience of what each of these components feels like and looks like. You may find that you already do some of these letters really well but other letters, not so much. You can skip around based on the needs of your particular relationship, but I would not recommend skipping over a letter entirely. Each one relates to and builds upon the previous in ways that are important for you and your partners to be polysecure. Some of you may also need to begin with the next chapter, on creating secure attachment with yourself before you are ready to apply the HEART of polysecurity in a relationship.\njokf | Since voice is so important to attachment, I don't want to dismiss that there are people who have never met in person, but do fall in love or start to feel intense attachments to each other just by talking on the phone or even messaging. However, I would put those experiences into the category of new relationship energy, limerence or possibly idealization, rather than include them in the formation of actual secure attachment.\nx0bn | The five love languages, developed by Gary Chapman, are Acts of Service, Quality Time, Words of Affirmation, Physical Touch and Receiving Gifts.\n049a | CHAPTER NINE\nebc8 | THE S IN HEARTS-SECURE ATTACHMENT WITH SELF\nidjw | IT IS TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT to have relationships with partners where you are able to put into practice the HEART of being polysecure. Being seen, understood, appreciated and loved by another who is turning towards you with their presence and warmth is invaluable in its potential to offer the corrective attachment experiences that so many of us need. But healing attachment does not stop there. While I will not diminish the power that secure relationships with others have to heal our past and to bring alive our own secure ways, the establishment of a secure relationship with our self is needed to fully embody healthy attachment with others, so much so that it requires its own chapter.\n6561 | When we have experienced attachment insecurity with caregivers-whether in childhood, in our adult relationships or as disruptions in any of the levels discussed in the nested model of attachment and trauma-our primary relationship with our self can become severed and the development of certain capacities and skills can become compromised. Attachment ruptures and trauma can also leave lasting marks on our psyche, distorting our sense of self through the beliefs that we do not matter, that we are flawed, broken, unworthy or too much while, simultaneously, not enough. This is what needs to be repaired, and in many ways it is the only aspect of our healing that we are truly in control of, since the HEART of being polysecure requires partners to practice with and the other levels require group-or collective-based processes that typically go beyond the individual level.\n2hrf | Internal attachment healing is needed for the HEART of secure functioning to become possible and then take root in our relationships. Even in the most remarkably secure relationships, being together forever is not a given. Your lives might still take you in different directions, partners can die, and even when partners are actively involved with you it is unrealistic to expect them to be there for you every time you are in need. When we are relating from attachment insecurity we can easily (and often unconsciously) put too much onto our partners. We can make our\nmpyx | partners into the source of our hope, love, strength, ability to feel or regulate our own emotions, as well as the source of our meaning and purpose in life. Our partners can be the inspiration for these things, as well as the objects or focus of our love, but they should not be the source of it. You are the source of your happiness, love, courage, emotional regulation and purpose, and the sooner that you can release your partner from being the source of these experiences the better for everyone involved (metamours included).\nqlzy | Knowing how to stand securely on your own two feet and how to be your own safe haven and secure base is fundamental to building your internal secure attachment. I would say this to anyone practicing monogamy, but it is even more imperative in nonmonogamous relationships. In polyamory, we need the internal security of being anchored in our inner strength and inner nurturer to navigate a relationship structure that is considerably less secure. Inner security is also imperative because depending on a certain partner as our only go-to support system regarding our relationship with another partner, a shared partner or one of their partners can be triangulating, messy, inappropriate, divisive and even damaging. You must be a priority in your own life. Secure attachment with yourself means being aware of your feelings and desires, as well as being able to tend to your own needs and knowing how to advocate for them in relationships. In the absence of this, your relationships can be built upon a false premise, or, at the very least, will struggle to be sustainable.\nsa6v | EARNED SECURE ATTACHMENT",
