You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

hjlr | If anyone were to say: 'Why can we not have a British Karakul skin?' the foregoing remarks would probably be what he would be told by an expert-
0k3o | Suppose we use this example to illustrate, however partially, my remarks that something which belongs to one culture should not-in the metaphysical sphere-be imported into another? Am I not importing something from another culture, or even series of cultures?
a1r1 | It must immediately be noted that the relevant factor here is whether the import belongs uniquely to the culture from which it was imported, or whether it does not.
bou6 | If I import a habit, like wearing sandals, from Greece, where it is hot to Greenland where it is cold, I am doing the wrong sort of importing. If, on the other hand, I import something of use, like wool, from a place where it grows to a place where it can be used, I am probably doing something useful.
s7uq | 253
l11a | It is a sad commentary on the primitive state of thinking upon this matter that people try to safeguard their existing ways by excluding things which are of use and including things which are useless.
llit | The difficulty on the part of the ordinary man to know what is useful and what is merely secondary, cultural material, is in part due to his impatience and greed - he wants anything that might be useful, (or is attractive) in part due to the fact that nobody has told him the elementary fact that certain things arc not only useful but essential imports, and partly due to the fear that something brought into his life or thinking from another source might not suit him.
mf1f | From this point of view, in metaphysics, you will see that he is at a very low level of accomplishment, which would not be able to persist for very long in the technological sphere of a simple society after it had once been impinged upon by a more developed one.
m61m | Of course, there are time-honoured ways of introducing into a society something which it needs but does not want to accept. Many of them are still being used. King Abdul-Aziz ibn Saud, in order to 'prove' that the radio was not an evil thing, had to broadcast verses from the Koran so that clerics could testify that it must be a good thing, since it was assumed that the devil could not quote the Koran.
pnz9 | There was the case of St. Francis who in a famous story told the Pope that his ideas and organisation were really ancient ones belonging to the Church, which had been neglected and con- currently developed elsewhere and were now finding their real place.
1abn | In parts of the world it is still customary for someone who has taken a pill given to him under modern medical doctrine to take it to the local magician to have it made 'really potent' by means of a spell.
8un4 | More in our own locality of operation, you may observe the almost magical 'rationalising' effect of an explanation which en- ables the hearer to reorganise his prejudices in a seemingly orderly way. You can say to him: I am telling you the same thing which was preached by so-and-so, and here is the correspondence of the ideas.' He will feel much better. He does not primarily want
s0ti | 254
yhew | truth, he wants reassurance, system, safety.
aqjo | Or you can do it in another way. You can say - and it works - 'This does not appear to be the same but it works wonders'. This can stimulate his greed, enable him to overcome prejudices in the 'higher interest' of something extra possible for himself.
opdt | Why am I describing these mechanisms, and why do I dis- approve of them?
j6d4 | For no other reason than that they are the easy, superficial way. You may say: 'What I am telling you is the same as what you learned from so-and-so' and you may be telling the truth. This truth may be important, and its proper realisation can have a very important effect. But, once you say this truth, you may expect the hearer to use this important truth for purposes of rationalisation. Instead of letting the basic truth have access to his consciousness, he exhausts its energy for him by using it to make acceptable, to superficial thinking, things about which he has had doubts.
wmtt | This primitive and futile use of important fact is, metaphysic- ally speaking, the sign of an immature man or woman.
u5uc | This is an important point at which we part company with the more conventional psychologist. The latter, far from complaining about this 'mechanism of rationalisation', tends to regard it as useful (for integrative purposes, for example) except where it produces a state of mind at variance with social norms, particularly his own.
0d2r | But the psychologist as familiar to us today is generally dealing with what we call the false personality of man: the superficial (though necessary) intellectual-emotional system with which he works. We are attempting to contact and inform the deeper in- dividuality of the human being.
gly4 | How does this tie in with our Karakul Lamb? Quite simply. The people who think that we are importing something, even though we prefer to say we are re-introducing it, if they are 'satisfied' by our explanations and thus rationalise them through greed or for some other motive, are as inaccessible to what we are really saying and doing as those who disregard everything we say or do.

f69a | KEEPING CLEAR OF THE BOTTOM
ycgz | Indeed, in a more elaborate form, their reaction is the same as the ground-plan of this Mulla Nasrudin anecdote:
jb3e | 'That is a very dangerous lake, Mulla' said a local fisherman; 'and people who swim in it are always being found dead at the bottom'
e580 | 'That's all right, friend', said Nasrudin, 'I'll keep well away from the bottom .
kwv3 | Indeed, when this teaching is projected, as it in fact is, in an- other convention than the metaphysical one, the people who reject what we are saying in the metaphysical idiom often show a marked potentiality for understanding. Bear in mind here that it is only the superficial thinker who assumes that our teaching, if it is a genuine one, is not bound by the limitations of so- called 'metaphysical' vocabulary. It can be taught in any manner. But it can be taught to so-called metaphysicians only in the jargon, or some equivalence of it, which is conditioned into them already.
wxdu | These remarks should be absorbed because of the unacceptably narrow view unfortunately acquired by many people who try to understand psychological, religious, philosophical and metaphysi- cal ideas.
zdfh | Abdulkarim Jili, the author of the important Sufi work Insan-i- Kamil, 'Perfected Human Being' who died in the fifteenth century of the Christian Era emphasises that Being is thought, and the external aspect of Being is the world. Through the multiplicity of perceived ideas and objects, of course, Sufi doctrine holds that real being may be perceived. This is the doctrine of 'The phenomenal is the Bridge to the Real', but it is instrumental in function. This means that the things of the world which conduce to higher per- ception have little meaning but much potential use. People look for meaning and are ignorant of use. So they value secondary worldly ideas instead of choosing them as instruments.
i1dq | 256
hwux | Teaching Methods and Prerequisites
9opd | Q: According to the Sufis, is there any knowledge of the differ- ence between teaching and conditioning; and do people know what they want when they set out to learn?
sco5 | A: People are conditioned not only by deliberate indoctrination, but also by systems whose proponents themselves are ignorant of the need for safeguards to prevent conditioning. People are also conditioned by a constellation of experiences. In most human societies, unanimity of thought has been arrived at by an un- recognised conditioning process in which virtually all the society's institutions may be branches of the conditioning process.
8wy0 | This information is neither new nor necessarily exciting. But it is essential. What is new about it is that it has been concisely and effectively revealed in studies made in the West, notably since the end of the Korean war. If you do not know or believe the fore- going, you will either have to accept it as a working hypothesis, or else leave all attempts at studying other matters aside until you have caught up with this information in the generally available sources on the subject. In such a case your basic information is incomplete, and your prospects of progress are as limited in a higher sense as if you were trying to become an academic but were not yet literate.
a505 | Certain traditional teaching-systems have continuously main- tained the knowledge of this 'conditioning by environment' factor. The essence of their systems has been twofold: (i) to stress the fact of conditioning, in order to redress the imbalance produced by it; and (2) to provide study-formats and human groupings in which the conditioning cannot easily operate.
tv1d | No such systems deny the value of conditioning for certain pur- poses: but they themselves do not use it. They are not trying to destroy the conditioning mechanism, upon which, indeed, so much of life depends.
yuul | This is the first lesson: People who are shown for the first time
n7uk | 257
aeaj | how their views are the product of conditioning tend to assume, in the crudest possible manner, that whoever told them this is him. self opposed to conditioning, or proposes to do something about it What any legitimate system will do, however, is to point out that conditioning is a part of the social scene and is confused with 'higher' things only at the point when a teaching has become deteriorated and has to 'train' its members.
tlut | The second lesson is that the majority of any group of people can be conditioned, if the group is in effect a random one: non- contitioning-prone groups can only be developed by selecting people who harmonise in such a manner as to help defeat this tendency.
izqq | People who hear this may tend automatically to assume that this is a doctrine of the elite. But this assumption is only accepted by them because they are ignorant of the process and the bases. The primary object is to associate people together who can avoid conditioning, so that a development can take place among these people which in turn can be passed on to larger numbers. It can never be applied to large numbers of people directly.
r93i | Many people who hear for the first time that conditioning is a powerful, unrecognised and spiritually ineffective development react in another manner which is equally useless. They assume that since conditioning is present in all the institutions known to them (including any which they themselves esteem highly) that it must always be essential. This is only due to the fact that they are not willing to face the fact that any institution may become in- vaded by a tendency which is dangerous to it. This is not the same as saying that the institution is based upon it.
milo | When people are collected together to be exposed to materials which will defy or avoid conditioning, they will always tend to become uncomfortable. This discomfort is due to the fact that they are not receiving from these materials the stimuli to which they have become accustomed as conditioned people. But, since they generally lack the full perception of what is in the materials, (and since it is a characteristic of conditioning materials that they may masquerade as independently arrived-at facts), such people do not know what to do. The solution to this problem which they will
hs4w | 258
voba | tend to adopt is some kind of rationalisation. If they receive no accustomed stimulus of an emotional sort, they will regard the new or carefully selected materials as 'insipid'.
tyxu | This is is a further lesson. Everyone should realise that the vicious circle must be broken somewhere and somehow. To substitute one conditioning for another is sometimes ridiculous. To provide people with a stimulus of a kind to which they have become accustomed may be a public or social service: it is not teaching activity of a higher sort.
q342 | Unfortunately people have been so trained as to imagine that something which is hard to understand or hard to do, in a crude sense, is a true exercise. Hence, people are often willing to sacrifice money, physical effort, time, comfort. But if they are asked (say) not to meet, or to sacrifice the attention of a teacher, this they find nearly impossible to bear, simply because their training is such that they are behaving as addicts. They may want sacrifice or effort, but only the kind which they have been trained to believe is sacrifice or effort. 'Stylised effort', though, is no effort at all.
au1k | Most unfortunately, they do not know that the system to which they have been trained has always (if they have developed such a taste for it as we have just described) fulfilled its optimum possible developmental function at a point long before we are likely to have encountered them. It has now become a vice, ritual or habit which they are unable to recognise as such.
jt2s | The prerequisite of an advanced form of teaching is that the participants shall be prepared to expose themselves to it, and not only to some travesty which gives them a lower nutrition to which they have become accustomed.
p530 | This is in itself a higher stage than any repetition or drilling or rehashing of words or exercises or theories. And, in its way, it is a challenge. Can the participants, or can they not, really enter an area where their effectively cruder desires and automatic responses are not pandered to?
zxwg | If they cannot, they have excluded themselves from the Teach- ing.
di8f | In order to become eligible, it is the would-be students who have to 'sort themselves out". They have to examine themselves and see whether they have merely been using their studies to fulfill social
1ipu | 259
o68o | desires, or personal psychological aims, or to condition themselves. They should also be told the simple fact that, for instance, if you shout 'I must wake up!' often enough, it will put you to sleep, jf their sense of power, for instance, is being fed by means of the suggestion that they are studying something that others do not know, they will get no further. If they are deriving any personal pleasure or other benefit from 'teaching' others, they will not learn any more. If they depend upon their study-community alone or mainly for friends or somewhere to go once or twice a week or month, they will get no further.
rvp9 | There has been a confusion between teaching and the social or human function. To help or to entertain someone else is a social, not an esoteric, duty. As a human being you always have the social and humanitarian duty. But you do not necessarily have the therapeutic duty; indeed, you may be much less well qualified for it than almost any conventional professional therapist.
wwgc | It is impossible to spend time with virtually any religious, philosophical and esotericist group, or even to read its literature, without seeing that a large number of the people involved, perhaps through no fault of their own, and because of ignorance of the problems, are using these formats for sociological or psychological purposes of a narrow kind. It is not that their spiritual life is right in these groups. It is that their social life is inadequate.
bjgk | 'As above, so below'. Just as in ordinary worldly considerations there can be inefficiency or confusion as to aims, so there may be in approaching higher knowledge. You may be able, initially, to pursue higher aims through lower mechanisms and theories, but you cannot pursue them by indulging short-term personal interests.
vz7z | You must follow your personality interests somewhere else. In an advanced society there are more institutions catering for such out- lets than anyone could possibly need. Make sure that your profes- sional, commercial, social, psychological and family needs are ful- filled in the society to which you belong. The rest of you is the part which can be communicated with by means of the specialised techniques available to those who have a comprehensive and legitimate traditional learning: and who have the means of safe- guarding it.
wk43 | This is what you have to study first of all. Most people are
1002 | 260
ujk8 | trying to effect something else, no matter what they imagine that they are doing. Fortunately, it is not hard to recognise this if enough sincere effort is expended.
