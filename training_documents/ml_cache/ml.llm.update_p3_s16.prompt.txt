You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

d5bz | The study of DNA, mRNA and proteins is broadly denoted as geno- mics, transcriptomics, and proteomics respectively. The genetic blue- print of a cell is explored using genomics, which looks at the DNA of individuals and helps us to investigate the presence or absence of certain genes (Gibson, 2015; Vogel and Motulsky, 1997). Transcriptomics studies the transcribed genetic material and examines the genes which
ap5o | are actively expressed and provides information about what is happening at the cellular level (Milward et al., 2016). Proteomics helps in characterising the information flow happening within the cell and the organism in the form of protein pathways and their networks (Wu et al., 2014).
7zvf | Although metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics do not form part of the central dogma analysis (Cobb, 2017), they still provide an invaluable amount of information regarding the metabolites, lipids and glycans (synthesised by the proteome via biosynthetic pathways) (Barh et al., 2011). These substances are the intermediate products of a cell's information flow and therefore are considered to be excellent indicators of the cell's activity. Similar to single-genome studies, metagenomics is used to sequence genetic information from environmental samples without the requirement of isolating individual species (Hugenholtz and Tyson, 2008).
mov9 | All measured omics data can be used as a biomarker which helps us to understand and analyse the underlying characteristics and complex- ities of biological systems (Alberts et al., 2008). Table 1 shows some of the important omics used to study biological systems (Handelsman et al., 1998; Kuska, 1998; Lindon et al., 2011; "Proteomics, transcriptomics,", 1999; Vasta and Ahmed, 2008; Wang et al., 2016; Wilkins and Appel, 2007). All of them are part of the same pipeline of biological informa- tion, whose output depends on the different inputs and regulation. As shown in Table 1, each of these omics can be measured using specialised high-throughput technologies (for example microarray (Bumgarner, 2013) and mass spectrometry (Glaves et al., 2014) for genomics and
ks7m | metabolomics respectively). The table also includes a list of recent re- views on each of these omics. High-throughput generated omics data (Lightbody et al., 2019) has played a pivotal role in developing precision medicine biomarkers for diseases such as Alzheimer's (Hampel et al., 2017; Hampel et al., 2016; Kovacs, 2016), diabetes (Capobianco, 2017; McCarthy, 2017; Mutie et al., 2017), cancer (Borad and LoRusso, 2017; Senft et al., 2017), hypertension (Barnes et al., 2016; Dominiczak et al., 2017), cardiovascular (Costantino et al., 2017) and chronic respiratory diseases (Agache and Rogozea, 2017; Hanania and Diamant, 2017). Recently, these omics have also been integrated for COVID-19 studies (Barh et al., 2020; Overmyer et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Many other specialised omics have also emerged such as pharmacogenomics (Wang, 2010), methylomics (Liu et al., 2013), interactomics (Luck et al., 2017) and radiomics (Lambin et al., 2017; Wong et al., 2016).
w1w1 | Overall, these omics provide a complete picture of cell biology and related cellular function (Cox, 2009). This provided the impetus for the development of various software mechanisms which can offer a pre- diction of a particular phenotype while using the available next- generation multi-omics data (Ritchie et al., 2015). Furthermore, they can be utilised to develop materials and devices which be used for diagnostic and preventive purpose at the molecular level while targeting molecules with greater accuracy (Giovanni Martinelli et al., 2015).
h8gv | 2.2. Machine learning
kwkp | Classical statistical modelling has always been the de facto standard choice for health data analysis and its interpretation. In recent years, with the increasing availability of affordable computing power and high-throughput omics data and the success of artificial intelligence technology in various fields, the use of ML has become popular in health sciences (Lee and Yoon, 2017; Clifton et al., 2015; Hung, 2019; Barnett- Itzhaki et al., 2020; Kirchebner et al., 2020). ML can be used to mine information hidden in the experimental data. In contrast, a conventional statistics-based model is usually developed using statistical assumptions and draws an inference about a population from a given dataset (Bzdok, 2017).
yj0m | The objective of ML methods is to acquire knowledge from historic or
ewfp | present-day data and utilise that understanding to make forecasts or choices for unidentified forthcoming data measures (Gammerman, 2010; Obermeyer and Emanuel, 2016). To assist beginners in the ML domain, a glossary of learning approaches covered in this review (Table 2), standard ML terminology (Table 3) and commonly used ML algorithms (Table 4) are provided. The basic foundations of ML and its uses have been extensively covered in the literature (Bishop, 2006).
oczy | ML is employed in a wide range of scenarios, where designing and programming explicit algorithms with optimal results is challenging, such as email filtering (Dada et al., 2019), hand-written optical char- acter recognition (Memon et al., 2020), and computer vision (O'Mahony et al., 2020). Also, it has been deployed for self-driving cars (Badue et al., 2021), cyber-security (Handa et al., 2019), automated assistants such as 'Siri', websites that recommend items based on the purchasing decisions of other people and novel solutions to some of the challenging problems of the real world (Watt et al., 2020).
2ttg | Deep learning has emerged in recent years as the leading class of ML algorithms. It uses neural networks composed of hidden layers per- forming different operations to find complex representations of data. It has pushed the performance of classifiers beyond that of traditional ML algorithms, especially in scenarios involving large-scale datasets with high dimensionality. On the other hand, it is very computationally intensive, requiring high-throughput or high-performance hardware, and lacks explainability (transparency) in feature selection (black-box approach), in the sense that it is difficult to extract from the network the features that the network has found as mainly responsible for the task, e. g. classification (LeCun et al., 2015). However, in the context of multi- omic integration, deep learning offers an exciting opportunity.
