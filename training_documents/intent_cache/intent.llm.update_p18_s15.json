        "content": "hd7d | Sustaining the therapeutic relationship is an ongoing task that does not focus solely on interpersonal events. The therapeutic relationship process that occurs outside of the interpersonal events is the macro dimension of the interpersonal process of therapy.\nehux | Responding to the immediate events that occur during therapy is the micro dimension. Responding to these interpersonal events of therapy requires that the therapist detects the occurrence of an event, reads the client's reaction to the event, and decides on an appropriate way to address the event with the client.\npoxj | Both the micro and macro scales of therapeutic interaction play a critical role in the overall process of occupational therapy. Moreover, they are interrelated. That is, the nature of the therapeutic relationship has an influence on how the client interprets and how the therapist responds to interpersonal events; and, in turn, interpersonal events and their resolution either enhance or detract from the therapeutic relationship.\n2xvb | In some cases, the two scales of interaction are difficult to differentiate. For example, some therapy relationships last only one or two sessions. In these cases, a therapist must work to respond to a client and to interpersonal events with much more vigilance and self-control because a more stable underlying therapeutic relationship does not yet exist. Moreover, the interpersonal events and their resolution during the therapy sessions are the major\nm1hx | In most cases, however, therapy continues during a period of weeks or months, allowing the development of some kind of predictable pattern or usual way of interacting within the therapeutic relationship. That therapeutic relationship is infused and shaped by interpersonal events that occur in the moment-by-moment therapy process. It is also influenced by the characteristics and behaviors the client and therapist bring to the relationship as well as by the circumstances surrounding the relationship. These circumstances include such factors as the nature and unfolding of the client's impairment and the context in which the therapy takes place.\n9psh | It is the therapist's responsibility to manage and continually strive to fortify the therapeutic relationship and to seek optimal resolutions to interpersonal events in therapy. The stability and success of a therapeutic relationship cannot be assumed. Rather, it begins early in treatment with attempts by the therapist to build rapport, followed by other efforts to develop a relationship that meets the client's immediate interpersonal needs and is appropriate in terms of the circumstances of therapy and the demands of the treatment setting. Recognizing and sustaining a successful therapeutic relationship might include such things as:\naiqv | Sharing certain interpersonal rituals that facilitate bonding for example, paying a visit to a garden or other favorite locale within the client's setting each time before the ending of therapy.\n4klz | Witnessing the client enjoying or benefiting from therapy\nxz5d | Sharing mutual feelings of respect, admiration, or appreciation\nerwx | Feeling interested and engaged in the therapy process\nie7i | Being open and comfortable digressing during therapy for discussion, venting, or advice-seeking about events in his or her personal life without interfering with progress toward goals.\naksw | Being able to discuss and overcome the interpersonal events that might otherwise challenge the relationship\n0fsl | Having a long-standing private joke with a client\n0m3g | Sharing a certain intensity of eye contact that communicates mutual trust\n9sp0 | Noticing a certain way a client laughs that conveys her\nnbpk | Chapter three A Model of the Intentional Relationship sixty-nine\nxs3r | These are only a few examples among myriad factors that might contribute to a successful therapeutic relationship. It is the responsibility of the therapist to be vigilant to explore, identify, and sustain the factors that contribute to a relationship that supports positive therapy outcomes.\nffuj | This is not to say that the client does not make positive contributions to the therapeutic relationship. In most instances, clients bring important or essential characteristics and behaviors into the relationship. However, the fundamental difference is that it is the therapist who must assume the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the relationship is positive. By assuming this responsibility, the therapist creates a space in the relationship wherein a client can be vulnerable, distressed, frustrated, or angry without fearing that the relationship will be ruptured. Moreover, this does not mean that the therapist assumes an expert or authoritative stance in the relationship. Rather, it means that the therapist must assume responsibility for the caring within the relationship.\nh7f6 | The enduring aspects of the therapeutic relationship are systematically built and fortified because of naturally occurring variables in the relationship similar interpersonal styles or interpersonal chemistry or other optimal circumstances and timing and because of the therapist's consistent efforts to build the relationship in the face of the inevitable interpersonal events and challenges that occur. If the therapist's efforts to build a relationship are successful and the client is not particularly sensitive, untrusting, or otherwise vulnerable, the therapeutic relationship becomes stronger through time and is more likely to withstand interpersonal events that would otherwise challenge or strain the relationship.\nt74k | For any number of reasons, however, the therapeutic relationship may not develop adequately to endure threats caused by the interpersonal events that routinely emerge during therapy. Signs that there is difficulty in the therapeutic relationship may include, but are not limited to:\nqdn7 | Change in affect, attitude, or interpersonal behavior\ndib4 | Becoming disengaged from therapy\nyvqj | Appearing or feeling impatient, irritable, or angry\nvz2f | Experiencing therapy as boring\nwyu0 | Questioning the utility of the therapy\ns8xw | Feeling questioning or criticism is excessive\nafv1 | Dreading or becoming apprehensive about the next\nfwf1 | Having a desire to refer or terminate prematurely\n3wck | Developing conflict with the client\njq2u | Noticing client's attendance pattern changes or declines\n9zf9 | There are several potential reasons that difficulty may emerge within the therapeutic relationship. For example, a client may bring a particular interpersonal history into the treatment relationship that makes it difficult for the therapist to establish rapport in ways that usually work. Conversely, the client may be mistrustful of the therapist because of the circumstances under which he is being seen. For example, a client may have been mandated by an insurance company to receive an evaluation for work potential, and the client perceives that the therapist has tremendous power to influence his life whether he continues to receive disability support. Alternatively, a therapist may have a negative reaction to a client because the client reminds the therapist of someone with whom the therapist has had a difficult relationship in the past. General sources of difficulty within the relationship may include, but are not limited to:\nclwo | Client brings a difficult interpersonal history into the relationship or has an Axis two diagnosis.\naki1 | Circumstances under which client is being seen are threatening or pressured for example, an evaluation is being conducted for the purpose of verifying disability to an insurance company.\nvf5h | There is a poor match between client's and therapist's interpersonal styles.\nl51p | There is an inability to overcome challenges caused by differences in culture, values, or worldview.\ns9zz | Client or therapist reminds the other of someone with whom he or she had a negative experience.\nx97k | Client or therapist disappoints or fails to meet expectations.\nqwix | Client or therapist inadvertently says or does something that is perceived as injurious, and the situation is not processed and resolved.\n6lnq | These and other obstacles to a more stable enduring relationship with a client are only intensified by inevitable interpersonal events. Examples of events that are likely to further stress an already-vulnerable therapy relationship include such things as a therapist's unanticipated absence for a period of time, a common misunderstanding that\nnxb1 | occurs between client and therapist, a comment or question that is perceived by the client as insensitive or inappropriate, or an unexpected personal crisis that causes the client to regress or temporarily relinquish treatment goals. Although they are normal and inevitable examples of difficult aspects of therapy, the way in which the therapist responds to them is a powerful mediator of the final outcome.\nkwpw | Irrespective of the extent to which the therapeutic relationship process is stable and strong, the process of therapeutic responding to interpersonal events is essential to good therapy. If a therapist does not respond adequately to interpersonal events or challenges to the relationship, the process of occupational engagement may suffer, and the therapeutic relationship process quickly erodes.",
