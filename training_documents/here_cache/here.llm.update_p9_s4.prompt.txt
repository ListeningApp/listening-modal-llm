You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

xek3 | Against this historical and global backdrop of a world imagined as em- pire and race, I seek to achieve with this book a degree of educational ac- countability. Although this phrase typically refers to holding teachers re- sponsible for student achievement scores on standardized tests, what I have in mind is that educators owe those they teach some account-if always partial- of what we have taught them about the world. The ethics of accountability, as I would cast it here, is about examining what this form of schooling has un- derwritten and who it has denied. It is about giving an account of education's and scholarship's role in a recent historical phenomenon that has had incal- culable global ramifications. The account called for here concerns the signif- icance of such divides as East and West, primitive and civilized; it concerns how the world has been constructed around centers and margins, and how these divisions were bolstered through forms of scholarship supported by im- perialism. As I am a teacher, I owe students an account of my work within the educational project that sought to put the world together in this way. I owe them an account of why education has not done more good in the world, why it has not done more to realize fully the democratic promises that con- tinue to underwrite public education. I owe them an account of why I re- main committed to expanding the concerns of education to include this re- flective and self-critical function.
bbpr | What might such an account sound like? Leon Litwick, in his presiden- tial address to the Organization of American Historians in 1987, captured the spirit of educational responsibility that I am invoking here, when he called upon historians to acknowledge that "no group of scholars was more deeply implicated in the miseducation of American youth and did more to shape the thinking of Americans about race and blacks than historians" (cited by Hughes, 1993, p. 123). This particular burden of scholarship does not fall, of course, on historians alone. It is distributed across the educational experiences that, in all likelihood, we and our children have gone through. However one wants to label this work-and Litwick would not use postcolonial to describe his position-there is a need to examine education's continuing contributions to what were and continue to be colonizing divisions of the world. Every- where in this work there is a worrying about the consequences of knowing
5zyf | that might have been inspired by the ethical compass set out in the eighteenth century by Montesquieu:
9own | If I knew something useful to myself and detrimental to my family, V would reject it from my mind. If I knew something useful to my fam- ily but not to my homeland, I would try to forget it. If I knew some- thing useful to my homeland and detrimental to Europe, or else useful to Europe and detrimental to Mankind, I would consider it a crime. (Cited by Kristeva, 1991, p. 130)
bqfb | This book is about the accumulation of learning that proved eminently use- ful to Europe and often detrimental to the larger body of humanity. It is con- cerned with what remains of that crime, as Montesquieu would have it, in the lessons we continue to teach the young and in the way many of us still see the world.
wwdt | To let students in on how their education may still be marked by Euro- pean imperialism resembles the project proposed by the literary scholar Ger- ald Graff (1992) when he calls on scholars to "teach the conflicts." Rather than following the typical pedagogical tack of "conflict evasion," Graff recom- mends that university classes explore the contest of ideas that dominate pub- lic forums and scholarly enclaves.18 Perhaps the recent controversy surround- ing Stanford University's Western civilization courses would be a good place to start in trying to understand the politics of imperialism's educational af- termath.19 However, when it comes to excluding dissenting voices, few insti- tutions can best the public high school, which is the educational home to a far wider range of the public than is the university. To hold off "teaching the con- flicts" of imperialism's educational legacy until college, or to treat it simply as an intellectual contest, diverts our attention from how the ideas of the prim- itive and the civilized become part of a commonsense division of the world by race, culture, and nation. The common sense of these divisions, I will argue, can be attributed to the success of this legacy, from primary grades to graduate school, from television's Wild Kingdom to National Geographic. This book turns to the less glamorous site of the public school because this is where most people form their ideas about history, science, literature, and other disciplines.
mn1r | The aim of this account giving is to afford students (and readers of the book) a critical distance from their own education, which may well, in turn be in need of revision itself one day; the aim is to hasten and focus chano that are already under way in creating a multicultural curriculum by offering readers a review of the history and the sort of education that have brought to this point. I do not intend the intellectual legacy of imperialism to be the whole of anyone's education, but neither should it go completely missing in a dozen years of schooling. Such teaching as I propose is not about realizing. or teaching to, the true identity of the student. It is intended, rather, to heln students understand their own education and the education of others as a worthy object of inquiry. Whatever criticisms of education this inquiry raises. it still reflects a faith in learning.
5vqw | In writing this book, I have sifted through the rich history of imperial- ism, drawing on primary documents and firsthand accounts as well as con- temporary polemics and advances in critical theory; I have worked with stu- dents, teachers, and textbooks in today's schools. The pattern I follow in this book is to move from the larger historical record of imperialism to specific components of today's classrooms. Along the way, I pause at the 196os as the critical juncture when the current generation of baby boomers that swell the ranks of today's teaching force was schooled and when twenty-eight nations, from Algeria to Zaire, successfully struggled through war and diplomacy to wrest their independence from the imperial powers. It was a time when Frantz Fanon published his scathing indictment of colonialism, The Wretched of the Earth (1963); and Great Britain attacked the UN for pursuing "a new and dangerous path" of decolonization as it pressured Portugal to grant inde- pendence to Angola, Mozambique, and Portuguese Guinea. Meanwhile, the United States was amassing some fourteen thousand military "advisers" in Vietnam while at home it faced, as Time put it, "the pressures of Negro revo- lution bursting out all over." Federal troops had to accompany African Amer- ican students to school in Little Rock, Oxford, and Tuscaloosa, while two hundred thousand people gathered during the triumphant March on Wash- ington to hear Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. tell the world, "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."20
