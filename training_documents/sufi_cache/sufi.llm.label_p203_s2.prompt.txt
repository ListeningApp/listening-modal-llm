You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

e0qn | IF YOUR HANDS ARE FULL
7343 | Terribly afraid one dark night, Mulla Nasrudin travelled with a sword in one hand and a dagger in the other. He had been told that these were a sure means of protection.
06l7 | On the way he was met by a robber, who took his donkey and saddlebags full of valuable books.
o1mq | The next day, as he was bemoaning his fate in the teahouse, someone asked:
ielb | 'But why did you let him get away with your possessions, Mulla? Did you not have the means to deter him?'
llcu | 'IF my hands had not been full' said the Mulla, 'it would have been a different story.'
4vdi | The use of the story, of course, is to indicate that people may have a transmitted formula ('weapons are a defence') without the ability to understand how to employ it.
kl0p | Like Nasrudin, they go through the motions, merely carrying the instruments . . .
czi9 | The unusual tenacity of replication of mere form which is to be observed in religious transmission is evidence of human determina- tion, not of effective content.
a3sj | The ancient Chinese, Babylonian and Egyptian civilisations, as social examples, for instance, endured for thousands of years not because they were especially good and true and necessary: but because they were promoted and maintained by determined men and women, and because there was in addition a quota of inertia in them which prevented laudable change. They did not develop beyond a certain stage.
fhkc | People appreciate and value form, and therefore do not at first appreciate the reality of Sufis, though they may think they do, mistaking certain outward form for Sufi reality. It is for this reason that the great ancient among the Sufis, Sahl son of Abdullah of Tustar, said: 'You may not appreciate Sufism at first, but once you do you will appreciate it until the end of your days.'
5hcr | 210
em55 | WEAKNESS OF EXPECTATION
8x5q | form can even include expectation, since people all over the world, and of all types, tend to prize the experience of expectation and especially the desire for reward. Form implies the acceptance of automatic or conditioned expectations, and Sufis therefore in their teaching circumstances defy this. As Yahya son of Maaz of Balkh said, over a thousand years ago, in this connexion: 'Ascetics renounce this world, but Sufis renounce expectations of the next one as well. Ascetics seek the pleasures of Paradise, but the Sufi is a stranger even to Paradise.'
wv87 | His contemporary Sari al-Saqati (who died in 867 of the Christian Era) underlines how the attachment to form and to one's self are intertwined, and says: 'True wisdom is non-attachment to the self and devotion to Truth.' And Sufism is traditionally termed 'Truth without form.'
97h8 | Talking of the limitations of question-and-answer sessions, the onus of limiting these to useful content and length is upon the teacher.
cj29 | In his Table-Talk*, the great master Jalaluddin Rum i said:
ekqn | The Night passed and our talk did not end: What sin was the night's? It was our speech which was too long.
hi3b | And do not forget the occasional enlightenment of what lurks within some supposedly spiritual people, which can slip out in question-and-answer circumstances. Traditionally, in India, couched in the form of a joke, there is an argument that false gurus can learn to be real ones by suddenly seeing their own inadequacies. This is the story:
3my4 | 'Guruji, why don't you enroll your boy into the Teaching?'
wizx | 'Because it is against my principles to teach the sons of the rich for nothing!'

lev6 | Dedication, Service, Sincerity
cnqv | Q: Is there any real sincerity behind the feeling of the sincerity that is open to doubt?
848r | A: One of the most embarrassing pieces of knowledge to have is to know when someone is doing something for his own entertain- ment, but is convinced that he is doing something for someone else.
o1ho | It makes one feel ashamed for such a person, and it makes me shocked by the cultural defect which has trained this wretched individual to imagine that he is serving someone or something, when he is instead obtaining personal gratification.
gd2a | At this time, and probably for some time to come, there is no hope that most of these people can ever be shown what they are doing: doing to themselves and to others.
z373 | Not least sad is the fact that, while someone is pursuing self- gratification believing it to be something else, he neither gets any deep gratification, nor does he ever do anything for anyone else, for a cause, for his real self.
38ni | Instead of looking at this problem, man prefers to preen himself and crow: 'Look what I have achieved since I came down out of the trees'.
effn | Isn't that more sad than still being in the trees?
ud13 | This is a most important technical problem. It can be solved, certainly in the case of some people. But first it must be observed. No culture of today provides any generally applicable theoretical or practical method of drawing attention to it, let alone doing anything about it. And yet it remains one of the major stumbling- blocks to human progress.
aoj8 | Instead of showing that disguised gratification-seeking is a masquerade, and just as inhibiting as any other make-believe (you can't do anything else while you are engaged in pretence) many human cultures sanctify and employ this flaw. Instead of saying: 'You are amusing yourself by engaging in this or that national,
1std | 212
m2cm | cultural, religious, spiritual game,' they may say: 'This is not a game it is serious. In fact, it is the way to heaven.' For lack of a high enough level of understanding, leaders of thought operate too shallowly.
2syo | This is because, at some time in the past, a shortage of tech- nicians who know what really is happening caused a majority of the ignorant to take the place of most of the wise.
dxsw | Giving people tasks, or letting them choose them, will often cither make them inured to such tasks, or else may cause them to derive sadistic or masochistic pleasure from such activities which entail service, dedication, suffering and so on: without an addi- tional dimension of insight.
ba75 | The only hope is for there to be someone present to prescribe, from time to time, what a person should do and what he should not do, to strengthen his real efforts, to prevent himself becoming a parrot or machine, or to stop sanctimoniousness getting the upper hand.
sod4 | It is unpopular to say that someone might know better than the individual himself as to the course which he should pursue.
2x2r | Unpopular, yes. But one cannot hope that everything right will always be popular. The people who go raving about that they 'must sacrifice' are the last people who, for their own sake, should be allowed to make sacrifices. But what happens? Every organisa- tion known to you is on the lookout for just these people, in order to fuel itself from their sacrifice.
4gct | Understanding this is what we call seeing oneself and seeing others.
uuio | One can help by giving you undertakings to involve yourself in which neither flatter you nor exploit you. But you have to do something towards it, too, you know. This something is not be- coming an acceptor, rejector or being uncertain.
e34x | It is for you to study this theory and watch it in practice, and keep yourself open to work and study, act and live without forming a part of an unnecessarily over-simplified pattern, which is the way in which the majority of people operate.

6ndf | THE TREASURE CAVE
x2p2 | Q: People say that premature insight, beyond ordinary under, standing, is worse than none: because one cannot use it or be used by it. They also say that someone may lose through greed and yet benefit others. What does all this mean? Can it be put in a more comprehensible form?
yhgh | A: Greed is the cause of loss and of the inability to profit from apparent gain. This is as true in metaphysics as in ordinary life. But one individual's greed may benefit others - though this effect does not concern him, and does not give him anything.
jjti | An ancient tale, still current, puts all this into a more memorable form:
uw2x | TALE OF THE VILLAGER
1rbl | There was once a brave villager who had not overcome his attachment to non-essentials. One day he was riding his donkey past a magical cave at the precise moment when it made one of its periodical appearances to humanity. Boldly entering, he found piles of treasure, which he took outside and stuffed into his saddle- bags. When the donkey was fully loaded, the man remembered that he had left his stick behind, and he ran back into the cave to retrieve it. But the time for the cave to vanish again had arrived. No sooner was he within than it disappeared, with him inside.
wr7g | The man was never seen again, and his donkey wandered back to the village. After waiting for him to return, the people sold the donkey and its burden and enriched themselves ...

tzxi | Sufis and Scholars
o4i7 | Q. What is the traditional Sufi objection to certain types of scholars, academic pedants as you have called them, based upon?
2sts | A: These scholars may often be regarded as decorative and useful people. Their decorative and utilitarian aspects, however, should be clearly perceived, in accordance with the principle that misunderstandings and distortions always occur when something is not defined which could be defined.
zx3s | They frequently desire attention, and do all they can to get it. They do not seek to propagate their ideas so much as to require that people think that they are being scholars. I am constantly approached by eminent ones begging me to cite their works, because citations mean importance. This activity is part of their desire to be seen, the self-display aspect. Again, some of them are jealous of special clothes and other appurtenances, and rituals of all kinds, which contribute towards their visibility. This charac- teristic is observed also in other human groups, in certain animals and birds and is not in itself to be considered undesirable, even if only because we gain some pleasure from such displays.
6c25 | Like containers, and permutation, accumulation and analysis agents of various kinds, they are able for the most part, to hold, to preserve, even to pass on - but not to effect any real change in - the materials with which they are concerned. A limited scholar who translates a book, for instance, may be giving its contents to someone who can absorb it, like a jug which contains water which will ultimately be drunk by others.
2ese | Scholars of the lesser sort, however, being human and not animal or inanimate, sometimes tend to confuse their own desires with their real effect and possible functions. This is only because they may have an image of themselves which has been fostered without being investigated. As one of them said in this very room to some of us the other day, 'We just can't help it!'
xvzx | 215
t08l | Investigated it may not be, but it is observed. It is from Oxford, not the Sufis, that the joke comes: 'I am the Master of Balliol College: and what I don't know can't be knowledge!'
k6vc | Scholars cannot readily be studied by other scholars, who are by virtue of their involvement unlikely to be able to attain sufficient objectivity.
lnqw | Scholars, however, can be studied by Sufis. There are in- numerable Sufis who have once been scholars: but there is no single Sufi known to us, perhaps to all history, who has subse- quently become a scholar. Scholarship, therefore, may be regarded as a stage after which one may become a Sufi.
kdr7 | Sufis never have followed scholars, though they have frequently equalled or excelled scholars in scholarship.
h1ds | Sufis can do this because they do not regard scholarship as an end but as something useful: with the advantages and limitations corresponding to this function. Scholars, quite often, do not show signs of understanding that there is anything beyond scholarship, and therefore they are incapacitated - while they remain at this stage - from being able to have a higher objective. One must always have an aspiration higher than one's actual status in order to rise, even in an existing field.
sgu6 | Such scholars, because they cannot move beyond their concep- tion of scholarship, are driven to believe and to practise two things:
47j0 | 1. They tend to make themselves believe that scholarship is of the highest nature among things and that scholars are a high, even special, product with some kind of property-interest in truth or even a peculiar, perhaps unique, capacity to perceive it. The historical records of scholars in this respect, not to mention their individual experiences in being refuted by events, do not daunt them.
1c60 | 2. Because they know inwardly that this posture of theirs is not true, those of them in the appropriate field are compelled to resort to the study of the work of their opponents (the Sufis). This is why scholars study the works of Sufis, but Sufis do not have to study the works of scholars, as one Sufi has cogently remarked.
0gex | This tendency of the lower attempting to emulate the higher in
8r7m | 216
qj19 | spjte of disabling limitations is evidenced in the behaviour of children, animals and other less-developed or insecure individuals. Small boys pretend that they are adults, or else study what they imagine adults to be doing or saying. In the process they quite naturally refrain from allowing themselves to register the adults' assertion that boys are still only boys.
l5ia | It is appropriate to stress here that, whereas a child may grow up, a man does not become an immature boy again. The scholar is too naive (in knowledge, if not in contentiousness) for any Sufi to become one of the type we are describing. This stage the Sufi has already passed, if he needed to pass through it.
ecp0 | When a child does not properly grow up, he will either be an unformed, infantile man, or else he may die. The alternatives to progress are these two. What he imagines about himself, or what he manages to convince others about himself, do not affect the reality of the situation, though they may affect opinions as to the nature of the reality. Few people will disagree that there is a difference between the reality, the observed fact, and the supposed facts created by opinion and maintained by constant repetition.
cujm | Any careful study of academic work will show how surprisingly often there is an unawareness, for instance, of the difference be- tween polemic and informational communication.
25y0 | The Sufi's opposition to the scholar is not any opposition to scholarship. It is an opposition to regarding scholarship as some- thing which it is not. If, for instance, one were to believe that bread and milk were the only true and valuable forms of food, it could mean that those who ate bread and milk might imagine that they had perceived and were operating at the apogee of nutrition. On the other hand, where there are other nutritions available, and when these are superior in some or many respects to those which are only supposed to be the solitary or best ones, a critical situation exists.
8u4f | The other objection which the Sufi traditionally makes is in the best interests of the scholar and his followers. It is widely known that an erroneous belief about oneself, particularly a fantasy that one is more important than one really is, can have an un- pleasant and destructive effect upon an individual and on those who may rely upon him. To ignore such scholastic imaginings
5bai | 217
2z5m | when in a position to comment upon them in a salutary manner is tantamount to allowing a person to damage himself and others- whether this damage arises through ignorance or malice. All social requirements of virtually all communities are unanimous in disallowing such a situation as this to pass unremarked, once it has been observed.
