        "content": "xqvs | Thirteen. Observation shows that people's desires for attention ebb and flow. When in an ebb or flow of attention-desire, the human being not realizing that this is his condition, attributes his actions and feelings to other factors, e.g., the hostility or pleasantness of others. He may even say that it is a 'lucky day', when his attention-needs have been quickly and adequately met. Re-examination of such situations has shown that such experiences are best accounted for by the attention-theory.\nz0yn | Fourteen. Objections based upon the supposed pleasure of attention being strongest when it is randomly achieved do not stand up when carefully examined. 'I prefer to be surprised by attention' can be paraphrased by saying, 'I prefer not to know where my next meal is coming from'. It simply underlines a primitive stage of feeling and thinking on this subject.\nbula | Fifteen. Situations which seem different when viewed from an oversimplified perspective (which is the usual one) are seen to be the same by the application of attention-theory. E.g.: People following an authority-figure may be exercising the desire for attention or the desire to give it. The interchange between people and their authority-figure may be explained by mutual-attention behavior. Some gain only attention from this interchange. Some can gain more.\npevq | Sixteen. Another confusion is caused by the fact that the object of attention may be a person, a cult, an object, an idea, interest, etc. Because the foci of attention can be so diverse, people in general have not yet identified the common factor-the desire for attention.\n39p6 | Seventeen. One of the advantages of this theory is that it allows the human mind to link in a coherent and easily-understood way many things which it has always (wrongly) been taught are very\n9snt | Eighty-seven\n9hma | different, not susceptible to comparison, etc. This incorrect training has, of course, impaired the possible efficiency in functioning of the brain, though only culturally, not permanently.\n6rf4 | Eighteen. The inability to feel when attention is extended, and also to encourage or to prevent its being called forth, makes man almost uniquely vulnerable to being influenced, especially in having ideas implanted in his brain, and being indoctrinated.\nr9je | Nineteen. Raising the emotional pitch is the most primitive method of increasing attention towards the instrument which increased the emotion. It is the prelude to, or accompaniment of, almost every form of indoctrination.\n8u2l | Twenty. Traditional philosophical and other teachings have been used to prescribe exercises in the control and focusing of attention. Their value, however, has been to a great measure lost because the individual exercises, prescribed for people in need of exercise, have been written down and repeated as unique truths and practiced in a manner, with people and at a rate and under circumstances which, by their very randomness, have not been able to effect any change in the attention-training. This treatment has, however, produced obsession. It continues to do so.\nj9td | Twenty-one. Here and there proverbs and other pieces of literary material indicate that there has been at one time a widespread knowledge of attention on the lines now being described. Deprived, however, of context, these indications survive as fossil indicators rather than being a useful guide to attention-exercise for contemporary man.\ny0so | Attention upon oneself, or upon a teacher, without the exercise of securing what is being offered from beyond the immediate surroundings, is a sort of short-circuit. As Rumi said: 'Do not look at me, but take what is in my hand'.\nrf23 | Sufi Study Themes\nxbc4 | Sufi Study Themes\n61e1 | Q: If you were to give a number of study themes to the people present, which ones would you stress?\nisto | A:\nma2o | One. All approaches to a study or an individual may start with a desire for attention. However they start, they must never end up in this manner.\nlx6n | Two. Study the assumptions behind your actions. Then study the options behind your assumptions.\n5ii9 | Three. \"Why did I do such-and-such a thing?' is all very well. But what about 'How otherwise could I have done it?'\n6quh | Four. You have come a long way, and you do not know it. You have a long way to go, and you do know what that means.\n1tm9 | Five. In respect to some, you may have advanced. In relation to others, you have not progressed at all. Neither observation is more important than the other.\na60a | Six. If your desire for 'good' is based on greed, it is not good, but\ne663 | Seven. Exercise power by means of kindness, and you may be causing more damage than you could by cruelty. Neither approach is correct.\n8n48 | Eight. The man who knows must discharge a function. The one who does not, cannot arrogate one to himself; he can only try to do\nwo91 | Nine. Do not try to be humble: learn humility.\nj381 | Ten. Assume that you are part-hypocrite and part heedless, and you will not be far wrong.\nhzpg | Eleven. To copy a virtue in another is more copying than it is virtue. Try to learn what that virtue is based upon.\ne8sm | Twelve. No practice exists in isolation.\ny6h8 | Thirteen. If you seek a teacher, try to become a real student. If you want to be a student, try to find a real teacher.\no8w8 | Fourteen. The more often you do a thing, the more likely you are to\nrz1d | do it again. There is no certainty that you will gain anything else from repetition than a likelihood of further repetition.\n61fx | Fifteen. At first, you are not worthy of the robes and implements of the Sufi. Later you do not need them. Finally, you may need them for the sake of others.\n1ccq | Sixteen. If you cannot laugh frequently and genuinely, you have no soul.\nnjzq | Seventeen. When a belief becomes more than an instrument, you are lost. You remain lost until you learn what belief is really for.\njeol | Eighteen. When a dervish shows interest in your material welfare, you may be pleased. But it is frequently because you are not yet ready for anything else.\nfnu9 | Nineteen. When someone asks for you to help in doing something, do you imagine that it is because he cannot do it unaided? Perhaps he is a Sufi who wants to help you by connecting you with his task.\nyejl | Twenty. If you are lazy, count yourself lucky if someone points this out, giving you a chance to improve. Laziness is always your fault. It is the sign that a man has persevered in uselessness for too long.\nw8yf | These points are in fact exercises in outwitting the false self, which thrives on smaller satisfactions. The Sufi aims at Tana (passing away-of the False Self) and Baga (remaining - of the Real). Behind the supposed 'I', which is impermanent, lies the real one, which is characterized by the awareness of truth, of reality.\nzp0b | And listen to the words of Junaid of Baghdad, when he said: 'A good-natured sensualist is better than a bad-tempered so-called Sufi.'\nm8wl | Things of the World\njp31 | An Eastern Sage and the Newspapers\njuzd | LETTER TO A SAGE\nxc9y | A WESTERN student of the spiritual wrote a fierce and reproving letter to a certain Eastern sage, when he saw his name in a newspaper. \"You should be completely unconcerned with the things of this world!' he said - and much else.\n3v42 | When I visited the sage, I asked him what he had thought of the letter, as I wanted to report his reaction to the writer of it.\nt3yi | 'I do get letters, it is true,' he murmured, 'but I am afraid I do not read them, because, you see, they are things of this world, and I am not concerned with them.'\nfy5f | 'Things of this world' include, according to the Sufis, anything other than Truth.\n846r | CONDUCT OF THE SUFIS",
