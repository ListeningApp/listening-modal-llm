You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

wzno | Given its type of regime, North Korea constituted a challenging target for Humint. This task had become even more difficult because of the cumbersome organization of the various bodies involved in this mission. Following the withdrawal of US forces in June 1949, American military assistance to the South Korean army was provided by the Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG), which also passed information from ROK sources to the Pentagon. In addition, the United States maintained three small intelligence missions in Korea: the Korean Liaison Office (KLO), established by MacArthur's G-2, Gen. Charles Willoughby after the
xagm | American forces left South Korea in 1949 and tasked with intelligence collection and analysis;20 the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI); and a CIA element that was linked to the local police and intelligence services. Their main sources were the South Korean collection agencies." Although South Korean officers claim that the intelligence that they collected about the coming attack was valuable,22 there is a consensus that G-2 in Tokyo regarded it as conflicting and useless.23
iwn5 | The KLO and CIA collection abilities in North Korea are a matter of controversy. According to Willoughby, in 1949, he had sixteen agents in North Korea. However, KLO officers had reservations about "their competence, motivation, and loyalty."24 Similarly, according to John Singlaub, he and his colleagues recruited dozens of Koreans in Manchuria between 1946 and 1948, trained them as agents, and sent them across the Yalu River into North Korea. The agents provided valuable information to the CIA station in Seoul,

pxbq | p. 130 and on the eve of the war reported on specific North 4 Korean preparations for invasion. Based on these reports, the CIA distributed a document assessing "that a North Korean invasion was pending" on June 19.25 Other intelligence histories of the war tend to ignore the CIA's Humint contribution. Thus, a semi-official report of American Humint in the war maintains that when it started "Korea was an intelligence vacuum."26 Academic accounts and the CIA documents themselves refute the claim that the agency forecast a North Korean invasion as an immediate threat a week before the war (see below).
jfsr | Lastly, the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), which was established in 1941 and transferred to the CIA in 1947, provided some information as well. However, its focus was less on North Korea per se, and more on Soviet media coverage of the two Koreas and Soviet-North Korean relations. Consequently, Osint missed some hints in the North Korean media (primarily deceptive messages) that could have indicated a certain change in the situation prior to the invasion." 27
u15r | ii. The information and its estimate
lq35 | Given the low ranking of North Korea in the US intelligence requirements order of priorities, the Comint contribution to an early warning was minimal. Post factum, it provided two hints of the coming invasion: an increase in Soviet targeting of South Korean communications between April 21 and May 15; and, from February 1950 onward, indications of large Soviet shipments of bandages and medicines to North Korea and Manchuria.28 FBIS monitoring of Soviet references to North Korea and North Korean broadcasts revealed no significant indications for a drastic change in the public attitude of both states on the issue of "armed unification."
3g9w | Humint provided a somewhat better picture. On January 13, 1950, a CIA document reported further expansion of the KPA forces, including tank units and heavy artillery, in the border zone with South Korea. In addition, the report notified an influx of PLA forces in Manchuria." A G-2 report 4 that was distributed six days before the invasion included significant war indicators: "an imminent enemy offensive-extensive troop movements along the 38th parallel; evacuation of all civilians north of the parallel for two kilometers; suspension of civilian freight service from Wonsan to Ch'orwon and the transportation of military supplies only; concentration of armored units in the border area; and the arrival of large shipments of weapons and ammunition." On the same day, a CIA report included no specific warning indicators. It did notice, however, that the KPA continued to deploy forces near the border, that the deployment included tanks and heavy artillery that had moved there "in recent months," and that, in general, the North Korean military forces in the border area "equal or surpass the strength of southern Korean army units similarly deployed."31
d09o | p. 131
ylhz | Some Humint sources also referred to specific dates of the coming offensive. On December 30, 1949, Willoughby sent Washington reports from field agents that warned of a North Korean invasion in March or April of 1950. A month-and-a-half later, he delivered two additional warnings about an attack in March or June. KLO officers reported on March 10 that the invasion had been rescheduled from March or April to June
a3td | 1950. However, since most of the warnings came from South Korean field sources, rather than American sources, they were dismissed by American intelligence officers.
ex5k | The CIA was right in assessing that the withdrawal of the American army from Korea would lead to a communist "armed unification," but it erred in estimating the circumstances under which the invasion would take place. It also was wrong in evaluating the balance of forces between North Korea and the ROK. In early January 1947, the CIA's predecessor, the Central Intelligence Group, had assessed that the USSR's long-term goal was to take over the whole of the Korean Peninsula, and that since the US military presence was the main obstacle to employing this scheme, "Soviet propaganda and Communist agitation have consistently sought to drive the US out of Korea."33 Toward the end of 1947, a CIA assessment warned that "U.S. withdrawal would have the effect of leaving South Korea incapable of offering any serious resistance to p. 132 eventual domination by the 4 North." A March 1948 document estimated that the right-wing South Korean regime under Syngman Rhee "would be incapable of withstanding ideological and military pressures from North Korea." Following the elections in August, the CIA assessment was somewhat more optimistic, expressing the belief that a strong South Korean army could be built before the expected American military withdrawal, and that such an army could serve as an effective deterrent against communist aggression. 36

cjq2 | The belief, shared by all American estimators, that the unification of the Korean Peninsula would be initiated by the USSR, and not by Kim Il Sung, was expressed in a February 1949 report of a decrease in Communist influence in South Korea. Consequently, the CIA analysts concluded that the conditions were not ripe for "carrying out the Soviet plan for the eventual absorption of South Korea into the Democratic Peoples Republic." This estimate relied on the expectation that "the Politburo would not engage in overt forms of aggression which involved the risk of a general war for the present and several years hence." A more alarmed tone was expressed a week later, noting that the scheduled American military withdrawal in June "would probably in time be followed by an invasion, timed to coincide with Communist-led South Korean revolts, by the North Korean People's Army possibly assisted by small battle-trained units from Communist Manchuria."39 This estimate is considered by some as evidence that the CIA correctly foresaw the coming events.40
5esx | The South Korean estimate was more pessimistic and also more accurate. Based on the "recent enemy situation and general developments," 4 the ROK Army Headquarters warned in its annual intelligence estimate of December 27, 1949, that "the enemy would carry out a full-scale offensive campaign in the spring of 1950." By March, the warning had become more concrete, forecasting June as the time of the invasion. The KLO and the KMAG G-2 reported this information, but it did not have a considerable impact in Tokyo or in Washington because it had gone through Willoughby, who rejected the Korean predictions. 42
m5ka | p. 133
byu8 | Despite the completion of the US military withdrawal in June 1949, and the increase of intelligence indications warning of an upcoming invasion, the CIA provided no specific warning until war broke out. The agency's "Weekly Summary" of January 13, 1950, shortly before Kim Il Sung obtained Stalin's green light for the invasion, noted the continued North Korean military buildup in the border area, but estimated that this was probably "a defensive measure to offset the growing strength of the offensively minded South- Korean army."43 The CIA's Watch Committee-a small body that was set up in 1948 and met about twice a month with representatives of the army, navy, air force and State Department to discuss indications of incoming threats-was asked on June 14 to consider a list of potential areas of conflict with the USSR in the next six months to a year. Their ranking order was Indochina, Berlin, and West Germany, Iran, Yugoslavia, South Korea (sixth), the Philippines, and Japan."44 Less than a week before war started, the CIA issued a report that grossly underestimated the KPA's capabilities: 66,000 troops organized in at least three infantry divisions and one independent brigade; at least 65 T-34 tanks; and about 35 Soviet-made fighters which probably had not yet attained operational status.45 In reality, the KPA had at least 135,000 soldiers, 150 T-34 tanks and an air force of 180 Soviet-made aircraft including 40 fighters and 70 attack-bombers.46 This
76b0 | p. 134 underestimation probably led the CIA to assess on the eve of the war that North Korea only had "a capability 4 for attaining limited objectives in short-term military operations against Southern Korea, including the capture of Seoul."47
zxz6 | The Far East Command (FEC) G-2 was even more off the mark. Less than three months before the North Korean invasion, Willoughby estimated:
xnth | It is believed that there would be no civil war in Korea this spring or summer. South Korea is not expected to seriously consider warfare so long as her precipitating war entails probable discontinuance of United States aid. The most probable course of North Korean action this spring and summer is furtherance of attempts to overthrow South Korean government by creation of chaotic conditions in the Republic of Korea through guerrillas and psychological warfare.48

2zmw | In contrast, the ROK army estimate of the KPA OB was far more accurate: 103,500 soldiers in six infantry and one armored divisions; 173 tanks, and 190 airplanes. These figures were rejected by the Americans who also rejected South Korean warnings in May that "an invasion by the North was imminent."49
bf9k | The North Korean attack started at 4 a.m. on June 25 Korean time, or 3 p.m. on June 24 Eastern Standard Time. It caught everyone by surprise, from the American ambassador and his staff in Seoul to President Truman, who first heard about the attack more than eight hours after it started. Truman and Acheson, who headed the group that was called together to deal with the crisis, processed the incoming information through a Munich analogy, and in an almost Pavlovian response connecting provocation with defense, decided to act militarily. In this sense, the decision to intervene was a product of the gap between strategic thinking that ranked South Korea at the bottom of the Far East order of priorities before the invasion, and political considerations that ranked it high once the invasion took place. At its root stood three intelligence shortcomings:
otkr | . Underestimation of the KPA military capabilities, which caused the administration to limit its assistance to the South Korean army, which facilitated its fast collapse. 4
ibgs | · Lack of high-quality early warning about the coming invasion, which prevented more effective South Korean and American military and diplomatic preparations to meet the challenge.
colo | . The failure to realistically assess the nature of the triangular relationship between the USSR, the PRC, and North Korea, which led to the mistaken belief that Stalin rather than Kim Il Sung was the driving force behind the invasion. Hence, an American military intervention was perceived as the adequate means to stop aggression.
d6r4 | c. Explaining the lack of preparedness
9mrz | The first communist military challenge in the postwar era, the North Korean invasion, found the United States unprepared to meet its role as the status quo defender. One source of this problem was insufficient American experience in that role, which manifested itself in the rapid manner in which the American weltanschauung moved from postwar optimism to MacArthyism and "red scare," and an insufficient body of expertise in world affairs inside the administration. The other source, which derived mainly from postwar optimism, was insufficient military and intelligence resources that were needed to support America's global posture. This was a result of the fast demobilization and the deep cuts in defense budgets in the aftermath of WWII.
pk06 | Attempting to bridge the gap between its new status and the lack of resources to support it started with a policy of containment as the national strategy, and the concomitant passing away of the Truman Doctrine and Marshal Plan. The 1947 National Security Act that reorganized the administration gave the president
7wn9 | p. 136 i. State level
wcd0 | p. 137
caos | more effective tools to meet the new American commitments. NATO's establishment in 1949 in reaction to the "Berlin blockade" created the main instrument to limit Soviet expansion in Europe. And following the Soviet nuclear test and the "fall of China" that amplified the "red scarce," Paul Nitze, the director of policy planning in the State Department, and his colleagues, formulated the NSC-68 aimed at putting financial and military teeth into the strategy of containment. It was submitted to President Truman in April 1950, but he did not sign it until September, and then, only under the pressure of the Korean War. This was the political envelope in which the failure to forecast the incoming invasion was sealed.

pn9j | The issue at stake
1pmc | Relatively speaking, postwar Korea was terra incognita for American Far Eastern policy. Japan had been well-known since the time of Commander Perry's visit there in the mid-nineteenth century. Its conversion under MacArthur into a peaceful democratic state attracted much attention. Americans thought of rural life in China in terms of Pearl Buck's books, primarily the Good Earth, which also became a major film; these images of course involved wild distortions but many Americans were unaware of the misrepresentations. Extensive American resources, including more than two billion dollars in aid, were invested in Chiang Kai- shek's struggle to win the civil war in China. The Philippines had been an American colony since 1898, and the independent government that was established there after the Japanese occupation received US aid in its war against the Hukbalahap ("Huks") Rebellion.
