        "content": "4exe | Although the convention text begins with the recognition of 'the intrinsic value of biological diversity', it is not obvious what role the intrinsic value in the CBD plays, as it appears only in the preamble. The recognition of intrinsic value is also followed by stating that the parties are conscious of 'the ecological, genetic, social, economic, scientific, educational, cultural, recreational and aesthetic values of biological diversity'. This shows that there is ambiguity in how the value of biodiversity is to be understood. Moreover, the larger normative international legal framework and even the CBD itself mainly endorse the established resource-focused language and practice. Here, again the question arises about how biodiversity-focused claims about value should be interpreted.\n0myz | So, the extinction of species via the resulting loss of biodiversity seems to involve a loss of value, but reasons for why the loss of variety might be problematic can rest on different argumentative grounds. Moreover, biodiversity can be conceptualised in various ways and normative emphasis can be put on different kinds of diversity (such as 'phylogenetic diversity'). Generally, there are two common (not exhaustive) argumentative routes to choose from, which do not preclude each other but are often found in combination to justify the protection of biodiversity.\nxh3i | Firstly, biological variety as in the variety or abundance of, for example, genes or species might have instrumental value beyond the (instrumental) value of the species themselves. While that is a common premise in conservation biology and environmental ethics that can justify why the extinction of many species is problematic due to the loss of valuable variety, different argumentative grounds for such instrumental value such as biodiversity's contribution to ecosystem functioning or its (potential) agricultural and pharmaceutical benefits have also been critically discussed. Independent of such critiques, the loss of variety might not be problematic for instrumental value reasons in all circumstances (e.g. consider the loss of variety of certain pathogens), which means that not necessarily all extinctions involve a loss of instrumentally valuable variety.\nkg3t | Yet that needs to be kept distinct from the instrumental value attributed to species themselves (such as their 'incalculable instrumental value'), although not all species will be instrumentally valuable for human purposes either. In so far as these, as well as biological variety, are fundamental grounds for the possibility of human life on earth, a mass extinction can be understood as humanity's 'autodestruction' constituting 'a wrong in its own category. The wrong is the wrong of putting an end to humankind and all that is of value in it. This is a cataclysmic wrong'. Thus, for such an argument the 'massness' of the current extinction event is central and, thereby, it avoids the problem that some individual species might not be instrumentally valuable for human purposes.\nlvae | The second option is to consider the intrinsic value of biological variety as something that might be valuable in itself - independently of whether it is beneficial for humans or other lifeforms. There are different versions of what this entails. For example, deep ecologist Arne Naess famously stated that '[r]ichness and diversity of life forms ( ... ) are also values in themselves'. Providing a more nuanced view on the intrinsic value of biodiversity, Gregory Mikkelson points out that 'variety' is not the sole determinant of value in neither Næss' deep ecology, nor in Mikkelson's own preferred richness theory. Both invoke additional determinants such as 'harmony'. To Mikkelson, more related to extinction, 'anthropogenic species extinctions are decreasing the overall harmony of life on Earth'.\no9sc | Philosophical claims about biodiversity's intrinsic value also get external support. As already mentioned, conservation biologist Soulé considered biotic diversity to have intrinsic value and also the Convention on Biological Diversity refers to intrinsic value. Moreover, studies about the environmental values of the public also report intrinsic values being supported and strong pro-environmental attitudes confirmed empirically have the possibility of generating subjectivist non-instrumental values. However, different proposals concerning the intrinsic value\n121u | Cambridge Prisms: Extinction\nzh03 | of biological variety have also been subject to critical analysis, such as concerning whether intrinsic value can attach to biological variety itself or whether that is better understood in terms of intrinsically valuing parts of biological variety such as species and individual beings.\n1mvw | Moreover, in addition to valuing species, nonhuman individuals and biological variety, further (additional or alternative) adjacent reasons grounding the badness of species extinction can be found in the literature. To mention two examples broadly within the realm of biodiversity-focused arguments, that includes, for one, arguments pertaining valuing the 'irreplaceable design that is embodied by the individuals' part of a species. The point being that after a long evolutionary process, '[e]ach of the wonderful contrivances of nature are ( ... ) unique and irreplaceable. Such irreplaceable design has special value that we recognise when we experience awe and wonderment towards the sophisticated structures and systems and strategies exemplified by living organisms'. According to Brendan Cline, that shifts the focus of concern away from the species themselves towards such 'irreplaceable design'. Secondly, the loss of biodiversity might also be considered problematic due to a lack of respect towards nonhuman living beings and active nature in their natural otherness. Such respect provides us with reasons to protect biodiversity and, consequently, species variety. Subsequently, human-caused extinctions can be interpreted as a lack of such respect.",
