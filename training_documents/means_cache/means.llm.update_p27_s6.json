        "content": "his3 | This example illustrates how covariates can help us to exert stricter experimental control by taking account of confounding variables to give us a 'purer' measure of effect of the experimental manipulation. Looking back at the group means from Table thirteen point one, you might think that the significant F-statistic reflects a difference between the control group and the two experimental groups - because the fifteen-and thirty-minute groups have very similar means (four point eight eight and four point eight five) whereas the control group mean is much lower at three point two two. However, we can't use these group means to interpret the effect because they have not been adjusted for the effect of the covariate. These original means tell us nothing about the group differences reflected by the significant F. Output thirteen point seven gives the adjusted values of the group means (which we calculated in Section thirteen point three), and we use these values for interpretation (this is why we selected Display Means for in Section thirteen point five point six). From these adjusted means you can see that happiness increased across\nm50z | the three doses. Output thirteen point seven\nme84 | Output thirteen point eight shows the parameter estimates selected in the Options dialog box and their bootstrapped confidence intervals and P-values (bottom table). These estimates result from Dose being coded using two dummy coding variables. The dummy variables are coded with the last category (the category coded with the highest value in the data editor, in this case the thirty-minute group) as the reference category. This reference category (labelled Dose equals three in the output) is coded with a zero for both dummy variables (see Section twelve point two for a reminder of how dummy coding works). Dose equals two, therefore, represents the difference between the group coded as two (fifteen minutes) and the reference category (thirty minutes), and Dose equals one represents the difference between the group coded as one (control) and the reference category (thirty minutes). The B-values represent the differences between the adjusted means in Output thirteen point seven and the significances of the T-tests tell us whether these adjusted group means differ significantly. The B for Dose equals one in Output thirteen point eight is the difference between the adjusted means for the control group and the thirty-minute group, two point nine two six minus five point one five one equals negative two point two two five, and the B for Dose equals two is the difference between the adjusted means for the fifteen-minute group and the thirty-minute group, \no56m | four point seven one two minus five point one five one equals negative zero point four three nine. The degrees of freedom for the T-test of the B-values are N minus K minus one (see Section nine point two point five), in which N is the total sample size (in this case thirty) and K is the number of predictors (in this case three, the two dummy variables and the covariate). For these data, D F equals thirty minus three minus one equals twenty-six. Based on the bootstrapped significance and confidence intervals (remember you'll get different values than me because of how bootstrapping works), we could conclude that the thirty-minute group differs significantly from the control group, P equals zero point zero two one (Dose equals one in the table), but not from the fifteen-minute group, P equals zero point five five eight, Dose equals two in the table.\nslz6 | The final thing to note is the value of B for the covariate (zero point four one six), which is the same as in Output thirteen point two (when we ran the analysis through the regression menu). This value tells us that if love of puppies increases by one unit, then the person's happiness should increase by just under half a unit (although there is nothing to suggest a causal link between the two); because the coefficient is positive we\n90k5 | know that as love of puppies increases so does happiness. A negative coefficient would mean the opposite: as one increases, the other decreases.\n9m8s | Output thirteen point nine repeats the parameter estimates from Output thirteen point eight but with standard errors, P-values and confidence intervals robust to heteroscedasticity (the HC four estimates that we asked for). We can interpret the effects for Dose in the same way as for the regular and Bootstrap P-values and confidence intervals. For the effect of puppy love, the HC four robust confidence interval and P-value supports the conclusion from the non-robust model: the P-value is zero point zero three eight, which is less than zero point zero five, and the confidence interval does not contain zero (zero point zero two five, zero point eight zero seven). However, the bootstrap confidence interval (Output thirteen point eight) contradicts this conclusion because it contains zero (negative zero point zero two three, zero point six nine eight) and has a P equals zero point zero five two (again, we're reminded of how daft it is to have a threshold that yields such opposing conclusions from such small differences in a value).\n893y | Output thirteen point eight\nfavz | Parameter Estimates\n7szx | Parameter Estimates with Robust Standard Errors\nhx9e | Output thirteen point ten Contrast Results (K Matrix)\nywn2 | Thirteen point six point three Contrasts",
