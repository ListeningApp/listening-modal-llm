        "content": "xv78 | The loss comprises three terms: the Bayes risk, i.e. the minimal loss achievable for next-token prediction on the full distribution P, also known as the \"entropy of natural text;\" a functional approximation term that depends on the size of the hypothesis space; finally, a stochastic approximation term that captures the suboptimality of minimizing LD instead of L, and of making a single epoch on the provided dataset.\nsdks | Expected forms of the loss terms. In the decomposition nine, the second term depends entirely on the number of parameters N that defines the size of the functional approximation space. On the set of two-layer neural networks, it is expected to be proportional to negative one. Finally, given that it corresponds to early stopping in stochastic first order methods, the third term should scale as the convergence rate of these methods, which is lower-bounded by one and may attain the bound. This convergence rate is expected to be dimension free and depends only on the loss smoothness; hence we assume that the second term only depends on D in two. Empirically, we find after fitting two that\ny8fb | L(N,D) equals E plus N to the zero point thirty-four plus B D to the zero point twenty-eight.\n521q | with E equals one point sixty-nine, A equals four hundred six point four, B equals four hundred ten point seven. We note that the parameter/data coefficients are both lower than two; this is expected for the data-efficiency coefficient but far from the known lower-bound. Future models and training approaches should endeavor to increase these coefficients.\nyogo | Fitting the decomposition to data. We effectively minimize the following problem\n2285 | a, b, e, eta, beta min Run i Hubers LSE(a minus a log N_i, b minus beta log D_i, e) minus log L_i, where LSE is the log-sum-exp operator. We then set A, B, E equals exp(a), exp(b), exp(e).\nys0g | We use the LBFGS algorithm to find local minima of the objective above, started on a grid of initialization given by: a in zero, zero point five, and so on to two; eta in zero, zero point five, and so on to two; e in negative one, negative point five, and so on to one; a in zero, five, and so on to twenty-five; and b in zero, five, and so on to twenty-five. We find that the optimal initialization is not on the boundary of our initialization sweep.\n7zvp | We use delta equals ten to the negative three for the Huber loss. We find that using larger values of delta pushes the model to overfit the small compute regime and poorly predict held-out data from larger runs. We find that using a delta smaller than ten to the negative three does not impact the resulting predictions.\nww6u | D point three. Predicted compute optimal frontier for all three methods\nhpi6 | For Approaches two and three, we show the estimated model size and number of training tokens for a variety of compute budgets in Table A three. We plot the predicted number of tokens and parameters for a variety of FLOP budgets for the three methods in Figure A three.\n4uhb | D point four.
