        "content": "epbj | These tubules are of two cell types, digestive cells and basophil secretory cells. Digestive cells are the most abundant type. They are columnar and vacuolated and are responsible for intracellular digestion of food. The free surface of the digestive cell is extended into microvilli and the cytoplasm is characterised by the presence of numerous cytoplasmic vesicles types. Particulate matter is taken up at the base of the microvilli by pinocytosis and is initially stored within small vesicles called phagosomes. Phagosomes fuse with lysosomes in their maturation process. Digestion takes place within these lysosomes which contain hydrolytic enzymes. The end products of digestion are released directly into the haemolymph system and waste products are contained in residual bodies within the digestive cells. The cells eventually rupture and the waste material is swept along the ciliated secondary and primary ducts of the ceca towards the stomach, and ultimately to the intestine.\nnmn2 | The ducts of the ceca are divided longitudinally into inhalant and exhalant channels. Cilia provide an exhalant current which carries undigested material to the typhlosoles and intestinal groove; this current also draws undigested material into the inhalant channel. It is possible that the currents alternate with time. Mathers has shown the existence of an interval between the time when the food arrives in the ducts and the return to the intestine of residues from the digestive process.\ng3tm | Two point two. The intestine\ntfra | The function of the intestine is primarily to form faeces. The intestine often passes through the pericardial coelom and is surrounded by the heart ventricle. It then passes dorsally over the posterior adductor muscle and terminates at the anus where faeces are discharged into the exhalant chamber at the base of the exhalant siphon.\n5lm9 | Three. Digestive enzymes\nwp2c | Both stomach and digestive ceca contain a variety of digestive enzymes, particularly carbohydrases. In bivalves, digestive enzymes are produced by the style, by the cells of the digestive ceca (diverticula) and, in some genera examined, in the midgut. Bivalve molluscs show an evolutionary trend towards extracellular digestion, which is believed to provide the most efficient utilisation of food.\nus5v | Digestive enzymes include amylase, cellulase, alginase, lipase, phosphatase and several proteases (including chymotrypsin and cathepsins).\nrs2m | Kristensen examined carbohydrases from the crystalline styles of a number of bivalves, including the blue mussel and found less activity than in the digestive gland. However, Wojtowicz recorded a forty-times greater activity of alpha-amylase in the style than in the digestive gland of the scallop Placopecten magellanicus, but other carbohydrases (alpha-glycosidase, beta-glucosidase, beta-galactosidase, laminarase and chitobiase) were confined to the digestive gland. Cellulase has been recorded in the style and digestive glands of several filter feeding bivalves, including Mytilus edulis. The high activity of cellulase in the stomach contents suggests that this enzyme is produced by gut bacteria.\nuz9y | The localisation of enzymes in the digestive tract of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is shown in Table Four.\n8ov0 | The activities of the carbohydrases (amylase, cellulase and laminarinase are located throughout the digestive tract in the epithelia, such as the lysosomal enzyme, N-acetyl glucosaminidase, which is particularly strong around the gastric shield and in the cells of the tubules of the digestive gland. Non-specific esterases are present in the canal of the digestive gland and the apical part of the stomach and intestinal epithelium. Acid phosphatase, a lysosomal enzyme, is very active in the digestive gland while alkaline phosphatase, which indicates active transport, is localized in the canals of the digestive gland and the base of the tubules.\nmj9m | Module BL five eight zero one Nutrition. Topic one: Feeding and digestion - invertebrates Jonathan David\n94h3 | Protease activity, in the tubules of the digestive gland and some parts of the intestine, is low at the start of digestion but builds up towards the end. These enzymes have an optimum P H of five point five, as with lysosomal enzymes; this is associated with intracellular digestion. Given their location on the apical zones of microvilli, these enzymes appear to be membrane-bound.\n9jx1 | Data from Lebesnerais. Lysosomal proteases (cathepsins) are also known as dipeptidyl peptidases (D P Ps); they are classified according to letter or number. Most of the cathepsins become activated at the low P H found in lysosomes. Thus, the activity of this family lies almost entirely within these organelles.\nc3lz | Similar distributions of enzymes within the digestive tract of other bivalve species have been identified: grooved carpet shell (Ruditapes decussatus); blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and king scallop (Pecten maximus). The movement of food through the digestive tract of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and the sites of enzyme action and uptake of nutrients is shown in Figure nineteen.",
