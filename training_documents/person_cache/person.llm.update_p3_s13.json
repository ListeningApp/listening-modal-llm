        "content": "8l69 | This picture of the characteristics of effective therapists might appear unrealistic. Who could be all those things? Certainly I do not fit this bill! Do not think of these personal characteristics from an all-or-nothing perspective; rather, consider them on a continuum. A given trait may be highly characteristic of you, at one extreme, or it may be very uncharacteristic of you, at the other extreme. I have presented this picture of the therapeutic person with the hope that you will examine it and develop your own concept of what personality traits you think are essential to strive for to promote your own personal growth. For a more detailed discussion of the person of the counselor and the role of the therapeutic relationship in outcomes of treatments, see Psychotherapy Relationships That Work, How Master Therapists Work: Exploring Change From the First Through the Last Session and Beyond, and Master Therapists: Exploring Expertise in Therapy and Counseling.\n1jyv | Personal Therapy for the Counselor\nolce | Discussion of the counselor as a therapeutic person raises another issue debated in counselor education: Should people be required to participate in counseling or therapy before they become practitioners? My view is that counselors can benefit greatly from the experience of being clients at some time, a view that is supported by research. This experience can be obtained before your training, during it,\nerx1 | THE COUNSELOR: PERSON AND PROFESSIONAL\nb3bt | or both, but I strongly support some form of self-exploration as vital preparation in learning to counsel others.\n0w8m | The vast majority of mental health professionals have experienced personal therapy, typically on several occasions. A review of research studies on the outcomes and impacts of the psychotherapist's own psychotherapy revealed that more than ninety percent of mental health professionals report satisfaction and positive outcomes from their own counseling experiences. Orlinsky and colleagues suggest that personal therapy contributes to the therapist's professional work in the following three ways: one as part of the therapist's training, personal therapy offers a model of therapeutic practice in which the trainee experiences the work of a more experienced therapist and learns experientially what is helpful or not helpful; two a beneficial experience in personal therapy can further enhance a therapist's interpersonal skills that are essential to skillfully practicing therapy; and three successful personal therapy can contribute to a therapist's ability to deal with the ongoing stresses associated with clinical work.\nvcu3 | In his research on personal therapy for mental health professionals, Norcross states that lasting lessons practitioners learn from their personal therapy experiences pertain to interpersonal relationships and the dynamics of psychotherapy. Some of these lessons learned are the centrality of warmth, empathy, and the personal relationship; having a sense of what it is like to be a therapy client; valuing patience and tolerance; and appreciating the importance of learning how to deal with transference and countertransference. By participating in personal therapy, counselors can prevent their potential future countertransference from harming clients.\nhjzj | Through our work as therapists, we can expect to confront our own unexplored personal blocks such as loneliness, power, death, and intimate relationships. This does not mean that we need to be free of conflicts before we can counsel others, but we should be aware of what these conflicts are and how they are likely to affect us as persons and as counselors. For example, if we have great difficulty dealing with anger or conflict, we may not be able to assist clients who are dealing with anger or with relationships in conflict.\nj79f | When I began counseling others, old wounds were opened and feelings I had not explored in depth came to the surface. It was difficult for me to encounter a client's depression because I had failed to come to terms with the way I had escaped from my own depression. I did my best to cheer up depressed clients by talking them out of what they were feeling, mainly because of my own inability to deal with such feelings. In the years I worked as a counselor in a university counseling center, I frequently wondered what I could do for my clients. I often had no idea what, if anything, my clients were getting from our sessions. I couldn't tell if they were getting better, staying the same, or getting worse. It was very important to me to note progress and see change in my clients. Because I did not see immediate results, I had many doubts about whether I could become an effective counselor. What I did not understand at the time was that my clients needed to struggle to find their own answers. To see my clients feel better quickly was my need, not theirs, for then I would know that I was helping them. It never occurred to me that clients often feel worse for a time as they give up their defenses and open themselves to their pain. My early\n6tbv | experiences as a counselor showed me that I could benefit by participating in further personal therapy to better understand how my personal issues were affecting my professional work. I realized that periodic therapy, especially early in one's career, can be most useful.\nxb13 | Personal therapy can be instrumental in healing the healer. If student counselors are not actively involved in the pursuit of their own healing and growth, they will probably have considerable difficulty entering the world of a client. As counselors, can we take our clients any further than we have gone ourselves? If we are not committed personally to the value of examining our own life, how can we inspire clients to examine their lives? By becoming clients ourselves, we gain an experiential frame of reference with which to view ourselves. This provides a basis for understanding and compassion for our clients, for we can draw on our own memories of reaching impasses in our therapy, of both wanting to go farther and at the same time resisting change. Our own therapy can help us develop patience with our patients! We learn what it feels like to deal with anxieties that are aroused by self-disclosure and self-exploration and how to creatively facilitate deeper levels of self-exploration in clients. As we increase our self-awareness through our own therapy, we gain increased appreciation for the courage our clients display in their therapeutic journey. Gold and Hilsenroth studied graduate clinicians and found that those who had personal therapy felt more confident and were more in agreement with their clients on the goals and tasks of treatment than were those who did not experience personal therapy. They further found that graduate clinicians who had experienced personal therapy were able to develop strong agreement with their clients on the goals and tasks of treatment. Participating in a process of self-exploration can reduce the chances of assuming an attitude of arrogance or of being convinced that we are totally healed. Our own therapy helps us avoid assuming a stance of superiority over others and makes it less likely that we would treat people as objects to be pitied or disrespected. Indeed, experiencing counseling as a client is very different from merely reading about the counseling process.\ncxqi | For a comprehensive discussion of personal therapy for counselors, see The Psychotherapist's Own Psychotherapy: Patient and Clinician Perspectives.\nqfmx | The Counselor's Values and the Therapeutic Process\nrut3 | As alluded to in the previous section, the importance of self-exploration for counselors carries over to the values and beliefs we hold. My experience in teaching and supervising students of counseling shows me how crucial it is that students be aware of their values, of where and how they acquired them, and of how their values can influence their interventions with clients.\nm3cp | The Role of Values in Counseling",
