        "content": "lfk1 | Choose Delta sub a c t v equals Delta sub c l, and suppose that x sub bar k is in B left( x sub star, Delta sub a c t v right). The first inclusion of fifty-seven, implies script A left( x sub bar k, delta right) equals script A left( x sub bar k plus one, zero right) equals script A left( x sub star, zero right), i.e. x sub bar k plus one is in X sub star, by Delta sub c l s is less than or equal to Delta sub b n d and the first part of Lemma E point three. This fact and the second inclusion of fifty-seven, implies x sub bar k plus one is in script N left( x sub star right) and therefore, by the second inclusion of fifty-six, script A left( x sub bar k plus one, delta right) equals script A left( x sub bar k plus two, zero right) equals script A left( x sub star, zero right), Again by the first part of Lemma E point three. Combining what we have so far, we obtain script A left( x sub bar k plus one, delta right) equals script A left( x sub bar k plus one, zero right) equals script A left( x sub star, zero right), which is the result for bar k plus one. Additionally, however, we can apply Lemma E point four applied to the iterate k plus one to obtain x sub bar k plus two is in script N left( x sub star right). The argument for bar k plus one may now be repeated for k is greater than bar k plus two. For instance, fifty-six and x sub bar k plus two is in script N left( x sub star right) implies x sub bar k plus two is in B left( x sub star, Delta sub b n d right) and so script A left( x sub bar k plus two, delta right) equals script A left( x sub bar k plus three, zero right) equals script A left( x sub star, zero right) by Lemma E point three and x sub bar k plus three is in script N left( x sub star right) by Lemma E point four, which yields the result for bar k plus two and sets up the argument for x sub bar k plus three. Continuing in this fashion yields the result for the given\nrwjw | Delta sub a c t v. F. Further Details and Extended Numerical Results\niazp | In this section we provide some additional elements of our proposed methods, further details on our experimental setup, and also give a more complete description of various problems we consider for our numerical simulations.\nksn3 | F point one. Line Search Algorithms\n8xbx | Here, we gather the line search algorithms used for the theoretical analysis as well as the empirical evaluations of our methods.\naod5 | F point two. Smooth Reformulation of Nonsmooth L one Regression\nayqs | Consider L one regularization of a smooth function, f, as given in twelve. Unfortunately, even when f is smooth, the objective twelve is non-differentiable when x superscript i equals zero for some i equals one, through d. However, it was shown in Schmidt et al. two thousand seven that one can reformulate twelve into a smooth problem by splitting x into positive and negative parts, i.e., x sub plus equals max left( zero, x right) and x sub minus equals negative min left( zero, x right), where \"max\" and \"min\" are taken elementwise. Indeed, we have the identities\njnpq | and\nr4w4 | x superscript i equals x sub plus superscript i minus x sub minus superscript i, absolute value of x superscript i equals x sub plus superscript i plus x sub minus superscript i, which we can use to reformulate fifty-eight as a constrained problem on script R superscript two d. In particular, the following auxiliary function is equivalent to the objective of twelve",
