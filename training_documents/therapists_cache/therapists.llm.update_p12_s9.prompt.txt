You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

mlcd | As with any other mode, the cautions associated with the advocating mode manifest when the mode is overused or misapplied. The strong ideological orientation that often characterizes a therapist in the advocating mode may lead some therapists to overestimate a client's desire; abil- ity; socioeconomic, political, or cultural context; as well as resources for pursuing autonomy and independence. Because clients differ in their experience of disability, they respond differently to advocacy efforts that involve consciousness-raising. For some clients, it may be pre- mature to raise their awareness about injustices that they would rather deny or discover in their own time.
2qe7 | Collaborating Mode
lpzf | The growing emphasis on client-centered practice in occupational therapy underscores the importance of the collaborating mode. Therapists functioning in the collab- orating mode expect their clients to drive the therapeu- tic reasoning that underlies the session, to choose their own activities, and to set their own goals for therapy, even if the therapist disagrees with some or all of the client's goals or agenda. Therapists functioning in the collaborat- ing mode also solicit ongoing feedback from their clients about their own performance as therapists and about the therapy process.
24rz | Therapists in the collaborating mode believe that cli- ents are more likely to achieve positive outcomes if they take ownership of the therapy process. They tend to view clients as capable of determining what they need from therapy and selecting occupational therapy goals and tasks that address those needs. In this way, they work to promote

sot6 | CASE EXAMPLE 4.2 The Advocating Mode
d6sf | Virgil1 is a man in his late 20s with cerebral palsy and moderate learning disabilities who has lived in an institution for most of his life. The managers of his care team at the institution had built a plan that he would move into independent living within the community with staff support to accommodate him. Before I was referred to work with Virgil, his care team from the institution had already located, set up, and obtained funding for his new housing sit- uation. I was referred to provide Virgil with a bath board to facilitate his bathing in the terraced house that was to become his home.
7haq | Virgil had been schooled in the notion that his home was suitable to his needs, and he was thrilled about the possibility of moving into a new home. When I met with him within this new environment, it was immediately evident to me that the housing arrangement was not acceptable. Fundamentally, the way the house was set up did not facilitate Virgil's independence, maximize his dignity, or pro- vide a safe environment for staff to support him.
ubwu | client empowerment, autonomy, independence, and per- sonal choice. When disagreements or other interpersonal difficulties with clients occur, therapists who utilize the collaborating mode encourage clients to use their own judgment. In practice, this mode can be difficult to enact in its purest sense. A therapist must possess the confidence and capacity not only to receive criticism from his or her clients but also to let go of all control and professional authority regarding what is taking place during therapy, if even for a brief period of time. Although most clients for whom this mode is most appropriate make positive deci- sions on their own behalf, any therapist that has witnessed a client act against his or her own best interest knows how challenging it can be to step aside and watch this occur.
ucme | Instead of providing the bath board, I felt it was my duty to inform the managers of Virgil's care team and the organization that was to fund his new housing that I had found the proposed accommoda- tions unacceptable. I provided a report that outlined the safety risks that would have been associated with providing a bath board. The report empha- sized other shortfalls in the environmental design of the house and outlined the oversights in the overall care plan for Virgil.
qnl5 | The managers took offense at my report and attempted to remove me from the situation. They insisted that Virgil was no longer in need of oc- cupational therapy services. However, I pursued my agenda and held meetings with the funding organization and the managers to explain the ra- tionale behind my position. Therefore, the funding organization conducted an independent review and later decided to offer Virgil an alternative accom- modation. The housing that Virgil was eventually provided enabled him to move freely about the entire home and gain access to the bath, toilet, and other areas in a much safer and more dignified manner.
wdx9 | understands that, even though the client made a poor de- cision in one instance, the confidence that the therapist had in the client to allow that decision to happen may have influenced that client to trust the therapist's judg- ment and recommendations in the future. Moreover, as explained earlier, the collaborating mode is most appro- priate for clients who are educated, informed, and proac- tive about their care. It is the correct match for a client with a high need to control and drive the goals and out- comes of therapy.

31wg | I met Edward, a 17-year-old boy, when he was admitted to the adolescent psychiatric unit for aggression toward staff and peers at his residential placement. At this time his primary diagnoses were conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, and posttrau- matic stress disorder. Treatment was initiated with administration of the Adolescent Occupational Self-Assessment, an interview developed for this setting based on the Model of Human Occupation.
celk | During his initial interview, Edward was coop- erative but made no eye contact and gave vague answers to the questions asked about his daily routine. He lacked insight into his aggressive be- haviors and took no personal responsibility for his actions. He perceived himself as being alone in the world and was anxious to move to independent living where he could come and go as he pleased. Edward had low self-esteem and a poorly defined sense of self. He was motivated to be successful in the role of worker, friend, boyfriend, family member, and student yet consistently experienced failure in all these roles. Edward also reported on the initial assessment interview that he was having some difficulty managing his affect and regulating his feelings.
