        "content": "n9ms | The earliest evidence suggesting a role for GPCRs in tumorigenesis stems from work demonstrating that expression of a GPCR encoded by the mas oncogene, had the ability to transform and induce foci formation in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, as well as develop tumors in nude mice. This pivotal work was novel in contrast to the many known oncogenes at the time, most of which were discovered based on the transforming activity of oncogenic viruses. These findings were reinforced by the observation that ectopic expression of the five HT one C serotonin receptor led to transformation of NIH3T3 cells. However, in both cases the receptors did not harbour any identifiable mutations, contrasting with most viral and human oncogenes, and these observations were not widely appreciated. Subsequent studies examining the transforming potential of GPCRs led to the discovery that coupling specificity and excess ligand availability were key determinants of the oncogenic activity of wild type GPCRs. Specifically, overexpression alone of muscarinic cholinergic receptors, which span across G A-coupling subtypes, was found to be insufficient to transform NIH3T3 cells. However, in the presence of the agonist carbachol foci were readily induced for G A Q-coupled CHRMs, thereby establishing that wild-type GPCRs can act as agonist-dependent oncogenes based on their G protein coupling capacity. The A one B-adrenergic receptor was found to behave similarly by inducing neoplastic transformation when ectopically expressed in NIH3T3 cells, and triggering formation of foci in an agonist-dependent manner. However, mutation of this receptor eliminated agonist dependency of receptor activation, rendering it constitutively active, thus raising the possibility that mutations may be a mechanism to enhance the oncogenic potential of GPCRs. As time has progressed, massive advances in the field of cancer genomics have transformed our understanding of oncogenesis and drivers of cancer. Aligned with this, GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins have emerged as candidate drivers supported by a diverse body of work underscoring the cancer relevance of mutations in GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins.\nicdp | The Hallmarks of Cancer\nwtse | The hallmarks of cancer were originally proposed as a conceptual framework to better describe and understand the fundamental underpinnings of neoplastic disease and have since revolutionized our paradigm of the intricate processes driving cancer. Composed of multiple interrelated processes, one, sustaining proliferative signalling, two, evading growth suppressors, three, resisting cell death, four, enabling replicative immortality, five, inducing angiogenesis, six, activating invasion and metastasis, seven, metabolic reprogramming, eight, evading immune destruction, and the enabling characteristics of nine, genome instability and ten, inflammation, this collection of capabilities cooperatively interact to facilitate the transformation of cells, and drive malignant growth and metastasis.\nbm7g | Aimed towards characterizing the unifying features of all cancers irrespective of tumor type, these guiding principles address the complex and dynamic interactions between and within the tumor and the tumor microenvironment, and have grown to encompass the numerous cell types that participate in these interactions, including normal cells whose functions can be co-opted to help drive tumorigenesis. Moreover, the dynamic and interrelated nature of these hallmarks necessitate the coordination of different signalling programs and their associated molecular mechanisms.\njr68 | The remarkable functional repertoire of GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins, and their centrality to numerous cellular and physiological processes make them key participants in facilitating each of these hallmarks. In particular, given the complexity of signal transduction networks controlled by GPCRs, coupled with the cell-context specificity of signal integration and output, it is likely that GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins participate in multiple hallmarks within cancer cells and their tumor microenvironment. Specifically, there are likely to be numerous and overlapping mechanisms by which mutations and/or aberrant expression of GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins drive proliferative signalling, induce evasion of growth suppressors and enable replicative immortality, which will be described in detail below. The role of GPCRs in the remaining hallmarks will be described under each respective heading.\naxix | GPCRs in Cancer Initiation: Proliferative Signalling, Evasion of Growth Suppressors, and Replicative Immortality\n05y4 | GPCRs and Viral-Associated Cancers\n2fb0 | Numerous viruses have evolved to take advantage of the diverse signalling outcomes downstream of GPCRs for their survival and propagation. Together, these mechanisms facilitate viral entry of the host cell, evasion of the host immune response, viral replication, and modulation\ns9fn | of host survival pathways in order to promote viral pathogenesis. Several viruses have been found to encode GPCRs in their genomes, including Kaposi's Sarcoma associated herpesvirus, Human cytomegalovirus, Human Herpesvirus six and seven, and Epstein-Barr Virus. These viral GPCRs all encode GPCRs that are distantly related to human chemokine receptors.\nk5r6 | In many cases, infections by these viruses can lead to development of viral-associated cancer. For example, KSHV, a gamma two herpesvirus, is the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma, most frequently found in immunosuppressed individuals, and a significant driver of mortality among AIDS patients. The KSHV vGPCR is most closely related to human C X C R one and two receptors; however, it possesses several substitutions in residues which confer constitutive activity and enhanced coupling to G proteins. Indeed, expression of KSHV vGPCR is alone sufficient to induce angiosarcomas when expressed in endothelial cells. Studies examining the etiology of Kaposi's sarcoma, have found that vGPCR can initiate Kaposi's sarcomagenesis and contribute to progression of Kaposi's sarcoma lesions. KSHV has also been shown to play key roles in lymphoproliferative disorders, namely primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman's disease, both of which are B cell lymphomas primarily seen in AIDS patients. Here, vGPCR has been shown to elicit a broad range of signalling and transcriptional events ultimately driving B cell recruitment and hyper-proliferation.\nz9v9 | Viruses can also exploit host GPCRs to promote viral pathogenesis and survival by expressing virally encoded GPCR agonists or antagonists in order to modulate host cell signalling. For example, KHSV encodes multiple viral cytokines, which have significant sequence similarity to host chemokine agonists and antagonists and can bind to host GPCRs to mediate functions such as chemotaxis of immune cells, and resistance to apoptosis. Alternatively, these proteins can bind to and inactivate host-produced ligands in order to shut off or abrogate host immune response.\ngpu9 | The Mutation Spectrum of GPCRs in Cancer\nu5ws | The generation of vast cancer sequencing resources including The Cancer Genome Atlas, and the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer have revealed that GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins are collectively mutated in roughly twenty percent of all cancers, spanning across numerous tumor types. This is aligned with mutation frequencies of some of the most well-studied cancer-related pathways, including the receptor tyrosine kinase, RAS, MAPK and P fifty-three pathways, which are mutated at forty-six percent and twenty-nine percent of all cancers",
