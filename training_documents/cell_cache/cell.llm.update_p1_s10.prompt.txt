You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

mror | ABSTRACT
zlxc | Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) denotes the initiation of gene expression after fertilization. It is part of the complex oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET) in which a highly specialized cell - the oocyte - is fertil- ized and transformed into a zygote that gives rise to an embryo that will develop into a newborn. From the perspective of gene expression, the OET reflects reprogramming of germ cell gene expression into the new developmental program of the zygote. This reprogramming occurs at transcriptional and post- transcriptional levels. This review will discuss selected aspects of mammalian ZGA, highlighting shared features and evolved differences observed in commonly investigated mammals and non-mammalian model animals.
k0bw | ultimately give rise to a new organism while the exchange the cell-governing system has to occur without disturbing cell's reg- ular business. The information for this logistical challenge is stored in ~108-109 nucleotides of nuclear DNA and the instructions con- tained therein must be executed in a zygote within a specific time frame. In highly complex human societies, changes in governing systems are accompanied with different degrees of chaos and anar- chy before new governing systems establish their control. This anthropomorphic perspective highlights how effectively natural selection has optimized the oocyte-to-embryo-transition (OET) so that its logistics1 is executed in a timely and orderly fashion.
aq5a | The initiation of animal development varies. The egg size, yolk distribution, cleavage pattern, and gene activation are among the notably diversified features. Yet, at least three themes appear com- mon across the animal kingdom: rapid cell cleavage, "maturation" of chromatin structures, and a delayed onset of zygotic transcrip- tion (for a review of diversity of OET, see, for example, [1]). This review will focus on mammalian ZGA and examine commonalities and differences among mammals and other animals.
sc5y | There are over five thousand extant species of placental mammals representing clades, that radiated primarily after the Cretaceous-Paleogene event 65-66 million years ago [2]. Two mammalian model systems have been studied the most: Homo sapiens and Mus musculus, the latter being the most experimen- tally manipulated mammalian species. However, extant mammals exhibit extreme diversity in size, habitat occupation, and locomo- tion adaptation [3]. Mammalian radiation did not occur at the same pace in terms of speciation and genome evolution; Mus musculus belongs to a group that radiated extensively [4]. The mouse genome evolved faster than that of larger mammals such as humans or bovine because it could produce more generation cycles per a given unit of time. This should be kept in mind when interpreting mouse model data because many traits observed in mice could repre- sent recently evolved characteristics rather than common ancestral traits present in all mammals.
0yab | 2. Early development in animals - the placenta
w95z | Initiation of development in placental mammals differs from other animals such as Caenorhabditis, Drosophila, zebrafish, Xeno- pus or chicken where the fertilized egg will exclusively give rise to a gastrulating embryo. In non-mammalian models, the initial cleav- age typically employs rapid cell cycles (sea urchin or Drosophila~10 min, zebrafish ~15 min, Xenopus ~35 min [5]) with little if any tran- scription of the genome (reviewed in [6]). Different mechanisms may regulate the delayed onset of ZGA (reviewed in [7,8])
0i1k | Zygotic cleavage in early mammalian development may not be a homologous process to cleavage in non-mammalian species. In mammals (mice, humans, bovine), the initial rate of cleavage is slow while extraembryonic and embryonic lineages are not yet sep- arated. By the time the first cleavage of mouse zygotes is complete, the above-mentioned non-mammalian models have developed far beyond gastrulation (Fig. A). Accordingly, it was proposed that early mammalian development should be aligned with early development of other animals by gastrulation (and not fertiliza- tion) to account for the rapid cleavage non-mammalian metazoan zygotes, which appears rather homologous to the accelerated peri- gastrulation cycles in placental mammals [6]. According to this model, fertilization in mammals occurs at a comparatively ear- lier stage in oocyte development with added cleavage steps before extraembryonic and embryonic lineages are separated [6]. Thus, mammalian preimplantation development should be considered a derived characteristic that evolved in ancestors of placental mam- mals as an adaptation of terrestrial life.
dqlg | 3. Early development in mammals and animals - the time issue
p6pq | Numerous experiments in different model systems indicate that zygotic gene products become essential for development only at specific stages that vary among the studied animals. For example, transcriptional inhibition in zebrafish or Xenopus embryos results in gastrulation defects, but does not prevent cleavage [9,10]. In Drosophila, absence of transcription will prevent cellularization, but preceding cell cycles will occur [11]. Consequently, analysis
zse6 | of RNA synthesis showed that zygotic transcription appears with a species-specific delay after fertilization (reviewed in [8]).
p2n3 | While the very first transcripts may be difficult to detect, the first major wave of RNA synthesis and transcript accumulation occurs at a specific stage of development. The first major surge in RNA synthesis is traditionally denoted the major ZGA wave and is char- acterized by a global change in gene expression that is essential for continued development. Importantly, some RNA synthesis, tradi- tionally denoted minor ZGA, can be detected prior to major ZGA (reviewed <LATEX>\left. i n \left[ 1 \right] \right) .</LATEX> However, this traditional distinction has been undermined by next generation sequencing (NGS) methods, which show that transcription at many loci expressed during major ZGA is also detectable at earlier time points.
ohh7 | ZGA timing was proposed to be controlled by nucleo- cytoplasmic ratio changes during cleavage where the geometric increase of genomic DNA titrates transcriptional repression [10], a notion supported by experimental data in zebrafish embryos [12]. More recently, it has been proposed that the concentration of non-DNA bound core histones determines the time for the onset of transcription. The reduction in nuclear histone concentration that coincides with genome activation does not affect nucleosome density on DNA, but would allow transcription factors to compete successfully for DNA binding [13].
vbni | Major ZGA in mouse embryos occurs at the 2-cell stage while in other mammals it is delayed several divisions (4-16-cell), although more sensitive NGS data suggest that transcription initiates earlier [14,15]. In terms of major ZGA among mammals, mice are "early genome activators" while humans and bovine are "later genome activators". It is likely that the early genome activation in mice is a derived characteristic while humans and bovine represent a more ancestral state. However, the early/late distinction is relative. Mice undergo major ZGA after the first cleavage (~19 h after fertilization) <LATEX>\begin{array}{} { \text { but at a } m } \\ { \text { Xenonus } \left( \right. } \end{array}</LATEX> much later time than major ZGA occurs in zebrafish (~4h), (~ 6h), or Drosophila (~2.5h) [8]).
