        "content": "6pmo | Other more sophisticated elements have been developed for modeling steel members with dominant shear yielding behavior, that are also applicable to EBF links. On the basis of the method proposed by Ricles and Popov, Kazemi and Erfani developed a model with a combined shear-flexural inner hinge and two rigid beams on its sides. Numerical results were compared to the test data reported by Kasai and Popov to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach. An improved version of this model with an axial-shear-flexural hinge was recently developed by Kazemi and Hoseinzadeh Asl. A mixed-formulation (or force-based) element was proposed by Saritas and Filippou with independent displacement, stress, and strain fields, where the displacement field was based on Timoshenko's beam theory. As a result, shear locking was avoided and mesh refinement was deemed unnecessary. Since the axial-shear-flexural interaction was\n195r | captured using material data only, the model did not need further calibration for different loading and boundary conditions, unlike most of the methods with concentrated hinges. Comparison between numerical and experimental results revealed the accuracy and robustness of the method. Papachristidis et al. have also proposed a force-based element; however, considering a three-dimensional state of stress and taking into account the interaction of axial, shear, flexural, and torsional actions. The kinematics of the model were obtained through the natural-mode method. Fairly accurate results were reported using this element when compared with the results of previous tests and also accurate FE analyses.\nkqmi | Five. EBF Systems\ng8rd | Five point one. Characteristics and Capacity Design Approach\nnns9 | This section provides general insight into the behavior and design philosophy of EBF systems, while the subsequent section is devoted to more in-depth discussion about the research on the seismic performance of these structures. As mentioned by Popov and Engelhardt, the use of eccentric bracing for resisting wind loads was well recognized even in the nineteen thirties; however, the use of this system for seismic applications was proposed in the nineteen seventies in Japan. The studies of Roeder and Popov in the late nineteen seventies pioneered the research on EBFs in the United States. The cyclic loading tests of Roeder and Popov and Manheim on a reduced-scale three-story one-bay EBF, the pseudo-dynamic tests on a full-scale six-story two-bay EBF as a part of the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Program in Earthquake Engineering reported by Roeder et al. and Foutch, the shaking table tests of Whittaker et al. on a scaled replica of the same six-story EBF, and the pseudo-dynamic tests of Balendra et al. as well as the early analytical studies of Hjelmstad and Popov, Ricles and Popov, and Popov et al. on EBF systems, all confirmed that this system could be effectively used for seismic applications. The EBF system was utilized in several major applications shortly after these studies. Short links in EBF systems are preferred since they will provide higher stiffness, strength, and ductility over intermediate and long links. Nevertheless, Popov and Engelhardt demonstrated that using links that are too short will\n9uwy | impose unmanageably high rotation demands on links. It was also noted by these researchers that the stiffness and consequently the fundamental period of EBF systems can be adjusted simply by altering the link length.\nsrly | The capacity design approach is utilized in the EBF design to ensure concentration of yielding in links while keeping other members essentially elastic. First, the links are sized and then, other members are designed to resist the loads generated by the yielded and strain hardened links. Plastic design methods for EBF systems were initially proposed by Roeder and Popov, Manheim, and Kasai and Popov in the nineteen seventies and nineteen eighties. An allowable stress design method was also developed by Teal in the late nineteen seventies. In the current practice, an elastic analysis is typically conducted during the design of EBF systems. Design examples for EBF systems can be found, for instance, in Bruneau et al., the AISC Seismic Design Manual, Popov et al. and Becker and Ishler.\ndl6i | The overstrength of links must be considered in the design of members other than the links to estimate the maximum loads that might be imposed on these members by the fully yielded and strain hardened links. Design specifications provide overstrength values which may be different for beams, braces, and columns. The AISC Seismic Provisions suggest a value of two equals one point to five for I-shaped links during the capacity design of EBF braces, which is lower than the traditional value of one point five (Section two point one), mainly for considerations of economy. It is worth noting that a recent numerical study by Yiğitsoy et al. demonstrated the adequacy of the current overstrength provisions for braces.\n89ub | The design of a beam in an EBF system is often problematic since it is generally under high axial force and high bending moment. Increasing the size of the beam will not benefit the design, since the link-induced forces will also increase. Several methods such as using short links and braces with moment connections possessing inclination angles above forty degrees can reduce the demand on beams. In addition, an EBF configuration proposed by Engelhardt and Popov (Figure one E) can minimize the beam axial force at the cost of using larger links and reducing the system redundancy. A similar EBF configuration was tested by Yang in the early nineteen eighties. In order to aid this design difficulty, a lower overstrength factor is used in AISC Three Forty-One Dashed Ten for the capacity design of\ndhle | beams when compared to that of braces. This is justified by considering the positive effect of the composite floor on beam performance as well as the fact that limited yielding of a beam will not negatively affect the behavior of an EBF system, as long as the stability of the beam is assured. Based on extensive FE analyses on EBF sub-assemblages, Yiğitsoy et al. suggested that the overstrength value recommended in AISC Three Forty-One Dashed Ten could be reduced even further in the design of an EBF beam with I-shaped links, provided that the demand-to-capacity ratio of the beam is kept below unity. For other cases a maximum unbraced length recommendation was developed. The FE analyses demonstrated that the probable yielding of the beam due to the above relaxation would not be detrimental and would only affect the brace end moment.",
