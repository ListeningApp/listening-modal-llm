You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

afbe | 13.13 What next?
78r8 | At the age of 13 I met my heroes, Iron Maiden, and very nice they were too. I've met them a couple of times since (not because they're my best buddies or anything exciting like that, but over the years the fan club put on various events where you were allowed to stand next to them and gibber like a fool while they humoured you politely). You'll notice that the photo at the start of this chapter is signed by Dave Murray. This wasn't possible because I had my own darkroom installed backstage at the Hammersmith Odeon in which I could quickly process photographs, or because I had access to time travel (sadly), but because I took the photo with me when I met him in 2000. I recounted the tale of how terrified I had been about meeting him in 1986. If he thought I was some strange stalker he certainly didn't let on. Uncharacteristic of most people who've sold millions of albums, they're lovely blokes.
320g | Anyway, having seen Iron Maiden in their glory, I was inspired. They still inspire me: I still rate them as the best live band I've ever seen (and I've seen them over 35 times, so I ought to know). Although I had briefly been deflected from my destiny by the shock of grammar school, I was back on track. I had to form a band. There was just one issue: no one else played a musical instrument. The solution was easy: through several months of covert subliminal persuasion I convinced my two best friends (both called Mark, oddly enough) that they wanted nothing more than to start learning the drums and bass guitar. A power trio was in the making.

jkp9 | · Task 1: A few years back I was stalked. You'd think they could have found someone a bit more interesting to stalk, but apparently times were hard. It could have been a lot worse, but it wasn't particularly pleasant. I imagined a world in which a psychologist tried two different therapies on different groups of stalkers (25 stalkers in each group - this variable is called Group). To the first group he gave cruel-to-be-kind therapy (every time the stalkers followed him around, or sent him a letter, the psychologist attacked them with a cattle prod). The second therapy was psychodyshamic therapy, in which stalkers were hypnotized and regressed into their childhood to discuss their penis (or lack of penis), their father's penis, their dog's penis, the seventh penis of a seventh penis and any other penis that sprang to mind. The psychologist measured the number of hours stalking in one week both before (stalk1) and after (stalk2) treatment (Stalker.sav). Analyse the effect of therapy on stalking behaviour after therapy, covarying for the amount of

41fx | · Task 3: A marketing manager tested the benefit of soft drinks for curing hangovers. He took 15 people and got them drunk. The next morning as they awoke, dehydrated and feeling as though they'd licked a camel's sandy feet clean with their tongue, he gave five of them water to drink, five of them Lucozade (a very nice glucose-based UK drink) and the
7um8 | remaining five a leading brand of cola (this variable is called drink). He measured how well they felt (on a scale from 0 = I feel like death to 10 = I feel really full of beans and healthy) two hours later (this variable is called well). He measured how drunk the person got the night before on a scale of 0 = as sober as a nun to 10 = flapping about like a haddock out of water on the floor in a puddle of their own vomit (HangoverCure.sav). Fit a model to see whether people felt better after different drinks when covarying for how drunk they were the night
uow2 | before.
iat7 | · Task 4: Compute effect sizes for Task 3 and report the results.
ywwr | · Task 5: The highlight of the elephant calendar is the annual elephant soccer event in Nepal (google search it). A heated argument burns between the African and Asian elephants. In 2010, the president of the Asian Elephant Football Association, an elephant named Boji, claimed that Asian elephants were more talented than their African counterparts. The head of the African Elephant Soccer Association, an elephant called Tunc, issued a press statement that read 'I make it a matter of personal pride never to take seriously any remark made by something that looks like an enormous scrotum'. I was called in to settle things. I collected data from the two types of elephants (elephant) over a season and recorded how many goals each elephant scored (goals) and how many years of experience the elephant had (experience). Analyse the effect of the type of elephant on goal scoring, covarying for the amount of football experience the elephant has (Elephant Football.sav).

Imagine we also had information about the baseline number of mischievous acts in these participants (mischief1). Fit a model to see whether people with invisibility cloaks get up to more mischief than those without when factoring in their baseline level of mischief (Invisibility
