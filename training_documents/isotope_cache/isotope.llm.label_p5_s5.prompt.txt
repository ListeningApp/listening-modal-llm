o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

u15r | Origin of Unusually Large Isotope Effects. The observed isotope effect for compound Q decay exceeds by severalfold the classical limit for a deuterium isotope effect. Large isotope effects typically arise in reactions that include (i) branched pathways, (ii) multiple steps with cumulative effects of more than one isotope-sensitive step, (iii) a hydrogen- tunneling process, or (iv) a magnetic isotope effect (Hwang & Grissom, 1994).4 The effects of a branched reaction are usually seen in the product distribution rather than the direct observation of the decay of a reactive, chromophoric intermediate as reported here. The participation of more than one isotope-sensitive step is feasible, but the possibilities for such a process are constrained by the fact that no loss of hydrogen other than from the bond where oxygen insertion occurs is observed. Thus, it is unlikely that two hydrogen atoms are removed during the course of the reaction. In preliminary studies, we have not been able to observe magnetic isotope effects in the product distribution.5 Con- sequently, of the possibilities noted, hydrogen tunneling appears to be the most likely origin of the large isotope effect.6
lq35 | Observations characteristic of tunneling include (1) a large <LATEX>\mathrm { K I E } > 7 ,</LATEX> (2) curvature in the Arrhenius plot, (3) AAH > 1.3 kcal/mol, and <LATEX>\left( 4 \right) a n</LATEX> Arrhenius preexponential factor ratio of <LATEX>A ^ { \mathrm { H } _ { \star } } A ^ { \mathrm { D } } < 1</LATEX> (Brunton et al., 1976; More O'Ferrall, 1975). We have shown here that the compound Q decay reaction
3g9w | Nesheim and Lipscomb
d09o | in the presence of methane fulfills three of these criteria, in that it has a large KIE, a large difference in activation energies, and an apparent <LATEX>A ^ { H } : A ^ { D }</LATEX> of slightly less than 1. Curvature in the Arrhenius plot is not expected to be observable within the small temperature range that could be accessed in this study. Although tunneling is consistent with the data observed, under the assumption of tunneling both the apparent <LATEX>\Delta \Delta \mathrm { H }</LATEX> and <LATEX>A ^ { H } : A ^ { D }</LATEX> will depend strongly on the temperature range in which the measurements are made. Thus, measurement of these parameters over a single small temperature range cannot be used to directly distinguish between tunneling and a classical Arrhenius mechanism.
ylhz | Tunneling of the hydrogen atom during the abstraction process could elicit a large isotope effect, especially for a small, light molecule such as methane. Molecular orbital calculations of the hydrogen-atom abstraction process for methane have been carried out by Pudzianowski and Loew (1983). An intramolecular deuterium isotope effect for CH3D of 34 was calculated for the process in the absence of tunneling and was 56 when a tunneling factor was added. The calculated AG was very small, -0.2 kcal/mol (298 K). Significantly, results from this computational experiment indicate that methane has a uniquely large KIE compared to the other hydrocarbons examined. These calculations7 assumed that the hydrogen-atom abstraction was carried out by a ground state triplet oxygen atom and predicted a linear transition state with complete C-H bond fissure, as we have proposed for the mechanism of MMO.
a3td | A factor that can elevate the apparent KIE is differential solvation of the <LATEX>H -</LATEX> and D-atoms on the substrate (Pal et al., 1995). Due to the highly ordered solvent "cage" surrounding the hydrophobic substrate, the deuterium could be less easily accessed by the reactive oxidant than hydrogen. This type of effect is not related to the transition state. We discount this process as a significant contributor for our reactions because the second-order rate constants for CH4 and <LATEX>\mathrm { C D } _ { 4 }</LATEX> are essentially independent of the fraction of <LATEX>D 2 0</LATEX> in the solvent.8 The slight decrease observed can be accounted for entirely by the effects of the increased viscosity of <LATEX>D _ { 2 } O</LATEX> on a collisional reaction.
ex5k | Differences in partitioning of deuterated and protiated methane between the solvent and the hydrophobic interior of the enzyme might also cause anomalously large isotope effects. However, intramolecular isotope effects for the isotopic homologs of methane should not be affected by such bulk partitioning.
9d4o | Comparison of the Isotope Effects Determined from Compound <LATEX>Q</LATEX> Decay and from Product Distribution. The deuterium isotope effects determined from product ratios, although large, are not as large as those determined directly from the kinetics of compound Q decay. In a single-turnover system, this would not normally be expected if compound Q reacts with substrate directly to form product as we propose. One possible explanation is that the reaction cycle

m5ka | branches before compound Q, so that only a small fraction of the reaction proceeds with an isotope effect approaching 100. This seems unlikely because it is known from Möss- bauer spectroscopy that compound Q is formed by at least half, and probably significantly more than half, of the MMOH sites after reaction with O2 (Lee et al., 1993a). Also, the extinction coefficient of compound Q was estimated to be 7500 M-1 cm-1 at 430 nm on the basis of the assumption that all of the observed product is formed via compound Q (Lee et al., 1993b). If this is not the case, then the extinction coefficient of compound Q is much larger than 7500 M-1 cm-1, which seems unlikely for a non-heme iron complex containing only two irons. A branch in the reaction pathway after the decay of compound Q would not alter the observed isotope effect unless it introduces a reversal of the hydrogen- atom abstraction. It is this possibility and the frequent correlation between a large primary KIE and a free energy change within several kilocalories/mole of zero [Bell (1973) and references cited therein] that leads us to put forth the scheme illustrated in Figure 5.
byu8 | In this scheme, compound Q reacts with methane with a very large deuterium isotope effect. It is further proposed that the intermediate methyl radical can react by either reabstracting the original hydrogen atom or abstracting hydroxyl radical to complete the oxidation reaction. If the hydrogen atom is reabstracted, a different form of compound Q, designated Q', is proposed to form. This scheme would decrease the observed isotope effect in the product distribu- tion because the hydrogen-atom reabstraction reaction would also show an isotope effect, while it is reasonable to assume a negligible isotope effect for the radical recombination process involving OH(D). Accordingly, the methane mol- ecules that had lost deuterium would have a greater tendency to go on to product than those that had lost hydrogen, resulting in a lowering of the isotope effect as seen in the product analysis. Simulations of this scheme show that it models both the isotope effects determined from the kinetics of compound Q decay and from product yield if the reabstraction isotope effect is about 10 and the abstraction isotope effect for compound Q' is in the range of 10-100. However, there are many other values for these constants that also give good fits to the data. The reaction scheme requires that the methane generated by hydrogen-atom reabstraction in the active site exchange freely with methane in solution because if this were not the case, no isotope effect would be observed when a 1:1 mixture of CH4 and CD4

xnth | reacts with compound Q. The reaction scheme also requires that compounds Q and Q' be discrete species because if this were not the case, the isotope effect in the decay rate of compound Q would remain correlated with the product isotope effect. Moreover, according to the scheme, com- pound Q decay should occur in at least three exponential phases. However, only one phase is observed, suggesting either that all species except compound Q are colorless at 430 nm (like the final species, diferric MMOH) and/or that compound Q' reacts with methane much faster than does compound Q. In either case, compound Q' would necessarily be distinguishable from compound Q.
vafm | The structures of the intermediate compounds Q, R, and the proposed intermediate Q' are not known. However, studies of high-valent model compounds (Dong et al., 1995a,b), as well as spectroscopic (Shu et al., 1996) and crystallographic (Rosenzweig et al., 1993, 1995) studies of the diferric hydroxylase, are consistent with a di-u-oxo (or hydroxo) diiron cluster for compound Q. One scenario that could provide a structural basis for the scheme shown in Figure 5 is illustrated in Figure 6. In this case, the initial hydrogen abstraction by compound Q leads to the formation of a terminal hydroxo moiety, compound R, which, following the reabstraction reaction (compound Q'), does not rapidly reform the second oxo bridge. The resulting terminal oxenoid species would be expected to be at least as reactive as the dibridged structure, but might have significantly different spectroscopic properties as required by the data.
2zmw | Although the hydrogen-atom reabstraction process is unexpected and has not been proposed for any other hydrocarbon-oxidizing system to our knowledge, the isotope effects determined from compound Q decay and the product ratio were both measured by straightforward techniques, suggesting that some process of this type does, in fact, occur. It is possible that the formation of a methyl radical presents a unique case in that it is expected to be significantly more reactive than other hydrocarbon radicals in the active site of MMO due to either the higher bde of the methane C-H bond or the potentially greater access of the methyl radical to the active site diiron cluster. The apparent occurrence of an isotope effect in two discrete steps means that MMO substrates other than methane may exhibit different isotope effects in either or both steps. Thus, the compound Q decay isotope effect might be larger or smaller than the product isotope effect for specific substrates.
bf9k | Secondary Isotope Effects. Both the rate constant of compound Q decay and the KIE monitored by product formation show essentially linear changes with a change in deuterium content of the methane. However, the implications of these changes are different. In the case of compound Q decay, the linear plot suggests that the primary isotope is large and the secondary isotope effect is small. This is an important observation because an apparent KIE of ~100 would be observed for a system with a more typical primary isotope effect (e.g., 12) and an exceptionally large secondary

ibgs | effect (e.g. 2).9 However, if this were the case, the plot shown in Figure 3 would be distinctly nonlinear. A simulation of the expected plot with a primary isotope effect of 60 and a secondary effect of 1.2 (apparent KIE = 100, Figure 3) is still slightly outside of the uncertainty in the data, suggesting that a maximum secondary isotope effect of ~1.1 would be allowed. In the case of the KIE monitored by product formation, there is a substantial decrease in the KIE as the deuterium content decreases. If the primary and secondary isotope effects were constant, then each of the isotopic homologs would give the same observed intra- molecular isotope effect (given by the primary to secondary effect ratio); thus, the observed decrease is unexpected. A similar trend was noted for zirconium activation of methane C-H bonds by Wolczanski and co-workers (Schaller et al., 1994), who attributed the change to relatively large secondary isotope effects that differed for each isotopic homolog. In considering these two sets of data together, it appears that the secondary isotope effects have little or no effect on the compound Q decay rate, but a complex and much more significant effect on the observed product KIE. This supports a scheme, such as that shown in Figure 5, in which the observed effects derive from different reactions.
colo | Mechanistic Significance. A deuterium isotope effect ranging from 4 to 20 is observed for both the product yield from methane single turnover by diferrous MMOH and the Vmax/KM value determined from multiple turnover by the reconstituted system. Significantly, little isotope effect is observed in the Vmax value for steady state turnover. These observations are generally in accord with the proposed mechanism for MMOH. Transient kinetic experiments (Lee et al., 1993b) show the following: (i) all of the steps in the cycle leading to compound Q are effectively irreversible; (ii) compound Q forms before methane reacts productively with the enzyme; (iii) methane appears to react with compound Q without prior complex formation; and (iv) once methane reacts with compound Q, the product stays bound in the active site to be released slowly in the rate-limiting step. Under these constraints for either a sequential or nonsequential mechanism, Vmax ~ k6ETotal and KM,CH4 ~ k6/ k4 (Segel, 1975). The product release step (k6) would not be expected to be isotope sensitive, and thus the observation of almost no isotope effect on Vmax is consistent with the mechanism shown in Figure 1. Similarly, the mechanism predicts the observed large isotope effect on KM because the step in which the C-H bond-breaking chemistry occurs (k4) appears in the expression for this kinetic constant.
d6r4 | Various mechanistic studies of MMO have provided information about the nature of the substrate intermediate during the oxygen insertion step of the catalytic cycle. Unfortunately, these studies do not support the same conclu- sion. A study using ultrafast radical clock substrates by Lippard and co-workers (Liu, K. E., et al., 1993) showed that, for the M. capsulatus MMO, no radical trapping occurred on a time scale for rearrangement of 10-11 s, suggesting that no substrate radical is formed and obviating the need for a discrete C-H bond-breaking step. In contrast, we have shown that for the M. trichosporium MMO, partial inversion of configuration of chiral ethane occurs, strongly

pk06 | suggesting that a substrate intermediate free to rotate in the active site, most reasonably a substrate radical, is generated (Priestley et al., 1992). The studies described here show that the methane oxygen insertion reaction occurs with inter- and intramolecular deuterium isotope effects that are greater than 4 and, perhaps, as large as 100 for the C-H bond- breaking step itself. These effects seem inconsistent with any model that does not propose a C-H bond-breaking step to form a discrete substrate intermediate prior to oxygen addition.
