You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

b7cq | Recruitment dynamics in the coastal stock of Pacific hake are characterised by episodic strong year classes, which can vary in number by as much as two orders of magnitude or more relative to weak year classes (Bailey and Francis, 1985; Methot and Dorn, 1995; JTC, 2013; Figure 9.5). The occurrence of these dominant year classes appears to be largely independent of spawning stock size, so a reliable stock-recruitment relationship has been difficult to establish (Bailey and Francis, 1985; JTC, 2013). Varying levels of mortality during the pre-recruit period is a common explanation for similar recruitment dynamics in other species.
0b39 | Hollowed et al. (2001) found that Pacific hake appeared to respond more strongly to inter-annual variability than to decadal climatic variability. Strong year classes often occurred in years with unusually warm surface temperature anomalies in coastal waters north of the tropics, 'Niño North' conditions that do not always correspond to El Niño events. The frequency of these conditions will affect the size and variability of the coastal Pacific hake stock.
qecd | Individual growth of Pacific hake can also be quite variable (Dorn, 1992). Helser et al. (2008) examined length-at-age data from the acoustic and bottom trawl surveys and found that both of the von Bertalanffy growth parameters K (Brody growth coefficient) and L. (asymptotic size) declined for individual cohorts from the early 1970s and the mid-1980s and subsequently increased again. Temporary decreases in parameter estimates could be due to warmer waters and reduced productivity following the 1977 regime shift,

cp13 | increased competition due to strong year classes, or both. Individual growth was depressed during the 1983-1984 El Niño (Hollowed and Francis, 1987), perhaps due to reduced euphausiid abundance (Miller et al., 1985; Rexstad and Pikitch, 1986).
bgre | 9.4 Fisheries
57lp | The fishery for the coastal population of Pacific hake occurs along the coasts of California, Oregon and Washington in the United States and British Columbia in Canada, typically from May through December. The primary fishery is con- ducted with mid-water trawls over bottom depths of 100-500 m; Pacific hake are also caught incidentally in other coastal fisheries. Catch averaged 222,000 t per year during 1966-2012, with nearly three-quarters of that catch coming from the U.S. waters. Recent coast-wide catches have been greater than the long-term average, averaging 243,000 t per year during 2008-2012 (Figure 9.6).
ukth | Pacific hake were caught incidentally in commercial fisheries targeting more valuable species dating from the late 19th century but were discarded or pro- cessed into animal food and fishmeal until the 1960s. Annual landings never exceeded a few 100 t during this period. In 1964, the U.S. National Marine Fish- eries Service (NMFS) demonstrated the potential for large catches of Pacific hake (up to 30 t in a single half-hour trawl) off Washington and Oregon using state-of-the-art depth telemetry systems on mid-water trawlers. The domestic fishery in the United States grew from less than 500 t in 1964 to about 9000 t in 1967, although these levels were not sustained afterwards due to lack of profitability.
kpvt | Foreign fleets noticed the increased harvest opportunity, and in 1966, factory trawlers from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics began harvesting

d0ik | Pacific hake. Japanese vessels, whose primary target was Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus), also harvested Pacific hake in the late 1960s. Vessels from Poland, the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and Bulgaria joined the fishery for Pacific hake in the 1970s. Foreign annual catch of Pacific hake from 1966 through 1979 averaged 167,000 t.
0x0s | Joint venture fisheries commenced in 1978 and completely supplanted the foreign fishery by 1989 in the United States and 1992 in Canada. The entry of domestic motherships and catcher-processors into the U.S. Pacific hake fishery in 1990 accelerated the change to a wholly domestic U.S. fishery that took the entire catch by 1991. The domestic Pacific hake fishery in Canada developed at a slower pace in the absence of these larger domestic processing vessels and remains largely a domestic shoreside fishery, with a small joint venture fishery in most years.
4exe | 9.4.1 Management strategy and challenges
0myz | Since implementation of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act in the United States and the declaration of a 200-mile fishery conservation zone in Canada in the late 1970s, annual harvest quotas have been the primary management tool used to limit the catch of Pacific hake. Scientists from both countries collaborated through the Technical Subcommittee of the Canada-U.S. Groundfish Committee, and there were informal agreements on the adoption of annual fishing policies. During the 1990s, however, disagreements between the United States and Canada on the allotment of the catch between the U.S. and Canadian fisheries led to quota overruns. This, coupled with the decline of abundant year classes from
xh3i | Biology, fisheries, assessment and management of Pacific hake
syiw | the mid-1980s, led to Pacific hake being declared overfished (i.e. below 25% of - average - unfished spawning biomass) in the United States in 2002. The strong 1999 year class was subsequently observed in the acoustic survey and fisheries, and a new assessment and abundance estimate led to the stock being declared rebuilt in 2004.
kg3t | The allocation issue was resolved with the development and eventual implementation of the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada on Pacific Hake/Whiting (the Treaty), which was signed in November 2003. The Treaty specifies a process for developing annual stock assessments and total allowable catch (TAC), including a default harvest rate of F40% and fixed allocations of 73.88% and 26.12% for the United States and Canada, respectively. The Hake Treaty established a Joint Management Commission (JMC) that decides the annual TAC. JMC decisions are guided by the terms of the Treaty and the JMC's three advisory bodies consisting of the Joint Technical Committee (JTC), the Scientific Review Group (SRG) and an Advisory Panel. The JTC conducts the annual stock assessment and develops potential yield amounts for JMC consideration. The SRG assures the technical integrity of the stock assessment and the assessment's potential yield estimates. The Advisory Panel is composed of hake industry participants from the United States and Canada, who provide their perspectives about the fishery.
