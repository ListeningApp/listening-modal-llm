The average testicular volume is twenty cubic centimeters in healthy young men and decreases in\nvtbo | Four point four\nq8pa | elderly men. Normal longitudinal length of the testis is approximately four point five to five point one centimeters. This extra-abdominal location maintains the testis at a temperature about two to three degrees Celsius lower than normal body temperature and this is required for normal spermatogenesis. The testis is surrounded by the tunica albuginea, a thick protective covering of the testis. It is suspended by the spermatic cord, which also contains the vas deferens, spermatic artery, and venous and lymphatic plexus. This tunica is thickened to form the mediastinum where the rete testis is found. The testis itself is composed of a series of lobules in humans approximately three hundred lobules divided by fibrous septa from the mediastinum. The testis contains seminiferous tubules and interstitial cells. The tubules are segregated into regions by connective tissue septa and occupy approximately eighty percent of the testicular volume. The tubules are long, V-shaped tubules, the ends of which terminate in the rete testis see Figure One.\nuc9x | i) Function of the Tunica: This capsule contains blood vessels, smooth muscle fibers and nerve fibers sensitive to pressure. The functional role of the testicular capsule is unknown but may relate to movement of fluid out through the rete testis or control of blood flow to the testis. In humans, it creates a partition between groups of seminiferous tubules, which are present within these lobules. The tough, fibrous tunica may also serve a protective function because of the position of the testes external to the pelvis. There are three layers that comprise the tunica-the tunica vasculosa, tunica albuginea, and tunica vaginalis.\nzy7o | ii) The lobules are composed of one to four seminiferous tubules, which are long looping structures that open at both ends into the rete testis. Within these lobules are the seminiferous tubules and the interstitial tissue that includes the blood and lymphatic vessels, nerves, Leydig cells, and macrophages.\nkcar | iii) Seminiferous Tubules are long tubes lined with stratified epithelium about one hundred fifty to two hundred fifty micrometers in diameter and thirty to seventy centimeters long. The combined length of the seminiferous tubules in a testis is approximately two hundred fifty meters! The tubuli recti or straight tubules connect these seminiferous tubules to the rete testis, a complex series of channels that connect to the epididymis by the ductuli efferentes.\n00aw | iv) Mediastinum supports the blood vessels, lymphatic system, and the ducts within the testis that transport the sperm and connect to the rete testis.\n351p | v) Rete Testis Efferent Ducts Ductuli efferentes: The rete testis receives drainage from the central, superior, and posterior regions of the testicular seminiferous tubules. The rete coalesces in the superior portion of the testis to form efferent ducts, which leave the testis, entering the head or caput of the epididymis. The sperm move through the tubuli recti straight tubules lined by simple cuboidal epithelium to the rete testis anastomosing channels in the mediastinum of the testis to the efferent ducts lined by columnar epithelium that connect the testis to the initial segment of the epididymal duct. In the human, there are about ten to twenty efferent ducts that have cilia that beat in the direction of the epididymis. This region plays an important role in the absorption of fluids secreted by the seminiferous epithelium. This region is surrounded by large lymphatic channels and blood vessels associated with large clusters of Leydig cells. The efferent ducts coalesce into a variable pattern within the caput to form a single epididymal tubule.\nzzcb | Four point five\nmxnx | vi) The artery to the testis is specialized in that it is highly coiled and intimately associated with a network of anastomotic veins that form the pampiniform plexus Figure One. This vascular arrangement facilitates the exchange of heat and small molecules, including testosterone. The counter-current exchange of heat in the spermatic cord provides blood to the testis that is two to four degrees Celsius lower than rectal temperature in the normal individual.\n11k8 | b) Genitourinary Tract and Accessory Gland Anatomy",
