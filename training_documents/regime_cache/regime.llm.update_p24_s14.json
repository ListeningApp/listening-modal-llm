We now outline some examples for Langevin dynamics, presented in Section two point one point three. Since this dynamics evolves two variables, namely positions q and momenta p, we can in theory use both differential operators Vq and Vp to construct our synthetic forcings. This leads to additional options for each class of extra forcings.\n78dj | Example three point four (Divergence-free vector field). The extra perturbation can be chosen as a first-order differential operator of the form\nc1pj | Čextra equals GTV equals G{ V q plus G two Vp,\n6v9y | where G one, G two are such that\ndeen | divq(G one TV) plus divp(G two TV) equals zero.\n27bo | A perturbation of similar form to Čextra has been used and studied. For instance, in any dimension d greater than two, a natural choice is G equals AVH, or more generally G equals &'(H)AVH, where A is an antisymmetric matrix. Typical choices include\n72k6 | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS\nemhp | the symplectic matrix\ntcgw | negative I zero zero I,\n4d8s |\n1cmq | or, more generally, linear combinations of matrices of the form\nu8s6 | A equals negative BT zero B\n86m5 | zero or A one zero zero,\nlzzv | A two\n623p | with A one, A two antisymmetric. In all these expressions, A one, A two and B can be functions of (q,p). The choice Čextra leads to the generator\n50lp | (Čextra4) (q, p) equals G one(q,p)TVq plus G two(q,p)}Vp,\ni4nn | and the dynamics\nnuk3 | dqt equals M negative one pt dt plus an G one(qt, Pt) dt,\ny2cn | dpt equals negative VV(qt) dt plus n(F(qt) plus @ G two(qt, Pt)) dt negative YM negative one pt dt plus VB twenty-seven dWt.\nhgm4 | When G equals JVH with J the symplectic matrix, the extra perturbation corresponds to rescaling the Hamiltonian part of the dynamics, which is equivalent, up to a time rescaling, to changing the strength of the fluctuation-dissipation.\nnc42 | Example three point five (Modified fluctuation-dissipation). We first consider an operator that is second-order in p. A simple choice for the extra forcing is Lextra equals negative B negative one.\ntbfm | Ln, a equals Cham plus (y plus an) CFD plus Cphys.\nok18 | For this forcing to be admissible, we require that one plus on greater than zero. The dynamics associated with Ln, a reads\npgqe | dqt equals M negative one pt dt,\nqo9m | dpt equals negative VV(qt) dt plus nF(qt) dt negative (y plus an) M negative one pt dt plus two(y plus an) β dWt.\ne7zz | The effect of the extra forcing is to rescale the strength of the fluctuation-dissipation, either increasing it when an greater than zero, or reducing it when an less than zero. More generally, one can scale this forcing by a function of q, i.e. consider Lextra equals negative a(q) two with a(q): X -> R. One can also extend this form to matrix-valued diffusions of the form D(q,p) Vp.\nlhzk | We can similarly consider a second-order forcing in q. One possible choice for the generator is then Lextra equals negative B negative one Vq seven q. Here, we require that on greater than zero. The associated dynamics is\nwdpw | dqt equals M negative one pt dt negative an VV (qt) dt plus one plus V two zero one B.\ntwiq | dpt equals (negative VV(qt) dt plus nF(qt)) dt negative YM negative one pt dt plus V twenty-seven dWt,\ncchx | β\n2vma | where Bt is a standard d-dimensional Brownian motion independent of Wt. One can also generalize this choice by scaling it by a function of p, leading to the more general choice negative b(p) VV q, or introduce a matrix-valued diffusion and consider VD(q, p) Vq.\nz4aw | Additionally, one could consider a mixed-term forcing, such as negative B negative one V q p or negative- Vg. However, since the diffusion matrix must be symmetric and positive- definite, this prevents us from considering these mixed forcings without adding also a contribution negative one Vq. Upon writing Ln,a as the sum of a first-order differential operator and Do: V two, we require that Da be symmetric positive, so that one can simulate the associated SDE upon taking the square root of Do, with\nmo0p | Da equals Do plus QD, Do equals Y zero Id zero zero,\ntyxr | where D denotes the diffusion associated with the extra forcings.\ntxaa | Example three point six (Feynman-Kac forcing). One possible form of the general forcing in item three of Section three point two point one is the following, for two functions § one : Rd -> R and § two : X -> R:\nqz8s | Čextra equals § one (p) TV* plus § two (q) TV.\ny7de | The associated dynamics reads\nrukn | dqt equals M negative one pt dt negative an § one (pt) dt,\n5tu7 | dpt equals negative VV (qt) dt plus n(F(qt) negative a § two (qt)) dt negative YM negative one pt dt plus V twenty-seven β dWt,\nvqgg | whose trajectories are reweighted using the Feynman-Kac weight involving § one (Ps) TVV (qs) plus § two (qs) TM negative one ps in the integral.\nsbs5 | Three point three. Choosing the magnitude of the forcing. The synthetic forcing is comprised of a physical forcing and an extra one, which translates into a perturbation Lphys plus QLextra at the level of generators. We discuss here how to choose the magnitude o of the extra forcing in order to optimize it in terms of the linear response.\nn413 | Recall from Section two point two point one that, for small values of n, we can think of the response as a polynomial in seven:\nmvxd | ra (n) equals En, (R) equals np one (a) plus n two p two (a) plus nn negative one pn negative one (a) plus O (n).\ngyzb | In practice, we want to choose a such that the contribution from nonlinear terms is minimized. There are two main approaches to choosing such an optimal a, by (i) canceling the second-order response, or (ii) bounding the relative error with respect to the linear regime. We next discuss both options.\nrrp1 | Canceling the second-order response. A first approach to reduce the nonlinear response is to cancel the second-order term o two, as this is the dominant part of the nonlinear bias when n is small. The second-order response is characterized by f two in, which reads here\n8b70 | f two (a) equals Lo one Č phys plus @ Č extra Lo one S equals f two , phys plus @ f two , extra,\nnivt | where we decomposed the second-order perturbation of the invariant measure into its physical and synthetic parts. Since f two is linear in a, the value of a for which p two is\n8925 | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS\ny2tz | cancelled is easily obtained from the definition of the second-order response.
