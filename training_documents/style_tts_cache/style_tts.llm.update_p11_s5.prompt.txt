You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

awab | There are three Transferable Monotonic Aligner (TMA) related innovations in this work: the decoder is trained with hard monotonic alignment and soft attention in a 50%-50% manner and two TMA objectives functions. The 50%-50% training is motivated by the fact that the monotonic alignment search proposed in [9] is not differentiable, and the soft attention alignment does not necessarily provide correct alignments for duration prediction in the second stage of training. This 50%-50% split is arbitrary and can be changed to anything from 10%-90% to 90%-10%, depending on the dataset and the application. When the ratio is 100%-0%, it becomes the case where the external aligners are not fine-tuned like in most parallel TTS systems such as FastSpeech [17], while when the ratio is 0%-100%, it becomes the case we fine-tune the aligner with only soft attention such as in Cotatron [66] for voice conversion applications. We find that training with external aligners (100% hard, no fine-tuning) decreases the naturalness of the synthesized speech because bad alignments can happen due to covariate shifts between the training dataset (LibriSpeech) and testing dataset (LJSpeech) as in the case of Montreal Forced Aligner [33]. One example is given in the leftmost figure in Figure 5. On the other hand, if we only fine- tune the decoder with soft alignment, the decoder will overfit on the soft alignment and be unable to synthesize audible speech from hard alignment because the soft alignments are not either 0 or 1 and the precise numerical values of alignments are used by the decoder to generate speech.
ixcc | Another notable case is when we do not use a pre-trained text aligner such as in the case of VITS. This case makes MOS even lower than the case of no fine-tuning, suggesting that overfitting on a smaller dataset can be more detrimental than failure in generalization on the TTS dataset for some samples. The figure in the middle in Fig. 5 shows an alignment with gaps and no background noises. This indicates overfitting of the text aligner to the smaller dataset for the mel-spectrogram reconstruction objective. However, since our goal is to synthesize the speech from predicted alignment, overfitting to speech reconstruction can be harmful to natural speech synthesis during inference.
8p6h | In addition to the 50%-50% training, we also introduced two TMA objectives Ls2s and Lmono. This is motivated by the fact that Ls2s learns correct alignments for S2S-ASR but not necessarily monotonic while non-differentiable monotonic alignments obtained through dynamic programming algorithms proposed in [9] do not necessarily produce correct alignments. By combining Ls2s and Lmono, we can learn an aligner that produces both correct and monotonic alignments.
pmgl | B. AdaIN, AdaLN, and Concatenation
90no | As shown in Table VII and Table VIII, AdaIN outperforms AdaLN and simple concatenation for both naturalness and style
jt0y | reflection. Here we describe our intuitions behind these results.
qb7o | Concatenation vs. AdaIN. When we concatenate the style vector to each frame of the encoded phonetic representations, we create a representation hstyle = Thtext s . When the hstyle is passed to the next convolution layer whose parameter is W, we get —
oae5 | hstyle . W =
s0fl | — . [Wtext |Wstyle]
43ia | (13)
3g2y | = htext . Wtext + S . Wstyle
gc7v | = htext . Wtext + Concat (htext, s)
wqfv | where Wtext and Wstyle are block matrix notation of the corresponding weights for hstyle and s and Concat (htext, S) = s . Wstyle denotes the concatenation operation as a function of input htext and style vector s. This Concat (x, s) function is almost like AdaIN in equation 1 where Lu(s) = Wstyle except we do not have the temporal modulation term La(s). The modulation term is very important in style transfer, and some works argue that modulation alone is enough for diverse style representations [24], [67]. In contrast, concatenation only provides the addition term (Lu) but no modulation term (La). Intuitively, the modulation term can determine the variance of the pitch and energy, for example, and therefore without such a term, correlations for pitch and energy standard deviation are much lower than AdaIN and AdaLN as shown in Table VIII.
j30a | AdaLN vs. AdaIN. Generative models for speech synthesis learn to generate mel-spectrograms, which is essentially a 1- D feature map with 80 channels. Each channel in the mel- spectrogram represents a single frequency range. When we apply AdaIN, we learn a distribution with a style-specific mean and variance for each channel, compared to AdaLN, where a single mean and variance are learned for the entire feature map. This inherent difference between feature distributions makes AdaIN more expressive in terms of style reflection than AdaLN.
