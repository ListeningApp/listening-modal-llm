You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

41fx | Feedbacks modulate burst frequencies and sizes differently
7um8 | Having inferred each gene's burst kinetics and feedback forms, we next investigated how feedback regulations af- fected expression variability (CV2) and transcriptional burst kinetics on a genome-wide scale. Interestingly, we found the statistical phenomenon of Simpson's paradox. First, we observed from Figure 3A that there were no sig- nificant differences in variability distributions between the positive-feedback and the negative-feedback genes, but the non-feedback genes exhibited higher expression variabil- ity. The latter result seemed inconsistent with the previous conclusions that positive feedback amplified variability and negative feedback attenuated variability (70). This can be in- terpreted by the fact that the expression level and the expres- sion variability were negatively correlated (57,58,71) (Sup- plementary Figure S9a). To show this point, we introduced the average expressed variable by dividing all the selected genes into five equal boxes based on average expression levels and tracked the expression-variability changes when the average gene-expression levels were increased. Then, we found that the expression variability was indeed negatively correlated with the average expression levels, regardless of feedback forms (Figure 3D). Furthermore, the positive- feedback genes showed relatively higher expression variabil- ity than the negative-feedback genes at the same expression levels (Figure 3D), consistent with the results obtained in previous studies (70,72).
uow2 | Next, we checked the genome-wide effects of feedback regulations on transcriptional burst frequencies and burst sizes. Interestingly, we found that positive and negative feed- back differently modulated burst frequencies and sizes (Fig- ures 3B, C, and Supplementary Figures S9c, d). Specifi- cally, the burst frequencies of positive-feedback genes were significantly higher than those of negative-feedback genes on the whole genome (Figure 3B) and at the same ex- pression level (Figure 3E). By contrast, the burst sizes of positive-feedback genes were smaller than those of
iat7 | negative-feedback genes (Figure 3C, F). In addition, the ef- fects of negative feedback and non-feedback on burst fre- quencies were difficult to distinguish (Figure 3B, E), but there was a significant difference in burst sizes (Figure 3C, F). This observation suggested that burst size could be a dis- tinguishable characteristic between negative-feedback and non-feedback genes.
ywwr | Finally, in this subsection, we point out that an un- explored issue is how promoter architecture affects tran- scriptional burst kinetics in the presence of feedback regulation on a genome-wide scale. Below, we address this issue from three aspects: promoter motifs, TSS dis- tributions, and enhancer-promoter interactions in the following.
0i6j | TATA genes are expressed with high burst frequencies only in the presence of positive feedback
87cq | It was reported that promoter motifs such as TATA box and initiator regulated transcriptional bursting directly (13,14,16,57,73). On the other hand, we showed in the previ- ous section that different feedback regulations led to differ- ent burst kinetics. This raised an unexplored question: how do promoter motifs modulate transcriptional burst kinetics
0qs3 | in the presence of feedback regulation on the genome-wide scale?
z8f7 | We first identified promoter motifs (TATA box, initia- tor, GC-box, and CCAAT-box) of each gene from the EPD database (54) (see 'Materials and Methods') (Figure 4A). Then, we found that both the TATA box and initiator pos- itively regulated mean transcriptional levels, in line with the results obtained in previous studies (74) (Supplemen- tary Figure S10a). Besides, we verified that the TATA genes with positive feedback had higher proportions than those genes with negative feedback or without feedback, whereas the other promoter motifs were uncorrelated to feedback forms (Supplementary Figure S10b). These results implied that the TATA box was a critical promoter motif for the reg- ulation of transcription by a positive feedback mechanism, which might be supported by the following experimental observation: TATA boxes were enriched in the promoters of genes with fewer transcriptional pauses (75), and the TATA box sequence was specifically bound by the TATA-binding proteins that acted as general transcription factors to facil- itate the localization of RNA polymerase II and transcrip- tion (76,77).
7w7j | To investigate the genome-wide effects of promoter mo- tifs on burst kinetics in the presence of feedback regu-
51vd | lations, we performed multivariate statistical analysis us- ing linear regression models (Figure 4B-D, see 'Mate- rials and Methods'). We also observed the Simpson's paradox that the effect of promoter motifs on variabil- ity and burst kinetics is different between distinguishing feedback regulation and without distinguishing feedback regulation.
baj1 | First, we studied gene-expression variability. We charac- terized this variability with the residual squared coefficient of variation (rCV2) (see 'Materials and Methods') since this coefficient can disentangle the correlation of the CV2 and the average expression levels across cells (Supplementary Figure S9b). Therefore, we focus on rCV2 instead of CV2. By performing the linear regression of rCV2 (see 'Materi- als and Methods'), we found the synergy between positive feedback and the TATA box (or initiator or CCAAT box) can amplify the expression variability (Figure 4B). This re- sult was actually an extension of the previous result that the TATA box enlarged the gene-expression variability when feedback regulations were not distinguished (Supplemen- tary Figure S10c) (13,78). As an additional evaluation, we used the rCV2 rank to predict the presence of the TATA- box and showed that the area under the ROC (receiver op- erating characteristic) curve, denoted by AUC, was larger in the case of positive feedback than in the case of nega- tive feedback or non-feedback (Figure 4E), indicating that
n1wo | TATA boxes led to the larger gene-expression variability in the former case.
5bq3 | Next, we assessed burst frequencies and sizes. Similar to the case of expression variability, we also performed multi- variate linear regression analyses on them. When feedbacks were not distinguished, we showed that TATA boxes sig- nificantly boosted burst frequencies of the genes (Supple- mentary Figure S10d). However, when considering differ- ent feedback forms, we observed that only TATA genes with positive feedback increased burst frequencies (Figure 4C). In addition, we observed that other promoter motifs had different degrees of effect on burst frequency, depending on feedback forms. These results were masked without dis- tinguishing feedback forms (Supplementary Figure S10d). For burst sizes, it was reported that the genes with TATA box or initiator had larger burst sizes than those without TATA box or without initiator (16). We reproduced simi- lar results (Supplementary Figure S10e), but observed that the TATA genes were expressed with larger burst sizes, in- dependently of feedback regulation, and the genes with ini- tiator had larger burst sizes only in the case of negative feed- back (Figure 4D). GC-box and CCAAT-box on the distal promoter had opposite effects on burst sizes in the cases of positive and negative feedback (Figure 4D). In particular, no difference was found for all the genes if feedback forms were not distinguished (Supplementary Figure S10e).
ezla | Briefly, the above results indicated that the TATA box played a pivotal role in transcriptional bursting. It worked as a static promoter element to up-regulate burst sizes and simultaneously utilized a dynamic positive feedback regula- tion mechanism to increase burst frequencies (Figure 4F).
