You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

u15r | Fortunately, these kinds of questions are tackled in another collection: Entrepreneurship in the Creative Industries, edited by Colette Henry. There is less agonising here over definitions, the editors and most of the chapters simply accept the UK's Department of Culture, Media and Sport, which defined the creative industries as the following 13 sectors in its 1998 mapping exercise: advertising, architecture, art and antiques, computer games, crafts, design, designer fashion, film and video, music, performing arts, publishing, software and television and radio (DCMS, 1998). This remains a popular categorisation, albeit associated with the New Labour government of Tony Blair. Chapter four of this book, by David Rae discusses the influence of this period in a UK perspective, pointing out some of the problematic effects of identifying the creative economy as different and non-mainstream. For example, Rae refers to the relatively poor standing of the UK in R&D expenditure and some other indicators of innovation, which stand in contrast to the high energy of the creative sectors in recent years, and calls for "cultural diffusion" to occur. This argument resonates with recent work by NESTA and the Queensland school on spillovers from the creative industries to the rest of the economy.
lq35 | The "special" nature of creative people is discussed in the chapter by O Cinneide and Henry, which argues that creative people have many qualities associated with entrepreneurship,
3g9w | such as risk-taking, tolerance for ambiguity, perseverance and autonomy. The chapter raises the case of Irish music and dance, such as Riverdance, which was launched from Eurovision Song Contest success to a new genre of live and recorded entertainment. However, the chapter stresses the barriers to entrepreneurship and the fact that even with the Irish success story, much of the economic success is not captured within the country. Again, these themes deserve a longer treatment and particularly in drawing out the lessons for entrepreneurship from the Irish case.
d09o | The following chapter on New Zealand's film industry has a similar structure with a brief page at the end on Peter Jackson, of Lord of the Rings fame. This chapter characterises national and regional policy as "state entrepreneurship", while Jackson is an individual entrepreneur. There is excellent data and analysis of how policy in New Zealand has influenced the industry but it seems to me there is a problem with calling government activity entrepreneurship: governments are usually doing something and it cannot all be entrepreneurship. One would then need to take a tautological position of calling it entrepreneurship if it appears to have led to success. How about activity that turns out to be unsuccessful or does not add value? And the success story of Jackson the individual does not seem to have followed from the policies-rather referring to more traditional notions of entrepre- neurship, like establishing businesses and high-quality resources to support his work.
ylhz | Chapter 2 by Desmond Hui reviews East and Southeast Asian government policies and economic statistics where available for creative and cultural industries as they are variously defined with sections on Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong-some of the statistics are projection. Understandably these deal with differences of definition, which are helpful to bear in mind with comparison. The review gives a sense of how countries like South Korea and Singapore have had a succession of policies aimed at CCIs since the 1980s, while others like Japan only really embraced targeted policies in the 21st century. It concludes that Korea's sustained policy attention seems to have paid off in terms of market success in TV, music and animation industries. However, this reader is left with a desire for more analysis of the impact of policy, with such a brief impression in the conclusion after a chapter presenting raw facts. Assembling the facts is important, of course, but there is still much to understand about development of CCIs in Asia.
a3td | The following chapter by Maria Aggestam on music entrepre- neurs in Scandinavia again shows a refreshing perspective. While we know the importance of institutions like the Eurovision Song Contest for several Scandinavian musicians and bands; not only the most famous, Abba, I had not realised that the tango and its music was such a strong part of Finnish culture. According to Aggestam there is a lack of professional marketing skills holding back the international growth of Finnish tango, but most importantly its language. Lyrics are crucial and singers' and songwriters' insistence on the Finnish language ensure it remains a local phenomenon. Sweden, by contrast, has continued export success, notably with songwriting for American artists such as the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez. The chapter contains data and narrative on important institutions.
ex5k | The second part of the book focuses on supporting the creative industries, including a chapter by Tom Fleming reviewing the investment and funding issues associated with creative firms; Ralph Brown on promoting entrepreneurship in arts education and the dilemmas and paradoxes of increased throughput of graduates, yet with a talent shortfall perceived by industry. These themes are returned to in a chapter by Calvin Taylor, while Linda Moss provides a transition economy perspective with a chapter on the support of creative enterprise in Russia. There is another
9d4o | chapter on human language technologies by Kenny and Meaton, which is interesting but seems somewhat out of place in this volume. A concluding chapter by Collette Henry summarises the themes and insights of the book.
cjq2 | In summary, this collection whets the appetite by shifting attention to countries that are less well researched in the creative industries field. They are fascinating vignettes that hint at a richer research landscape. I recommend both these books for scholars and students interested in these sectors. There is also much to interest the general reader. As a pair they complement each other and when read together they leave a more complete picture of the range and reach of the creative and cultural industries.
