        "content": "43ia | Formed as a result of reaction one, the excited water molecule can react by processes three, four, and eleven or with the unexcited water molecules, the concentration of which inside the cavitation bubble is high enough. In the last case, the energy can transform very effectively, \"resonant quenching.\" In addition, water molecules quench the excited states of hydroxyl radical.\n3g2y | O H excited state plus H two O reacts to form O H ground state plus H two O plus Q.\ngc7v | Thus, the total scheme, simplified of course, of chemical reactions inside the cavitation bubble, which lead to sonoluminescence, in the presence of noble gas can be presented as follows:\nwqfv | Spectra of Water Sonoluminescence\nj30a | It is necessary to include also in this scheme reactions five through eight and fourteen. It is seen from scheme fifteen that the rate of luminescence quenching of H two O excited and O H excited species increases with the increase of water molecules concentration. This diminishes the total sonoluminescence light emission and changes the spectra: the intensity of a short-wave part of the spectrum decreases more significantly as the \"resonant quenching\" is usually more effective. The difference in the spectra of water sonoluminescence at high and low frequency is explained by sonoluminescence quenching.\n7bdk | The proposed scheme may be seen strained. Actually, we did not find in the literature the experimental data on the formation and the emission of H two O excited molecules, although the vibrational excited H two O dot argon van der Waals molecules are described. On the other hand, this proposition can easily explain the observed phenomena.\nfim0 | Following the thermal theory of sonoluminescence and sonochemical reactions, the maximal temperature inside the bubble and, consequently, the yield of excited species must be at the stage of maximal compression, that is, at minimum radius. However, the experimental results show that sonoluminescence is over before minimum radius is reached. This fact cannot be explained by thermal conductivity of the bubble content, as the maximum temperature is not yet achieved, but it can be the consequence of the processes of luminescence quenching. The number of collisions per particle for the time equals ten to the power of negative ten seconds is around one thousand and three, and the concentration of excited species is small. The atoms of inert gas are not effective in the reactions of energy transformation, but it takes only a few collisions for water molecules in these processes. For larger molecules the energy transformation processes are more effective. For example, the sonoluminescence spectra of potassium lines in octanol solutions are much broader than in the water solution, and the lifetime of the excited state of potassium atoms is around zero point zero five picoseconds.\nojro | It has been shown recently that the time of sonoluminescence flash decreases from one hundred fifty to fifty picoseconds as the bulk temperature of water increases from ten to twenty two degrees Celsius. This result can be explained by the increase of the rate of sonoluminescence quenching as a consequence of the increase of water vapor concentration inside the bubble with the increase of bulk solution temperature. Actually, the lower the bulk solution temperature, the lower the vapor pressure inside the bubble and the lower the rate of sonoluminescence quenching. In this case the stationary state between the rates of excited species formation and the rates of sonoluminescence quenching is achieved later, closer to the minimal size of a bubble. In addition, the rate of sonoluminescence quenching is lower at bulk solution temperature of ten degrees Celsius, so sonoluminescence diminishes with time not as fast as in the case of the \"more vaporous\" bubble. Thus, the total sonoluminescence intensity is much higher and the time of sonoluminescence flush is longer at ten degrees Celsius.\nl6t9 | Reactions of the Hydrogen Peroxide Formation. Next, we shall consider shortly the chemical reactions inside or outside the cavitation bubble, which produce or destroy hydrogen peroxide.\n1ujy | Hydrogen peroxide is formed by the recombination inside the bubble or in the liquid after the end of bubble compression:\nqzor | O H plus O H forms H two O two.\na0by | The reaction\nu1ky | H plus O H forms H two O.\nhtm9 | Seventeen.\n8hul | can compete with the recombination sixteen as the ratio of the rate constants of the respective reactions k seventeen over k sixteen is approximately four point four four, where k sixteen and k seventeen are the rate constants of reactions sixteen and seventeen, respectively. Note that the excited hydroxyl radicals O H excited can also take part in these reactions. Formed hydrogen peroxide can be destroyed by high temperature inside the bubble.\n87vz | H two O two forms O H plus O H.\nym66 | Eighteen.\nl0a3 | or by the radicals H and O H.\nu8nw | H plus H two O two forms H two O plus O H.\nl2v9 | O H plus H two O two forms H two O plus H O two.\nafbe | Hydroperoxide radical can recombine, giving hydrogen peroxide H O two plus H O two forms H two O two plus O two.\n78r8 | or react with hydrogen peroxide H O two plus H two O two forms H two O plus O two plus O H.\n320g | Twenty-two.\ntp8g | Reactions nineteen to twenty-two in the solution become observable at high enough concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and for a long time of ultrasound exposures. In this case, the yield time dependency deviates from the linear one. We neglected the reactions of hydrogen peroxide destruction in the solution as we were working for a short time of exposures on the linear part of yield time curves. Note also that we took into account only the concentration of O H radicals that avoided recombination.\ngxfd | Following reference forty-five, around eighty percent of original O H radicals recombine by process seventeen. So, the ratio of the total number of original O H radicals to the number of radicals avoiding recombination seventeen should be around five to one. If we assume that O H radicals are formed, basically, by reactions three a to four a, i.e., the number of original O H radicals corresponds to the number of photons emitted by O H excited radicals, then the ratio obtained in this paper of O H excited to O H is approximately five point six. This is the maximum value for that ratio, as we did not consider the processes of sonoluminescence quenching of O H excited radicals.\ns2v1 | At high temperatures inside the bubble, the reaction of H atoms with H two O molecule can increase the yield of O H radicals:\njkp9 | H plus H two O forms O H plus H two.\nz8tt | Formation of O H radicals is the destruction of water molecules by reactions one to four. At higher temperatures, reaction twenty-three plays a dominant role and produces an additional quantity of O H radicals. There were considered twenty-one chemical reactions influencing the yield of O H radicals inside the cavitation bubble at the time of its implosion. Unfortunately, the mechanism of the excited species reactions inside the cavitation bubble was not considered in reference forty-seven.\n41fx | Thus, the mechanism of formation and chemical reactions of excited particles and radicals is very complex, and it can change depending on the conditions inside the bubble at the time of its compression. We did not consider in detail all the possible processes as, first, the mechanism of reactions and the type of the species formed are not clear, and second, the calculation of temperature inside the bubble at high amplitude of its pulsation is complicated.",
