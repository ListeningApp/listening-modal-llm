You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

dvms | The midgut is connected to the hepatopancreas, so named because it combines the functions of the vertebrate liver and pancreas. The hepatopancreas forms a pair of glands on either side of the stomach where it occupies a large proportion of the cephalothorax (Fig. 5).
qrd3 | The hepatopancreas is also known as the midgut gland or digestive gland. This organ is particularly large in decapod crustaceans, where it makes up 2-6% of the body mass (Brockerhoff & Hoyle, 1967; Stewart et al., 1967). The colour of the hepatopancreas is variable (e.g., brown, red, green, yellow) depending on the pigments that it contains. Each half of the hepatopancreas consists of a cluster of ducts that subdivide into small tubules that make up the glandular mass. The primary duct of each gland opens into the midgut. Digested food and secretions exchange between the gland and the midgut as a result of the peristaltic action of circular and longitudinal muscles.
rxrg | The hepatopancreas is responsible for the secretion of digestive enzymes, the absorption of nutrients, the storage of energy reserves and the transport of monovalent and divalent ions. Digestive enzymes are synthesised in the F-cells (fibrillar cells) and accumulate in the B-cells (blister-like cells) (Sousa et al., 2005; Vogt et al., 1989).
tf43 | The products of digestion are absorbed and stored by the hepatopancreas. This tubular system has a single layer of epithelial cells that facilitate rapid trans-cellular nutrient transport to the haemolymph. Two of the cell types of the hepatopancreas, the R- (resorptive cells) and F-cells, are equipped with microvilli, indicating absorptive functions. Epithelial cells of the intestinal ceca, present in several shrimp species, also have well organized microvilli (Ceccaldi, 1997). The midgut intestine is capable of absorbing nutrients such as amino acids and glucose but this is relatively minor compared to the role played by the hepatopancreas (Ahearn, 1974; Ahearn & Maginniss, 1977; Gibson & Barker, 1979b).
fcco | Significant sodium-dependent glucose and glutamate uptake and non-sodium-dependent alanine and lysine uptake has been demonstrated in crustacean hepatopancreas; transport rates are several orders of magnitude greater than those of the intestine (Ahearn & Clay, 1987; Ahearn et al., 1985; Verri et al., 2001).
8uji | Experiments on penaeids have revealed that R- (resorptive cells) and B-cells of the hepatopancreas possess different types of glucose transport mechanisms with B cells showing a Na+-dependent sugar transport process and R cells showing a Na+-independent sugar carrier system (Blaya et al., 1998; Verri et al., 2001; Vilella et al., 1998). Simmons et al. (2012) found that, in the hepatopancreas of the White shrimp, Litopenaeus setiferus, sodium, potassium, and metallic cations such as zinc and manganese may stimulate the absorption of D-glucose, L-leucine and L-histidine by independent carrier-mediated transport processes. These mechanisms use the gradient of one solute's concentration to force the other molecule or ion against its gradient. Such mechanisms are known as cotransporters.
df3e | The activities of several membrane transporters in the hepatopancreas are pH-dependent (Verri et al., 2001). This has been demonstrated for the Na+ -D-glucose cotransporter, the Na+ /Cl- /L-alanine cotransporter, the Na+ /2Cl- /L-
53eu | leucine cotransporter and the Na+ /Cl- /L-glutamate cotransporter. The low pH in the hepatopancreatic lumen facilitates nutrient influx into the epithelial cells.
a5u1 | Undigested residues from the hepatopancreas are passed back to the midgut intestine and combine with material that was diverted away from the hepatopancreas opening. This material is compacted in the intestine where water and ions are removed and transported across the epithelium.
ry7u | The hepatopancreas also releases an insulin-like factor in lobsters and probably other decapod crustaceans (Sanders, 1983a). This factor increases glycogenesis in lobster muscle (Sanders, 1983b) but is not released in response to a rise in glucose in the haemolymph nor does it reduce haemolymph glucose levels (Sanders, 1983c).
5mda | In some decapods, such as the marine Carcinus maenas and Cancer pagurus, and the freshwater crab Paratelphusa hydrodomous, calcium and phosphate are accumulated by the hepatopancreas during the pre-moult period and stored as calcium phosphate granules (Greenaway, 1985).
i4li | 2.3 The hindgut
r8sm | Digestion is completed in several hours and indigestible matter passes into the peritrophic membrane of the midgut. The faecal pellet is contained in this tube, which is grasped by the rectal pads and extruded at intervals in lengths equal to that of the midgut. Infolding of the basal membrane in the hindgut epithelial cells as well as folding of the entire epithelium allow for stretching of the hindgut lining under faecal loading.
cuin | The cells lining the short hindgut appear to be specialized for cation transport (Mykles, 1980), but their specific functional role in nutrition has yet to be defined. Since the hindgut is lined with cuticle, it is unlikely to absorb digestive materials (van Weel, 1955). It may be involved in water transport (see the section on osmoregulation), but again its role must be limited due to the cuticular lining. The rectum is probably also the means by which the external medium is pumped into the midgut but, again, the function of this rectal pumping has not been firmly established.
n1i7 | 3. Digestive enzymes
0r5m | The pH of digestive fluids is acidic (about pH 5) (Hoyle, 1973) which favours the activities of the various enzymes involved in digestion. The shrimp stomach, which is covered in a chitin layer, does not secrete acid or enzymes, although its contents often show digestive enzyme activities, some of which may derive from the hepatopancreas and some from food animals.
