You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

76b0 | Data analysis
zxz6 | Data were entered in Epidata version 3.3 and analyzed using SPSS software package version 20. The Xpert sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated using the following as one of the reference stan- dards: i) LJ culture alone; ii) LJ culture and/or Xpert (confirmed TB); and iii) composite refer- ence standard (CRS) (confirmed TB and Unconfirmed TB). Differences and similarities between the two methods (stool Xpert versus gastric aspirate Xpert) was determined based on the 95%CI. Non-over lapping 95% CIs indicated a difference between the two methods (stool Xpert versus gastric aspirate Xpert) and vice versa.

Seventy-eight (51.3%) of 152 participants were females and participants' ages ranged from 7 months to 14 years (median 3 years). Majority, 98 (64.5%), of the participants were rural resi- dents (Table 1). Regarding the clinical manifestation of the participants, 141 (92.8%) had cough for >2 weeks, 122 (80.3%) had loss of appetite, 109 (71.7%) had fever, 90 (59.2%) had weight loss, 90 (55.9%) had weakness/fatigue, 70 (46.1%) had shortness of breath and 35 (23%) had TB contact history. The majority, 142 (93.4%), were vaccinated with BCG. Close to a third of the participants, 54 (35.5%), were severely malnourished, whereas 6 (3.9%) of them were on anti-retroviral therapy.
9mrz | Diagnosis of TB
pk06 | Out of the 152 pulmonary specimens analyzed, MTB was detected in 9 (6.7%) by culture and in 8 (5.9%) by Xpert. In one of the participants, gastric aspirate Xpert was positive whereas the culture from the same specimen was negative. On the other hand, in two of the participants, culture from the gastric aspirates were positive whereas Xpert results were negative. All the 17 expectorated sputum specimens were negative by both Xpert and culture. Stool Xpert testing revealed 10 (6.6%) MTB positive cases. Rifampicin resistance was not detected in any of the Xpert positive specimens. Table 2 shows results of gastric aspirate Xpert, stool Xpert and gas- tric aspirate culture amongst study subjects.
7wn9 | Overall, 10 (6.6%) of the 152 study participants had microbiologically confirmed PTB, defined as a positive result on culture and/or Xpert on pulmonary specimen. We reviewed the medical records of the remaining 142 (93.4%) of participants who were microbiologically neg- ative. Of these, 8.5% (12/142) were clinically diagnosed as TB by the clinicians. Among the 12 clinically diagnosed TB cases, 83.3% (10/12) showed clinical improvement after ATT. The remaining 2 cases died after two weeks of ATT initiation and were classified as unlikely TB cases. Out of the 10 cases who have improved clinically, 4 had radiological findings suggestive of TB whereas 6 had no radiological evidences of TB documented on their medical records and hence were classified as "unconfirmed TB". However, none of the children with clinically- diagnosed TB (unconfirmed TB) had positive stool Xpert result. In the remaining 91.5% (130/

b8hf | Diagnostic performance of stool Xpert
hntf | Error/invalid results were documented in 4.6% (7/152) of Xpert tests performed on stool. Due to a shortage of Xpert cartridges, we didn't repeat the tests in these invalid cases. Of the 145 stool specimens with valid Xpert results, 6.9% (10/145) were MTB positive. Stool Xpert detected all gastric aspirate culture confirmed TB cases and one positive case missed by gastric aspirate culture (Table 2). Moreover, stool Xpert also detected two MTB positive cases which were found to be negative on gastric aspirate Xpert.
99fo | Using culture of the respiratory specimen (gastric aspirate and expectorated samples) as the reference standard, stool Xpert had sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 66.4-100) and specificity of 99.3% (95% CI: 96.2-100), whereas gastric aspirate Xpert had sensitivity of 77.8% (95% CI: 40- 97.2) and specificity of 99.3% (95% CI: 96.2-100) (Table 3). Using gastric aspirate culture and/ or Xpert positivity (microbiological confirmation) as one of the reference standards, stool Xpert had each 100% sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV (Table 4 and S1 Table).
y5r7 | Moreover, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of stool and gastric aspirate Xpert were also calculated with reference to CRS. Accordingly, stool Xpert had a sensitivity of 50% (95% CI; 27.2-72.8), specificity of 100% (95% CI: 97.1-100), PPV of 100% and NPV of 92.6% (95% CI; 89-95.1) against CRS (Table 5). The corresponding sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for gastric aspirate Xpert were 40% (95% CI; 19.1-64), 100% (95% CI; 97.2-100), 100% and 91.7% (95% CI; 88.5-94) respectively compared to CRS (Table 5). Stool and gastric aspirate Xpert MTB detection rates compared to CRS is also shown in supporting information (S2 Table).
lrry | Discussion
hvhm | Ethiopia is among the 30 countries with high-burden of TB and TB/HIV in the world and there is a huge number of undiagnosed TB in children [11]. The national guidelines for TB care in Ethiopia recommends Xpert for the diagnosis of childhood TB. However, obtaining appropriate respiratory specimens from children is difficult. Thus, a non-invasive sample for the diagnosis of TB in children would improve care for this population. In the current study, we have demonstrated that stool Xpert has comparable performance with gastric aspirate Xpert in consecutively recruited children with presumptive PTB. Other studies have also reported promising findings [6, 12].

ffx8 | We found that Xpert was 100% sensitive for MTB detection in stool among children with microbiological confirmation from a respiratory specimen and 50% sensitive in children with microbiologically and/or clinically diagnosed TB. Other studies [8, 13, 14] conducted in Ethio- pia, Kenya and Pakistan have also reported excellent sensitivity (ranging from 88.9% to 100%)

nv42 | of stool Xpert compared to gastric aspirate culture. The lower sensitivity of stool Xpert com- pared to CRS (microbiological and/or clinically confirmed TB) is possibly due to the presence of paucibacillary disease in patients clinically diagnosed for TB.
xags | The specificity of stool Xpert in our study when compared to culture was consistent with other previous studies conducted in Ethiopia, South Africa and Egypt which have demon- strated specificities ranging from 99.3 to 99.7% [6, 8, 15]. The specificity of stool Xpert in our study when compared to CRS was similar with another study conducted in Pakistan [14]. One culture negative gastric aspirate specimen was found to be positive on both stool and gastric aspirate Xpert tests. This may be due to the presence of non-viable bacilli during decontamina- tion process of gastric aspirate specimen.
jc47 | In this study, stool Xpert identified all of the gastric aspirate Xpert positive cases, suggesting stool as a potential alternative for use to gastric aspirate in the routine diagnosis of PTB. Gas- tric aspiration may be used to retrieve pulmonary specimen from patients who cannot expec- torate sputum but it is an invasive procedure and needs trained health workers. As a non- invasive sample, stool is considered to be safe, easy for collection and has the potential to be used for detection of MTB. Moreover, stool Xpert test is performed by simple stool testing pro- tocol adapted from KNCV TB foundation [11], which omits some labor intensive steps such as homogenization, decontamination and centrifugation of stool specimen prior to Xpert testing done by other studies [13-15]. This approach significantly reduces sample processing time, minimizes the workload on the laboratory personnel and also minimizes costs.
ko3c | In our study, unfortunately, none of the clinically diagnosed TB cases were detected by stool Xpert. Poor performance of stool Xpert in the clinically diagnosed (microbiologically negative) children has also been reported in other studies [15, 16]. This could potentially indi- cate the limitation of the stool Xpert since patients with such clinically-diagnosed unconfirmed TB are more likely to have paucibacillary disease. Children with a high clinical probability of TB despite a negative stool Xpert should be started on ATT until better and more sensitive tools are available.
xek3 | Older children are able to expectorate sputum and may produce more adult-type sputum. However, in our study, none of the expectorated sputum samples were positive for M. tubercu- losis. This could be due to the poor sample quality in the expectorated sputum samples.

meyw | However, we did not assess the quality of the sputum sample in the current study which might be taken as a limitation.
2e62 | Our study has some limitations. We used small sample size due to resource constraints. An additional limitation of our study is the fact that, we collected only single respiratory and stool specimen rather than successive specimens which could have probably increased the yield of the tests done.
75y3 | Conclusion
s2g2 | The sensitivity of stool Xpert is comparable to that of gastric aspirate Xpert. Stool is a potential alternative to pulmonary specimen in the diagnosis of PTB in patients who cannot produce sputum. Moreover, stool collection is easier and relatively safe compared to pulmonary speci- men and can be easily implemented at lowest level of health care system. However, the diag- nostic yield of stool Xpert still requires further validation and optimization using larger sample size.
