        "content": "1ylw | the output YP may be interpreted as the recognized class label of pattern ZP, or as scores or probabilities associated with each class. A loss function EP equals D of DP and F of W and ZP measures the discrepancy between DP, the \"correct\" or desired output for pattern ZP, and the output produced by the system. The average loss function Etrain of W is the average of the errors EP over a set of labeled examples called the training set, which is Z one D one through ZP DP. In the simplest setting, the learning problem consists in finding the value of W that minimizes Etrain of W. In practice, the performance of the system on a training set is of little interest. The more relevant measure is the error rate of the system in the field, where it would be used in practice. This performance is estimated by measuring the accuracy on a set of samples disjoint from the training set, which is called the test set. Much theoretical and experimental work has shown that the gap between the expected error rate on the test set Etest and the error rate on the training set Etrain decreases with the number of training samples approximately as\nwaqw | Etest minus Etrain equals k times h over P to the power of alpha\nnf6a | One\n5g96 | where P is the number of training samples, h is a measure of \"effective capacity\" or complexity of the machine, alpha is a number between zero point five and one point zero, and k is a constant. This gap always decreases when the number of training samples increases. Furthermore, as the capacity h increases, Etrain decreases. Therefore, when increasing the capacity h, there is a trade-off between the decrease of Etrain and the increase of the gap, with an optimal value of the capacity h that achieves the lowest generalization error Etest. Most learning algorithms attempt to minimize Etrain as well as some estimate of the gap. A formal version of this is called structural risk minimization and it is based on defining a sequence of learning machines of increasing capacity, corresponding to a sequence of subsets of the parameter space such that each subset is a superset of the previous subset. In practical terms, structural risk minimization is implemented by minimizing Etrain plus beta H of W, where the function H of W is called a regularization function and beta is a constant. H of W is chosen such that it takes large values on parameters W that belong to high-capacity subsets of the parameter space. Minimizing H of W in effect limits the capacity of the accessible subset of the parameter space, thereby controlling the trade-off between minimizing the training error and minimizing the expected gap between the training error and test error.\nd1y5 | B. Gradient-Based Learning\nrl20 | The general problem of minimizing a function with respect to a set of parameters is at the root of many issues in computer science. Gradient-based learning draws on the fact that it is generally much easier to minimize a reasonably smooth, continuous function than a discrete combinatorial function. The loss function can be minimized by estimating the impact of small variations of the parameter values on the loss function. This is measured\nt91r | by the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters. Efficient learning algorithms can be devised when the gradient vector can be computed analytically, as opposed to numerically through perturbations. This is the basis of numerous gradient-based learning algorithms with continuous-valued parameters. In the procedures described in this article, the set of parameters W is a real-valued vector, with respect to which E of W is continuous, as well as differentiable almost everywhere. The simplest minimization procedure in such a setting is the gradient descent algorithm where W is iteratively adjusted as follows:\n7s4b | partial E of W partial derivative W\nehif | WK equals Wk minus one minus epsilon partial E of Wk partial derivative W\nbuv0 | In the simplest case, epsilon is a scalar constant. More sophisticated procedures use variable epsilon, or substitute it for a diagonal matrix, or substitute it for an estimate of the inverse Hessian matrix as in Newton or quasi-Newton methods. The conjugate gradient method can also be used. However, Appendix B shows that despite many claims to the contrary in the literature, the usefulness of these second-order methods to large learning machines is very limited.\nwqqa | A popular minimization procedure is the stochastic gradient algorithm, also called the online update. It consists in updating the parameter vector using a noisy, or approximated, version of the average gradient. In the most common instance of it, W is updated on the basis of a single sample\nwww8 | WK equals Wk minus one minus epsilon EPK of W partial derivative W\nzhvt | With this procedure the parameter vector fluctuates around an average trajectory, but usually it converges considerably faster than regular gradient descent and second-order methods on large training sets with redundant samples such as those encountered in speech or character recognition. The reasons for this are explained in Appendix B. The properties of such algorithms applied to learning have been studied theoretically since the nineteen sixties, but practical successes for nontrivial tasks did not occur until the mid-eighties.\nyv1q | C. Gradient Back Propagation\nu7jx | Gradient-based learning procedures have been used since the late nineteen fifties, but they were mostly limited to linear systems. The surprising usefulness of such simple gradient descent techniques for complex machine learning tasks was not widely realized until the following three events occurred. The first event was the realization that, despite early warnings to the contrary, the presence of local minima in the loss function does not seem to be a major problem in practice. This became apparent when it was noticed that local minima did not seem to be a major impediment to the success of early nonlinear gradient-based learning techniques such as Boltzmann machines. The second event was the popularization by Rumelhart and others of a simple and efficient procedure to compute the gradient in a nonlinear system composed\n03u9 | of several layers of processing, i.e., the back-propagation algorithm. The third event was the demonstration that the back-propagation procedure applied to multilayer neural networks with sigmoidal units can solve complicated learning tasks. The basic idea of back propagation is that gradients can be computed efficiently by propagation from the output to the input. This idea was described in the control theory literature of the early nineteen sixties, but its application to machine learning was not generally realized then. Interestingly, the early derivations of back propagation in the context of neural network learning did not use gradients but \"virtual targets\" for units in intermediate layers, or minimal disturbance arguments. The Lagrange formalism used in the control theory literature provides perhaps the best rigorous method for deriving back propagation and for deriving generalizations of back propagation to recurrent networks and networks of heterogeneous modules. A simple derivation for generic multilayer systems is given in Section One dash E.",
