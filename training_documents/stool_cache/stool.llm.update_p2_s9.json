        "content": "rl4j | We defined patients with presumptive tuberculosis, following clinical guidelines in both settings, as children with signs or symptoms suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis such as persistent cough, unexplained fever and/or night sweats, poor weight gain or weight loss, reduced playfulness or malaise, history of contact with a tuberculosis patient, or enlarged lymph nodes in the neck (Ethiopia only).\nvz32 | Under the Standard of Care, national guidelines in both countries recommend the use of GeneXpert for the diagnosis of paediatric tuberculosis. However, in both countries, sputum smear microscopy is allowed for diagnosis if the Primary Health Care has no access to GeneXpert. Despite this recommendation, in both countries, most Primary Health Care units do not have access to a GeneXpert machine, and therefore use sputum smear microscopy for the diagnosis of paediatric tuberculosis. For the diagnosis of paediatric tuberculosis, in the primary analyses, we assumed that sputum smear microscopy was the bacteriological test used at Primary Health Care in Standard of Care in both Ethiopia and Indonesia. In the sensitivity analyses, we considered alternate scenarios with Xpert used for bacteriological testing for sputum in Standard of Care.\nncb0 | The intervention was modelled as implementing the simple stool Xpert testing method at Primary Health Care and hospital level. Thus, considering spontaneous sputum expectoration to be limiting in obtaining a test result under Standard of Care, we conceptualised the intervention as increasing the fraction of children with a bacteriological test result at both the primary and higher healthcare level.\n8mp0 | We assumed that children with a negative bacteriological test under the intervention would receive clinical assessments for tuberculosis while only a small proportion would get clinical assessments under Standard of Care. A clinical diagnosis can be made based on tuberculosis-suggestive signs or symptoms, chest X-ray results, and tuberculin skin test (Indonesia only) or contact history with a tuberculosis patient. Indonesian referral centres that do not have access to chest X-rays and/or tuberculosis skin tests use a score chart for clinical diagnosis.\nxjyk | Systematic review data on the sensitivity of stool-based diagnostics for identifying tuberculosis in children indicate sensitivity of fifty to sixty-seven percent in children with bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis, but very poor sensitivity, two to six percent, in clinically diagnosed tuberculosis. We, therefore, assumed that stool\nmt0f | testing would only detect a proportion of those children who would be bacteriologically positive under ideal circumstances. The accuracy of Xpert testing on stool using the Standard of Care method was modelled based on a systematic review which reported pooled sensitivity and specificity of stool Xpert of fifty-seven point one percent and ninety-eight point one percent, respectively, compared with culture on a respiratory sample as the reference standard. The intervention was to reduce mortality through higher sensitivity for detecting tuberculosis, and to reduce referrals and reassessments.\nawab | Modelling approach\nixcc | The pathway of care shown in figure one was coded into a decision tree using the HEdtree package in R. Referral endpoints from Primary Health Care level were modelled by adding an identical hospital care pathway to follow the three paths for referral from Primary Health Care level. All care outcomes were extended to either death or survival. The probability of children following different pathways through the tree was assumed to depend on true tuberculosis status and age, zero to four years or five to fourteen years. Mortality risk from tuberculosis by age group and anti-tuberculosis treatment status was modelled using a published approach, using case-fatality ratios based on systematic review data. We neglected mortality in children who were truly negative for tuberculosis. We did not model drug-resistant tuberculosis or HIV status.\n8p6h | All parameters in the model were treated as uncertain and following specified distributions. All results were based on applying the model to calculate mean outcomes from the tree for each of ten thousand samples from these parameter distributions.\npmgl | Literature review and parameterisation\n90no | To inform the parameters needed in the decision tree model, we followed a three-step data collection process. First, we reviewed data from ongoing studies in Ethiopia and Indonesia. Second, we systematically searched peer-reviewed literature for parameters not available from country study data. In brief, initially, systematic reviews on tuberculosis in children were sought by a search of PubMed including the terms 'systematic review', 'meta-analysis', 'tuberculosis' and 'children' on nineteenth June twenty twenty. Subsequently, we constructed pooled estimates from primary literature, published from twenty ten to present, about tuberculosis diagnostic testing in infants and children, including healthcare seeking and healthcare cascade with a focus on Ethiopia and Indonesia. For this, a systematic search strategy was developed by an information specialist combining free-text and thesaurus searching. Except for searches specifically addressing\njt0y | Table one.
