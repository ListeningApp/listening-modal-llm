Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire\nma93 | The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire is a thirty-nine-item scale to measure five factors of mindfulness: Observing (attending to or noticing internal and external stimuli, such as sensations, emotions, cognitions, sights, sounds, and smells), describing (noting or mentally labeling these stimuli with words), acting with awareness (attending to one's current actions, as opposed to behaving automatically or absent-mindedly), non-judging of inner experience (refraining from evaluation of one's sensations, cognitions, and emotions) and non-reactivity to inner experience (allowing thoughts and feeling to come and go, without attention getting caught up in them). Responses to the items are given on a five-point Likert-type scale \"one equals never\" or very rarely true, \"five equals very\" often or always true. The five subscales have shown adequate to good internal consistency. Usable data from both time-points were obtained from fourteen MBSR and fourteen control participants.\nc6hh | Two point four. MRI data collection and analysis\ny7ea | All participants were scanned at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging in Charlestown, Massachusetts. MBSR participants were scanned during the two weeks before (Pre) and after (Post) participation in the program. Control participants were also scanned twice, approximately two months apart. There was an average time of fifty-six point two five days (S.D.: four point five days) in between scanning sessions for the MBSR group and sixty-five point six seven days (S.D.: eleven point two two days) for the control group. High-resolution MRI data were acquired with a Siemens Magnetom Avanto one point five Tesla scanner with standard head coil. Data sets of the whole brain were collected using a T-one weighted MPRAGE-sequence, consisting of one hundred twenty-eight sagittal slices \"one point zero times one point zero times one point three millimeters\" , \"T I equals one thousand milliseconds\" \"T E equals three point three nine milliseconds\" \"T R equals two thousand seven hundred thirty milliseconds\" . Image analysis was performed with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) tools within the Statistical Parametric Mapping neuroimaging statistical software based in MATLAB seven point one, release fourteen, using default settings unless otherwise specified. VBM permits an automated voxel-wise whole brain statistical comparison of MRI scan. Images were manually aligned to the anterior commissure and then segmented into gray and white matter in native space (i.e., before normalization, using the 'Native Space' segmentation option implemented in SPM5). For each individual, the (unmodulated) gray matter segmentations of the Pre and Post images were spatially registered. Normalization parameters were calculated for the \"Pre\" scan and were applied to both time-points (trilinear interpolation, \"two times two times two millimeters\" , to make sure that regional differences between the images were not removed by scan-specific spatial normalization. Images were smoothed using an eight-millimeter full width at half maximum Isotropic Gaussian Kernel.\nnav4 | We computed exploratory whole brain analyses as well as region of interest analyses. The ROI contained the bilateral hippocampi and bilateral insulae and was created using the WFU Pickatlas software and based on the parcellation of Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. A paired t-test within the MBSR group was first performed in SPM5, in order to identify those brain regions with significantly increased gray matter concentration following participation in the MBSR program. Since our ROI analysis was spatially focused, we chose to correct for multiple comparisons within the ROI (bilateral hippocampi and insulae) using the voxel-wise method implemented in SPM5. Given the very large number of voxels in the whole brain analysis, a voxel-wise method for\ngem8 | preventing false positives seemed too conservative and leads to a substantial loss of statistical power. We therefore chose to use a cluster-wise method for the exploratory whole brain analysis and corrected for multiple comparisons across the entire brain using the method implemented in SPM5. In order to exceed the threshold of \"P is less than point zero five\" , clusters had to exceed a size of two hundred fifty voxels. Statistical parametric maps were initially thresholded with \"P equals zero point zero one\" , uncorrected. P-values \"is less than zero point zero five\" , corrected for multiple comparisons, were considered significant for both the exploratory whole brain analysis as well as the ROI analysis.\ne8nr | Following the paired t-test within the MBSR group, follow-up tests were then conducted within the identified regions to test for significance compared with the control group. Values from the identified clusters were extracted for each person and each time-point using the Marsbar toolbox. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was then performed for each cluster in the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), with group (MBSR and control group) as the between-subjects factor and time-point (Pre and Post) as the within-subjects factor. Since groups were not identical in age and gender, these variables were controlled by entering them as nuisance variables.\nk78w | Three. Results\ng9du | Three point one. Amount of mindfulness practice\nf682 | MBSR participants reported spending an average of twenty-two point six hours (S.D.: six point three hours) engaged in formal homework exercises over the eight-week course (average equals twenty-seven minutes per day). In detail, the amount of body scan practice ranged between three hundred thirty-five and one thousand two minutes (mean: six hundred ninety-nine minutes, S.D.: two hundred seventeen minutes), yoga between one hundred three and seven hundred seventy-five minutes (mean: three hundred twenty-seven minutes, S.D.: one hundred ninety-four minutes), and sitting meditation between zero and seven hundred fifty-five minutes (mean: three hundred thirty-two minutes, S.D.: two hundred eleven minutes). The three measures were not significantly correlated with each other: body scan and yoga: \"r equals negative zero point zero four two\" , \"P equals zero point eight seven\" ; body scan and sitting: \"r equals negative zero point two six\" , \"P equals zero point three three\" ; yoga and sitting:\n```",
