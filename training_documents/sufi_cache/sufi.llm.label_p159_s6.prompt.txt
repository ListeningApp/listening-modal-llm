You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

3z35 | The Sufi usage of Hafiz's works is not at all the same as the ordinary translator's or reader's .*** I have noted elsewhere **** that, although it has been translated many times and quoted many thousands of times, there is hardly a correct rendition of the very first couplet of Rumi's major classical Sufi work, The Masnavi.
0xdu | We could give hundreds of examples. In fact, let us just open the Gulistan (Rose Garden) of Saadi and look at a passage and see what we find. Here is a passage; it runs in Persian:
bpdv | Kasani ki yazdan-parasti kunand/Bi-awazi dtdab masti kunand. One English translation gives the meaning, literally enough, as:
b0xd | *Katib Chelebi: Thi Balance of Truth, tr. G. L. Lewis, London: Allen & Unwin, 1957.
e106 | ** Cf. L. F. Rushbrook William*, Sufi Studies East & West, London: Octagon, and New York: E. P. Dunon Inc., 1973 and 1974. *** See 'Dye your Prayer-Rug with Wine' in this book.
mh8r | **** In my The Sufis, London and New York: Doubleday & Co. Inc., and Octagon.

8qfv | Those who arc God-worshippers
iers | Become drunken (even) at the sound of a water-wheel.
z6h3 | How, the word dulab (water-wheel), also means, figuratively, 'deceit' in Persian.
qe1n | Saadi is saying, therefore:
uaiu | 1. That people who worship the divine (yazdan) go into a state of intoxication even at the sound of a water-wheel. This can mean, in this context, either that they can be so conditioned [in the case, of course, of superficialists] that anything will throw them into what they regard as a religious state, or else that anything might remind [rightly-attuned mystics] of Divinity;
besh | 2. Either type of person just referred to can be diverted into his or her state (imagined or real) by deceit.
z6fn | So, instead of having the unexceptionable but fragmentary translation 'Anything will throw the religious into an ecstasy', we find a whole range of meanings open up as we look at the words and their alternative significations, including :-
c7zf | 1. Fixation upon the Divine can lead to becoming intoxicated by it, by the sound made by an inanimate object not intended to elicit such a reaction;
iwkf | 2. People who have fixated upon the Divine may revert to the intoxication [which may or may not be a veridical mystical experience] by a rhythmic sound;
4jzo | 3. Genuine mystical experiences can be invoked in the devout by rhythmic methods;
i5zo | 4. Experiences thought to be mystical can be elicited in people who have [genuinely or otherwise] engaged in divine worship by deceit(s).
we91 | This kind of multiple meaning abounds in Persian poetry. The Sufi has to be able to keep all the alternative possibilities of meaning in mind, so as to be able to look at the whole range of possible significances of human experience which ordinary people compress into a far smaller range of understanding.

my5y | Some Characteristics of Sufi Literat ure
k3e7 | Q: We find, in your book The Sufis, some illuminating material on Sufi literature. Could you say something more on this subject, to help in its study?
zuhq | A: Nothing betrays the superficial or the uninformed student, when it comes to study and presentation of formerly current texts, like the use made by such people of literature.
pt13 | To be entirely specific, we must point out that those who are primarily litterateurs and academic workers have a manner of study and an appreciation of literature which corresponds only with the outer husk of Sufi literature.
rw3z | People are reluctant to admit this possibility, partly because so much of the Sufi literature is a part of the classical literary heri- tage : they think that it must be susceptible only to study for its derivations, variety, elegance, vocabulary and so on.
voc3 | To say that all this superb material contains something which its self-styled greatest supporters do not perceive is asking for their outraged condemnation. But, as this happens to be true, we are obliged to say it. Whether they like it or not, Sufi literature was not written for certain pedants, for orientalists, or even, often, for the generation of today. There is the husk for all to see. The kernel may be garnered by those who, first, know which is the husk; and also how to reach the kernel.
huha | Viewed from this 'instrumental' usage of literature, the activities of memorising passages, selecting parts which appeal to one, comparing editions and manuscripts, seeking emotional or intellec- tual stimulus - all this is a different field from the inner functional one represented in this literature.
otjb | Let it not be denied that such masters as Rumi have baldly stated this fact. Nobody takes any notice-they go on studying Rumi. The result is that they imbibe the teaching material together
1rbe | 168
z978 | with the antidote, corrective or protective material in which it. is enshrouded. The only effect is cultural, in the anthropologist's sense of the word.
qxdv | From the Sufic point of view, such people are of course com- pletely entitled to their level of appreciation. The seriousness of the situation becomes evident when they teach others, people who are capable of greater understanding, to treat the materials in the same relatively shallow manner as they do themselves.
06co | It is at this point that we have something to say and much to do.
jei2 | Such trained individuals, we find, have their scope of 'being' attenuated, their perceptions (in the Sufic sense) dwarfed. They sometimes become conditioned to certain stimuli, they develop what can be alarming tendencies of a doctrinaire or academic nature.
tti3 | Here are a few characteristics of Sufi literature :-
r4pa | 1. Some books, some passages, are intended to be read in a certain order.
ivgr | 2. Some books and passages have to be read under specific environmental conditions.
vobc | 3. Some have to be read aloud, some silently, some alone, some in company.
3rdh | 4. Some are only vehicles for illustrations or other content generally regarded as extraneous or secondary to the text.
lbvs | 5. Some are of limited use or ephemeral function, being addressed to communities in certain places, at certain stages of development, or for a limited time.
2rt2 | 6. Some forms have concealed meanings which yield coherent but misleading meanings, safety-devices to ward off tamperers.
3ld6 | 7. Some are interlarded with material deliberately designed to confuse or sidetrack those who are not properly instructed, for their own protection.
1ac5 | 8. Some books contain a completely different potential, and they are communicators through another means than the writing con- tained in them. They are not designed primarily to be read at all.
oau9 | 9- Sufi literature is a part of a carefully worked out plan. Its abuse leads to nothing of permanent value.
9i0g | 169
3w3y | Sufi teachings, and sometimes keys to it, are sometimes em- bedded in quite other material, not recognisable as Sufi at all to the uninitiated. Many of these teachings are really meditation- themes. They have a deep function almost unknown to pedestrian conventionalists, enthusiasts, imitators or the occultist.
3ejg | Many people familiarise themselves with the classics, or any Sufi literature which they can obtain, thinking that they will benefit by doing this. Many again think that they have really benefitted. But since the frequency or pattern upon which the studies are planned cannot be penetrated by such people, they do not gain the nutritional and developmental content of the materials.
ehdq | Even the sheer familiarisation with Sufi materials, for the pur- pose of future development, must at some point take place in accordance with the school pattern, itself based upon the 'great design' which unlocks the treasures of this extraordinary store- house.
mahz | No form of selectivity, no A to Z treatment of study, no mere immersing of oneself in 'Sufi thought', no participation in Sufi exercises or rituals, can, if carried out arbitrarily (and by this we mean without the direction of those who know the pattern) none of this can yield the deep Sufic content.
ba46 | People may think that they have gained something. But this is characteristic of the adherents of each and every school, system, religion and so on. What they have gained is much more super- ficial than they imagine.
bjmu | These are among the reasons for a special and specialised school to preside over exposure to the Sufi materials.
w8jo | Sufi materials, of necessity, are designed to be perceptible in real meaning to those who are at a stage or in a condition to profit from them. If people are not, they accept shallow, emotional or misguided 'meanings' from Sufic materials.
n4g6 | This tendency is paralleled in the behaviour of animals and people at different stages of understanding and states of mind. You can find such examples, showing the failure to use one's mind correctly, every day in equivalent situations in ordinary life. Many Sufi jokes reproduce such situations, but the newspapers are also full of them. Consider the following:

b5m5 | THE PROTECTED MONUMENT
wu5k | 'Councillors at Ryde, Isle of Wight, burst into laughter last night on hearing from [a Government Department in] Whitehall that Seaview Pier was officially listed as a building of historic or architectural interest. The pier was demolished in 1952.'*
n462 | Lack of accurate information and the underlying failure to seek it, coupled with the assumption that things were in the condition imagined by whoever drafted that scheduling order provided the protection of the non-existent pier. The same kind of thinking is involved when many people deal with ideas, literature and person- alities rather than buildings. The same kind of mental equipment approaches a different proposition in the same kind of way.
7tg4 | You do not even have to be a human being to assume things about something resulting in harm and uselessness to yourself. Look at this:
5kya | THE MONKEY AND THE HEAD
7muy | 'A man had to be given hospital treatment for a sprained neck in Kuala Lam pur, Malaysia, when a monkey trained to pluck coco- nuts from high trees jumped on to his shoulders and began twist- ing his head.' **
3zl7 | That monkey, no doubt, if trained, would have scheduled a non- existing building as 'of interest'.
i0sj | Communication has to take into account the person to whom something is to be communicated. Consider this and compare it with someone buying a book and reading it according to his own conceptions of what it is trying to convey:
slsh | DOG AND DINNER
ji5o | A Swiss couple told the newspaper Blick that they had taken their pet poodle into a Hong Kong restaurant and signalled to the waiter that they wanted it fed, making eating signs. The poodle was taken away. When the waiter came back with a dish under a

56tt | silver lid, they found their dog roasted inside, garnished with pepper sauce and bamboo shoots .***
chel | The couple were reported to be traumatised and to be suffering from emotional shock. Many Sufi teachers, such as Rumi, reflecting in his Fihi Ma Fihi and the Masnavi on how people behave with spiritual materials, have almost an equal air of traumatisation.

a3t5 | Impartiality as a Point of View
jlbs | Q: How do we reach impartiality?
6aui | A: Most people's impartiality is not such at all, but a cover for a partial point of view.
y7r5 | If you have a bias towards impartiality, your goal must be the control of bias, not the struggle towards impartiality - because you will never reach impartiality through bias.
nhpx | People who believe that they are impartial, however, seldom are.
2yc2 | To find impartial people is usually easy only for those who do not need them.
eehg | As the Anwar-i-Suhaili says:
ght4 | 'If practice were verification, we would be able to discern liars by their faces.'
sx29 | As an example of impartiality, remember the action of Bishr al-Hafi, quoted by Ghazzali, in his Book of Knowledge, who buried a large number of books, saying:
j7hg | I feel the urge to recount Traditions. But I will not do this until the desire abates.'
2c66 | Lack of experience and information causes lack of impartiality; but this does not stop people from believing that they are in fact objective. They believe this because they have a strong desire to be or to appear to be impartial. Hence Bishr's pointing to the disabling role of the emotion of desire.
zzrc | We can illustrate what people do when they have too little information and too much desire in a safely 'objective' case of an anthropological observation from New Guinea:
m1vl | BUYING THE PRESIDENT
ghtz | In April 1966 some islanders refused to pay taxes because they were saving up to buy the President of the United States. They had already refused to vote as the President's name was not on the ballot paper .. .*
72zw | *The Times, (London) 14 April 1966, quoting Reuter, April 13.
9v2o | 173
fn2s | To reach an impartial viewpoint, you have to be able to look at situations beyond their immediate 'message', so that you can event- ually see things 'in the round'.
rhn0 | If I were asked to illustrate this by a Western parallel, I would choose this tale:
pg87 | TWO MEN IN A MADHOUSE
4r9c | A guide in a certain madhouse was describing two cases to some visiting psychiatrists. 'In this padded cell,' he said, 'we have a man who went mad when another man married the girl whom he was in love with.'
xbmu | 'And in the next cell?' asked a visitor.
rp75 | 'In that one we have the man who actually did marry the girl.'
62hx | 174
n5mv | Characteristics and Purposes of a Sufi Group
3lem | Q: May we have some characteristics and purposes of a living Sufi group?
jm94 | A:
v4s7 | Appearance: May take any form consistent with the culture in which it is operating, the commanding principle being that certain people have to be related in some kind of a viable entity.
j6ud | Objective: To form and maintain, under appropriate guidance, the special conditions in which the Teaching can operate.
rlh2 | Intention: To enable as many people as possible, in due order, to achieve the understanding which will facilitate the higher (as well as the lower) effects of the Teaching to give the maximum develop- mental help.
gwtt | Programme: To keep the group operating as a channel for the successively refined impulses from the Source, and to attune the members to be able to perceive these impulses.
gzru | Characteristics: Enough serious-minded but not indoctrinated people; attitudes suitable for the transmission to act upon; an orientation suitable to accept and work with the materials provided or indicated by the Representative for the time being of the Teaching.
79vs | Modus Operandi: Meetings, reading, 'audition', performances, practices, theoretical and practical study, organisation of environ- ment.
9bfz | Deterioration: Evidenced by the acceptance of simplifications, contraction of activity, messianic and panacea thinking, hierarchical behaviour patterns believed to be sacrosanct, literal acceptance of the figurative and vice-versa, hagiography, providing social and psychological stimuli and/or reassurances, offering scope for per- sonality-projection, assuaging desires for attention, substituting itself for diversions of a political, organisational, religious, psycho-
lrwo | 175
vlfw | logical, social, academic, family and other groupings.
fg41 | Contrast this with the kind of group, that of the 'man of learn- ing' surrounded by others, of whom Al-Thauri says 'Be assured that he is an impostor and a fraud: because if he were to tell them the truth, they would hate him'.
