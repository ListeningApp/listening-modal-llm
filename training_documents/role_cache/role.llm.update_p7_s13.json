        "content": "gxfd | Bioinformatics analysis predicted that MdERF3 may bind to the GCC-box or DRE motif on the promoter of genes such as MdPGLR3, MdPME2 and MdACO4. MdPGLR3, MdPME2 and MdACO4 were predicted as candidate genes from QTLs F-F zero three point four, C-F zero two point one and F-Z sixteen point one, respectively, and all these three genes were DEGs for flesh firmness and crispness retainability. Yeast one hybrid assay confirmed that MdERF3 efficiently bound to the promoters of MdPGLR3, MdPME2 and MdACO4. The relative expression of MdPGLR3, MdPME2 and MdACO4 was significantly inhibited in MdERF3 overexpressing lines, but was induced significantly in RNAi lines. These data demonstrated that MdERF3 might negatively regulate the transcription of MdPGLR3, MdPME2 and MdACO4.\ns2v1 | MdDOF five point three was predicted to be located near QTL F-Z eleven point one. Yeast one hybrid revealed that MdDOF five point three bound to the promoter of MdERF3 of 'Red Fuji' containing the CTTAACTG element, but did not bind to MdERF3 of 'Red Fuji'. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay further confirmed the interaction between MdDOF five point three and the promoter of MdERF3 containing the CTTAACTG element. In thirty-five S: MdDOF five point three and MdERF3 pro-F: GUS co-transformed tobacco leaves, the MdERF3 promoter activity was higher than that co-transformed with a M d E R F three pr a-F: GUS. These results indicated that MdERF3 completely perturbed the binding of MdDOF five point three to the CTTAACTG motif of MdERF3 promoter.\njkp9 | MdERF3 was then transiently overexpressed via Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration or silenced via pTRV virus-induced gene silencing. Compared to that with the PRI one hundred one empty vector transformants control, a significant increase in MdERF3 expression and distinct changes in fruit skin colour were observed in 'Golden Delicious' apples five days after transient transformation with PRI-MdERF3. However, both flesh firmness and crispness of PRI-MdERF3-transformed apples were relatively lower than that of PRI one hundred one control, which may be attributed to natural fruit senescence. The apples transformed with pTRV-MdERF3 displayed more yellowing of the skin, reduced MdERF3 expression, and an especially lower flesh firmness and crispness five days after infiltration. These data further confirmed that MdERF3 contributed to post-harvest flesh firmness/crispness retainability.\nz8tt | A three base pair deletion GTT at negative two hundred twenty-nine to negative two hundred thirty-one upstream of the ATG codon of MdERF one hundred eighteen was detected in 'Zisai Pearl', which disrupted the RAVL one binding CAACA motif and reduced the expression of MdERF one hundred eighteen in flesh firmness and crispness non-retainable Del two hundred twenty-nine:del two hundred twenty-nine genotypes. The GUS staining intensity, GUS gene expression in tobacco, and transgenic apple calli indicated that the presence of Del two hundred twenty-nine or truncating off the corresponding motif reduced the promoter activity of MdERF one hundred eighteen. Yeast one hybrid and transgenic apple calli lines confirmed that MdERF one hundred eighteen might negatively regulate the transcription of MdPGLR3 and MdACO4.\n9g22 | MdRAVL one was predicted from QTL F-Z sixteen point two. Yeast one hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and transient co-transformed tobacco showed that MdRAVL one bound to the promoter of MdERF one hundred eighteen but not MdERF one hundred eighteen-D. 'Golden Delicious' apples transiently overexpressing or virus-induced gene silencing MdERF one hundred eighteen further confirmed the contribution of MdERF one hundred eighteen to flesh firmness or crispness retainability.\n41fx | The yeast two hybrid assay revealed the protein-protein interaction between MdERF3 and MdERF one hundred eighteen. Then, a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves further verified that MdERF3 interacted with MdERF one hundred eighteen in the nucleus.\n7um8 | QTL-based GAP modelling and simulative selection\nuow2 | An SNP marker was selected from a candidate gene predicted from each of the fifty-six QTLs, including MdERF3 and MdERF one hundred eighteen. The genotypes of hybrids in the training population for the fifty-six QTL-based markers were listed in tables. The marker effects varied from zero point one five five months to two point five nine months, and from zero point two one months to three point two four months for flesh firmness and crispness retainability, respectively. The additive, for example SNP one three five seven nine four one eight for crispness\niat7 | retainability, or complete dominant, for example SNP nine four zero three three one eight for crispness retainability, allelic effects were less common than the partial dominant allelic effect, for example SNP nine one two seven two six nine and SNP three eight five seven three four six one for both firmness and crispness retainability.\nywwr | The genomics-predicted value of flesh firmness retainability of four hundred seventy-three hybrids and genomics-predicted value of flesh crispness retainability of three hundred ninety-four hybrids were shown in tables. Relatively high prediction accuracy was obtained as zero point five seven one two and zero point six five eight five for the retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively. The fivefold cross-validation exhibited an average prediction accuracy of zero point five five four one and zero point six zero one eight for flesh firmness and crispness retainability, respectively. In a simulative selection, when flesh firmness retainability genomics-predicted value criterion was set as five point zero months, the selection rate was two point five four percent and the efficiency was one hundred percent, which indicated that the observed phenotype value of all the twelve selected hybrids was equal to or longer than five point zero months. When the genomics-predicted value criterion for flesh crispness retainability was set as five point zero months, the selection rate was three point four eight percent and the efficiency was sixty-four point two nine percent.\n0i6j | Discussion",
