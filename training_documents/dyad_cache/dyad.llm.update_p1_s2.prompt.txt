You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

7imw | Intelligence Success and Failure: The Human Factor Rose McDermott and Uri Bar-Joseph
lf1t | 4 The Second Dyad: The USA in the Korean War a Uri Bar-Joseph, Rose McDermott
tze7 | Abstract
ryvv | The two American warning failures in the Korean War are unique cases in our category of events: The first, because the US intelligence community provided no warning at all prior to the North Korean invasion in June 1950, due to the poor quality of its collection capabilities and its distrust of South Korean warnings. The second case is even more unique. Despite China's public warnings, reliable information that massive Chinese forces had crossed the Yalu River, and the actual engagement with these forces, General MacArthur, supported by his intelligence officer General Willoughby, entirely ignored them when ordering his forces to complete the occupation of North Korea. Explaining this odd decision, the chapter pinpoints MacArthur's paranoia and narcissism and Willoughby's tendency toward centralism, mirror-imaging, and need for cognitive closure. These traits allowed the success of the sudden Chinese counteroffensive in late November that caused the US Army one of the worst defeats in its history.
zdrh | With the prize within his grasp, holding tight to his conviction that Red China was a paper tiger, MacArthur had simply closed his ears to all counsel save his own."
osmo | MacArthur did not want the Chinese to enter the war in Korea. Anything MacArthur wanted, Willoughby produced intelligence for .... In this case, Willoughby falsified the intelligence reports .... He should have gone to jail.2
0b8v | Introduction
fucs | The two American intelligence failures in the Korean War are unique cases in the category of events that make this book. The uniqueness of the first, the failure to warn that North Korea intended to invade South Korea in June 1950, derives from the fact that on the eve of the invasion, American intelligence organizations failed to provide any specific piece of information that could alert their consumers to the looming threat. This kind of a failure-at the level of collection-is rare in the history of surprise attacks. When compared to other cases in this book, it is a far cry from Barbarossa and the Yom Kippur war, when the intelligence organizations collected sufficient information to alert the decision-makers to the threat even if these warnings were ignored. 4
yply | The second American failure is even more unique. In June 1950, the attack was against soldiers from the Republic of Korea and not the US Army, and prior to it the Korean Peninsula was ranked very low in the American intelligence order of priorities, as indicated in NSC-68, and this explains much of the outcome. But in late November 1950, the Chinese attacked American soldiers, and unlike in the June 1950 case, in the weeks before the attack a plethora of intelligence information concerning the looming threat had become available to General Douglas MacArthur and his staff. They were nevertheless caught unprepared, and the United States suffered one of the worst defeats in its military history. A number of factors explain this failure, but they mainly result from the lack of a proper learning process after the failure of June 1950.

ec91 | a. The road to war
wul6 | When compared with Hitler's decision to launch Barbarossa before ending the war with Britain, Japan's decision to initiate a war against a far stronger American opponent at Pearl Harbor, or Sadat's decision to attack Israel despite the clear military superiority of the Israel Defense Force (IDF), the decision of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ([DPRK]; North Korea) to attack the Republic of Korea ([ROK]; South Korea) seems rather rational. The decision to attack was Kim Il-Sung's, but it was dependent on the approval of Stalin and Mao Ze Dong.
4rhy | Kim's commitment to an "armed unification" of Korea dates back to the early 1940s, when he served as the head of the Korean battalion for the 88th brigade in the Soviet Far East Command.3 Earlier, he was a guerrilla commander in the war against the Japanese occupation in Manchuria and North Korea. He had moved to the USSR in 1939 or 1940, graduated from an officers school, and in 1945 was selected by Beria, with Stalin's approval, to be the leader of the Korean territories that were occupied by the Red Army toward the end of the war. Backed up by Soviet support, Kim took over the country in 1946 and established the Korean People's Army (KPA), which became, within a few years, a significant military force. Committed to the unification of Korea under his leadership, Kim rejected the Soviet-American understanding for a joint trusteeship of Korea reached at the February 1945 Yalta conference. Following the American military 4 withdrawal from South Korea in June 1949, he became convinced that the KPA was capable of defeating the far weaker ROK army, as well as the American dispatch forces.4 Kim's optimistic estimations, which were supported by the reports of the Soviet ambassador in Pyongyang, convinced Stalin that the "progressive forces" in South Korea were powerful enough and that it was in a state of "revolutionary readiness."5
092d | Until early 1950, Stalin, who feared a confrontation with the United States in the Far East, avoided giving a green light to Kim's military initiative. Unlike in Europe, where Stalin expanded Communist influence despite the risk of such a confrontation, concern about the American reaction ranked high in his Far Eastern strategy. In the case of Korea, it led him to agree to the division of the peninsula and the evacuation of the
94ul | Red Army from the territory it had occupied in August 1945. In the Chinese civil war, it drove him to support the division of China between the nationalist and communist rivals along the Yangtze River instead of pledging full support for Mao. Only the Communist military achievements caused him to alter policy in the spring of 1949. Similarly, despite the optimistic reports he received from North Korea regarding the south's ripeness for unification under a communist rule, he expressed his reservations about it during the talks he held with Mao in Moscow in late 1949, and continued to reject any proposal for a military initiative until early 1950.6
0vdu | Following the communist victory in the Chinese civil war, both Mao and Kim competed to win Soviet support for the unification of their countries: China with Tibet and Formosa and North Korea with the south." Influenced by Kim's optimistic reports, Stalin's reluctance to support him lessened. Nevertheless, when Stalin did give Kim the green light, in January 1950, he also made it clear that Korea ranked low in his order of priorities and that, therefore, he would not be able to provide "great assistance and support" in case of failure. In addition, Stalin demanded that Kim obtain the blessing of the Chinese.
a230 | Apart from his increased optimism regarding a North Korean military initiative, other factors influenced Stalin's change of mind: the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, which was regarded as a model for 4 spreading the revolution in Asia; his belief that the United States had deserted Chiang Kai-shek and would act similarly in the case of Korea; the successful Soviet nuclear test in August 1949, which ended the American nuclear monopoly; and the early January 1950 declarations by secretary of state Dean Acheson and President Truman that excluded Korea and Formosa from the American defense perimeter in the east, signaling weakness in the American position in East Asia. According to a more updated analysis, which relies on recently released Soviet and Chinese documents, Stalin was also influenced by his interest in preserving an ice-free port in the Pacific. By this account, unification of the Korean peninsula under communist rule meant that the ports of Pusan and Inchon would become available to the Soviets. And if the North Koreans were defeated, the risk to the People's Republic of China (PRC) would compel Mao to ask the Soviets to maintain their presence in the ports of Lushun and Dalian.9
