You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

dgcw | 9.3.3.2 Cross-shelf distribution
gvwz | Pacific hake form dense daytime aggregations on the continental shelf break and near the edges of mid-shelf banks and basins, sometimes extending 40 km or more offshore over water depths as great as 2000 m (Bailey et al., 1982; Dorn, 1995; Ware and McFarlane, 1995; Swartzman, 2001). Pacific hake are found primarily between depths of 50 and 500 m during the day, most commonly in aggregations at depths of between 150 and 250 m.
sk5m | From south to north in the CCLME, Pacific hake aggregations increase in depth and move further offshore along the continental shelf to the shelf break (Swartzman, 1997). This pattern probably reflects ontogenetic effects on depth preferences, that is, smaller, younger juvenile fish do not migrate as far north as older Pacific hake (Hollowed, 1992; Dorn, 1995; Ware and McFarlane, 1995), and juvenile Pacific hake exhibit a greater preference for shallower shelf loca- tions than mature fish (Methot and Dorn, 1995; Saunders and McFarlane, 1997). At least in some years, hake have been shown to be preferentially aggre- gated off the shelf break at the depth of the sub-surface poleward-flow of the California Undercurrent (Agostini et al., 2006).
qws8 | Temperature gradients may be an important mechanism driving Pacific hake depth distribution, but preferred temperature ranges for Pacific hake have not been established. The distribution of Pacific hake across years demonstrates that they are able to live within a range of temperatures. Temperature and depth are correlated with other factors, including currents and prey availability. Swartzman (2001) suggests that euphausiids sense and orient to oceanographic factors (e.g. bottom depth, temperature and flow) and Pacific hake sense and orient to euphausiids.

rzhj | 9.3.3.3 Diel migrations
bfax | Adult Pacific hake form pelagic schools during the day, mostly between the depths of 50 and 500 m, then disperse and migrate towards the surface at dusk; during spawning, they neither feed nor migrate vertically (Best, 1963; Nelson and Larkins, 1970; Bailey et al., 1982; Stauffer, 1985). The vertical migration is usually thought to facilitate predation upon fish and zooplankton in the water column (Alton and Nelson, 1970) and may be influenced by several factors (e.g. prey, light, avoidance of predation and metabolism), as observed in other marine fishes (Neilson and Perry, 1990).
f2y8 | 9.3.4 Prey and predation
o7qm | Pacific hake is both an important food source for many predators and likely the most important consumer of zooplankton and forage fish in the CCLME (Field, 2004). Larvae and smaller juvenile hake feed on copepod eggs, copepods and juvenile euphausiids (Sumida and Moser, 1980; Grover et al., 2002; Cass-Calay, 2003). The diet of large juveniles and adults is composed primarily of euphausiids, fish and pandalid shrimp, with evidence of adult cannibalism on juveniles (Alton and Nelson, 1970; Bailey et al., 1982; Livingston, 1983; Brodeur et al., 1987; Buckley and Livingston, 1997, Field et al., 2006; Emmett and Krutzikowsky, 2008). The amount of spatial overlap (and cannibalism) between adult and juvenile fish varies annually in response to environmental and demographic factors as discussed previously (Buckley and Livingston, 1997). Larger zooplankton and fish become more important dietary components as Pacific hake grow. Pacific hake are usu- ally considered to be opportunistic feeders (Best, 1963), particularly upon schooling or aggregating prey (Livingston and Bailey, 1985). The daily ration for juvenile and adult Pacific hake has been estimated variously between 0.4% and 3.5% of body weight (Francis, 1983; Livingston, 1983; Rexstad and Pikitch, 1986; Tanasichuk et al., 1991). Euphausiids nearly always appear as a very important component of the Pacific hake diet, but some studies have demonstrated seasonal and inter-annual changes in the mix of prey types utilised throughout the CCLME (e.g. Bailey et al., 1982; Livingston, 1983; Buckley and Livingston, 1997; Emmett and Krutzikowsky, 2008). These shifts include from primarily euphausiid prey (primarily Thysanoessa spinifera) to increased consumption of Pacific herring in late summer off Vancouver Island (Tanasichuk et al., 1991; Ware and McFarlane, 1995) and during the 1997-1998 El Niño (Nelson, 2004), and from mostly fish prey to euphausiids in the summertime off Oregon and Washington (Brodeur et al., 1987).
d52l | Pacific hake are also important prey for other species. Pacific hake embryos and larvae are preyed upon by copepods, amphipods and gelatinous zoo- plankton (Bailey and Yen, 1983; Livingston and Bailey, 1985). Pacific hake juveniles and adults are also prey for other nekton, including dogfish (Squalus acanthias), sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), lingcod (Ophidon elongates),

nhsg | arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) and tunas (Thunnus spp.), as well as apex predators such as California sea lions (Zalophus californianus californianus), Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardii), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) and other tooted whales, sooty shearwaters (Puffinus griseus), western gulls (Larus occidentalis) and common murres (Uria aalge) (Fiscus, 1979; Ainley et al., 1982; Livingston and Bailey, 1985; Baraff and Loughlin, 2000; Field, 2004). The predation of Humboldt squid (Dosidicus gigas) upon adult Pacific hake has recently received attention (Field et al., 2007; Zeidberg and Robison, 2007), as these squid have become periodically more common in the northern CCLME. In particular, the northward expansion of Humboldt squid in 2009 resulted in considerable overlap in depth and geographic range with Pacific hake. This hake forms an important link between upper and lower trophic levels in the CCLME.
hy0l | 9.3.5 Population dynamics
4jmz | Pacific hake live more than 20 years, attaining lengths of over 50 cm of total length, with 50% reaching maturity by the age of 4 years, at about 37 cm. Dorn et al. (1993) estimated a natural mortality rate (M) of 0.23 per year. Hamel and Stewart (2009) used a meta-analytical approach incorporating multiple life-history correlates to develop a log-normal prior for M with mean 0.193 per year.
