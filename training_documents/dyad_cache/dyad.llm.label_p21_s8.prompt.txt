You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

xjyk | The poor quality of intelligence collection on the CPVF deployment can account for the American surprise in the First Chinese Campaign. But it cannot explain the surprise of the Second Campaign of late November. As Appleman argued, "It is obvious that the FEC was in possession of a great amount of intelligence concerning the Chinese and their relations to the Korean War.""Haynes was even sharper, arguing, "By the end of the first week of November 1950, the FEC G-2 had enough data to identify the Chinese order of battle in Korea and should have been able to determine that the Chinese Communists had fully committed to entering the Korean War."174 Indeed, the battles that took place during the First Campaign and the reports provided by POW interrogations sufficed to warrant a conclusion that the CPVF OB in Korea was far larger than Willoughby's estimates indicated.
mt0f | Some students of the subject tried to explain this failure as the consequence of a sophisticated deception effort by the Chinese to make the CPVF forces look smaller than what they actually were. The plan involved Sigint deception, false reports by POWs, and a hasty withdrawal to the 4 north aimed at portraying the First Campaign as a solitary intervention in the war.15 But although one should not disregard the Chinese capacity for deception, it cannot count for the American estimation failure. Thus, for example, while Roe highlighted the objective difficulties involved in locating the CPVF crossing into Korea by aerial photography, a semi-official history of the air war emphasized that the air reconnaissance units involved "might have done a better job if they had known what they were expected to discover." Nor was the mission considered as too important, since "[I]ntelligence officers . did not view reports of an enemy build-up in the mountains south of Huichon with much concern."1" In other words, ineffective tasking and lack of concern by intelligence officers contributed to this failure no less than the objective difficulties, including Chinese deception.
awab | By this stage, it is clear that neither disregard of a possible Chinese intervention nor insufficient information about it can account for the surprise of late November. The best and most accurate explanations, indeed, are to be found once again in the human factor.

8p6h | ii. Decision-making
pmgl | The decision to allow MacArthur to renew his offensive was taken in an ambiguous atmosphere. Acheson noted in his memoirs: "All the president's advisers in this matter, civilian and military, knew that something was badly wrong, though what it was, how to find out, and what to do about it they muffed."177 Ridgway described a similar atmosphere in the JCS:
90no | There was no joy in the Pentagon at seeing our forces dispersed in the manner that MacArthur has now dispersed them, especially when the threat of massive Chinese intervention looked now so probable and so imminent. But in the pentagon as well as in the field there was an utmost superstitious awe of this larger-than-life military figure who had so often been right when everyone else had been wrong-who had never admitted a mistake in judgment, yet whose mistakes in judgment had been remarkably few. Then there were those who felt 4 that it was useless to try to check a man who might react to criticism by pursuing his own way with increased stubbornness and fervor.178

qb7o | Consequently, as an official history of the war concluded, "the most critical element in weighing the risks of Chinese intervention was the deference paid to the opinions of Gen. MacArthur."1" In addition, both civilian and military policymakers were dependent on information concerning the magnitude of the CPVF threat. The information came from MacArthur and his G-2. In this sense, the center of gravity of decision-making in November 1950 was not Washington but Tokyo, and the most relevant actors were MacArthur and his staff officers, primarily Willoughby.
oae5 | Decision-making in the Far East attracted insufficient attention, certainly in comparison to the volume of studies of the corresponding processes in Washington. This is peculiar not only because of MacArthur's mythological place in American military history and the critical role he personally played at this stage in the war, but also because of the impact of what can be termed the "Bataan Gang mentality" that dominated intelligence-making and operational planning in October and November 1950.
s0fl | The "Bataan Gang" (a.k.a. "Bataan Boys") was the nick-name of the group of staff officers that MacArthur had started to assemble around him in the late 1930s.18 In July 1941, when he was nominated to command the newly established Far Eastern Command, the nucleus of the group was made up of seven officers, including Willoughby. In March 1942, when MacArthur escaped by torpedo boat from the Corregidor Island in the Philippines to Australia, he took fifteen officers with him, who made up what became known as the "Bataan Gang." The group was divided into the upper-level faction made up of eight higher-rank and position officers, and the rest were personal staff.182
43ia | In addition to providing a cohesive body of staff work under MacArthur's leadership, the group dynamic was nourished by the three necessary conditions for the creation of charisma: a leader with charismatic qualities (a spark); followers who are open to his charisma (flammable material); and 4 an environment favorable to charisma (oxygen).18 In this case, MacArthur's military skills combined with his personal charisma and his paranoia (see below), provided the spark. The group of personally devoted officers he cultivated during his many years of Army service and built up around him, first in the Philippines and later in Australia, made the flammable material. And the oxygen was made up of elements such as the risky travel by torpedo boats to Australia, the sense of being left behind by Washington when it came to allocation of the resources needed to win the war in the Pacific, MacArthur's subsequent battle victories in the face of opposition, and his personal paranoia that ascribed negative developments to personal persecution. Together they made the Bataan Boys "an extension of his ego,"14leading them to give up their individuality. As one of them told John Gunther, "I honestly can't tell you anything. He's too enormous, too unpredictable. I don't really understand him myself. No one could.">185
3g2y | p. 166
gc7v | Although some of the symptoms of this group dynamic-such as the illusion of invulnerability, rationalization, and the unshakable belief in the group's morality-bring to mind Janis's groupthink notion, this dynamics did not rule the Bataan Gang. Its members were hand-picked by MacArthur over the years first and foremost according to their degree of personal loyalty to him. Remaining in the group was primarily the function of the members' ability to please MacArthur, and the way to do it this was through automatic (and motivated) agreement with him and consent to him. There were, furthermore, intergroup rivalries, and not all group members respected each other. Lastly, in many cases the interactions were between MacArthur and specific assistants rather than whole-group discussions, where groupthink dynamics would more likely arise. "They catered," Manchester wrote, "to his peacockery, genuflected to his viceregal whims, and shared his conviction that plotters were bent upon stabbing him in the back."18This is not how groupthink works; it sounds far more like cult of personality.

j30a | Since arriving in Australia, the group members had built a barrier around MacArthur. Their utmost loyalty and devotion, which gained them his personal backing and support, defined as MacArthur's only "blind spot," turned them into an exclusive and powerful group, to the extent that "[t]he 4 mere mention that a particular staff officer was one of the Bataan Boys was often enough to quell opposition." Nevertheless, until recently, they did not receive the attention they deserved.188
7bdk | By 1950, most of the Bataan Boys had left for the United States, and only two of MacArthur's original upper- level class remained in his Tokyo inner circle, which now amounted to twelve officers. Willoughby was one of the two. He had first met MacArthur in the mid-1930s while serving at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel as a teacher of military history in a military academy. According to his own testimony, his whole teaching was based on a summary of MacArthur's ideas as a Chief of Staff. Upon Willoughby's request, he joined MacArthur in the Philippines in 1939, and became his G-2 in 1941. Despite this fast rise to power, Willoughby did not win the respect of others and was generally regarded as a mediocre man who held his post because of his "doglike devotion" to MacArthur.1" By some accounts, this devotion spilled over into his professional work, which reflected his tendency to "cloud his judgment" based on MacArthur's views. 190 After the war, Willoughby gained more power and influence and became MacArthur's closest confident.191 At the same time, he continued cultivating the Bataan Gang mentality, thus helping to create "a command environment that rewarded sycophants and isolated those who challenged the conventional wisdom."192
fim0 | Devotion to the boss ranked as Willoughby highest goal. In describing Lt. Gen. Richard Sutherland- MacArthur's Chief of Staff during the war and a personal rival of Willoughby-he counted his "devotion to the 'old man' " and "his quick perception of the General's wishes" as the keys to his success.135 John Gunther, an early biographer of MacArthur, wrote that for Willoughby "MacArthur is the only man in the world [for] whose opinion he cares anything."14 This was evident in the early stage of the war in Korea. Perceiving himself as MacArthur's personal intelligence officer, rather than as a provider of intelligence to the relevant consumers in Washington and on the battlefield, he prevented the transfer of means of collection as well 4 as intelligence information to Gen. Walker, who was defending the Pusan parameter.195 Walker was not part of MacArthur's inner circle; MacArthur did not trust him and considered relieving him of his duty. On top of that, Walker's relations with Willoughby were hostile.196
ojro | The Inchon landing-"the most masterly and audacious strategic course in all history" as praised by Admiral William Halsey -increased the sense of self-assuredness and further decreased openness to opposing views among MacArthur and his inner-circle. The near collapse of the KPA and the speedy re- occupation of South Korea increased MacArthur's confidence and his sureness that victory could be reached by the end of the year. MacArthur and his inner circle even "punished those officers who cast doubt on the invasion's success. " 198 Walker, who knew that he was not getting the necessary engineering equipment to meet his tasks, certainly in comparison to Almond's X Corps, told the JCS: "We have been bastard children." He received a vivid confirmation of his feelings when MacArthur arrived in a liberated Seoul on September 29. The general completely snubbed Walker, who sided with those who had been opposed to
l6t9 | Inchon and warmly greeted Almond, his former chief of staff, who was an enthusiastic supporter of the operation. 200
1ujy | Willoughby, who in early July had admonished the commander of the 24th Division to expedite preparations for the controversial landing operation or be left behind, " was no exception. The fact that his forecasts of only light North Korean resistance proved to be wrong shortly after the successful landing had taken place did not diminish his self-assuredness. Shortly after the invasion, James M. Gavin, an experienced airborne officer visited the Kimpo airfield, the main airbase near Seoul. He found that it had been readied for use by a modern air force and told Willoughby that this most likely indicated a possible Chinese intervention. Willoughby assured him that the Chinese would never cross the Yalu and march into the peninsula. He had his sources. He knew 202

a0by | p. 168 Indeed, by this stage, Willoughby's reports matched the available intelligence information he had. While various sources indicated that the Chinese army had moved large forces to Manchuria, hardly any reliable 4 ones, particularly not Comint, showed that they had made any large-scale crossing of the Yalu. Hence, the estimate that a massive intervention had become militarily too dangerous for the Chinese could constitute a reasonable foundation for MacArthur's commitment to end the war by December. The situation changed in late October when the Chinese offensive created a gap between MacArthur's optimism and the battlefield reality. Within the Bataan Gang, the way to bridge this gap was by adjusting reality to accord with their leader's view. It would be done by providing policymakers in Washington and commanders in the battlefield with intelligence estimates that would support MacArthur's optimism. Willoughby was precisely the man to do it, and the monopoly he held over the intelligence from Korea made this fabrication so effective.
u1ky | That Willoughby falsified intelligence in order to please MacArthur is supported by good evidence from the X Corps and the Eighth Army staff officers. Almond's deputy chief of staff, Colonel William J. McCaffrey, who had served under Almond as the chief of staff of the 92nd Division in WWII, believed that Willoughby "was more interested in staying in MacArthur's good graces than in rendering objective assessment of the available facts" and that this was particularly the case regarding the estimate of the magnitude of the Chinese threat. Almond's G-3, Jack Chiles, remembered: "MacArthur did not want the Chinese to enter the war in Korea. Anything MacArthur wanted, Willoughby produced intelligence for In this case, Willoughby falsified the intelligence reports He should have gone to jail."24 Almond's G-2, Colonel James H. Polk, wrote that "we had the dope but old CAW (Willoughby) bowed to the superior wisdom of his beloved boss and didn't fight him as a good staff officer should."205
