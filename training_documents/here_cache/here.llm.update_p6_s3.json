They need to realize the spread of education from the missionary schools of the New World to the universities of Japan.\ngem8 | Of course, the label \"European imperialism\" does not in any sense represent a systematic movement, a sustained campaign, or a coherent body of thought. Nowhere is this more clear than with the British Empire. Although by the turn of this century the empire encompassed more than one-quarter of the world's people, the British liked to think that it had been acquired over a five-century period in a \"fit of absence of mind,\" as the British historian John Seeley put it in the last century. The empire was made up of a makeshift assortment of Crown colonies, white dominions, mandates, naval bases, trading ports, and the unique Indian raj. To name what was common to all of these arrangements is difficult, and so the term imperialism will have to operate as a loosely conceived historical phenomenon that covers a myriad of ventures directed at extending the dominion of Europe around the globe.\ne8nr | At the risk, then, of lending too much coherence to the forces of European imperialism and of seeming to belittle the violence and injustice that accompanied the exploits of these \"gentlemanly capitalists,\" as they have been characterized, this book focuses on the activities that were conducted in the name of imperialism's intellectual interests, which I take to be its educational project. Beginning in earnest during the eighteenth century, the research and development arm of imperialism was gradually staffed by increasingly professional cadres of geologists, naturalists, astronomers, ethnographers, philosophers, historians, geographers, painters, and poets (many of them holding day jobs as sailors, soldiers, missionaries, and bureaucrats). The whole thing resulted in a Victorian \"obsession with gathering and ordering information,\" as Thomas Richards describes it, that was closely connected to the \"administrative core\" of the British Empire through such educational institutions as the British Museum, the Royal Society, the Royal Geographic Society, the Royal Botanical Gardens, and the India Survey, as well as the universities. It produced an imaginary \"imperial archive,\" in Richards's\nk78w | terms, which amounted to \"a fantasy of knowledge collected in the service of state and empire\" that was thought capable of turning the world into a comprehensive order. It was the duty and pleasure of these learned men and women, as this book will detail, to make the whole of the world coherent for the West by bringing all we knew of it within the imperial order of things. So it was that this order dictated all that future generations were going to learn of the world.\ng9du | Today, that order may seem to be a thing of the past. The great colonial empires collapsed after the Second World War, undone by the politics of self-determination, the cold war, and transnational capitalism. A hundred nations were born, legalized segregation was declared unconstitutional in America, apartheid was finally ended in South Africa, and the Soviet Union was broken up. Transnational capital remains a global force, an imperialism of a different order, that extends beyond the scope of this book, which is taken up with the particular manifestations of the colonial legacy. Yet the West is still dealing directly with the colonial legacy on a number of fronts. Consider Australia, where Aborigines' land claims met with considerable resistance until, only recently, the courts corrected one of colonialism's great myths by conceding that the British had not found a terra nullius, that is, an unoccupied land, when they first arrived. In Canada, the Quebecois and First Nations peoples are each still working on forming postcolonial associations within or apart from the dominion (and are often at odds with each other in this struggle). The First Nations peoples in Canada do not hesitate to speak of a \"colonialism on trial\" in addressing unsettled land claims now before the courts.\nf682 | In America, the legacy persists in a deepening of the \"color line,\" with increasing segregation in schools and discrimination in health care. Bob Herbert writes in the New York Times of \"a besieged black population\" facing restricted voting rights, dimin-\nli1k | WHERE IS HERE?\npbea | ished affirmative action, education, and job training opportunities, and curtailed support for the poor (largely the black poor) in housing, health, and food. For Herbert, the \"increasingly harrowing times\" that face the African American people bear \"the foul legacy of two hundred years of slavery and nearly a century and half of violent and grotesque racism.\" Meanwhile, a rising nativism uses the specter of an \"immigration crisis\" to advocate restrictive legislation for newcomers and a pitting of one minority group against another. \"The Asian invasion\" (and its variations) whether in the New Yorker or in Sports Illustrated, is just one of the racial clich√©s that have returned to prominence. Immigration also preoccupies Europe, with its internal colonization of guest workers facing a rising xenophobia that sustains, for example, the demand for blood citizenship in Germany and talk of a fortress Europe, which, having made so much of the world, now closes its door to it.\nccpt | Beyond the economic and political legacy of the colonial era, the West has also been busy producing a colonial nostalgic that speaks to the lost style and seeming grace of those heady days. The African Queen, A Passage to India, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Indochine are but a few films serving up a fascination with the exotic, with Walt Disney making it a speciality. Disney's Aladdin perpetuates the charmingly despotic Eastern other in a cartoonish orientalism, and The Jungle Book and Pocahontas extend the characterizations of this colorful period. Red Rose tea announces that its company's agents \"comb the backwaters of Ceylon, India, and Africa in search of the most treasured tea leaves\" for \"tea that means the world to you.\" Colonial imagery wafts through the perfume ads for Ralph Lauren's \"Safari,\" and the New York Times spread on \"Indo-Chic,\" with fashions by Chanel and Armani, was shot in Vietnam, one \"of the rare places where one can still experience true glamour. . . . There's something otherworldly about the place.\" For the home, colonial nostalgia-chic can be had from Domain Home Fashions: \"No one went farther to make themselves comfortable than the British,\" its ad explains. \"From the West Indies to East India, their traditional furnishings were enriched by the tropical cultures of the colonies, and now you can reclaim this adventurous and romantic era for yourself. . . . After all, it's your empire.\"",
