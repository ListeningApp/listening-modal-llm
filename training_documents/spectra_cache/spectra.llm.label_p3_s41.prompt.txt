You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

iwn5 | of its implosion. Note that the authors of the papers7a,11,27 were working at the intensity of ultrasound that is higher than the threshold of instability of the bubble surface, i.e., at conditions where the bubble disruption and the detachment of tiny bubbles from the bigger one seem incredible.7a
uooz | The sonoluminescence spectra of hydrocarbons show no emission lines or bands of charged particles,14 which is also in disagreement with the electrical discharge hypotheses.
pxbq | Nevertheless, there are no well-recognized hypotheses about the mechanism of sonoluminescence and sonochemistry, and the debates still continue.4,8e,f,22 To our knowledge, the majority of experimental results can be explained by the thermal hypothesis and its variations. Next we shall try to explain the data obtained in this work with the help of this hypothesis.
jfsr | Sonoluminescence as Blackbody Radiation. SL occurs at the compression of a cavitation bubble just before the minimum of its size is reached.10 The velocity of the bubble wall can exceed 130 m/s11 or even around the speed of sound in the gas.10 The time of SL flash is less than 50 ps, and the number of photons emitted from one flash is around 105.27 The spectra of SL emitted by a single cavitation bubble have a maximum <LATEX>a t \approx 2 3 0 n m . ^ { 6 , 7 }</LATEX> The authors of mentioned papers believe that <LATEX>\mathrm { S L }</LATEX> is a blackbody radiation with temperature =25 0006 or 16 200 K.7 The decrease of bulk solution temperature from 22 to 10 Â°C increases a blackbody temperature to 50 000 K.6
u15r | Suppose that sonoluminescence is the equilibrium thermal radiation at 25 000 K. Let us estimate the number of photons emitted by a single bubble. The SL flash occurs at the bubble radius <LATEX>R _ { S L } \simeq 2 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } c m . ^ { 1 0 }</LATEX> The density of the bubble content at its minimum size should be around liquid density.13 Thus, the number of particles inside the bubble <LATEX>N _ { 0 }</LATEX> at <LATEX>R = R _ { S L }</LATEX> is about <LATEX>N _ { 0 } \simeq 1 0 ^ { 1 2 } .</LATEX> The number of particles <LATEX>N _ { i }</LATEX> with the energy of <LATEX>\epsilon _ { i } \simeq 5 . 4 \epsilon \mathrm { V }</LATEX> <LATEX>\left( 1 = 2 3 0 \quad n m , \right.</LATEX> maximum in the spectra6,7) is, in accordance with the Boltzmann distribution, <LATEX>N _ { i } \simeq N _ { 0 } \exp \left( - \epsilon _ { i } / \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. k T \right) \approx 7 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 0 } .</LATEX> The experimentally determined value of <LATEX>N _ { i }</LATEX> is <LATEX>= 1 0 ^ { 5 , 2 7 } \text { So } ,</LATEX> at equilibrium temperature of 25 000 K the number of photons emitted by one cavitation bubble must be 5 orders larger than the experimental value. For <LATEX>N _ { i }</LATEX> to be equal to the calculated value, temperature inside the bubble has to be around <LATEX>4 0 0 0 - 4 5 0 0 \quad K .</LATEX> However, in this case according to Wein's rule, the maximum in the spectra has to be situated in the region of 725-644 nm. Thus, the temperature inside the bubble cannot be so high (25 000 K or even 50 000 <LATEX>K ^ { 6 } ,</LATEX> and it is probably around the values estimated in refs 28 and 29.
lq35 | The calculations of temperature from the experimental data on the broadening of potassium lines28 or on the rohvibrational distribution of the lines in the <LATEX>C _ { 2 } *</LATEX> band29 gave the values of <LATEX>3 3 6 0 \pm 3 3 0</LATEX> and <LATEX>5 0 7 5 \pm 1 5 6 K ,</LATEX> respectively. The temperature inside the bubble is distributed irregularly: its maximum in the center can be 5-fold higher than average one.30 For example, according to ref 31, the liquid temperature around the bubble does not differ essentially from that in the bulk liquid; however, the temperature on the bubble-liquid frontier from the bubble side can be <LATEX>\approx 1 9 0 0 K</LATEX> and in the bubble center

d09o | At the average temperature inside the bubble of <LATEX>T = 5 0 0 0</LATEX> <LATEX>K ,</LATEX> the number of molecules with <LATEX>\epsilon _ { i } = 1 0 \mathrm { e V }</LATEX> (the energy of the first stable excited state <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathrm { C } } ^ { 1 } \mathrm { B } _ { 1 }</LATEX> of water molecule32), <LATEX>N _ { i } ,</LATEX> is <LATEX>\approx 1 4</LATEX> at <LATEX>T = 8 0 0 0 K N _ { i } \simeq 1 . 7 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 } .</LATEX> The number of molecules with <LATEX>\epsilon _ { i } = 8 . 3 \mathrm { e V }</LATEX> (the energy of <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathrm { B } } ^ { 1 } \mathrm { A } _ { 1 }</LATEX> state32), <LATEX>N _ { i } ,</LATEX> is <LATEX>\approx 1 0 ^ { 3 }</LATEX> at <LATEX>T =</LATEX> 5000 K and <LATEX>N _ { i } \approx 4 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 }</LATEX> at <LATEX>T = 7 0 0 0 \quad K .</LATEX> Thus, the average temperature inside the bubble at the conditions of refs 6 and 7b is, probably, within the 5000-8000 K limits.
ylhz | The time of SL flash is very short, <LATEX>\approx 1 0 ^ { - 1 0 } s ^ { 2 7 }</LATEX> Atoms and molecules can take part in <LATEX>1 0 ^ { 3 }</LATEX> collisions in this time.13 Consequently, the equilibrium can be achieved only for the translational degrees of freedom, partly for dissociation and electronic, rotational, and vibrational transitions. The ionization and ionic recombination processes are far from the equilibrium.13 Probably, more correctly, one should discuss the "effective" temperature inside the bubble.29 Hence, we shall mean the effective temperature inside the bubble in discussing the results obtained in this work.
a3td | The luminescent nature of SL has been repeatedly proved so the supposition that sonoluminescence has to be blackbody radiation needs addition argumentations. Probably, this conclu- sion has been made by the authors of refs 6 and 7 because they did not detect any lines or bands in the spectra. Actually, SL was obtained from the bubble, which contains air gases and water vapors. These spectra are broadened; the band from the excited OH* radical is not prominent13,15 because of the luminescence of the products of the chemical reactions of nitrogen and oxygen atoms and molecules inside the cavitation bubble.2,15
ex5k | The results of recently published papers on the spectra of SL of organic liquids14 are in contradiction with the blackbody mechanism.6 Those spectra show a prominent emission from the excited <LATEX>C _ { 2 } *</LATEX> radical.14 The SL spectra of dodecane were studied in the presence of He, Ne, and Ar and in the mixture of He/Ar. The data showed that the ratio of the intensity of <LATEX>C _ { 2 } *</LATEX> emission to the intensity of a continuum does not depend on the thermal conductivity of the dissolved gas. Besides, no bands or lines were detected in those spectra at wavelengths shorter than 300 nm.14 Thus, one can conclude that the bands at <LATEX>A <</LATEX> 270 nm in the SL spectra of water saturated with noble gases (Figure 1) are not the emission of the heated gas. Otherwise, they must be presented in the spectra of ref 14. Thus, these bands originate from the emission of water molecules or some particles which contain a water molecule (or the product of its dissociation) with the atoms of noble gases. It is very difficult also to explain with the help of the blackbody mechanism of sonoluminescence the very short time of SL flash and the fact that it is over before the minimum size of a bubble is reached.10 Thus, the blackbody mechanism of SL is inconsistent with the experimental results.
9d4o | Interpretation of Spectra. The compression of a cavitation bubble starts slowly, almost isothermally. Vapors are partly condensed, and the evolved heat of condensation is extracted by the thermal conductivity of a liquid. Next, the velocity of a bubble compression increases, and it shrinks almost adiabati- cally with the continuous growth of temperature and pressure. The kinetic energy of particles inside the bubble also increases. It can be converted into the energy of electronic excitation by means of inelastic collisions3,15
