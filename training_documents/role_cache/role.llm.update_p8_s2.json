Relatively high prediction accuracy was obtained as zero point five seven one two and zero point six five eight five for the retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively. The fivefold cross-validation exhibited an average prediction accuracy of zero point five five four one and zero point six zero one eight for flesh firmness and crispness retainability, respectively. In a simulative selection, when flesh firmness retainability genomics-predicted value criterion was set as five point zero months, the selection rate was two point five four percent and the efficiency was one hundred percent, which indicated that the observed phenotype value of all the twelve selected hybrids was equal to or longer than five point zero months. When the genomics-predicted value criterion for flesh crispness retainability was set as five point zero months, the selection rate was three point four eight percent and the efficiency was sixty-four point two nine percent.\n7w7j | Discussion\n51vd | Flesh firmness retainability and crispness retainability are the critical properties affecting fruit cold storability. The heritability of flesh firmness and crispness retainability was as high as eighty-three point eight five percent and eighty-three point six four percent, respectively, which was slightly higher than the estimate seventy percent for firmness and crispness at harvest or after two month cold storage. Flesh firmness and crispness retention can be prolonged if the initial values of firmness and crispness at harvest are high or if the flesh softening rates during storage are low, or both. In this study, unlike flesh firmness and crispness at harvest, the segregation of flesh firmness and crispness retainability did not displayed Gaussian distribution, a large proportion of hybrids lost acceptable flesh firmness and crispness one month post-harvest.\nbaj1 | According to the Q.T.L. effects in tomato, flesh firmness loss was not predicted by firmness at harvest. The phenotype correlations between the initial flesh firmness and crispness and their retainability were also relatively low in this study. In a two-year trial, apple fruit firmness after storage correlated positively with both firmness at harvest and changes in firmness during storage; however, no obvious correlation was observed between changes in firmness and the initial firmness at harvest. A major Q.T.L. for apple fruit firmness retention after storage was identified on chromosome ten; however, a gene encoding E.R.F. was predicted as the candidate rather than the frequently detected Md.P.G. one in other populations, indicating that the genetics of the trait firmness retention might differ from that of initial firmness at harvest. In a Meta.Q.T.L. analysis, of the six Meta.Q.T.L.s for apple fruit texture attributes, two were for both firmness at harvest and firmness after two months cold storage, one for both softening and firmness after two months, and three for solely softening, firmness at harvest, and firmness after two months, respectively. This indicated that these three texture attributes were mutually related but partially independent. High initial flesh firmness or crispness is necessary but insufficient for long-term firmness and crispness retainability. In this study, several new\nn1wo | Quantitative trait loci for flesh firmness and crispness retainability were identified on chromosomes two, eleven, twelve and seventeen, which were previously considered as always having low values for segregating quantitative trait loci on these chromosomes.\n5bq3 | The four functional markers, Md.A.C.S. one, Md.A.C.O. one, Md.P.G. one and an expansin gene, Md.Exp. seven, for fruit firmness and crispness in apple have been well studied to dissect phenotypic variability among cultivars and hybrids. Unfortunately, the empirical predictive power of these four functional markers were limited, with fifteen percent of the observed variation in initial firmness and eighteen percent in softening rate; therefore, their large-scale use for marker-assisted selection was doubtful. The genotypes of commonly used markers on Md.A.C.S. one and Md.A.C.O. one did not segregate in the 'Zisai Pearl' x 'Red\nezla | Fuji' population, which offered opportunity to map more quantitative trait loci. Ethylene production, however, varied with types of firmness and crispness retainability. R.N.A.-seq data showed that the expression levels of Md.A.C.O. one, Md.A.C.O. two, Md.A.C.O. three and some ethylene response genes were higher in flesh firmness and crispness unretainable type one hybrids.\nrsbu | Flesh firmness and crispness are usually measured simultaneously; however, they should be two closely relevant but clearly distinct texture attributes. One evidence for the close relatedness was that the phenotypic correlation coefficient between the flesh firmness retainability and crispness retainability was as high as zero point eight zero two four, which was inconsistent with the previous report. Another evidence was that the overlapping quantitative trait loci on chromosomes three and sixteen associated with flesh firmness and crispness retainability. The third evidence\nmagd | was that variations in Md.E.R.F. three and Md.E.R.F. one one eight affected both flesh firmness and crispness. On the other hand, retainability of flesh firmness was likely a prerequisite for flesh crispness retainability. Additionally, many quantitative trait loci were identified independently for flesh firmness retainability and crispness retainability, which manifested the distinctness of these two flesh texture attributes.",
