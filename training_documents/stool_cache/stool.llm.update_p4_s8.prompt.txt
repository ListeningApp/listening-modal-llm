You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

j30a | Indonesia/Ethiopia, we excluded case reports, non- English and non-human studies, and papers with terms for Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), latent TB, gamma interferon (IFN-y) release assay (IGRA) and tuberculin skin test in titles because of their relevance to TB infec- tion, not active pulmonary TB. Searches were conducted between 19 October 2020 and 26 October 2020. Finally, to inform remaining parameters, we sought opinion from TB experts from each country (authors AB and MG for Ethiopia and NK and RT for Indonesia) in an iterative process using a questionnaire, and remote workshops to explain the model and focus on parameters identified as influential by one-way sensitivity analysis. More details are provided in online supplemental appendix 1 (literature search) and online supplemental appendix 2A (model parameter estimation).
7bdk | Cost parameters and health economic approach
fim0 | We collected costs (reported in 2019 USD) from the healthcare provider's perspective and adjusted histor- ical costs for inflation to 2019 prices using relevant gross domestic product (GDP) deflators.19 We transferred costs from other countries to Ethiopia and Indonesia by applying relevant purchasing power parity conversion factors.20 All costs were assumed to accrue in the present, with no discounting applied.
ojro | We assumed the cost for the initial TB assessment at the PHC was equivalent to the country-specific cost of two outpatient visits (or a single outpatient visit for reas- sessment) to a health centre (health centre with no beds from WHO-CHOICE estimates21). Similar assumptions were used for hospital assessment and reassessment with the corresponding WHO-CHOICE cost estimates.21 The cost of bacteriological investigation in the SOC includes the country specific unit cost of either SSM2223 or Xpert, depending on availability at each level of care, adding the unit costs for collecting two sputum samples for testing with SSM or one sample for testing with Xpert. The unit costs for Xpert were estimated based on country specific data available from the OneHealth Tool (see online supplemental appendix 2B).24 Country-specific unit costs for collecting sputum samples were not available and are based on a study done in adults from South Africa.25 In the intervention, we applied the unit cost for collecting a single stool sample based on estimates provided by the Paediatric Operational Sustainability Expertise Exchange group.20 Treatment cost for diagnosed TB comprises the cost of anti-TB drugs (including pyridoxine), from the Global Drug Facility,27 the costs of follow-up visits (drug pickups or medical review) according to national TB treatment guidelines at the healthcare facilities based on WHO-CHOICE unit cost estimates, and the costs of labo- ratory monitoring in bacteriologically confirmed TB only (see online supplemental appendix 2B (overview of cost parameters)).
l6t9 | We used a disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) frame- work, calculating the life-years saved over a life-time horizon with a discount rate of 3% based on United
1ujy | Nations Population Division country-specific life tables. A simple mean across ages included in the 0-4 and 5-14 year age groups was used, and decrements in health-related quality of life or subsequent survival were not modelled.
qzor | Metrics calculated
a0by | For every 100 children seeking care with presumptive TB in each country, we calculated the deaths, DALYs, costs, referrals, clinical assessments, bacteriological assess- ments, ATTs, percent of true TB receiving ATT, percent of those receiving ATT bacteriologically confirmed, percent of those receiving ATT initiated at PHC, percent of ATT that is false-positive, as well as the change in these quantities under the intervention. We report the incre- mental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). For each country, we produced plots of the cost-effectiveness plane, cost- effectiveness acceptability curve, and expected net benefit, and tornado plots illustrating the one-way sensi- tivity of outcomes to influential model parameters. We also undertook specific scenario analyses: (1) we consid- ered a low TB prevalence scenario (half the base-case prevalence among presumptive TB patients); (2) we considered Xpert as the universally available bacteriolog- ical test instead of sputum-smear microscopy in SOC; (3) we considered discount rates of 0% and 5% for the life- years. The results of these sensitivity analyses are included in online supplemental appendix 3 (additional results). Results are presented following the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards Statement (online supplemental appendix 4).

8hul | RESULTS
87vz | Following our review of the literature, we developed the model parametrisation shown in table 1. The data sources and approach to synthesis for each parameter are described in detail, respectively, in online supplemental appendices 1 and 2A. Country-specific data were used to inform the proportion of children submitting a spon- taneously expectorated sputum sample, the fraction of presumptive TB in children under 5 years, and the level of initial care-seeking at PHC. We used existing systematic reviews for the basis of parameters describing diagnostic test accuracy, our own pooled estimates of true TB prev- alence among presumptive TB, the fraction of TB that is bacteriological confirmable and the fraction of chil- dren able to spontaneously expectorate. Evidence for the accuracy of clinical diagnosis was limited, and published evidence was completely lacking for other parameters around referral and reassessment. Hence, we based these on expert opinion. Unit costs used in the analysis are shown in table 2.
ym66 | The intervention increased the sensitivity to detect true TB by over 10 percentage points in each country and resulted in around a fourfold increase in the propor- tion of patients with TB diagnosed that are bacteriolog- ically confirmed. Specificity showed little change under the intervention (<1% change). In both countries, the proportion of children referred (or self-referred) to higher levels of care after seeking care at PHC level fell by more than twofold. In both countries, the average total number of assessments for children with presumptive TB increased from around 2 per child under SOC to around 2.5 per child with the intervention, and the total number of bacteriological investigations increased more than threefold (table 3).
l0a3 | The relative number of children initiated on ATT increased by 19-25% under the intervention. A larger fraction (~40% relative increase) of children received ATT with the intervention, and more children (~10% point increase) initiated ATT at PHC level (table 3). Restricting to children under 5, we found bigger increases in the number of bacteriological investigations (+30-fold), and the proportion of TB cases diagnosed that are bacteriologically confirmed (+50%). We also found a larger reduction in referrals of children with presump- tive TB to higher levels of care in both countries (almost threefold) (see online supplemental appendix 3 (addi- tional results)).
