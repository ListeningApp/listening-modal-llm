You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

Clinical outcomes included the delta-SOFA score (change in SOFA score based on laboratory studies and vital signs from the 24-hr period prior to the start of the intervention compared to score based on data from the 24-hr period after completion of the intervention), 28-day hospital-free days, 28-day ventilator-free days, acquisition of secondary infections, and 28-day mor- tality. Secondary infections were defined as new pos- itive cultures or new antibiotics started after 48 hours and documentation of a new confirmed infection by the treating clinical team.
uooz | The safety outcomes of interest were vasopressor dose (expressed as norepinephrine-equivalent dose), HR, and respiratory rate.
pxbq | Immunological Testing
jfsr | Immunological testing was performed by laboratory technicians blinded to participant group allocation. Quantification of monocyte HLA-DR was performed according to the Demaret method (43), as previously described (28). Whole blood was incubated with BD Quantibrite anti-HLA-DR/anti-monocyte stain (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA), lysed using RBC Lysis Buffer (BioLegend, San Diego, CA), and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. Samples were acquired on a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson) with a five-color up- grade (CyTech, Fremont, CA). Flow files were acquired and analyzed in CellQuest Pro (Becton-Dickinson). Antibodies bound per cell (AB/c) were calculated by standardizing HLA-DR geomean fluorescent intensity of monocytes to BD Quantibrite-phycoerythrin beads (Becton-Dickinson).
u15r | CD3/CD28-induced IFN-y production was deter- mined using an Enzyme-Linked Immunospot (ELISpot) assay, as previously described (44). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells harvested from whole blood plated at a standardized density, 5×105 cells per well, using the Vi-Cell counter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) in wells coated with biotinylated capture antibody spe- cific to IFN-y. Cells were incubated overnight with Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 media (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) containing anti-CD3/anti-CD28 (BioLegend). IFN-y was detected using a colorimetric reagent kit (Strep-AP and BCIP-NBT; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Images from the ELISpot plates

d09o | (made by MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA; and ac- quired through Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) were analyzed on ImmunoSpot 7.0 plate reader and software (Cellular Technologies Limited, Shaker Heights, OH). The number of spots, representing cells producing IFN- y, and mean spot size were recorded. The means of two identically treated plates run in duplicate were calculated.
ylhz | Sample Size Determination
a3td | To detect a difference in HLA-DR expression of 12,000 AB/c with a power of 80% using a two-sided a = 0.05, a total of 44 sepsis participants (22 patients per arm) were required. The detectable difference in HLA-DR expres- sion was the magnitude of the difference in patients with who did and did not experience an increase in body temperature of 1.5℃ within 24 hours of sepsis diagnosis in our preliminary data (41). Anticipating control group mortality of 20% prior to acquisition of the postintervention blood sample, enrollment of 56 participants was planned.
ex5k | Statistical Analysis
9d4o | Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis re- gardless of whether temperature goals were met in the intervention group. Descriptive statistics are pre- sented as counts, means, and medians, as appropriate. Temperature and care-associated variables were com- pared using t tests, repeated measures analysis of vari- ance (ANOVA), Mann-Whitney U tests, or chi-square tests as appropriate. The primary HLA-DR and sec- ondary serum IFN-y analyses were performed among participants who had nonmissing values for both the baseline and follow-up immune outcomes using re- peated measures ANOVA. Hospital-free days and ven- tilator-free days were compared using nonparametric tests. To ensure that any 28-day mortality difference observed was not attributable to confounding by illness severity, we conducted a post hoc multivariable logistic regression analysis, including predictors of both treat- ment group assignment and enrollment SOFA score. All analyses were conducted in Stata v.16.1 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX).

5esx | We enrolled 56 participants (28 in each arm), with none lost to follow-up (Supplemental Fig. 1,

otkr | The temperature in participants randomized to ther- apeutic warming during the study period was higher than those allocated to usual care (repeated measures ANOVA <LATEX>\left. p < 0 . 0 0 1 \right)</LATEX> (Fig. 1). Twenty-six participants (93%) in the warming group achieved target tempera- ture, with 18 (69%) reaching the target within 6 hours. The median time to target temperature was 3 hours (interquartile range, 2-4hr) in the warming group (Supplemental Table 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/ H32). Ten participants (36%) had warming terminated prior to 48 hours, with the most common reason being extubation during the intervention period <LATEX>\left( n = 5 \right)</LATEX> (Supplemental Table 2, http://links.lww.com/CCM/ H33). Two participants had missing immune bio- marker values, one due to death prior to sample being drawn and one due to misplacement of the sample (these cases were excluded from immune biomarker analysis). Corticosteroid therapy was administered during the ICU stay (after randomization) for nine control participants (32%) and eight intervention par- ticipants (29%).

Persistent lymphopenia was similar between the groups (50% vs 43%; difference, -7%; 95% CI, -33 to 19; Supplemental Table 3, http://links.lww.com/ CCM/H34).
7wn9 | Clinical Outcomes
wcd0 | Participants randomized to therapeutic warming had lower 28-day mortality than those in the control group (18% vs 43%; absolute risk reduction, 25%; 95% CI, -48 to -2; Fig. 3). Post hoc adjustment of the 28-day mortality outcome for enrollment SOFA score revealed similar effect of treatment group allocation (adjusted odds ratio, 0.151; 95% CI, 0.029-0.789). They also had more 28-day hospital-free days (2.6 d; 95% CI, 0-11.6 d). There were no differences between 28-day ventilator-free days or the 48-hour delta-SOFA score. Secondary infec- tions were common (30%), but they were not different between the two groups (Table 2).

We did, how- ever, observe decreased mortality and increased 28-day hospital-free days in the group that under- went therapeutic hyperthermia. These are important observations because they suggest there may be a clinical benefit of this treatment, although the bio- logical mechanism and replicability in a larger trial remain unknown.

ba4l | The risk of hypothermia and the survival benefit of fever in patients with sepsis are well described (2-8, 45). A meta-analysis of observational studies cited a pooled estimate of a 47% mortality in hypothermic patients with sepsis versus 22% mortality in those with fever (6). While the control group mortality in our trial was high, it tracks closely with the mortality observed in prior cohorts of afebrile critically ill sepsis patients (2-5). Perhaps more compelling, participants allocated to therapeutic hyperthermia experienced a mortality that was more closely aligned with expected mortality in fe- brile sepsis patients (2-6). Studies of antipyretic therapy in sepsis have demonstrated little benefit (46, 47). A single trial of external cooling in febrile sepsis patients showed reduced vasopressor doses and lower early mortality in febrile patients cooled to normo- thermia (48), but these findings were not replicated in a subsequent randomized trial (49). The inflammatory cascade, cytokine expression, and transcription factors in febrile sepsis patients are likely different from afe- brile sepsis patients, and having experienced fever may confer benefit to immunocompetent sepsis patients that cannot be undone with cooling.
ffx8 | The mechanism through which therapeutic hyper- thermia may have affected clinical outcomes in this study is unclear. Previous data have demonstrated that, compared to afebrile patients with sepsis, febrile patients had a greater increase in monocyte HLA-DR early after sepsis diagnosis (9), suggesting a lower
