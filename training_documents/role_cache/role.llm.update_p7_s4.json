        "content": "87vz | P is less than point zero five, P is less than point zero one. between the three types of flesh firmness and crispness retainability. As expected, a clear transcriptomic signature of both the flesh firmness type one and the flesh crispness type one hybrids was the two point one eight- to fifty-six point one nine-fold high expression of cell wall degradation-related genes. These genes included MdBGL, MdBGAL, and MdBGLU. On the contrary, the expression of four cell wall-associated genes was significantly higher (two point two six- to nine point one zero-fold difference) in flesh crispness retainable type three and type two hybrids than in crispness unretainable type one hybrids, that is MdPGIP twelve, MdGLCAT fourteen B, MdGWD one, and a cellulolyase gene.\nym66 | Several ethylene-related DEGs were detected between flesh firmness type three or type two and type one hybrids. The expression of MdZAT twelve, MdERF one ten, and MdACO one was zero point zero one- to zero point four eight-fold lower in type two and type three hybrids. Similarly, the expression of MdACO two, MdACO three, MdEIN three and MdERF ninety-eight was significantly low (zero point zero one- to zero point four seven-fold difference) in flesh crispness retainable type three and type two hybrids. A group of ethylene response genes, however, was expressed more actively (two point zero two- to two thousand five hundred fourteen point five five-fold difference) in firmness type three and type two hybrids than that in firmness type one hybrids, such as MdAGL twenty-four, MdACO four, MdACO four-like, and MdALD one.\nl0a3 | High expression (two point nine five- to thirty-seven point one four-fold difference) of some auxin-related genes, MdSAUR seventy-one, MdSAUR forty, and MdARGOS, was observed in flesh firmness type one hybrids. In addition, a group of genes involved in abscisic acid and gibberellic acid synthesis, transport, and response were differentially expressed between hybrid types of flesh firmness or crispness. There were also DEGs detected between flesh firmness type three and type two hybrids, such as jasmonate-related genes. In summary, the above DEGs indicated the cell wall degradation, ethylene biosynthesis and signalling of ethylene, and other phytohormones were involved in flesh firmness and crispness retainability.\nu8nw | To predict candidate genes associated with flesh firmness and crispness retainability from QTL regions, one thousand eight hundred sixty-five and one thousand two hundred seventy-eight genes were downloaded from the intervals of the sixty-two QTLs for flesh\nl2v9 | firmness or crispness retainability, respectively. Then, eighty-seven and fifty-eight genes were selected according to the parental re-sequencing and RNA-seq data. These genes were functionally associated with fruit ripening and senescence. From the QTL regions of F-F zero three point one and C-F zero three point two, and F-Z sixteen point two, two ERF genes, MdERF three and MdERF one eighteen, were predicted as candidate genes for both flesh firmness and crispness retainability. MdERF three and MdERF one eighteen were also DEGs.\nafbe | Validation of candidate genes MdERF three and MdERF one eighteen, and their interaction\n78r8 | An eight-base pair deletion (CTTAACTG) from negative three hundred twenty-three to negative three hundred thirty prior to the ATG codon of MdERF three of 'Red Fuji' was detected and validated using Sanger sequencing. The Del three hundred twenty-three genotypes of 'Red Fuji' and 'Zisai Pearl' were heterozygous Del three hundred twenty-three:del three hundred twenty-three and homologous Del three hundred twenty-three:Del three hundred twenty-three, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis predicted that this deletion might damage the DOF five point three binding motif.\n320g | The expression of MdERF three in 'Red Fuji' and three flesh firmness and crispness retainable hybrids (zero one-zero sixty-seven, eleven-one sixty-nine, and seventeen-one thirty-eight) with Del three hundred twenty-three:del three hundred twenty-three genotype was significantly higher (two point one- to two point nine-fold difference) than that in 'Zisai Pearl' and three flesh firmness and crispness non-retainable hybrids (twelve-one ninety, seventeen-one zero three, and fourteen-one zero seven) with Del three hundred twenty-three:Del three hundred twenty-three genotype during six to eighteen weeks of cold storage.\ntp8g | Beta-Glucuronidase staining of transient transformed tobacco leaves and the relative expres- sion of GUS in MdERFpro-Fdel three hundred twenty-three:GUS and MdERF three pro-Fdel three hundred twenty-three- two:GUS indicated that both the presence of Del three hundred twenty-three from 'Zisai Pearl' and truncating off the corresponding fragment from 'Red Fuji' destroyed the promoter activity of MdERF three. In transgenic apple calli, the relative promoter activity was signifi- cantly lower in MdERF three pro-F:GUS (Del three hundred twenty-three) than in MdERF three pro-F:GUS (del three hundred twenty-three).",
