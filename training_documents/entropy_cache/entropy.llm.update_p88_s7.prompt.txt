You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

0sc2 | Puzzle 46. Say we have a harmonic oscillator with spring constant K. As long as <LATEX>\kappa > 0 ,</LATEX> the energy depends quadratically on 2 degrees of freedom so <LATEX>\langle E \rangle = k T .</LATEX> But when <LATEX>\kappa = 0</LATEX> it depends on just one, and suddenly <LATEX>\langle E \rangle = \frac { 1 } { 2 } k T .</LATEX> How is such a discontinuity possible? In other words: how can a particle care so much about the difference between an arbitrarily small positive spring constant and a spring constant that's exactly zero, making its expected energy twice as much in the first case?
yufa | I'll warn you: this puzzle is deliberately devilish. In a way it's a trick question!
4ggu | PARTICLE IN A BOX: FREE ENERGY
vbg6 | A classical free particle of mass m in a 1d box of length L has partition function
o5y1 | Z = 1 2Tm h\ L h - β
gxus | The free energy of any system is given by F = -- In Z, so B 1
kfy5 | F = - In
eg1f | Using $ = 1/kT and fiddling around a bit, we can rewrite this as
4npi | F= - kT (In L + -InkT + - In - 1 2 n KET + 1 2 2mm h2
q93a | From the partition function of a classical free particle in a one-dimensional box we can also compute its free energy!
gxvi | PARTICLE IN A BOX: ENTROPY
igdg | We've shown that in thermal equilibrium, a classical particle of mass m in a 1-dimensional box of length L has expected energy (E) = kT 1
3u7c | and free energy
cx2c | F = - kT (In L + - In kT + - In 1 2 1 2Tm h2
uoim | But entropy S is always ((E) - F)/T, so
dwsl | S = k ln L + 1 2 InkT + In 1 +1) 2 1
lpnq | Having worked out the expected energy (E) and free energy F for a single classical particle in thermal equilibrium in a 1-dimensional box, it is easy to work out its entropy. We just subtract the free energy from the expected energy and divide by temperature:
c0cp | S : (E) - F T .
vm3e | The formula we get is not very snappy:
ky8f | S = k (In L +5 InkT +;In 1 2Tm h2 + 2) .
gtxr | We will get a better formula later, and ponder its meaning. For now, let's just make these observations:
ehqu | . When we make the length L of the box larger, the entropy becomes larger.
5hiy | · When we increase the temperature T, the entropy becomes larger.
ghiq | · When we increase the mass m of the particle, the entropy becomes larger.
ytlm | The first two facts should feel intuitively obvious. When we increase the box's length, there is more unknown information about the position of the particle in thermal equilibrium. When we increase the particle's temperature, there is more unknown information about its momentum. The third fact is less obvious. When we introduce the concept of 'thermal wavelength', we will see that increasing the particle's mass decreases its thermal wavelength, which in turn increases its entropy in thermal equilibrium.
fg9j | WHERE ARE WE NOW?
wt58 | The mystery: why does each molecule of hydrogen have ~ 23 bits of entropy at standard temperature and pressure?
gcgx | The goal: derive and understand the formula for the entropy of a classical ideal monatomic gas:
xeng | N (In ) V 3 N + - InkT + Y 2
jf2c | including the mysterious constant y.
9qk9 | The subgoal: compute the entropy of a single classical particle in a 1-dimensional box:
mki0 | S = k In L + - InkT + In T +2) 1
din5 | The sub-subgoal: explain entropy from the ground up, and compute the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator:
qc24 | how kT 1 ✓
ktw4 | Let's pause to remember where we are in our game plan. First we computed the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator. Now we've computed the entropy of a single classical particle in a 1-dimensional box. The answer looks a bit like the entropy of an ideal gas! That's no coincidence we're almost there now.
0wr0 | In case you wanted to know the entropy of a particle in a 3-dimensional box, don't worry. It's the same as the entropy of three particles of the same mass in three 1- dimensional boxes of appropriate lengths: the length L, width W and height H of our 3d box. So we can just sum those 3 entropies and get our answer. Since ln L+ln W +ln H = ln V where V is the volume of our 3d box, we get
01xg | S = k InV + InkT + 2In 3 h2 2+ 3).
i6d2 | Later we'll do this calculation more rigorously and more generally for a box of any shape.
lg8p | But you may have another question: what's the meaning of our formula for the entropy of a classical particle in a 1-dimensional box? It's pretty complicated, after all, and we'll need to understand it to have any chance of understanding the mysterious constant y in the formula for a classical ideal monatomic gas.
3fo4 | We can understand our formula better if we delve into a tiny bit of quantum me- chanics, and the concept of 'thermal wavelength'. So let's do that.
bs9g | THE WAVELENGTH OF A PARTICLE
wyx9 | In quantum mechanics particles are waves! A particle with momentum p has wavelength
lmig | h
63vd | 1= p where h is the unreduced Planck's constant, exactly
ihsk | For example, the wavelength of an electron moving at 1 meter/second is about 0.7 millimeters.
yohk | One of the most amazing discoveries of 20th-century physics: particles are waves. The wavelength of a particle is Planck's constant divided by its momentum! This was first realized by Louis de Broglie in his 1924 Ph.D. thesis, so it's called the 'de Broglie wavelength'.
0qgi | Why am I telling you this? Because I want to explain and simplify the formula for the entropy of a particle in a box. Even though I derived it classically, it contains Planck's constant! So, it will become more intuitive if we think a tiny bit about quantum mechanics.
awut | A good explanation of quantum mechanics would require a whole other course. But it's good to know that in quantum mechanics, a particle with a given momentum has a wavelength associated to it: we shouldn't imagine it as having a definite location; it's a bit 'blurry'.
pjzb | This will give a more intuitive explanation for our complicated formula of the entropy of a particle in a 1d box. We'll use this intuition to simplify our formula. That will make it easier to generalize to N particles in a 3d box that is, a classical monatomic ideal gas!
a2ry | THE WAVELENGTH OF A WARM PARTICLE
8zhz | In thermal equilibrium, the average energy of a classical free particle in 3d space is
nokn | (E) = CkT 3
n0c4 | where T is the temperature and k is Boltzmann's constant.
viyb | If the particle has mass m,
dz2n | E= mv2, p=mv = p= V2mE = V3mkT
h9r0 | In quantum mechanics, a particle of momentum p has wavelength X = h/p where h is the unreduced Planck's constant. So, at temperature T, the typical wavelength of a free particle of mass m is roughly
ggnb | V3mkT
w3d0 | Particles are waves! Their wavelength is shorter when their momentum is bigger. And the warmer they are, the bigger their momentum tends to be. So there should be a formula for the typical wavelength of a warm particle. And here it is! It helps us visualize the world: particles are a bit blurry, with a characteristic wavelength that depends on temperature.
