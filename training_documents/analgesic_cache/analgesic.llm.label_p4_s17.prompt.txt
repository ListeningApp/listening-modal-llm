You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

hvhm | The COX-1 activity inhibition was greater at both dipyrone doses than meloxicam from 4 hours on. Even though this in- hibition is similar to that caused by nonselective NSAIDs, dipyrone was not associated with any adverse effects commonly observed with NSAIDs. A multicentric study of humans reported higher gastrointestinal safety with dipyrone than classical NSAIDs (Laporte et al. 1991) and its low acidity may be responsible for the favorable gastrointestinal tolerance (Hinz et al. 2007).
863b | Despite the significant COX-1 inhibition seen in this study, no postoperative bleeding was observed in any cat. In a similar study in dogs, a single dose of dipyrone (25 mg <LATEX>\left. \mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { I V } \right)</LATEX> alone or in combination with meloxicam <LATEX>\left( 0 . 2 \mathrm { m g } \mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { I V } \right)</LATEX> inhibited platelet aggregation for 3 and 5 hours, respectively, with no alterations in thromboelastometry and buccal mucosal bleeding time (Zanuzzo et al. 2015b).
fj24 | The ex vivo evaluation of COX-2 activity inhibition showed that it occurred in all groups, similar to results from studies in other species (Engelhardt et al. 1996a, b; Brideau et al. 2001; Giraudel et al. 2005; Hinz et al. 2007; Pierre et al. 2007). At 0.5 hour, PGE2 concentrations had decreased significantly in all groups, lasting longer (4 hours) in group M.
uz3c | In the present study, both dipyrone doses strongly inhibited both COX isoforms in a nonselective way; COX-1 inhibition was greater and longer lasting than that of COX-2. The COX

Cats were anesthetized with isoflurane and remifentanil constant rate infusion for the surgical procedure, and for recovery were administered dipyrone (25 mg kg every 24 hours; group D25); dipyrone (12.5 mg kg every 12 hours; group D12.5); or meloxicam (0.1 mg kg every 24 hours; group M), intravenously.

ba4l | selectivity ratio was not calculated because ex vivo assays cannot be used for these estimates (Duz et al. 2015). Hinz et al. (2007) observed that 4-methylamino antipyrine, an active metabolite of dipyrone, led to a substantial COX inhibition of both isoforms equally.
ffx8 | Meloxicam also inhibited both COX isoenzymes, however inhibition of COX-1 by meloxicam was less intense than from dipyrone, whereas COX-2 inhibition was longer lasting. Pre- vious studies, including assays of canine and feline whole blood after administration of meloxicam, identified only a slight COX-2 selectivity (COX-1:COX-2 ratio of 10 and 3.5, respectively) (Brideau et al. 2001; Giraudel et al. 2005). Blood collected from 10 cats revealed that meloxicam inhibited COX-1 by at least 20% at minimal plasma concen- trations and exceeded 40% at therapeutic plasma concen- trations (Giraudel et al. 2005). These results are similar to those in the present study.
s6su | Despite the nonselective COX-2 inhibition, the drugs and dosages administered in the present study resulted in no adverse effects or alterations in laboratory tests (CBC and serum chemistry) throughout the evaluation period. In group M, serum SDMA concentrations decreased at 24 hours compared with 7 days before and 7 days after anesthesia. In group D25, they were significantly lower at 24 hours compared with 7 days postoperatively. However, the changes showed a similar pattern in all groups, and the values did not exceed the feline normal reference interval (0-14 µg dL-1). These results suggest that glomerular filtration rate increased after the surgical procedure, probably influenced by intra- operative fluid therapy. There were no differences among

xags | Pain is a vital sign that has a complex pathophysiology. Sensitization of nociceptors or hyperalgesia is a common finding in inflammatory pain and is a consequence of the ac- tion of inflammatory mediators such as PGE2. These mediators lower the threshold of excitability of receptors, facilitating the activity of notoriously painful substances, such as histamine and bradykinin (Zhang et al. 1997). NSAIDs, such as melox- icam, have a proven analgesic potential related to COX inhi- bition, decreasing the production of PGE2 in cats (Giraudel et al. 2005).
jc47 | Although dipyrone is not a new drug, the mechanism of action is complex and not yet completely understood. Based on studies in other species, it was hypothesized that effects of dipyrone depend at least partially on COX inhibition and consequently on the reduction in PGE2 synthesis peripherally (Abbate et al. 1990; Hinz et al. 2007). Our findings corrob- orate these data; however, it is likely that dipyrone also pro- duces analgesia through other mechanisms in cats. Chandrasekharan et al. (2002) reported the existence of a splicing variant of COX-1, referred to as COX-3, and suggested that dipyrone selectively inhibits this enzyme. However, that in vitro study used constructs of canine COX-3 and murine COX-1 and -2 with disparate activity levels, leading to un- certainties and controversies (Hinz et al. 2007). In addition, there is no evidence regarding the presence, physiological role and dipyrone selectivity for COX-3 in the feline species.

5zyf | ovariohysterectomy postoperative pain. Although mono- therapy with dipyrone or an NSAID is indicated for mild pain only (WHO 1987), an experienced surgeon performing ovar- iohysterectomy in young animals with an ideal body condition score may produce less surgical trauma and thus mild pain, corroborating the findings of previous studies (Imagawa et al. 2011; Zanuzzo et al. 2015a; Pereira et al. 2018).
9own | To find the lowest effective analgesic dose yielding the least adverse effects, a low dose (12.5 mg kg 1) was tested and compared with the commonly used dose for dogs and cats. There were no significant differences among groups regarding the need for rescue analgesia (40%, 20% and 20% in D25, D12.5 and M, respectively), similar to a study in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy administered either dipyr- one, meloxicam or a combination of these drugs (Zanuzzo et al. 2015a). The administration of tramadol as rescue

mn1r | The four subjective pain scales were used to measure post- operative pain more precisely and to analyze correlations among them. All cats requiring rescue analgesia were assigned scores above the cut-off value for rescue in all scales and a moderate (VAS x MCPS) to very strong (VAS × CSU-FAPS) correlation among them was found. A strong association be- tween validated scales, MCPS and CMPS-FS scores (p < 0.0001), was observed, corroborating the findings of Steagall et al. (2018). However, only VAS displayed a significant dif- ference between baseline and 4 hours, when two cats in group D12.5 needed rescue analgesia.
