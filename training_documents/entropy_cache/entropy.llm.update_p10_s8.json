        "content": "iphf | To understand something deeply, it can be good to set yourself a concrete goal. To avoid getting lost in the theory of entropy, let's try to understand the entropy of hydrogen gas. This is a 'diatomic' gas since a hydrogen molecule has two atoms. At standard temperature and pressure it's close to 'ideal', meaning the molecules don't interact much. It's also close to 'classical', meaning we don't need to know quantum mechanics to do this calculation. Also, when the hydrogen is not extremely hot, its molecules don't vibrate much—but they do tumble around.\njdf8 | Given all this, we can derive a formula for the entropy S of some hydrogen gas as a function of its temperature T, the number N of molecules, the volume V, and a physical constant k called 'Boltzmann's constant'. This formula also involves a rather surprising constant which I'm calling y. We'll figure that out too. It's so weird I don't want to give it away!\n59yt | As a warmup, we will derive the formula for the entropy of an ideal 'monatomic' gas a gas made of individual atoms, like helium or neon or argon. Sackur and Tetrode worked this out in nineteen twelve. Their result, called the Sackur-Tetrode equation, is similar to the one for a diatomic gas.\ne2hn | But before doing a monatomic gas, we'll figure out the entropy of a single atom of gas in a box. That turns out to be a good start, since in an ideal monatomic gas the atoms don't interact, and the entropy of N atoms—as we'll see is just N times the entropy of a single atom.\ngojw | But before we can do any of this, we need to understand what entropy is, and how to compute it. It will take quite a bit of time to compute the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator! But from then on, the rest is surprisingly quick.\nf57y | Five kinds of entropy\njlv5 | Entropy in thermodynamics: the change in entropy as we change a system's internal energy by an infinitesimal amount dE while keeping it in thermal equilibrium is dS equals dE divided by T, where T is the temperature.\nzw42 | Entropy in classical statistical mechanics: S equals negative k integral of P of x l n of P of x du of x where P is a probability distribution on the measure space (X, u) of states and k is Boltzmann's constant.\nzgr4 | Entropy in quantum statistical mechanics: S equals negative k trace of P l n of P where P is a density matrix.\nocdz | Entropy in information theory: H equals negative summation of P sub i log P sub i where P is a probability distribution on the set X.\n0ii3 | Algorithmic entropy: the entropy of a string of symbols is the length of the shortest computer program that prints it out.\n2gqg | Before I actually start explaining entropy, a warning: it can be hard at first to learn about entropy because there are many kinds—and people often don't say which kind they're talking about. Here are five kinds. Luckily, they are closely related!\ni4a8 | In thermodynamics we primarily have a formula for the change in entropy: if you change the internal energy of a system by an infinitesimal amount dE while keeping it in thermal equilibrium, the infinitesimal change in entropy is dS equals dE divided by T where T is the temperature.\nfupn | Later, in classical statistical mechanics, Gibbs explained entropy in terms of a probability distribution P on the space of states of a classical system. In this framework, entropy is the integral of negative P l n P times a constant k called Boltzmann's constant.\n8yo3 | Later von Neumann generalized Gibbs' formula for entropy from classical to quantum statistical mechanics! He replaced the probability distribution P by a so-called density matrix P, and the integral by a trace.\nlm4p | Later Shannon invented information theory, and a formula for the entropy of a probability distribution on a set (often a finite set). This is often called 'Shannon entropy'. It's just a special case of Gibbs' formula for entropy in classical statistical mechanics, but without the Boltzmann's constant.\nmpm5 | Later still, Kolmogorov invented a formula for the entropy of a specific string of symbols. It's just the length of the shortest program, written in bits, that prints out this string. It depends on the computer language, but not too much.\nstwt | There's a network of results connecting all these five concepts of entropy. I will first explain Shannon entropy, then entropy in classical statistical mechanics, and then entropy in thermodynamics. While this is the reverse of the historical order, it's the easiest way to go.\npcec | I will not explain entropy in quantum statistical mechanics: for that I would feel compelled to teach you quantum mechanics first. Nor will I explain algorithmic entropy.\njqe8 | From probability to information\nurkt | How much information do you get when you learn an event of probability P has happened? It's\n0dx9 | negative log P where we can use any base for the logarithm, usually E or two.",
