There are several assumptions that need to be made including the anticipated true values which of course cannot be known.\nl0a3 | Five point two. More general formula for any combination of significance and power.\nu8nw | The formula given for the comparison for two proportions is based on a type one error of alpha equals zero point zero five (equating to a significance level of five percent) and a type two error of beta equals zero point one (equating to ninety percent power). However, a more general formula for different values of alpha and beta is needed.\nl2v9 | A more general formula is as follows:\nafbe | where F(alpha, beta) is a function of alpha and beta. The table below provides the value of F(alpha, beta) for different values of alpha and beta.\n78r8 | Note that the value of F(alpha, beta) can be calculated for any level of alpha and beta and this is given by the formula below (you will need to understand what Z one minus alpha over two and Z one minus beta represent: the z-distribution has a mean of zero with a standard deviation of one).\n320g | F(alpha, beta) equals (Z one minus alpha over two plus Z one minus beta) squared. For example, for alpha equals zero point zero five and beta equals zero point one: F(alpha, beta) equals (one point nine six plus one point two eight) squared equals ten point five. For example, for alpha equals zero point zero five and\ntp8g | beta equals zero point two: F(alpha, beta) equals (one point nine six plus zero point eight four) squared equals seven point eight five. Six. Impact of choice of scientific criteria on sample size.\ngxfd | The key factors required in order to calculate the required sample size and needed for a trial comparing two percentages have been introduced. Assuming the primary outcome variable has been identified these are (one) the expected percentage or risk in the control arm, (two) the smallest clinically important difference that needs detecting, (three) the level of significance, and (four) the power to detect the difference specified in (two) if such a true difference exists.\ns2v1 | While a set significance (usually five percent) and power (usually ninety percent or eighty percent) can be specified, perhaps the most important assumptions that need to be considered are for the unknown underlying risk in the control group and the smallest clinically important decision that needed to be detected.\njkp9 | Some flexibility is usually needed in assessing sample size requirements and it is a useful exercise to calculate the numbers needed for several different scenarios. In this section the impact of altering each of the four criteria given above on the sample size for comparing two percentages will be demonstrated using the UK PACE trial. Note that previous calculations showed one thousand nine hundred twenty-six patients were required based on the following criteria:\nz8tt | Expected mortality in the single chamber arm (pi one) equals twenty-four percent. Expected mortality in the dual chamber arm (pi two) equals eighteen percent (i.e. one quarter reduction) alpha equals zero point zero five, beta equals zero point one (power equals ninety percent) i.e.\n9g22 | F(alpha, beta) equals ten point five. (one) Impact of reducing the difference to detect.\n41fx | Suppose one quarter reduction is considered unrealistically high and decide an absolute difference of three percent from twenty-four percent would be clinically important to detect (i.e. pi one minus pi two equals three percent). The total sample size required is eight thousand one hundred twenty-eight. Halving the absolute difference to detect for a given expected percentage outcome in the control arm resulted in more than quadrupling the sample size.\n7um8 | (two) Impact of overestimating the event rate in each group.\nuow2 | Suppose the true mortality is half that expected in both groups i.e. pi one equals twelve percent, pi two equals nine percent. Note that this is still a one quarter reduction in mortality. The total sample size required is four thousand three hundred seventy-six, more than double the initial estimate.\niat7 | Note however that this assumes the relative effect remains the same i.e. a quarter reduction. For a given absolute difference to detect, the total number decreases as the event rate decreases (for event rates below fifty percent). For example, suppose it is required to detect a difference of twelve percent versus six percent, then the total sample size would be nine hundred forty-six, but this represents a halving in mortality.\nywwr | (three) Impact of reducing the significance level (i.e. reducing risk of a type one error).\n0i6j | Suppose more stringent evidence for a treatment difference is required and the level of significance is set to be one percent i.e. require P less than point zero one to claim a treatment difference. F(alpha, beta) now becomes fourteen point nine, and the total sample size needs to be increased to two thousand seven hundred thirty-two.\n87cq | (four) Impact of increasing the power (i.e. the risk of a type two error).\n0qs3 | Suppose it is required for the study to give more chance of finding a treatment difference and ninety-five percent power is used. F(alpha, beta) now becomes thirteen point zero, and the total sample size needs to be increased to two thousand three hundred eighty-four.\nz8f7 | In practice, these calculations are usually done using computer packages, such as Stata, R or Epi-Info. The number of patients which different packages arrive at may differ slightly from those above as slightly different approximations are used.\n7w7j | In deciding upon the required size of a trial, the numbers are often disappointingly large in respect of investigators' expectations and available patients. For example, reducing the absolute required difference to detect by half meant increasing the sample size more than fourfold.\n51vd | Sample sizes entail some judgement, and some compromise between using stringent statistical criteria and what can practically be achieved is required. However, the choices to be made need to be realistic.\nbaj1 | Comparing two means\nn1wo | In some clinical trials, the primary endpoint is a continuous outcome, e.g. kidney functioning as measured by glomerular filtration rate or systolic blood pressure, rather than the occurrence of some binary event, e.g. mortality. The principles behind calculating the required sample size when the outcome is a comparison of two means are the same as when comparing two percentages.\n5bq3 | Seven point one.
