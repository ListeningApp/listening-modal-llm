You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ib53 | In our earlier work on the Third Law, we only studied systems with finitely many states. Later we saw how to compute entropy from the free energy and expected energy. This makes it a bit easier to handle systems with a countable infinity of states. In the following puzzles, which are only for the most devoted readers, let's use these ideas to prove and improve the Third Law for systems with countably many states.
0kr1 | Earlier we worked with temperature, but it's cooler to use coolness. For all the following puzzles, let's suppose we have a system with a countable infinity of states n =1,2, 3, ... with energies En. Also suppose thermal equilibrium is possible for some Bo > 0, i.e., the sum
58mo | Z (Bo) = Lexp(-BoEn) n=1 00
1ghh | converges. (Our arguments also apply to systems with finitely many states, where this convergence condition is automatic.)
643d | Èn = En + c
58a9 | we get a new 'shifted' system whose partition function, expected energy, free energy and entropy are related to those of our original system by
hjlr | Ž = exp(-ßc)Z, (Ē) = (E) + c, F = F + c, Š = S
0k3o | for all B > Bo.
a1r1 | Now further suppose that our original system has just one state of least energy. Earlier we saw that we could reindex the states so that E1 < E2 ≤ E3 ≤ . . . and En -> +00. The same is true of our new shifted system, and let's choose c = - E1 so that the lowest energy of the shifted system is zero. With this shift we have
bou6 | 0 = Ễ1 < Ě2 < 3 <...
s7uq | and En -> +00.
l11a | <LATEX>\widetilde { Z } \left( \beta \right) - 1 = \sum _ { n = 2 } ^ { \infty } e ^ { - \beta \widetilde { E } _ { n } } .</LATEX> Using this equation show
llit | <LATEX>| \widetilde { Z } \left( \beta \right) - 1 | \leq e ^ { - \left( \beta - \beta _ { 0 } \right) \widetilde { E } _ { 2 } } | \widetilde { Z } \left( \beta _ { 0 } \right) - 1 |</LATEX> and thus
mf1f | <LATEX>| \widetilde { Z } \left( \beta \right) - 1 | < \mathrm { c o n s t } e ^ { - \left( \beta - \beta _ { 0 } \right) \widetilde { E } _ { 2 } }</LATEX> for some constant independent of <LATEX>\beta .</LATEX> Use the fact that <LATEX>\widetilde { F } \left( \beta \right) = - \frac { 1 } { \beta } \ln \widetilde { Z } \left( \beta \right)</LATEX> to show that for large enough
m61m | <LATEX>\beta ,</LATEX> <LATEX>| \widetilde { F } \left( \beta \right) | < \mathrm { c o n s t } e ^ { - \left( \beta - \beta _ { 0 } \right) \widetilde { E } _ { 2 } }</LATEX> possibly for a different constant independent of <LATEX>\beta .</LATEX> Using Puzzle 57, conclude that
pnz9 | <LATEX>| F \left( \beta \right) - E _ { 1 } | < \mathrm { c o n s t } e ^ { - \left( \beta - \beta _ { 0 } \right) \left( E _ { 2 } - E _ { 1 } \right) } .</LATEX> Voilà! This shows that for a system with countably many states and just one state of lowest energy, if thermal equilibrium is possible at some positive temperature, then the free energy must approach this lowest energy exponentially fast as <LATEX>\beta \rightarrow + \infty .</LATEX> Now let's show something similar for the expected energy. Again we use the shifted system to simplify the calculations. I'll leave more work to you this time.
1abn | <LATEX>\frac { d } { d \beta } \widetilde { Z } \left( \beta \right) = - \sum _ { n = 2 } \widetilde { E } _ { n } e ^ { - \beta \widetilde { E } _ { n } } .</LATEX> Use this to show that <LATEX>\frac { d } { d \beta } \widetilde { Z } \left( \beta \right)</LATEX> goes to zero exponentially fast as <LATEX>\beta \rightarrow + \infty .</LATEX> Using
8un4 | the expected value of E tilde as a function of beta equals negative the partial derivative with respect to beta of the natural logarithm of Z as a function of beta equals negative one over Z as a function of beta times the partial derivative with respect to beta of Z as a function of beta and Puzzle fifty-eight, show that the expected value of E tilde as a function of beta goes to zero exponentially fast as beta approaches positive infinity. Using Puzzle fifty-seven, conclude that the expected value of E as a function of beta approaches E sub one exponentially fast as beta approaches positive infinity. Finally, since
s0ti | S equals k times beta times the quantity F minus the expected value of E and both F and the expected value of E approach E sub one exponentially fast as beta approaches positive infinity, conclude that S approaches zero exponentially fast as
