You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

d0ik | We elucidate the appearance and robustness of quantum skyrmion lattices as a function of the external magnetic field, the strength of DMI, and perturbations of the form Eq. (2) due to uniaxial anisotropy. For this calculation, we have concen- trated on a triangular lattice with disk boundary conditions of diameter L = 9 sites, for which we obtain a single centered skyrmion for B = J = - 0.5D in the unperturbed case K = 0 [see Fig. 2(e)]. We relax the fine-tuned parameter lines of Fig. 2 by variations of B, J, and consider nonzero uniaxial anisotropies for J < 0 by varying K.
0x0s | Based on our simulations, we predict the existence of at least three distinct quantum phases of our model: (i) a region hosting HS states for weak field amplitudes, (ii) a valley for field strengths of the order of B ~ - 0.5D, which features a lattice formed by quantum skyrmions of radius r ~ 3a (SKX3a), and (iii) an FP phase where spins align parallel to the external field.
4exe | Helical spin spiral states are characterized by a vanishing average polarization m2, whereas field-polarized states are maximally polarized (up to finite-size effects). As shown in Fig. 2, quantum skyrmions are embedded in a background of field-polarized spins, and as a consequence, the state in the skyrmion lattice phase will have a finite polarization smaller than a corresponding field-polarized state. We numerically confirm this intuitive picture and find disjoint intervals of average polarization mz uniquely linked to each phase [see Fig. 4(a)], which can be summarized in the zero-temperature phase diagram presented in Fig. 9. Note that Fig. 9 is obtained by simulations of a fixed flake system size and is therefore only qualitatively correct in the thermodynamic limit. Further- more, the interplay between system size and skyrmion length scale might lead to incommensurate phases which will be the subject of future work. In order to determine the exact position of quantum critical points or the nature of the quantum phase transition, a finite size extrapolation is necessary, a study which we leave for future work.
0myz | Our results about the dependence of the skyrmion phase on the uniaxial anisotropy are in qualitative agreement with cor- responding classical systems, where it is known that a weak uniaxial anisotropy tends to stabilize skyrmion configurations at smaller magnetic fields [14,60]. Furthermore, we observe that the skyrmion radius increases with -J/D, such that quite large spin-1/2 systems might be needed to resolve even in- dividual quantum skyrmions. Based on our results for J = -0.5D we conjecture that the skyrmion lattice phase should also exist for such cases where the individual quasiparticles have a larger radius, but due to limitations dictated by the nu- merical complexity (which we discuss in Appendix A), other numerical techniques must be consulted to make quantitative predictions about the phase diagram for -J/D >> 0.5. Similar values of the exchange coupling are expected in present thin film experiments [61], thereby making our results of practical relevance.
xh3i | Besides the ferromagnetic SKX3a phase, which is the fo- cus of this work, we find signatures of a quantum skyrmion lattice phase in the absence of exchange coupling and even for antiferromagnetic couplings J ≤ 0. However, because of the significantly enhanced entanglement [see Fig. 9(c)], the MPS ansatz for this phase requires an exponential scaling of the bond dimension with the system size, and

lvae | VII. SUMMARY
o9sc | We have demonstrated that the ground state of the two- dimensional ferromagnetic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model in the presence of DMI hosts quantum skyrmions at intermediate magnetic fields B ~ J = - D/2. The resulting magnetic tex- tures are characterized by a central spin pointing opposite to the direction of the applied magnetic field and winds radially outwards toward the field-polarized environment, similar to a classical Néel skyrmion. For periodic boundary conditions and in the thermodynamic limit, we expect the ground state of the skyrmion lattice phase to be degenerate, scaling with the area of the individual skyrmion quasiparticles, such that the bulk of a system with open boundary conditions corresponds to a spontaneously symmetry broken state. The existence of quantum skyrmions yields experimental signatures in the position-dependent magnetization, the average polarization, and the structure factor, and we showed that these observables allow a distinction between a spin spiral phase at small mag- netic fields, a skyrmion phase at intermediate magnetic fields, and a field-polarized phase at large magnetic fields.
121u | While the spin texture is reminiscent of classical skyrmions, we should point out that in the present case, the skyrmion phase arises as a quantum ground state at zero tem- perature with open boundary conditions. In contrast, classical skyrmions typically occur at finite temperatures and result from a minimization of the free energy. Moreover, our exam- ination of the resulting quantum state using the entanglement entropy and the concurrence has revealed that the quantum skyrmion state features significant entanglement shared be- tween spin pairs of the skyrmion boundary. We argued that the quantum and classical states can be distinguished by the norm of the polarization | (Sr) | ≤ 1/2 (conserved for classi- cal states) and by corrected correlation functions (vanishing for classical states). We therefore conclude that a semiclassi- cal treatment of the quantum skyrmion based on a classical magnetic texture would not necessarily capture the internal degrees of freedom of a quantum skyrmion.
zh03 | Towards larger system sizes, we found that the quan- tum skyrmion phase is characterized by a regular lattice of skyrmions. As the size of individual skyrmions is determined by the system parameters B, J, D, and K, a regular lattice requires commensurability between the lattice size and the skyrmion size. While our numerical simulations cannot reach the limit of infinite system size, our results allow us to extrap- olate that the ground state in the thermodynamic limit features a dense packing of quantum skyrmion textures. Each of these quantum skyrmions has entanglement localized near its do- main wall, but the entanglement between different skyrmions is small, which suggests that they can be approximated as individual quasiparticles.
1mvw | We expect that our results may guide the develop- ment of an effective analytical field theory of the quantum skyrmion phase. Based on our experience, we conclude that variational tensor networks provide a suitable numeri- cal technique to study these systems. This is not surprising for gapped quantum phases with short-range interactions and bounded entanglement. Nevertheless, using MPS for a two-dimensional system is not without pitfalls, as the necessary mapping on a one-dimensional system causes non- local interactions. We have made sure that our results have fully converged for lattice sizes corresponding to individual skyrmions. However, we have seen that the numerical errors grow for the system sizes required for 4 x 4 skyrmion lattices (29 x 29 spin-1/2 in total). For such large systems, we expect our results to be only qualitatively correct.
