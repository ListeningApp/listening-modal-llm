You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

2e62 | DNA methylation in the mammalian germline undergoes two reprogramming events, in which existing DNA methylation is largely eliminated (reviewed in [29]). In mouse zygotes, maternal and paternal genomes show two distinct demethylation patterns upon staining with a 5mC-recognizing antibody. The paternal genome rapidly loses 5mC signal (6-8 hours after fertilization) while the maternal genome gradually reduces methylation dur- ing cleavage-stage development [30,31]. The overall loss of DNA methylation is associated with reduction of repressive chromatin. The molecular mechanism of 5mC loss entails oxidation into 5- hydroxymethyl cytosine (5hmC) by TET dioxygenase and base excision repair (reviewed in [32]). Active paternal DNA demethy- lation in the zygote is found in many mammals, but is not entirely conserved [33-35] and is incomplete [36]. Apart from imprinted loci, which retain their parent-of-origin methylation pattern in imprinting control regions, intracisternal A-particle (IAP), an active murine endogenous retrovirus also remains methylated despite global demethylation [37].
75y3 | Histone modifications offer a system for recording additional information concerning the histone-associated DNA. Functionality of key histone modifications is more conserved across eukaryotic kingdoms than DNA methylation (reviewed in [28]). The "histone code" has many roles including regulation of transcription and DNA repair (reviewed in [38,39]). Importantly, some histone marks are generated because of a specific event (e.g. transcription, DNA dam- age), but are not maintained and do not constitute a true epigenetic mark per se.
s2g2 | A detailed catalogue of histone modification dynamics during OET has been provided elsewhere [18,40]. A growing number of chromatin factors has been implicated in establishing the correct epigenetic landscape, including polycomb-mediated gene silencing [41] or histone demethylase KDM1A associated with gene activa- tion or repression in a context-dependent manner [42,43]. Recent advances in analysis of global chromatin architecture allowed also for exploring genome-wide distribution of histone marks, chro- matin accessibility and global chromatin architecture during early development [44-47].
q1q2 | A notable feature of chromatin remodeling during OET is reduc- tion of parental heterochromatin prior to ZGA. As mentioned above, most paternal histone modifications, including heterochromatin marks, are almost completely erased during spermatogenesis. Maternal heterochromatin histone marks are also reduced after fertilization in mice. H4K20me3 and H3K64me3 are rapidly lost by the 2-cell stage [48,49] and H3K9me3 is reduced in pericen- tric heterochromatin up to the 8-cell stage [41]. These patterns suggest that removal of parental heterochromatin marks is part of the reprogramming process that results in totipotent blastomeres. The pattern is also consistent with the open chromatin structure observed during early development [50,51 ] and reminiscent of the chromatin structure observed in pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESC) [50,52].
cb7r | Spatially distinct genome organization was observed using a single-nucleus, high-resolution chromosome conformation cap- ture (Hi-C) in paternal and female pronuclei during mouse OET [47]. Notably, the maternal genome was not segregated into active and inactive compartments (possibly due to inactive transcription in the extended G1 phase) suggesting that its compartmentalization in zygotes is established de novo. In contrast, there was weak, but significant, compartmentalization of the paternal genome which was either rapidly established de novo or inherited from sperm chromatin [47].
68xu | 5. The onset of ZGA in mouse zygotes - the minor ZGA
hd35 | Mice have the earliest known onset of ZGA among mammals with new RNA transcripts detected in mouse zygotes as early as ~7 h after pronucleus formation [53-55] (Fig. A); a more sensi- tive analysis could possibly detect transcription even earlier. Male pronuclei produce more RNA than female pronuclei [53]. The dif- ference historically has been ascribed to the chromatin remodeling in the male pronucleus that is associated with protamine/histone exchange [56]. This remodeling could provide an opportunity for maternal transcription factors to associate preferentially with the male pronuclear DNA [53].
2zpk | The nature of the initial transcription (minor ZGA) at the 1-cell stage has been unclear. Promiscuous or random transcription is supported by the observations that in 1-cell mouse embryos, repet- itive elements such as B2-containing sequences [57] or MuERV-L [58] are expressed. In addition, plasmid-borne reporter gene expression does not require an enhancer for robust expression in 1-cell embryos, whereas an enhancer is required for robust expression in 2-cell embryos [59]. However, apart from detection of MuERV-L retrotransposon transcripts at the late 1-cell stage [58], RNAs produced during minor ZGA could not be detected by microarrays [60,61]. Thus, either minor ZGA did not produce mRNAs or their abundance was too low to be detected by these technologies.
epu7 | NGS analysis of polyA RNA, which can detect low-abundant and unannotated transcripts, documented hundreds of potential minor ZGA mRNAs [15,62,63]. However, whether these mRNAs reflected transcription or de novo polyadenylation that occurs in fertilized eggs [64] was unclear. This issue could be avoided by using total RNA for NGS. Indeed, comparison of published total RNA and polyA RNA NGS data in oocytes and early embryos indi- cates that polyadenylation of maternal mRNAs could be confused with transcriptional activation (Fig. B). Two NGS studies of total RNA addressed the nature of transcripts produced during the minor wave of ZGA [63,65]. One sequenced total RNA (depleted of ribosomal RNA) and identified ~600 genes whose expression was up-regulated >1.5 fold between oocyte and 1-cell stage. The other sequenced total RNA and observed transcription within ~4000 genes. Altogether, NGS data document that the first wave of
7od1 | zygotic transcription is relatively promiscuous, low-level, genome- wide, and produces transcripts that are inefficiently spliced and polyadenylated [63,65].
0bqy | Low level, genome-wide transcription that is both inter- and intragenic implies that transcription in 1-cell zygotes only requires minimal promoter features [66]. However, minor ZGA transcrip- tion exhibits some selectivity in that oocyte-specific genes are not transcribed. It has been proposed that minor ZGA could be "primed" by the sperm because >300 minor ZGA transcripts are also expressed in sperm, but not in parthenogenetic embryos [63]. However, only a few highly expressed testis-specific genes are detected during minor ZGA and bioinformatic analysis shows that transcription of many genes, known to be expressed during major ZGA, already can be detected during minor ZGA [65]. This implies that transcription factors controlling gene expression specifically during oocyte's growth phase are replaced by the 1-cell stage with transcription factors controlling embryonic genome activa- tion. Elimination of maternal factors (as documented, for example, for NOBOX [67]) would explain the lack of expression of maternal transcripts and expression of major ZGA genes. The promiscuous transcription would then reflect increased accessibility of poten- tial (cryptic) promoters to the available transcription factors. As chromatin structures further matures, this accessibility would be lost and the cryptic promoters would not be engaged.
