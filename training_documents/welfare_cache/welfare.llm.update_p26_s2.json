        "content": "1k9e | Our study also raises some further questions for future research. For example, in twenty fifteen, well after the crisis of two thousand eight, a reform followed in both countries with a \"revival\" of NPG ideas and a focus on decentralization. This raises the question of whether NPG-type reforms are contingent on relatively favourable economic conditions? Another fundamental issue is how different NPG reforms actually are from TPA and NPM? As Lapuente and Van der Walle argued: \"Post-NPM represents a reassertion of old public administration values as well as an attempt to remedy some of the disintegrating tendencies associated with NPM, and not an abandonment of NPM reforms.\" Other scholars have theoretically questioned if the models are internally consistent: NPM has at least two faces: market and management; and also NPG would have many meanings. However, we have shown in this paper that despite internal variety, the NPM and NPG models can be used to uncover convergence and divergence in reform characteristics and their impact on welfare administrations over time.",
