You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

fcco | Our core contention is that strong upgrading coalitions have not emerged in today's MI countries. Owing to the ways these countries grew into MI status-by their reliance on various combinations of cheap labor, foreign investment, and commodity exports-the economic elites and workers in MI countries have different compositions, cleavages, and underlying interests than did those in the earlier industrializers.35 In- deed, we are aware of no existing scholarship on these countries arguing that such upgrading coalitions exist. We can only speculate about what such an upgrading coalition might look like in the future. The past ex- perience of rich countries suggests that it might be cross-class among business and workers, as in Northern Europe, or more elitist and more exclusively among economic elites, as in East Asia. Our goal, though, is
8uji | not to recommend particular coalitions, but rather to examine the fis- sures that make any potential upgrading coalition less likely.36
df3e | The fragmentation of social groups is both vertical (high inequality) and horizontal (within business and labor). Of course, business and labor are differentiated everywhere by size and sectoral, geographical, and other divisions. But fragmentation in MI countries is both deeper than in most other cases, and now more consequential. The fragmenta- tion means that firms and workers in different parts of the economy have different strategies and therefore different interests regarding key upgrading reforms (and a range of other policies as well), especially education, as will be discussed in Section IV.
53eu | INEQUALITY
a5u1 | Inequality has risen higher and endured longer in today's MI countries than in earlier industrializers (see Table 3). In Figure 3 (note the in- verted scale on the y-axis), the line slopes upward and shows that the large MI countries are more unequal than would have been predicted from their income. Viewed historically, many MI countries have passed the levels of GDP per capita that OECD countries had earlier in the twen- tieth century, when their inequality was falling. Over the course of the twentieth century, for pretax Gini coefficients in ten OECD countries, inequality fell steadily from .48 in 1910 to .35 in 1980 (and then rose to .39 in 2000). By contrast, Gini coefficients for five MI countries rose to above .5 in 1930 and stayed at this very high level until 2000.37 After 2000 inequality fell in most of the nine large MI countries, though only slightly on average, from .5 to .48.38
ry7u | Most scholars would agree that inequality makes politics more dis- cordant and fractious, thus discouraging the centripetal and consensual politics that Foxley and Sossdorf and others urge on MI countries.39 Be- yond general contention, inequality also makes MI politics vulnerable to several kinds of political dysfunction, including elite capture, economic entrenchment, clientelism, and populism, all of which in various ways divert political attention and economic resources away from upgrading and work against the formation of upgrading coalitions.
5mda | Most simply, two-actor models of highly unequal societies start with the premise that these political economies have distinct dynamics
i4li | because elites enjoy greater power and nonelites have less recourse for checking that power.40 In economic versions of such models, elites cre- ate extractive institutions to ensure their rents, even if these institutions slow growth for the economy as a whole.41 Although oversimplified, these models are useful in highlighting the pivotal role of domestic elite participation in potential upgrading coalitions and the ways in which elite privileges can discourage such engagement.
r8sm | One obstacle to such participation involves a form of entrenchment in which longer periods in MI status allow large firms and elite social groups to consolidate their positions in the economy and the polity.42 The domestic firms-mostly huge, conglomerated, family-owned busi- ness groups-that grew large in the late twentieth century were con- centrated in commodities (natural resources, basic metals, and other semiprocessed goods), regulated sectors (especially banking and utili- ties), natural oligopolies (such as cement and beer), and occasionally, low-tech manufacturing (having been boxed out of high-tech manufac- turing by MNCs). They were already very large and powerful coming into the twenty-first century.43 In contrast to business groups in countries that escaped the MI trap, these concentrated business groups have had little to gain from pushing for policies that would help their economies break out of the trap.44 They are entrenched in their own traditional business strategies and in politics and wield power to maintain institu- tions favorable to their existing businesses. 45
