You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

gxfd | Bioinformatics analysis predicted that MdERF3 may bind to the GCC-box or DRE motif on the promoter of genes such as MdPGLR3, MdPME2 and MdACO4 (Figure 2g). MdPGLR3, MdPME2 and MdACO4 were predicted as candidate genes from QTLs F-F03.4, C-F02.1 and F-Z16.1, respectively, and all these three genes were DEGs for flesh firmness and crispness retain- ability (Table S6). Yeast one hybrid (Y1H) assay confirmed that MdERF3 efficiently bound to the promoters of MdPGLR3, MdPME2 and MdACO4 (Figure 2g). The relative expression of MdPGLR3, MdPME2 and MdACO4 was significantly inhibited in MdERF3 overexpressing lines, but was induced significantly in RNAi lines (Figure 2h,i). These data demonstrated that MdERF3 might negatively regulate the transcription of MdPGLR3, MdPME2 and MdACO4.
s2v1 | MdDOF5.3 was predicted to be located near QTL F-Z11.1 (Table S6). Y1H revealed that MdDof5.3 bound to the promoter of MdERF3 (del323) of 'Red Fuji' containing the CTTAACTG element, but did not bind to MdERF3 (Del323) of 'Red Fuji' (Figure 3a). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) further confirmed the interaction between MdDOF5.3 and the promoter of MdERF3 containing the CTTAACTG element (Figure 3b). In 35S:MdDOF5.3 and MdERF3 pro-F:GUS (del323) co-transformed tobacco leaves, the MdERF3 promoter activity was higher than that co-transformed with a <LATEX>M d E R F 3 _ { p r a } - F : G U S</LATEX> (Del323) (Fig- ure 3c). These results indicated that Del323 of MdERF3 com- pletely perturbed the binding of MdDOF5.3 to the CTTAACTG motif of MdERF3 promoter.
jkp9 | MdERF3 was then transiently overexpressed via Agrobac- terium-mediated infiltration or silenced via pTRV virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). Compared to that with the PRI101 empty vector transformants control, a significant increase in MdERF3 expression and distinct changes in fruit skin colour were observed in 'Golden Delicious' apples five days after transient transforma- tion with PRI-MdERF3 (Figure 3d,e). However, both flesh firmness and crispness of PRI-MdERF3-transformed apples were relatively lower than that of PRI101 control (Figure 3f,g), which may be attributed to natural fruit senescence. The apples transformed with pTRV-MdERF3 displayed more yellowing of the skin (Figure 3d), reduced MdERF3 expression, and an especially lower flesh firmness and crispness five days after infiltration (Figure 3e- g). These data further confirmed that MdERF3 contributed to post-harvest flesh firmness/crispness retainability.
z8tt | A 3-bp deletion (GTT) at -229 to -231 (Del229) upstream of the ATG codon of MdERF118 was detected in 'Zisai Pearl' (Figure 4a), which disrupted the RAVL1 binding CAACA motif and reduced the expression of MdERF118 in flesh firmness and crispness non-retainable Del229:del229 genotypes (Figure 4b). The GUS staining intensity, GUS gene expression in tobacco, and transgenic apple calli indicated that the presence of Del229 or truncating off the corresponding motif reduced the promoter activity of MdERF118 (Figure 4c-f). Y1H and transgenic apple calli lines confirmed that MdERF118 might negatively regulate the transcription of MdPGLR3 and MdACO4 (Figure 4g-i).
9g22 | MdRAVL1 was predicted from QTL F-Z16.2 (Table S6). Y1H, EMSA and transient co-transformed tobacco showed that MdRAVL1 bound to the promoter of MdERF118 (del229) but not MdERF118-D (Del229) (Figure 5a-c). 'Golden Delicious' apples transiently overexpressing or VIGS MdERF118 further confirmed the contribution of MdERF118 to flesh firmness/ crispness retainability (Figure 5d-g).
41fx | The yeast two hybrid (Y2H) assay revealed the protein-protein interaction between MdERF3 and MdERF118 (Figure 5h). Then, a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay in N. benthamiana leaves further verified that MdERF3 interacted with MdERF118 in the nucleus (Figure 5i).
7um8 | QTL-based GAP modelling and simulative selection
uow2 | An SNP marker was selected from a candidate gene predicted from each of the 56 QTLs, including MdERF3 and MdERF118 (Figure S4; Table S7). The genotypes of hybrids in the training population for the 56 QTL-based markers were listed in Tables S8 and S10. The marker effects varied from 0.155 months (SNP10070698) to 2.59 months (SNP9127269), and from 0.21 months (SNP10070698) to 3.24 months (SNP23366479) for flesh firmness and crispness retainability, respectively (Tables S9 and S11). The additive (e.g. SNP13579418 for crispness
iat7 | retainability) or complete dominant (e.g. SNP9403318 for crisp- ness retainability) allelic effects were less common than the partial dominant allelic effect (e.g. SNP9127269 and SNP38573461 for both firmness and crispness retainability) (Figure 6a).
ywwr | The genomics-predicted value (GPV) of flesh firmness retain- ability of 473 hybrids and GPV of flesh crispness retainability of 394 hybrids were shown in Tables S8 and S10, respectively. Relatively high prediction accuracy was obtained as 0.5712 and 0.6585 for the retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively (Figure 6b,c). The fivefold cross-validation exhibited an average prediction accuracy of 0.5541 and 0.6018 for flesh firmness and crispness retainability, respectively (Tables S12 and S13). In a simulative selection, when flesh firmness retainability GPV criterion was set as 5.0 months, the selection rate was 2.54% and the efficiency was 100% (12/12), which indicated that the observed phenotype value (OPV) of all the 12 selected hybrids was equal to or longer than 5.0 months (Table S14). When the GPV criterion for flesh crispness retainability was set as 5.0 months, the selection rate was 3.48% and the efficiency was 64.29% (Table S15).
