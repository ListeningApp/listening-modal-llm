You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | Asymmetric Student-Teacher Networks for Industrial Anomaly Detection
dqn8 | Abstract
cop0 | Industrial defect detection is commonly addressed with anomaly detection (AD) methods where no or only incom- plete data of potentially occurring defects is available. This work discovers previously unknown problems of student- teacher approaches for AD and proposes a solution, where two neural networks are trained to produce the same output for the defect-free training examples. The core assumption of student-teacher networks is that the distance between the outputs of both networks is larger for anomalies since they are absent in training. However, previous methods suffer from the similarity of student and teacher architecture, such that the distance is undesirably small for anomalies. For this reason, we propose asymmetric student-teacher net- works (AST). We train a normalizing flow for density es- timation as a teacher and a conventional feed-forward net- work as a student to trigger large distances for anomalies: The bijectivity of the normalizing flow enforces a divergence of teacher outputs for anomalies compared to normal data. Outside the training distribution the student cannot imitate this divergence due to its fundamentally different architec- ture. Our AST network compensates for wrongly estimated likelihoods by a normalizing flow, which was alternatively used for anomaly detection in previous work. We show that our method produces state-of-the-art results on the two cur- rently most relevant defect detection datasets MVTec AD and MVTec 3D-AD regarding image-level anomaly detec- tion on RGB and 3D data.
lhkq | 1. Introduction
82ju | To ensure product quality and safety standards in indus- trial manufacturing processes, products are traditionally in- spected by humans, which is expensive and unreliable in practice. For this reason, image-based methods for auto- matic inspection have been developed recently using ad- vances in deep learning [9, 18, 29, 38, 39]. Since there are no or only very few negative examples, i.e. erroneous prod- ucts, available, especially at the beginning of production, and new errors occur repeatedly during the process, tradi- tional supervised algorithms cannot be applied to this task.
y2qo | Instead, it is assumed that only data of a normal class of defect-free examples is available in training which is termed as semi-supervised anomaly detection. This work and oth- ers [9, 22, 36, 38, 39] specialize for industrial anomaly de- tection. This domain differs in contrast to others that normal examples are similar to each other and to defective prod- ucts. In this work, we not only show the effectiveness of our method for common RGB images but also on 3D data and their combination as shown in Figure 1.
1piq | Several approaches try to solve the problem by so-called student-teacher networks [5, 7, 19, 51, 53]. First, the teacher is trained on a pretext task to learn a semantic em- bedding. In a second step, the student is trained to match the output of the teacher. The motivation is that the student can
7fqw | only match the outputs of the teacher on normal data since it is trained only on normal data. The distance between the outputs of student and teacher is used as an indicator of an anomaly at test-time. It is assumed that this distance is larger for defective examples compared to defect-free ex- amples. However, this is not necessarily the case in pre- vious work, since we discovered that both teacher and stu- dent are conventional (i. e. non-injective) neural networks with similar architecture. A student with similar architec- ture tends to undesired generalization, such that it extrapo- lates similar outputs as the teacher for inputs that are out of the training distribution, which, in turn, gives an undesired low anomaly score. This effect is shown in Figure 2 us- ing an explanatory experiment with one-dimensional data: If the same neural network with one hidden layer is used for student and teacher, the outputs are still similar for anoma- lous data in the yellow area of the upper plot. In contrast, the outputs for anomalies diverge if an MLP with 3 hidden layers is used as the student.
rhaz | In general, it is not guaranteed that an out-of-distribution input will cause a sufficiently large change in both out- puts due to the missing injectivity of common neural net- works. In contrast to normalizing flows, conventional net- works have no guarantee to provide out-of-distribution out- puts for out-of-distribution inputs. These problems moti- vate us to use an asymmetric student-teacher pair (AST): A bijective normalizing flow [34] acts as a teacher while a conventional sequential model acts as a student. In this way, the teacher guarantees to be sensitive to changes in the input caused by anomalies. Furthermore, the usage of different architectures and thus of different sets of learn- able functions enforces the effect of distant outputs for out- of-distribution samples. As a pretext task for the teacher, we optimize to transform the distribution of image features and/or depth maps to a normal distribution via maximum
wak1 | likelihood training which is equivalent to a density esti- mation [15]. This optimization itself is used in previous work [22, 38, 39] for anomaly detection by utilizing the likelihoods as an anomaly score: A low likelihood of be- ing normal should be an indicator of anomalies. However, Le and Dinh [28] have shown that even perfect density es- timators cannot guarantee anomaly detection. For example, just reparameterizing the data would change the likelihoods of samples. Furthermore, unstable training leads to mises- timated likelihoods. We show that our student-teacher dis- tance is a better measure for anomaly detection compared to the obtained likelihoods by the teacher. The advantage to using a normalizing flow itself for anomaly detection is that a possible misestimation in likelihood can be compen- sated for: If a low likelihood of being normal is incorrectly assigned to normal data, this output can be predicted by the student, thus still resulting in a small anomaly score. If a high likelihood of being normal is incorrectly assigned to anomalous data, this output cannot be predicted by the stu- dent, again resulting in a high anomaly score. In this way, we combine the benefits of student-teacher networks and density estimation with normalizing flows. We further en- hance the detection by a positional encoding and by mask- ing the foreground using 3D images.

b2lm | Originally, the motivation for having a student network that learns to regress the output of a teacher network was to distill knowledge and save model parameters [23, 31, 48]. In this case, a student with clearly fewer parameters com- pared to the teacher almost matches the performance. Some previous work exploits the student-teacher idea for anomaly detection by using the distance between their outputs: The larger the distance, the more likely the sample is anoma- lous. Bergmann et al. [7] propose an ensemble of students which are trained to regress the output of a teacher for im- age patches. This teacher is either a distilled version of an ImageNet-pre-trained network or trained via metric learn- ing. The anomaly score is composed of the student uncer- tainty, measured by the variance of the ensemble, and the
