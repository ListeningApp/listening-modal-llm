You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

mt0f | Prior to the 1980s, some outside observers and expatriates portrayed the colonial govern- ment as a 'night watchman'. Unlike most colonial regimes, the state in Hong Kong did not have 'comprehensive control over the colonial society'.14 These scholars promoted the idea that the city-state was a peculiar late 20th-century example of laissez-faire in a colo- nial setting. The government possessed 'a limited reach in society as a result of its deliber- ate policy of indirect rule, a combination of economic laissez-faire and political non-intervention'.15 George Endacott, for instance, described the state in Hong Kong as 'a minimum of government' in the style of 'Benthamite laissez-faire'.16 From the 1980s, sociologists reinforced this abstract notion of a laissez-faire state. Lau Siu-kai asserted that Hong Kong was a 'minimally-integrated social-political system'. The colony was 'largely exempted from interference by social and economic forces in the system'. Hong Kong Chinese were politically apathetic and the state did not pursue any kind of 'activ- ism' to 'intrude unnecessarily into society to restructure it'. The links between an 'autono- mous bureaucratic polity' and 'atomistic Chinese society' were extremely limited.17 Being atomistic, the Chinese households in Hong Kong relied on familial networks and were capable of self-regulating.18 'Boundary maintenance' was sustained, meaning that politics only took place at the boundary between the state and society, and was 'not highly insti- tutionalized in a formal or legal sense'.19 There were no 'political institutions which enable[d] non-bureaucratic "outsiders" to acquire or exercise political power'.20 Equally, the state lacked 'the organizational penetration into the Chinese society'.21 Other sociolo- gists purported the notion of a 'highly insulated state', in which only a limited number of elites were absorbed into the administrative system to legitimize the foreign rule.22
awab | Lau's position was ahistorical, based on partial evidence that was primarily drawn from interview data. He acknowledged that his 'theoretical approach' inevitably led to the omission of 'many historical and empirical details' and failed to examine the com- plex nature of Hong Kong's social-political system 'in a particular structural-historical context'.23 Since the 1990s, revisionists have refuted the concept of laissez-faire and convincingly argued that a 'minimally-integrated social-political system' misrepresented state-society relations in Hong Kong. The state's power was 'far more penetrating' and state-society relations were 'complex and contingent upon particular situations'.24 At times, the colonial government deliberately created 'social cleavages' and collaborated with different social groups, ranging from marginalized industrialists to social activists,
ixcc | to manipulate public opinion and maintain effective governance.25 Ma Ngok observed that 'the mutual non-intervention between polity and society was over-stated'.26 Wai- man Lam asserted. that Lau's study failed to demonstrate that the colonial state was 'underdeveloped' and that Chinese society was 'overdeveloped'. Insufficient evidence suggested that the Chinese communities in Hong Kong could satisfy their needs through 'private means'. Throughout the post-war period, social movements challenged state policies.27 Michael Ng argued that the press was 'continuously and systematically moni- tored and pervasively censored through the collaborative efforts of executive actions, legislation provisions and judicial decisions'. The Control of Publications Ordinance passed in 1951 strengthened the state's power of press control, which previously could only be exercised by the Governor during emergencies.28 The freedom to protest in pub- lic was also restricted by statutory controls, showing implicitly that the state was con- scious that it had to monitor social unrest.29
8p6h | Although an erroneous view of state-society relations has been refuted, how the reformist Hong Kong colonial state interacted with its Chinese communities and improved political communications remains under-investigated. It is also unknown whether constructed public opinion had an impact on policymaking. Using archival evi- dence, this article offers an understanding of how this non-democratic and at times repressive late colonial state functioned. It argues that 'the masses' were made structur- ally invisible by the bureaucracy, and involved in the policymaking process through MOOD, a formally institutionalized programme coordinated by the Home Affairs Department. MOOD's methods and disseminations also demonstrate how it was used to understand changing public sentiments in Hong Kong. Containing a substantial amount of valuable and rich qualitative data about ordinary Hong Kong Chinese, there is no comparable surviving state document. Analysis of this data also contests the dominant narrative which argues that political culture in Hong Kong shifted in the 1970s due to the emergence of local identity, especially among the post-war baby boomers.30 The existing literature portrays Hong Kong as a homogenous entity. This article analyses how class and age impacted on these complex social processes.
pmgl | Constructing public opinion at the local level
90no | From 1968, to detect grievances and solicit views of the 'man in the street' from 'differ- ent walks of life', the City District Officers produced the confidential Town Talk, 'one of the most important channels for soliciting public opinions'.31 It emphasized the qualita- tive aspect of opinions, for department heads and high-ranked government officials. Opinions of the public were gathered by observing and having casual conversations with ordinary people. Nonetheless, the existing knowledge about these opinion polls is extremely limited as they were 'not officially included in the CDO [City District Officer] Scheme'.32 To understand how public opinion was constructed in the 1970s and in the absence of access to confidential state records, King resorted to interviewing several officers. The only thing that was commonly known was that no clear guidelines were provided in the late 1960s and early 1970s on who the City District Officers should inter- view, which resulted in interviewees being consulted spontaneously and repeatedly. This put the report's authoritativeness in question. As Augustine Kam Chui, the Deputy Director of the Home Affairs Department, noted:
jt0y | The major criticism of Town Talk over years has been that it was unsystematic and had no statistical basis. This will always be the case but its credibility can be increased very considerably if the staff involved each contact a predetermined number of people every week to ensure that the coverage is as widely extend[ed] as feasible.33
qb7o | MOOD, a successor of Town Talk, was introduced in March 1975. It intended to be a 'more authoritative and therefore influential' public opinion poll.34 It was a confidential report generated by the Home Affairs Department. The main purpose of MOOD was 'to draw attention to subjects which are currently or potentially of public concern, and to assess public reactions, attitudes and feelings in appropriate instances'.35 Like Town Talk, MOOD placed its priority on collecting opinions that were not reported by the news media. It examined the impact of the press on public opinion, public misconceptions and voices of 'the less articulated classes' who 'cannot get their views heard and have there- fore suffered in silence'.36 Controversial topics and anti-government activities were investigated, as well as the opinions of civil servants who disagreed with state policies.37 Due to the sensitivity of the intelligence gathered, the reports only circulated among senior officials.38 Heads of departments were reminded to store their MOOD reports 'securely all the time'.39
