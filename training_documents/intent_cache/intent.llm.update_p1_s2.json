This process of using one's therapeutic self is best summarized as interpersonal reasoning; it is a highly personal, individualized, subjective decision-making process that is grounded in the disciplined application of a set of concepts aimed\nubwu | The Intentional Relationship Model guides occupational therapy practice by defining therapeutic use of self and thereby outlining an interpersonal reasoning process that therapists may apply when interacting with their clients. Each component of this model describes practical skills that may be applied during actual practice situations. The concepts and skills that comprise the Intentional Relationship Model have been empirically validated and tested and are explained in greater detail in subsequent chapters. This chapter provides an overview of the Intentional Relationship Model so that readers understand how each of the components relate to one another within\nucme | Rigel continues with the empathizing mode: \"That is generous of you to say. I know I already gave you the lecture, yesterday, about what an occu-\nqnl5 | at meeting the client's interpersonal needs. Some may believe that the process is driven by one's emotional reactions to clients and an innate or nurtured intuitive capacity. A smaller set of others perceive the process as largely rational and grounded in the disciplined application of a set of interpersonal guidelines.\nwdx9 | Irrespective of such viewpoints, the Intentional Relationship Model argues that therapeutic use of self is, in large part, a product of the extent to which one approaches practice intentionally, being ever-vigilant toward keeping one's personal reactions to a client in perspective and, instead, focusing one's attention on the client's reactions to us and to the therapy process. Therapeutic use of self involves prioritizing one's attempts to cultivate an empathic understanding of one's client and applying a knowledge base and interpersonal skill set thoughtfully to common interpersonal events,\nn1xr | CASE EXAMPLE Three point one Rigel Returns to Meet Mr. Johnson\nohpj | As we learned in Chapter One, Mr. Johnson became depressed and withdrawn following a stroke. One of Mr. Johnson's most prominent interpersonal characteristics is his communication style, which tends to be guarded and reluctant. His first interaction with Rigel resulted in an interpersonal event cascade, more than one inevitable interpersonal event occurring in succession during a single session. This was because of a series of missed opportunities in not responding to Mr. Johnson's interpersonal characteristics and to the interpersonal events using the appropriate modes. As you may recall, Rigel decides to end the therapy session early and return another day.\nry5f | After a long evening of contemplation, Rigel returns to work with Mr. Johnson the following morning. This time, he applies interpersonal reasoning by reflecting upon Mr. Johnson's most striking interpersonal characteristic, his communication style. Knowing that Mr. Johnson uses few words and largely communicates nonverbally, Rigel decides he will not engage with him in a way that would require him to speak a great deal. Also knowing that the interpersonal event of resistance had happened the day before, Rigel decided that he would need to be exceptionally careful about always communicating\n31wg | such as when a client is not engaging in therapy appropriately. Accordingly, therapeutic use of self is an occupational therapy skill that must be developed, reinforced, monitored, and refined. One's personal and emotional reactions to clients must be overseen by and balanced with a rational and self-disciplined application of almost selfless empathy toward the client.\ncelk | This chapter presents the Intentional Relationship Model, a conceptual practice model that operationalizes the processes involved in therapeutic use of self. The rationale, conceptual background, and underlying principles of this model are presented. The model explains how components of the client-therapist relationship interact and are enacted in the face of everyday challenges to that relationship. Finally, this chapter presents a set of core principles that guide the implementation of this model.\n3mf9 | beginning the session with small talk, he decided to begin the session by using the empathizing mode.\nz2rd | Instead of asserting any type of agenda for therapy that day, Rigel enters the room and simply greets Mr. Johnson by saying:\nvqld | Rigel: \"Remember me?\"\nljmz | Mr. Johnson simply looks up to acknowledge Rigel. Rigel sits down at a bit of a distance, not facing Mr. Johnson. Rigel draws upon the empathizing mode by orienting his body at an angle toward Mr. Johnson in a nonthreatening way that would not imply any expectations or demands. After a few moments pass, Rigel uses the empathizing mode by making the following summary statement, which opened a door for continued communication with Mr. Johnson.\nen1l | Rigel (using the empathizing mode): \"I was really fumbling around trying to offer something therapeutic for you yesterday. I knew that I was heading in the wrong direction, so I thought I would come back again, today, just to acknowledge this.\"\n45gx | Mr. Johnson makes an intimate self-disclosure: \"It was not your fault.\"\nxgur | ways I might be able to serve you. Today, we can begin wherever we want.\"\niz66 | Mr. Johnson says nothing and gives Rigel a curious glance.\ndndq | Rigel then enacts the collaborating mode: \"If you don't mind, I'd like to just spend our time together observing you as you go about your day. You can do or not do anything you want.\"\nxzce | Mr. Johnson responds: \"Nothing we do will make a difference.\"\nw4vd | Rigel then shifts to the empathizing mode: \"I want to understand why you believe this.\"\ncuh0 | (Silence and a nonverbal cue from Mr. Johnson, who looks down and away from Rigel.)\nk36t | Rigel continues in the empathizing mode: \"I just want to get to know you and learn about anything that you might be thinking or anything that is important to you.\"\nz1wx | The session continues as Rigel observes Mr. Johnson pull out his smartphone and thumb through what appear to be photos of family and friends. After several moments pass, Rigel continues with the empathizing mode and observes:\no6gf | \"I see that you are looking at photos.\"\n0hs6 | Mr. Johnson makes a second intimate self-disclosure:",
