        "content": "cuh0 | fective potential for a high, Upsilon equals ten, and a low, Upsilon equals one, temperature for the polynomial and unequal L-J potentials respectively. As K approaches zero is approached, a distinct single minimum develops, indicating the average position of the particle. As expected, the lower the temperature, the closest the effective minimum is to the bare potential's global minimum, reflecting the relative weakness of fluctuations to force the particle to spend time away from it. As one might expect, it takes 'longer' in K evolution for local features - e.g. barriers - to disappear in the Upsilon equals one case as fluctuations at each K scale have less energy than their equivalent for the Upsilon equals ten and the particle's stochastic motion between barriers is less frequent. Physically this means that the fluctuations we have integrated out up to scale K do not contribute significantly to the particle moving between minima.\nk36t | We see a similar phenomenon in Fig.  three for the flow from the bare to the effective potential for Upsilon equals three, and Upsilon equals one for an X squared potential with six gaussian bumps or dips. Here the original Langevin potential is much more com-\nz1wx | plicated than in the previous two cases but the fRG is still able to smoothen out these features in a non-trivial way. This example further demonstrates how the flow of the effective potential is driven by the local curvature, the gaussian features imposed here, since for an X squared potential the fRG flow equation eighty-eight yields no change beyond an unphysical shift by an overall additive constant.\no6gf | It is clear in all three figures that at the high temperature there is not much change in the shape of the potential when K has reached the value given by the green, dot-dashed line. Physically this means that the fluctuations integrated out in this range do not contribute significantly to the particle evolution and transition between minima. However, by the time K has been lowered to the value of the yellow, dashed line we have started to integrate over fluctuations over timescales relevant for inter-minima transitions. Naturally, when K equals zero is reached the potential is fully convex (as it must be by definition of T) with no local features to overcome. Similar behaviour is obtained where again we consider the corresponding\n0hs6 | Upsilon equals three lower temperature. As one might expect it takes 'longer' in K evolution for the barrier to disappear as fluctuations at each K scale have less energy than their equivalent for the high temperature case. Of note is that not only is\nm05x | the evolution different but the final shape of V sub K equals zero left parenthesis X right parenthesis is different for the two different temperature regimes. Both the position and gradient near the global minimum are changed. This is suggestive of longer time scales required at lower temperatures to reach equilibrium. It also indicates longer times for the equilibrium covariance to decay, as we discuss below.\nds29 | Regarding WFR, the full numerical solutions to (ninety-six) for the unequal L-J potential at Upsilon equals ten, two and for an X squared potential with six gaussian bumps or dips at Upsilon equals three, are shown in Figs. four and five respectively. We see that from the initial condition, Zeta sub X equals one everywhere, features appear as K approaches zero in direct contrast with the evolution of the effective higher temperatures it is clear that at K equals zero a local minima appears at the same place as the global minimum for the effective potential where the height of the local minima is linked to the equilibrium covariance - see equation one hundred nineteen. Looking at Fig. four (b) however we can see that this is no longer the case and the features generated by the fRG flow are much greater than in the high temperature case. We will see later that the neighbouring features in Zeta sub X will help to better describe dynamical evolution than the bare potential alone.\nqcmr | Six.
