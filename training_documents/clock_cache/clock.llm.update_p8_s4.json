        "content": "wtfz | Delta G star equals Delta G star sub I plus Delta G nought divided by two plus left parenthesis Delta G nought right parenthesis squared divided by sixteen Delta G star sub I\nqy1i | activation energy expected for a thermoneutral cyclopropylcarbinyl radical ring opening. This value of Delta G star sub I can be used in equation five to calculate widetilde Delta G superscript I for cyclopropylcarbinyl ring openings of varying exergonicity. Figure two shows a plot of log bar k, as a function of the exergonicity of the reaction.\n1k9e | Comparisons of standard bond dissociation energies can be used to estimate the exergonicity of the cyclopropylcarbinyl ring-opening reactions. The bond dissociation energy for a benzylic hydrogen in toluene is ten to eleven kilocalories per mole smaller than that of a primary C-H bond in ethane or propane. For the benzylic position in ethylbenzene, the bond dissociation energy is reduced by approximately two point five kilocalories per mole from that of toluene. Thus, the ring opening of the radical derived from one is expected to be about twelve point five to thirteen point five kilocalories per mole more exergonic than that of five, giving a value of Delta G nought equals negative eighteen point two kilocalories per mole. If we assume that the full overlap of the X-system of the phenyl ring is available in the transition state for ring opening of the radical derived from one, then the predicted rate constant for ring opening of this radical at twenty-five degrees Celsius is one times ten to the power of eleven reciprocal seconds. Given the crude nature of the analysis, this value compares favorably with the observed rate constant of\n5bjs | three times ten to the power of eleven reciprocal seconds. If the phenyl group in the radical derived from one is locked such that its pi r-system cannot overlap fully with the breaking bond in the cyclopropyl ring, the resonance stabilization would be a function of cosine squared theta, where theta is the dihedral angle of the breaking bond and the pi T-system of the phenyl ring. When the latter is orthogonal to the breaking bond left parenthesis theta equals ninety degrees right parenthesis, the effect of the phenyl group would be reduced to approximately that of the inductive effect of an alkyl group. In this extreme case, the appropriate model reaction for the Marcus analysis would be one in which the exergonicity of the ring-opening reaction is only about two point five to three kilocalories per mole greater than that of five on the basis of the differences in bond dissociation energy between primary and secondary alkane C C-H bonds. This per second value gives a predicted rate constant at twenty-five degrees Celsius of about\nuodj | four times ten to the power of eight Using the two limiting cases discussed above, corresponding to phenyl stabilization of between three and thirteen kilocalories per mole, the stereoelectronic effect of an enforced position begin array end array in the radical derived from one is shown on the selected dihedral angles. When theta is for ring opening at twenty-five degrees Celsius is reduced two times ten to the power of nine reciprocal seconds, one order of magnitude less than the oxygen rebound rate constants found in P-four hundred fifty oxidations. Because it is possible that an oxygen rebound rate constant in the MMO hydroxylase is faster than that found in the P-four hundred fifty studies, further reduction of the rate constant for ring opening of the radical derived from one could lead to undetectably small amounts of ring-opened alcohol product one b. Thus the absence of one b from oxidation of probe one could result from an extreme alteration in the rate constant for ring opening of the derived cyclopropylcarbinyl radical in the enzyme active site.\nk16v | Although the Marcus analysis demonstrates that a stereoelectronic reduction in the rate constant for ring opening of a radical derived from one is a possible explanation for the absence of ring-opened alcohol one b, it should be recalled that no ring-opened product formed in the hydroxylation of the closely related substrate two. A significant reduction in the rate constant for ring opening of the radical derived from this substrate probe due to steric effects in the active site is less likely. In this case, both phenyl groups must be held such that their pi T-systems are virtually orthogonal to the breaking bond in order to reduce resonance stabilization in the transition state for opening, a much less probable situation. Moreover, such an arrangement would require that the phenyl groups approach coplanarity with one another, a geometry that would increase steric interactions between them. The results from probe two therefore suggest that a radical or carbocation is not formed and that the hydroxylation mechanism involves one of the alternative pathways A, B, C left parenthesis one right parenthesis, or F in Scheme four.\nb2lm | There is another factor to consider with regard to the results with probe one. The discussion of steric effects on the rate constant for ring opening of substrate-derived radical ignored the fact that two enantiomers of this substrate were allowed to react with the chiral enzyme. If sterics-enforced stereoelectronic effects were operative, it is unlikely that both enantiomeric radicals derived from the enantiomers of the probe would suffer similar ring-opening rate retardations. The formation of aryl hydroxylated product in amounts comparable to the amount of alcohol one a produced complicates the analysis, however. As indicated above, it is likely that the two different products are derived from the two different enantiomers of the probe substrate. Further studies with enantiomerically pure probes are planned to resolve this question.",
