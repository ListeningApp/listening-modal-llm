You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

otkr | Ecological novelty is a characteristic feature of species redistribution in the Anthropocene (Saul and Jeschke 2015). Different facets of ecological novelty can be conceptual- ized, and we argue that these are associated in different ways with range-expanding and alien species (table 1). Specifically, ecological novelty can be inversely measured as ecoevolutionary experience of interacting resident and non- resident species (sensu Saul and Jeschke 2015): Organisms with novel weapons (sensu Callaway and Ridenour 2004) or other novel traits the resident species are not familiar with (i.e., they have a low ecoevolutionary experience) are expected to have stronger impacts than organisms that are similar to resident species (i.e., high ecoevolutionary experi- ence). We would expect that resident species typically have a higher ecoevolutionary experience when interacting with range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental change than with alien species coming from

fj24 | further away. This is because alien species are frequently more distinct in their morphology, behavior, or other traits and characteristics. Extreme examples are alien mammalian predators introduced to New Zealand (and other oceanic islands) that had a devastating impact on resident flightless birds. Because of the previous absence of such predators on New Zealand, kiwi and other ground nesting bird species became easy prey for cats and mustelids (Blackwell 2005). However, because of evolutionary convergence, aliens some- times have a lower degree of novelty than range-expanding species. For example, range-expanding plants that track climate change and are expanding into biomes with cooler climates can have profound impacts on nutrient cycling and ecosystem functioning when they introduce novel growth forms (e.g., shrubification of tundra ecosystems, laurophyl- lisation of temperate forests; Sturm et al. 2001, Walther et al. 2007, Alexander et al. 2018). Similarly, pathogens that spread into new regions because of climate change can have severe impacts on their (new) hosts (Harvell et al. 2002). Future studies are therefore needed to test our prediction that range-expanding species typically have a lower degree of novelty than alien species (e.g., following the procedure proposed by Saul et al. 2013). These will also provide impor- tant insights for biodiversity management.

d5bi | Proposing a term for range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental change
ba4l | We note that given the overabundance of terminology in ecology and biogeography, introducing a new term for range-expanding species that respond to anthropogenic environmental change has the potential to exacerbate this unfortunate situation further. However, given the impor- tance of this phenomenon and the absence of a specific term for such species, we believe that suggesting a new term is useful and appropriate. Therefore, we propose that the term neonative be applied for range-expanding taxa responding to anthropogenic environmental change (figure 2). We have chosen this term because it succinctly captures the biogeo- graphic status of such taxa-that is, to be present in a region only relatively recently.
ffx8 | Specifically, we propose the following definition for neonatives (see also figure 2, table 2): Neonatives are those taxa that have expanded geographically beyond their native range and that now have established populations whose presence is due to human-induced changes of the biophysi- cal environment, but not as a result of direct movement by human agency, intentional or unintentional, or to the cre- ation of dispersal corridors such as canals, roads, pipelines, or tunnels.
s6su | We propose that such taxa should be considered native in the new range, but that there are sound reasons to dis- criminate them from native species occurring within their historic range and from range-expanding native species that do so apparently without responding to human-induced environmental change. Therefore, taxa may be native, neo- native, or alien in different parts of their current range

Species respond to human-induced environmental change by expanding from their historic range (a) into formerly unsuitable (or inaccessible) regions (b), often with parts of the newly suitable region being not yet colonized because of colonization lags. The proposed terminology is shown in panel (c), with characteristic features that are relevant for identifying native species in their historic range, native species that expand their ranges without human contribution, neonative species, and alien species that are introduced by human agency (e.g., introduction of propagules; d).

bqfb | The word neonative has previously sometimes been used in other contexts. For instance, it has been used in anthropol- ogy with regard to colonizing human populations, especially in North America (e.g., Rudy and Farmer 2010). In forestry, the term has been used for discussing the establishment of neonative forest species, including the use of native and alien tree species and nonlocal tree provenances to better adapt forests to future climate conditions (e.g., Millar et al. 2007). We are aware that suggesting a term that has been previously

meyw | used in related contexts is not ideal, but because previous usage of neonative was rare, this should not be a major issue.
2e62 | Considerations for managing species ranges in the Anthropocene
75y3 | Although there is broad agreement that alien species in some cases cause substantial impacts on the environment and human well-being (Vilà et al. 2011, Blackburn et al. 2014, Bacher et al. 2018) that warrants management, much less attention is given to the possible impacts of neonative species as defined above. However, there is accumulating evidence that impacts by neonatives can be substantial and even functionally similar to the impacts caused by alien

68xu | species (Nackley et al. 2017), and that the level of differ- ences to the traits represented in the recipient communities play an important role (Engelkes et al. 2008). For instance, neonatives often encounter closely related species in the newly colonized region, which may make hybridization and genetic introgression a more frequent phenomenon than when alien species invade a new region (Le Roux and Wieczorek 2009, Klonner et al. 2017). Predators and herbi- vores may switch to closely related prey or plant species as a food resource (Soininen et al. 2007, Pateman et al. 2012). Furthermore, the arrival of neonatives will occur with dif- ferential rates of spread, with generalist species likely to spread more rapidly (e.g., Chen et al. 2011, Alexander et al. 2018). Such asynchronous spread may cause boom-and-bust phenomena (Strayer et al. 2017) and an overdominance of generalist species capable of rapidly tracking changing envi- ronmental conditions.
hd35 | Aliens do, but neonatives do not depend on humans as the initial dispersal vector into a new region (although second- ary spread of alien species can also be unaided by humans). Consequently, although we can aim to control alien propa- gule and colonization pressure, there is no easy way to control the arrival and spread of neonatives; management practices can only be post hoc-and they include other risks, because restricting species migration might actually lead to the extinction of the species if the original range becomes unsuitable. The management of neonatives therefore poses

7od1 | challenges that are quite different from the management of aliens (table 1). In fact, the challenge is to manage spe- cies turnover, the enrichment or replacement of natives by neonatives such that negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services are minimized or even turned into benefits. There is a critical need to understand how species turnover affects biodiversity and ecosystem services (Hobbs et al. 2013).
0bqy | Finally, we identify four key challenges for future research and management-namely, assessing the impacts of neo- natives on recipient ecosystems, identifying the drivers of rapid range expansion and the specific traits that favor successful range expansion and the different biological and ecological characteristics of neonatives in comparison to resident native and alien species, debating manage- ment options and conservation benefits of neonatives, and potentially recognizing neonative species in legislation and policies for management. For these challenges, we provide recommendations for science and biodiversity management of neonatives (table 3). Although some of these challenges address basic gaps in knowledge and understanding, others are aiming to improve the transfer of scientific understand- ing to biodiversity management and policy.

y7ea | believe that it is useful to distinguish natural range dynam- ics from those facilitated by human-induced environmental change. Therefore, expanding the list of currently used cat- egories of biogeographic status to recognize this increasingly important component of regional species pools is warranted and useful for better communication and understand- ing among scientists, policy makers and managers, which undoubtedly will benefit conservation efforts.
nav4 | Neonatives are currently treated by most international regulations as natives (e.g., EU Regulation 1143/2014, CBD, IUCN). We support such a classification, albeit as a distinct subcategory from resident natives. Similarly, there will undoubtedly be different opinions on the issue of using temporal and spatial thresholds for identifying neonatives. These issues clearly warrant further discussion among sci- entists and biodiversity managers.
gem8 | In any case, we conclude that in the future, neonatives should be explicitly considered in global and regional sce- narios for biodiversity management to increase clarity and to decrease undesirable effects. For example, policies aimed at increasing ecological connectivity should give explicit consideration to the potential movements of such species. Research should develop approaches for predicting their potential impacts on ecosystems and human well-being.
