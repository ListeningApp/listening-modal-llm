You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

9f7o | 184 neuroproteasome (Fig 1D). We fail to detect cytosolic proteins such as Actin in our surface
5n75 | 185 fraction, validating our surface-labeling approach, and fail to observe FLAG expression in 20S-
3ljd | 186 FLAG mice without Cre (Fig 1D). By blotting using an antibody which detects six of the seven
2oqd | 187 alpha subunits of the 20S proteasome including a7, the subunit coded for by Psma3, we can
c4uf | 188 clearly distinguish the modified a7 subunit overlaying with the FLAG signal, denoting
gmje | 189 modification of the endogenous protein (Fig 1D). Next, we used surface biotinylation to assess if
a8px | 190 our transgenic system was functional in primary cultures. Primary neurons from 20S-FLAG mice
uz6l | 191 were cultured and transduced with AAVs to express Cre recombinase at days in vitro (DIV) two
xaka | 192 and then processed for surface biotinylation at DIV14 (Fig S1E). We did not detect FLAG
p46y | 193 without AAVs to express Cre, supporting our conclusion that the 20S-FLAG transgene is 194 inducible and not leaky.
4rcq | 195
zie9 | 196 Next, we purified FLAG-neuroproteasomes to determine their composition. First, we prepared
qx9z | 197 plasma membranes from 20S-FLAG/Baf53b-Cre brains and then gently extracted membrane
otrq | 198 proteins. We find our membrane preparations were enriched in membrane proteins such as
ule8 | 199 GluR1 and depleted of cytosolic proteins like Actin (Fig S1F). We affinity isolated FLAG-
6yp6 | 200 neuroproteasomes from the membrane fraction as well as cytosolic FLAG-proteasomes and
qx7g | 201 subjected both to quantitative tandem mass tag-based mass spectrometry analysis. As expected,
17ou | 202 we find common signatures of 20S subunits between both cytosolic proteasomes and
l7mi | 203 neuroproteasomes and a significant depletion of 19S subunits in the neuroproteasome isolations.
odfd | 204 This is consistent with a lack of cytosolic subunits in our membrane preparations and validates our previous findings(3-5). We identified 64 proteins enriched in the neuroproteasome isolations 206 which are depleted in the cytosolic fraction. This revealed significant enrichment of the GPM6
zlby | 205
k37v | 207 glycoprotein, which we previously described(3) (Fig 1E), and a surprising and strong enrichment
77oz | 208 of ApoE and the ApoE receptor Lrp1 (Fig 1E, Table S1). We do not observe other ApoE receptors, such as ApoER2, VLDLR, and LDLR in this analysis. We first validated these proteomic data by affinity isolating FLAG-neuroproteasomes as well as cytosolic FLAG-
aw8u | 209
ktnk | 210
qiri | 211 proteasomes and then immunoblotting these samples. Here, we validate our proteomic data by also identifying robust co-purification of ApoE and Lrp1 with the FLAG-neuroproteasome (Fig 1F).

jp3l | 215 ApoE isoforms differentially modulate neuroproteasome surface localization in vivo
2pzg | 216
qeue | 217 ApoE can be expressed as one of three isoforms in human: ApoE4, ApoE3, and ApoE2, each of 218 which differs by only one or two residues. We next tested whether ApoE isoforms could
77jl | 219 differentially modulate neuroproteasome localization and function. We obtained human ApoE
a9ul | 220 isoform knock-in (KI) mice, where the entire coding region for the Apoe gene was replaced with
9jxp | 221 a cassette encoding the three human Apoe loci, generating a fully humanized ApoE protein(52).
ejzi | 222 These mice therefore only express the ApoE2, ApoE3, or ApoE4 isoforms. hApoE-KI mice were
lgbb | 223 perfused and then hippocampus and primary motor cortex (PMC) were microdissected and
hdy5 | 224 subjected to surface biotinylation and immunoblotting. We chose a limited survey of regions
rlsz | 225 based on their differential susceptibility to accumulate pathological hallmarks of AD
wf16 | 226 (hippocampus>PMC)(53, 54). We found a strong reduction of neuroproteasome surface
syuf | 227 localization in the hippocampus of ApoE4-KI mice, compared to ApoE3-KIs or ApoE2-KIs,
n8b1 | 228 measured by surface signal of 20S subunit ß5 (Fig 2A). We observe a significant difference
wurf | 229 between ApoE3 male and female mice, where female ApoE3 mice have 50% fewer surface-
v7s4 | 230 localized neuroproteasomes than male ApoE3 mice in hippocampus (Fig 2A). We find this
yg3g | 23 noteworthy in the context of the extensive literature on the influence of biological sex on AD
7fo3 | 232 pathogenesis(36, 55-58). When we monitor neuroproteasome localization in the PMC from the
mwxk | 233 hApoE-KI mice, we find that neuroproteasome surface localization in ApoE4-KIs is reduced
ovs7 | 234 compared to ApoE2-KIs and we observe a trend, but no significant change in ApoE4-KI
0dyv | 235 compared to ApoE3-KI (Fig S2A). These data may be attributable to differences in ApoE
sl16 | 236 expression in different brain regions(36, 52, 59), a dimension which we have not systematically investigated.

3z35 | 239 Given the region-specific effect of ApoE isoforms on neuroproteasome expression in vivo, we
0xdu | 240 approached the effect of ApoE isoforms and ApoE receptors in a more defined and tractable
bpdv | 241 primary neuronal culture system. Lrp1 was the only ApoE receptor that we identified in our neuroproteasome IP/MS dataset and we also found ApoE isoform-dependent modulation of Lrp1
b0xd | 242
e106 | 243 levels (Fig S2B). Instead of testing the role for Lrp1 specifically, we tested the role for ApoE
mh8r | 244 receptors in modulating neuroproteasome localization using the well-established pan-ApoE
ud3i | 245 receptor antagonist Receptor-associated protein (RAP) (60-62). We chose this strategy because 246 Lrp1 knockouts still contain small amounts of Lrp1 remaining in sporadic sets of neurons and
8qfv | 247 because of detrimental effects on neuronal health following Lrp1 knockdown(63, 64). We used a
iers | 248 variant of RAP (stable RAP) which contains a stabilizing mutation to protect against pH-induced 249 denaturation and maintains a higher percentage of internalized Lrp1, and presumably other ApoE
z6h3 | 250 receptors as well(60) (Fig 2B). We incubated primary neurons with purified stable RAP and
qe1n | 251 measured surface protein levels using surface biotinylation and immunoblotting. We find that stable RAP rapidly decreases the surface localization of Lrp1, as expected (Fig 2C). We also
uaiu | 252
besh | 253 find that stable RAP reduces surface localization of neuroproteasomes (Fig 2C). These data 254 served as the first demonstration that ApoE receptors, such as Lrp1, can regulate
z6fn | 255 neuroproteasome localization.
c7zf | 256
iwkf | 257 ApoE is a lipoprotein, and in the brain is thought to be released by glia in the lipid-bound
4jzo | 258 form(36, 52, 65, 66). We therefore next leveraged the primary culture system to determine
i5zo | 259 whether extracellular ApoE could modulate neuroproteasome localization and if the lipidation of 260 ApoE was important for this modulation. We generated primary neurons from either 20S-FLAG
we91 | 26 transgenic animals or WT animals and conducted imaging and biochemical experiments to
3h4l | 262 measure neuroproteasome localization. We conjugated recombinant ApoE isoforms with a
my5y | 263 mixture of POPC and Cholesterol (PC) and purified ApoE lipoproteins, referred to as PC-
k3e7 | 264 ApoE2, E3, and E4. These lipoproteins were validated by SEC and negative stain EM (Fig S2C)
