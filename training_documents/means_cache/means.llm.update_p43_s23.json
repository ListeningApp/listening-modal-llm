She also wanted to see Brian, because he was the closest thing she had to a friend in this town.\nafbe | Thirteen point thirteen. What next?\n78r8 | At the age of thirteen I met my heroes, Iron Maiden, and very nice they were too. I've met them a couple of times since (not because they're my best buddies or anything exciting like that, but over the years the fan club put on various events where you were allowed to stand next to them and gibber like a fool while they humoured you politely). You'll notice that the photo at the start of this chapter is signed by Dave Murray. This wasn't possible because I had my own darkroom installed backstage at the Hammersmith Odeon in which I could quickly process photographs, or because I had access to time travel (sadly), but because I took the photo with me when I met him in two thousand. I recounted the tale of how terrified I had been about meeting him in nineteen eighty six. If he thought I was some strange stalker he certainly didn't let on. Uncharacteristic of most people who've sold millions of albums, they're lovely blokes.\n320g | Anyway, having seen Iron Maiden in their glory, I was inspired. They still inspire me: I still rate them as the best live band I've ever seen (and I've seen them over thirty-five times, so I ought to know). Although I had briefly been deflected from my destiny by the shock of grammar school, I was back on track. I had to form a band. There was just one issue: no one else played a musical instrument. The solution was easy: through several months of covert subliminal persuasion I convinced my two best friends (both called Mark, oddly enough) that they wanted nothing more than to start learning the drums and bass guitar. A power trio was in the making.\ntp8g | Thirteen point fourteen.

You'd think they could have found someone a bit more interesting to stalk, but apparently times were hard. It could have been a lot worse, but it wasn't particularly pleasant. I imagined a world in which a psychologist tried two different therapies on different groups of stalkers (twenty-five stalkers in each group - this variable is called Group). To the first group he gave cruel-to-be-kind therapy (every time the stalkers followed him around, or sent him a letter, the psychologist attacked them with a cattle prod). The second therapy was psychodynamic therapy, in which stalkers were hypnotized and regressed into their childhood to discuss their penis (or lack of penis), their father's penis, their dog's penis, the seventh penis of a seventh penis and any other penis that sprang to mind. The psychologist measured the number of hours stalking in one week both before (stalk one) and after (stalk two) treatment. Analyse the effect of therapy on stalking behaviour after therapy, covarying for the amount of\nz8tt | stalking behaviour before therapy.\n9g22 | · Task Two: Compute effect sizes for Task One and report the results.\n41fx | · Task Three: A marketing manager tested the benefit of soft drinks for curing hangovers. He took fifteen people and got them drunk. The next morning as they awoke, dehydrated and feeling as though they'd licked a camel's sandy feet clean with their tongue, he gave five of them water to drink, five of them Lucozade (a very nice glucose-based UK drink) and the\n7um8 | remaining five a leading brand of cola (this variable is called drink). He measured how well they felt (on a scale from zero equals I feel like death to ten equals I feel really full of beans and healthy) two hours later (this variable is called well). He measured how drunk the person got the night before on a scale of zero equals as sober as a nun to ten equals flapping about like a haddock out of water on the floor in a puddle of their own vomit. Fit a model to see whether people felt better after different drinks when covarying for how drunk they were the night\nuow2 | before.\niat7 | · Task Four: Compute effect sizes for Task Three and report the results.\nywwr | · Task Five: The highlight of the elephant calendar is the annual elephant soccer event in Nepal. A heated argument burns between the African and Asian elephants. In two thousand ten, the president of the Asian Elephant Football Association, an elephant named Boji, claimed that Asian elephants were more talented than their African counterparts. The head of the African Elephant Soccer Association, an elephant called Tunc, issued a press statement that read 'I make it a matter of personal pride never to take seriously any remark made by something that looks like an enormous scrotum'. I was called in to settle things. I collected data from the two types of elephants over a season and recorded how many goals each elephant scored and how many years of experience the elephant had. Analyse the effect of the type of elephant on goal scoring, covarying for the amount of football experience the elephant has.\n0i6j | · Task Six: In Chapter Four (Task Six) we looked at data from people who had been forced to marry goats and dogs and measured their life satisfaction and also how much they like animals. Fit a model predicting life satisfaction from\n87cq | the type of animal to which a person was married and their\n0qs3 | animal liking score.\nz8f7 | · Task Seven: Compare your results for Task Six to those for the corresponding task in Chapter Eleven. What differences do you\n7w7j | notice and why?\n51vd | · Task Eight: In Chapter Ten we compared the number of mischievous acts (mischief two) in people who had invisibility cloaks to those without. Imagine we also had information about the baseline number of mischievous acts in these participants (mischief one). Fit a model to see whether people with invisibility cloaks get up to more mischief than those without when factoring in their baseline level of mischief.",
