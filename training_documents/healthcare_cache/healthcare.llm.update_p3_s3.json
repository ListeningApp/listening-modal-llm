In absence of national policy, patients, physicians, and health care plans are essential - yet often overlooked - components in moving towards green health care reform.\ny7ea | Two. Participation in Green Health Care Initiatives\nnav4 | A green initiative promotes environmental sustainability, with \"sustainability\" used in the traditional sense of the word, in reference to the nineteen eighty-seven Bruntland Commission report, which defined \"sustainable devel-\ngem8 | Despite the lack of a sustainable health care industry in the United States, there are opportunities for green health care reform. In absence of national policy, patients, physicians, and health care plans are essential - yet often overlooked - components in moving towards green health care reform.\ne8nr | opment\" as \"meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\" Although there are critiques of both the possibility and legitimacy of the term, \"sustainability\" remains a key concept in environmental and biomedical ethics.\nk78w | It should be noted that sustainability does not imply a constant level of resource use or carbon emissions if that level is toxic, harmful, or unjust. In rural Ghana, a sustainable health care system may need to increase, expand, and accelerate medical access. In the United States, a sustainable health care system will need to reduce carbon emissions and minimize resource use. Sustainable health care can be achieved through policies, laws, or initiatives.\ng9du | \"Green\" initiatives may be identified by either their ideological intention to make health care more sustainable or by their functional outcome in actual reduction of health care resources. In environmental ethics, as with many social movements including civil rights, feminism, and LGBT liberation, there are philosophical debates as to the preferability of ideological ethics which promote a value, versus functional ethics that produce the desired result, often through law. The former attempts to transform morality by appealing to the intrinsic rightness of the action. The latter is less\nf682 | concerned with the motivation because the outcome benefits the cause.\npbea | In sustainable health care, an \"ideological green initiative\" may have the intention of carbon reduction, but in actuality may be impotent to reduce the emissions of health care because it is poorly-designed, or unsustainable once implemented, or because of positive net emissions. For instance, sending out medical sharps for sterilization may reduce the use of syringes, but the processing and shipping impact may result in more environmental waste. Of course, many ideological green initiatives actually do reduce carbon emissions.\nccpt | On the other hand, \"functionally green initiatives\" will save resources and reduce carbon emissions of health care, but may have no environmental commitment attached to them. For instance, a health care system that purchases the most economical plastic-\n0fpw | ware may incidentally find that these are also the least resource intensive. Moreover, a functionally green initiative may be unethical. Barriers to care because of medical deserts are certainly \"green\" in that fewer people will use health care resources in a particular area, but they are morally problematic. Of course, a functionally green initiative might have a very strong environmental commitment behind it.\ndqn8 | This article recognizes the overlap between ideological and functionally green initiatives and will highlight both in order to provide the widest base of outlets towards sustainability. The distinction between ideological and functionally green initiatives ought to be employed in any discussions of green health care reform. Without a shared understanding of how the term \"green\" is being used, the potential or actual efficacy of the initiative will be difficult to evaluate.\ncop0 | Having thus defined sustainability and the parameters of green initiatives, this section will examine patient and doctor participation of green initiatives in the United States. Patients participate in green initiatives through education, carbon awareness, and ecotherapy. Physicians participate in green initiatives through activism, green health centers, green teams, continuing education, and green prescriptions. These are representative, but not comprehensive, initiatives.\nlhkq | A. Patients\n82ju | Many people are adapting to climate change through concerted efforts to be more sustainable. Just as restaurant patrons are encouraged to ask where their food comes from, opening a dialogue about climate change is on the agenda of doctor's visits. Becoming educated about sustainability in health practices may help patients be more active in their health care. Green education gives patients a valuable tool for advocating sustainability in other areas of medicine. For instance, if a patient knows that sterilization and reuse of instruments reduces resource use at the ophthalmologist, they can then be empowered to ask for sterilized instead of disposable tools at their next primary care check-up. Making this request is a reflection of autonomous decision-making and informed consent.\ny2qo | Two. Carbon Awareness\n1piq | Carbon emissions and resource use are familiar terms in the lexicon of environmentally aware citizens and thus environmentally aware patients. As patients educate themselves about sustainable practices, they may use carbon calculations to determine the carbon impact and alternatives, of medical treatments. Increasingly, studies are published on the carbon emissions of individual medical procedures. Data is available on cataract operations, heart bypass operations, conventional hemodialysis, caesarian sections and vaginal childbirth, reproduction, hysterectomies, Critical Care Unit stays, randomized controlled trials, and a variety of dental and mental health services. Carbon calculations are a valuable tool in determining the environmental effects of health care, while also meeting the desires that many patients have to understand the impact of their health choices on the environment. Although patients might not always opt for lower carbon procedures, just as they may not choose sustainable transportation, they may balance their medical consumption with being intentionally more sustainable in other areas of life, like diet or family planning.\n7fqw | Three. Ecotherapy\nrhaz | In addition to carbon awareness in traditional health care, patients may seek unconventional ecotherapy. Ecotherapy is not necessarily sustainable, but it has environmental resonance. Ecotherapy may encompass \"prescriptions for nature\" such as walks in a forest, going outside more, attending a nature retreat, or participating in other forms of open-air recreation. While the medicalization of nature is problematic, as it may lead to instrumentalization, many patients find\nwak1 | medical legitimacy through the word \"therapy\" and retain use of the term. To be sure, patients may still utilize traditional medicine and may not be concerned with reducing their impact on the environment. In fact, if ecotherapy is used as a conjunctive to traditional medicine it can require more total resources. This inconsistency is part and parcel of health care; even as some patients try to be healthier in one area of life, such as not smoking, they may flout health care wisdom in other areas, like physical activity.\nwtfz | B.
