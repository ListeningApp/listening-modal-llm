You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

p39w | Intention: To enable as many people as possible, in due order, to achieve the understanding which will facilitate the higher (as well as the lower) effects of the Teaching to give the maximum develop- mental help.
g6k3 | Programme: To keep the group operating as a channel for the successively refined impulses from the Source, and to attune the members to be able to perceive these impulses.
xmvn | Characteristics: Enough serious-minded but not indoctrinated people; attitudes suitable for the transmission to act upon; an orientation suitable to accept and work with the materials provided or indicated by the Representative for the time being of the Teaching.
v2zu | Modus Operandi: Meetings, reading, 'audition', performances, practices, theoretical and practical study, organisation of environ- ment.
z2nh | Deterioration: Evidenced by the acceptance of simplifications, contraction of activity, messianic and panacea thinking, hierarchical behaviour patterns believed to be sacrosanct, literal acceptance of the figurative and vice-versa, hagiography, providing social and psychological stimuli and/or reassurances, offering scope for per- sonality-projection, assuaging desires for attention, substituting itself for diversions of a political, organisational, religious, psycho-

15ri | Contrast this with the kind of group, that of the 'man of learn- ing' surrounded by others, of whom Al-Thauri says 'Be assured that he is an impostor and a fraud: because if he were to tell them the truth, they would hate him'.

e9bu | Prerequisites for a Student of Sufism
usfq | Q: Can you give me an essential prerequisite for a student of Sufism? I think that it is to be misunderstood.
4jnl | A: One essential is that the student should not attempt to impose his own conditions of study or criteria of progress.
ows8 | On understanding, a student should not think that he can under- stand just because he wants to.
qkak | A THOUSAND WILL CALL YOU AN UNBELIEVER
39ur | On being understood, it was the great Junaid of Baghdad who said:
nlm3 | 'Nobody attains to the degree of Truth until a thousand sincere people have pronounced him an unbeliever.'
muf5 | But the sincerity he is talking about here is not real sincerity, absolute objectivity. It is the sincerity of people who imagine themselves to be sincere because they believe certain things, whether they know these things or not.
lqjf | The sincere act, reflecting the real sincerity, is defined by Abu- Yaqub al-Susi, in Kalabadhi's Taaruf:
7z7b | 'The really sincere act is the one which is known by no record- ing angel, by no demon to afflict it, nor by the self, to become prideful of it.'
tv8z | This means that human beings have to become aware of their essence, the real part of themselves, which speaks when the other elements are silent.
wj6v | THE INSECT
ax4d | In Fiki ma Fihi, Rumi says that there is a minute insect in a field, which cannot be seen at first. But as soon as it makes a sound, people are alerted and see it. People, similarly, are lost in the field of this world, their surroundings and preoccupations. The human essence within is concealed by all this disturbance.
gtbn | 177
ui4d | THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME
2h4x | A Chinese restaurant manager, asked in a London court to identify a man who was appealing against sentence for stealing chickens from a Chinese restaurant, said: 'All white men look the same to me.'*
0s3f | What is seen is not always understood in its qualities which may be relevant to a given perception, as with the Chinese and the white man. The Chinese, in Rumi's terms, is 'lost' in the field of his own world. The white man, in the expectation of the court, was in his appearance instrumental: that is to say, identification of his appearance would lead to certain facts. The description, though necessary, was secondary.
1ajd | The student should also regard such things as lectures as instru- mental, not descriptive, remembering what Faris relates that Abu- Abdullah Shikthal answered when asked why he did not lecture:
qj5b | 'Existence is not real, and it is wrong to speak of what is not real. Words cannot be used to describe the Real, so why should I speak?'
15wh | The student must be prepared for experience and intakes which do not affect the ordinary consciousness where words and emotions exercise their functions.
ad3x | Although 'the world' is not real, since what we perceive of it depends on our sense-perceptions which may be faulty, trained or changed: and it is hence not any kind of an absolute, the instru- mental function means that it can be employed for teaching pur- poses. This is why an 'essential prerequisite' which you ask for is certainly that this principle should be registered in your mind. As the Sufi Gharib-Nawaz puts it:
6zdx | 'Every particle of dust is a cup wherein all the world can be seen.'
lwg2 | Some things in the world conduce towards understanding and some towards a greater involvement with the world and con- sequent lack of perception and false understanding.

5mk0 | Futuh al-Ghaib invites his hearers to think of good and evil as two fruits from the same tree. 'Approach the tree itself and become its guard and attendant servant and acquire knowledge of these two branches and of the two fruits and their neighbourhoods and remain near that branch which yields sweet fruit - then it will be your food and source of strength and beware lest you should approach the other branch and eat the fruit thereof and thus its bitterness should kill you ... and when these fruits are brought before you and the sweet cannot be distinguished from the bitter and you start eating them ... you may put the bitter one in your mouth.'

m3bl | In Step is out of Step
7ul5 | Q: Can you say something about the technical use of the term 'The Madman' for the Sufi?
1b57 | A: There is a Persian saying: 'To a madman, it is enough to shout HOO!' (Diwana-ra HOOI bas ast). The repetition of the syllable HOO is a part of Sufi rites. Hence this saying indicates, to the intellectualist, that you merely shout this word and the well- conditioned disciple starts capering; and capering, as the uninitiated would think, without rhyme or reason. But the Sufi prides himself upon being, in the eyes of the uninstructed, 'a madman'; and so he uses the phrase himself to indicate that at a certain stage of initia- tion, the one syllable, once repeated, is enough to sustain him and produce in him the state which he desires.
rwom | This brings us straight away to the difficulties of a practice which is inexplicable to one set of people, yet completely LIVED by another.
w1qt | The books that have been written by Sufis are partial ones; they have to be read at certain times, perhaps in conjunction with certain movements, or certain attunements, otherwise their meaning is but fragmentary like a great deal of other initiatory material which has been taken at its face value by 'outer' observers. It is as if a man were to lick the outside of an apple and pronounce it pleasant to the nose but seemingly devoid of nourishment.
emp6 | Some people may say that they will not seek illumination or other-worldly truths if it involves their capering about. This is like saying that you will drive your car, providing that nobody is allowed to fill the fuel tank. Some say that they want something that they can understand before they will 'go into it'. This can be like saying that you will have to drive the train, or you will not travel in it at all.
vm2i | It is this 'outer' attitude towards initiatory systems which gives rise to false cults which purport to give you 'secrets' that you can understand. Except that they do not, in fact, give you such
u7au | 180
1ti5 | things at all.
vpp5 | If you feel that you can understand a poem, providing that you are given time or peace to absorb it, and will not consider it otherwise, you can be cutting yourself off from a poem which may have been written specifically to be read or recited only under certain circumstances, which themselves may involve a negation of the conditions which you seek to impose. One example is conven- tion, which you have created or copied from someone else. It is not enough to claim that these canons are sacrosanct They are not, cannot be - and cannot be shown to be.
y9yd | The famous phrase: 'C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas <LATEX>l a</LATEX> guerre' is a typical example of something that should not be, according to the Sufi belief. Indeed, it CANNOT be.
rwaf | There is an interesting saying involving the use of the technical term 'madman' for 'Sufi':
xbze | 'A fool can easily drop a rock into a well, but a hundred scholars may not be able to raise it out again. It may need a Sufi.'
p2wh | This saying refers to the difficulty which certain intellectuals (scholars) have in dealing with fixed ideas or psychological prob- lems (a fool).
uzhc | What seems madness to some may be sanity to others: and, of course the converse. In this connection, remember the words of Sheikh Abdullah Ansari of Herat:
f2h2 | 'The skilled artisan uses the same iron to make a horseshoe As he does for a polished mirror for the King.'
8z32 | Thirty thousand Americans die each year as a result of taking medicines prescribed by their doctors. Ten times that number need hospital treatment because of the adverse reactions produced by medicines .*
0yaq | What may be good for some is certainly not at all good for others. The random application of Sufic and other processes, taken from books or transmitted by shallow imitators, is the madness: not the measured and understood application of real specifics to properly diagnosed conditions.

0g5c | 'Dye your Prayer-Rug with Wine'
ql4n | IN one of his best-known poems, the great poet Hafiz says that you should dye your prayer-carpet with wine if your teacher tells you to do so.
eyg6 | This advice, alarming though it may be to the limited mind of the literalist, is extensively admired by Sufis - and not only for its poetic beauty in the Persian original.
00l8 | Sufis admire this admonition because it is a classical example of multiple-meaning, where a precise developmental formula is rendered in several dimensions. Let us look at some of the ingre- dients separately, which, together, give the instruction and the content which can only be called a living exercise: -
ojx3 | 1. Shock: 'Dye your rug with wine' is designed to shock anyone whose faith is based on the conditioning, e.g., that 'Wine can only mean something evil';
7o0d | 2. Allegory: wine stands for an inner experience, similar to 'mystical rapture' in other systems;
7atk | 3. Obedience: the orders of the teacher are absolute;
opr3 | 4. Occasion: the teacher orders one to do something when it is indicated for one's progress. He does not say, 'Dye your rug constantly", not "Until you dye your rug you cannot be a Sufi'. He says: 'When I tell you to dye your rug - dye it'.
rsan | 5. Analogy: Just as the prayer-carpet is not prayer, is rather, an external thing, so, too, on that level, is wine an external thing, and therefore secondary. Similarly, obedience to the teacher, though taken by the superficial as implying a great sacrifice and high merit, is only of the crude and superficial order in the relationship between master and disciple as rug is to prayer and wine is to real mystical experience.
3l5p | 6. Multiplicity of exercises: It is not said that 'Dyeing the rug with wine is the golden key'. On the contrary, it is more than hinted that this is just one activity, one part of a measured and known activity which will lead somewhere. This is the most powerful distinguishing sign of this system. To the extent to which
keiw | 182
h95r | the student can learn that he is working within a complex and refined system, and only to that extent, will he be able to move out of crude fanaticism and superficiality. The followers of 'systems' are always looking for-or think that they have found - the single practice, or the only one magic wand, which will give them what they want: illumination or whatever it is.
8bxq | The value of this teaching cannot be over-emphasised. It will deter and annoy those who cannot profit from it. It will be utterly useless to those who want to turn the Sufi way into a mere cult. It will show up and make obvious those who are simply copyists or romantics, because they will be unable to benefit from the terms in which we have analysed it.
bzwy | And all this is contained in a few lines of something which a literary observer imagines is perhaps only lyricism and the poetic outpourings of a man who approves of ecstatogenic processes.
icip | Until the real spirit of such technical documents as this is appreciated by the student, we are not dealing with a real student at all; a consumer of poetry, perhaps, a follower, perhaps, a poseur, even, who doesn't know that he is such. But we are not dealing with someone who, in this condition, can progress beyond the exterior.
x0k3 | I have actually heard of people who have set themselves up as teachers and who drink wine and ask their disciples to do so, in an attempt to 'follow what Hafiz said'.
wh96 | Any comment on such doubly absurd mimetic behaviour should not, I believe, be on any higher level than the joke:
2ukf | 'What effect did the banana diet have on your wife?'
jtpi | "Well, she isn't any thinner, but you should see her climb trees !'

mj7h | The Master-Dyer
3avc | Q: What kind of planning can Sufis do that people are un- familiar with in current cultural terms?
j9bn | A: Try this example:
pnz1 | THE KING AND THE SUFI
0jt4 | There was once a King who found nobody in his realm wise or great enough to succeed him. So he spent some years in enquiries and study until a possible successor, named Arif el Arifin, was located. Now the King, perplexed by the problem of how to intro- duce the wise man in the face of the inevitable inertia, jealousy and expectations which existed in the absence of a wise man's constant presence and recognition, asked Arif himself to make a plan.
mk0a | 'Who are the people most notorious in your realm for their envy and inflexibility?' Arif asked.
zn35 | 'The dyers of wool and cloth' said the King. 'Each one thinks that he is a master-dyer, and that his techniques and knowledge are the best. These men combine with one another very seldom, and then generally only to oppose the occasional intruder or minor dyer trying to rise in the profession.'
rrn2 | 'Very well' said Arif; 'cause it to be announced to the dyers that the world's greatest master of their art is coming to take up his abode in your capital city.'
foid | When the dyers heard the talk of this possibility spread through- out the city, and were shown samples of Arif the Master Dyer's work, which was magnificent, they went into transports of rage. So bitterly did they begin to hate their unknown rival that it very soon became obvious to almost everyone else that powerful emo- tion, not justice or fidelity to their craft, lay behind their vicious, bitter and often irrational denunciations of the interloper.
152h | Now the people of the country in general whom the dyers had
