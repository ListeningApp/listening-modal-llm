We assume that this relationship between covariate and outcome variable holds true for all groups of participants, which is known as the assumption of homogeneity of regression slopes. Think of the assumption like this: imagine a scatterplot for each group of participants with the covariate on one axis, the outcome on the other, and a regression line summarizing their relationship. If the assumption is met then the regression lines should look similar (i.e., the values of B in each group should be equal).\nmj9m | Let's make this concept a bit more concrete. Remember that the main example in this chapter looks at whether different doses of puppy therapy affect happiness when including love of puppies as a covariate. The homogeneity of regression slopes assumption means that the relationship between the outcome (dependent variable) and the covariate is the same in each of our treatment groups. Figure thirteen point three shows a scatterplot with regression line that summarizes this relationship (i.e., the relationship between love of puppies, the covariate, and the outcome, participant's happiness) for the three experimental conditions (shown in different panels). There is a positive relationship (the regression line slopes upwards from left to right) between love of puppies and participant's happiness in both the control (left panel) and fifteen-minute conditions (middle panel). In fact, the slopes of the lines for these two groups are very similar, showing that the relationship between happiness and love of puppies is very similar in these two groups. This situation is an example of homogeneity of regression slopes. However, in the thirty-minute condition (right panel) there is a slightly negative relationship between happiness and love of puppies. The slope of this line differs from the slopes in the other two groups, suggesting heterogeneity of regression slopes (because the relationship between happiness and love of puppies is different in the thirty-minute group compared to the other two groups).\n94h3 | Although in a traditional ANCOVA heterogeneity of regression slopes is a bad thing, there are situations where you might expect regression slopes to differ across groups and that variability may be interesting.\n9jx1 | For example, when research is conducted across different locations, you might expect the effects to vary across those locations. Imagine you had a new treatment for backache, and you recruit several physiotherapists to try it out in different hospitals. The effect of the treatment is likely to differ across these hospitals (because therapists will differ in expertise, the patients they see will have different problems and so on). As such, heterogeneity of regression slopes is not a bad thing per se. If you have violated the assumption of homogeneity of regression slopes, or if the variability in regression slopes is an interesting hypothesis in itself, then you can explicitly model this variation using multilevel linear models (see Chapter twenty-one).\nc3lz | Thirteen point four point three What to do when assumptions are violated\n8bwk | A bootstrap for the model parameters and post hoc tests can be used so that these, at least, are robust. The bootstrap won't help for the F-tests though. There is a robust variant of ANCOVA that can be implemented using R, and we'll discuss this in Section thirteen point eight.\nez9s | Thirteen point five Conducting ANCOVA using SPSS Statistics\nmqot | Thirteen point five point one General procedure\noc99 | The general procedure is much the same as for any linear model, so remind yourself of the steps for fitting a linear model. Figure thirteen point four shows a simpler overview of the process that highlights some of the specific issues for ANCOVA-style models. As with any analysis, begin by graphing the data and looking for and correcting sources of bias.\ngipz | Figure thirteen point four General procedure for analysis of covariance\nb4wj | We have already looked at the data and the data file. To remind you, the data file is set out like Table thirteen point one and contains three columns: a coding variable called Dose (one equals control, two equals fifteen minutes, three equals thirty minutes), a variable called Happiness containing the scores for the person's happiness, and a variable called Puppy_love containing the scores for love of puppies from zero to seven. The thirty rows correspond to each person's scores on these three variables.\n5xlt | Thirteen point five point three Testing the independence of the treatment\n9bz4 | variable and covariate\npujl | In Section thirteen point four point one, I mentioned that if the covariate and group means (independent variable) are independent then the interpretation of ANCOVA models is a lot more straightforward. In this case, the covariate is love of puppies, so we'd want to check that the mean level of love of puppies is roughly equal across the three puppy therapy groups by fitting a linear model with Puppy_love as the outcome and Dose as the predictor.\n3rqe | Output thirteen point three shows that the main effect of dose is not significant, F two comma twenty-seven equals one point nine eight, P equals zero point one six, which shows that the average level of love of puppies was roughly the same in the three puppy therapy groups. In other words, the means for love of puppies in Table thirteen point two are not significantly different across the control, fifteen-and thirty-minute groups. This result is good news for using love of puppies as a covariate in the model.\nnsi3 | Thirteen point five point four The main analysis\nnil3 | Most of the General Linear Model (GLM) procedures in SPSS Statistics contain the facility to include one or more covariates. For designs that don't involve\n68a1 | repeated measures it is easiest to include covariates by selecting Analyze General Linear Model GLM GEN Univariate to activate the dialog box in Figure thirteen point five. Drag the variable Happiness into the box labelled Dependent Variable (or click\nseik | ), drag Dose into the box labelled Fixed Factor(s) and drag Puppy_love into the box labelled Covariate(s).\noq7c | Thirteen point five point five Contrasts\nz4mi | There are various dialog boxes that can be accessed from the main dialog box. If a covariate is selected, the post hoc tests are disabled because the tests that we used in the previous chapter are not designed for models that include covariates.\nhkft | However, comparisons can be done by clicking Contrasts \njai3 | to access the\np57i | Contrasts dialog box in Figure thirteen point six. You cannot enter codes to specify user-defined contrasts (but see SPSS Tip thirteen point one); instead you can select one of the standard contrasts that we met in Table twelve point six. In this example, there was a control condition (coded as the first group), so a sensible set of contrasts would be simple contrasts comparing each experimental group to the control (this results in the same contrasts as dummy coding). Click the drop-down list and select a type of contrast (in this case Simple) from this list. For simple contrasts you need to specify the reference category (i.e., the category against which all other groups are compared). By default the last category is used, which for our data is the thirty-minute group. We need to change the reference category to be the control group, which is the first category (assuming that you coded control as one). We make this change by selecting\nu5ug | First. Having selected a contrast, click Change\ni9k5 | to register the\n20z2 | selection. Figure thirteen point six shows the completed dialog box. Click Continue to return to the main dialog box.\n4cgs | Thirteen point five point six Other options\n```",
