        "content": "rw3z | overuse of technology has on both the parent and child's ability to develop emotional bonds. The addition of screens into our already busy lives can add further strain on important face-to-face connection time between parents and their children.\nvoc3 | While use of technology is more and more of a social requirement at even very young ages, for many parents it is also a needed crutch, often due to financial necessity. If all the adults in the home need to work, screen time can become the babysitter or give the parents the break that they need just to make dinner or maintain the bare basics of their home. Even though we are ostensibly more connected than ever through our phones, tablets and other devices, studies have shown that, in adults in the United States aged nineteen to thirty-two, higher social media use can lead to feeling more socially isolated and emotionally disconnected than people with lower social media use. I also see how emotionally overwhelming it can be when the absence of face-to-face contact enables a certain boldness or even meanness from people that they would not necessarily enact in person. Online attacks and rejections of others can cause a great deal of loss and psychological injury. As in all levels, there can be damage and trauma at the local culture and communities level, but there can, of course, also be healing. When someone grows up in a home or town where no one really looks and feels like they do, finding an online community where their voice and experiences are received, honored and even celebrated can be deeply healing to their sense of self and connection.\nhuha | School culture is another important aspect to this level, since most children spend the majority of their waking hours in the classroom, cafeterias and schoolyard. I once had a client who joked that you should never trust anyone who said they liked their junior high school experience. I later learned that this comment was the sarcastic mask in front of some very painful and traumatic events she experienced in early adolescence. Now in her forties, this woman had lasting scars from the social hierarchies and mean girl culture at her junior high school. She had experienced overt social rejection and repeated emotional and verbal cruelty from her peers. Coupled with the highly competitive academic culture of her school, the\notjb | educational and social pressures became too unbearable and thus she attempted to take her life at age thirteen.\n1rbe | While I was writing this book, my father sent me a newspaper article in which he was interviewed about the sexual assault he experienced from his high school principal over forty years earlier. In the article, he is quoted as relating the alcoholism, drug addiction and mental illness of his adult life as having its origin in the profound shame he experienced from being sexually assaulted at school. When I spoke to him about it, he also added that the years of corporal punishment and the Catholic school culture of overt disapproval further reinforced and solidified his shame. His traumas at this level had a lasting effect on his ability to bond with me as my parent. When I was eight years old, my father went into rehab, but his sobriety did not initially improve our relationship as much as both of us might have anticipated. Although the alcoholism and drug addiction were treated, his trauma, shame and deep-rooted feeling of unworthiness to be loved-even from his own child-remained for decades. My father had a strong desire to be available to me, but the absence of healing from his high school traumas and the ensuing shame left him, in many ways, incapable of bonding, connecting and responding in the nurturing, present and attuned ways that both of us wanted.\nz978 | How safe we feel on the streets of our neighborhood, whether we have to lock our front door or not, how welcome and embraced we feel from the communities that we encounter and whether the leaders of our various communities are benevolent or unkind are all factors that I see as impacting our sense of safety, security and ability to explore. Traumas that arise from bullying, community violence or school shootings should not be underestimated. But although many different types of attachment traumas can happen at this level, it is also a level that can offer needed healing and attachment repair. The homes of friends, spiritual communities, substance abuse support groups, sports and dance teams or online communities can become our safe havens where we are freer to be ourselves, are understood and are seen and loved for who we are.\nqxdv | Social Level\n06co | The next outer dimension in this nested model refers to the larger societal structures and systems that we live in, such as our economic, legal, medical and political systems, as well as our religious institutions. It is at the social level that prejudice and oppression are institutionalized through the laws and power structures that either favor or discriminate against people based on age, race, sex, class, physical ability, sexual orientation and relationship orientation. Who is considered legally legitimate or not at a societal level, who has access to health care and education, whether or not you have rights to your children or whether or not you are subject to the institutionalization of birth practices that can interfere with parent-child bonding are all factors that can be traumatizing and attachment-compromising. Additionally, whether or not we are a part of a legally protected class has massive implications for how safe and secure we feel in the world. The sociologist Johan Galtung refers to this as structural violence. Distinguished from physical violence (yet often intertwined), structural violence refers to a type of violence that is often invisible yet intricately built into social structures. People's lives are complicated, confined or even lost because of heterosexism, classism, racism, ableism and sexism. Structural violence may be less obvious and direct than physical violence, but it is just as impactful and harmful. It creates a disparity between a person's potential reality-the life they could conceivably live-compared to the limited reality that they find themselves in.\njei2 | Societal issues including homophobia, racism, sexism and mononormativity do not exist solely at the societal level. They influence and play out in very real and impactful ways, including the neighborhoods and homes we live in, which schools we have access to and what funding they receive, how we approach or avoid others and how we are treated by teachers, taxi drivers or clerks at the grocery store. A black man is likely to have a very different experience of how safe and secure he feels when walking past a police officer than a white woman in the same scenario. In a time when mass shootings are rampant in the United States and amid the current political climate, a person of color who practices Islam will likely feel very differently\ntti3 | walking into a mosque than a white Catholic person walking into a church. These societal experiences can then trickle all the way down to the self level, where social-level issues become internalized as forms of shame or self-loathing, again hindering one's ability to bond, attach and connect. Studies have shown that children with socioeconomic risks are more likely to develop disorganized attachment and that children are at an increased risk of disorganized attachment when they are in non-maternal care for more than sixty hours a week, due to parental work hours.",
