You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

z2gn | 418 of Epoxomicin for the proteasome(83, 87-89). While iBEp is still highly active against the
mgx1 | 419 proteasome, we do find that the Biotin-PEG24 linker moderately reduces the efficacy of iBEp
x0do | 420 relative to Epoxomicin (Fig S4G). We therefore chose doses of inhibitor where the effective
r8qt | 421 concentration of the inhibitor was similar to previous studies using Epoxomicin alone and well 422 within the acceptable range of efficacy given how potent Epoxomicin is as a proteasome 423 inhibitor.
sga6 | 424
7af5 | 425 To test the permeability of our compounds, we incubated primary cortical neurons with iBEp 426 over a time course and prepared both cytosolic and plasma membrane-enriched fractions.
uds2 | 427 Samples were immunoblotted and probed for cytosolic marker Actin and membrane protein 428 GluR1 to validate our fractionation (Fig 4B). We found specific biotin signal corresponding to
jp0o | 429 covalent inhibition of the proteasome by iBEp only in the membrane fraction, and not in the
akty | 430 cytosol, over a 24 hour incubation in primary neurons (Fig 4B). As an orthogonal measure of cell 43. penetrance, we tested whether the activity of cytosolic proteasomes was affected by iBEp
olz9 | 432 treatment. We subjected cytosolic and membrane fractions from iBEp-treated neurons to LLVY-
5rex | based proteasome activity assays. Cytosolic proteasome activity remains completely intact from
hiwi | 434 iBEp-treated neurons compared to DMSO controls, but proteasome activity in the membrane
zsp2 | 435 fraction is almost entirely abrogated (Fig 4C). This suggests that neuroproteasomes are inhibited following iBEp incubation but cytosolic proteasomes remain unaffected.

6hya | 437
h0lh | 438 To further validate our neuroproteasome-specific inhibitors, we sought a cellular functional
u5th | 439 readout of whether our cell-impermeant inhibitors affected cytosolic proteasomes. One of the
kelb | 440 most penetrant and robust consequences of total proteasome inhibition is the induction of
xtdb | 441 autophagy as a cellular response mechanism to compensate for the lack of proteasomal
f48k | 442 degradation(31-33, 90-92). To test this, we assayed three autophagy markers, p62 levels,
pg0s | 443 LC3bI/II ratios, and Ulk1 levels. Each are robust markers of different steps of autophagy. p62
aiap | 444 has been demonstrated to be rapidly induced upon proteasome inhibition and LC3bI/II induction 445 is thought to be slower, while Ulk1 is important for early phagosome formation(93). Cytosolic 446 proteasome inhibition has been reproducibly demonstrated to induce a strong increase in p62
55v8 | 447 levels in neurons(31, 32, 34, 93). Consistent with these reported observations, we find a strong induction of p62 and little to no change in LC3bI/II following 12 hours of total proteasome inhibition with epoxomicin (Fig 4D). However, when we treat primary neurons with iBEp, we 450 observe no change in either p62 or LC3bI/II levels (Fig 4D). These data are a functional 451 demonstration that iBEp is cell-impermeable to neurons and signify that specifically inhibiting 452 neuroproteasomes over all proteasomes does not induce compensatory autophagic degradation, 453 and together, validate the use of iBEp as a neuroproteasome-specific inhibitor.
6sol | 448 449
gtra | 454 455 One important advantage of iBEp is the ability to use over extended timecourses, a property 456 necessary to understand how neuroproteasomes shape the proteome, if at all. We hypothesized 457 that prolonged neuroproteasome inhibition may reveal not only the turnover of candidate 458 substrates, but also affect the solubility and aggregation of proteins. If true, this observation may
bhjq | 459 provide some explanatory power for how neuroproteasome dysfunction (driven by ApoE4 or
67jy | 460 other mechanisms) could underlie deficits in proteostasis with potential relevance for
u6kp | 46 neurodegenerative disorders. We incubated DIV12-14 primary cortical neurons with cell-
vpph | 462 impermeable proteasome inhibitors in biological duplicate for 1 and 6 hours, prepared sarkosyl-
03xu | 463 soluble and sarkosyl-insoluble samples, and then collected and processed samples for
54ay | 464 quantitative TMT-based proteomics (Fig 4E). We first analyzed proteins which increase over the
aohh | 465 time-course in the soluble fraction. We recapitulate our previously published data and find that
pb0r | 466 neuroproteasome inhibition induces the accumulation of previously reported neuroproteasome
5j88 | 467 substrates such as Rgs4, c-Fos, Sox4, Snurf, Arc, and Bex2 in the soluble fraction (Fig 4F, G,
nfec | 468 Table S3)(4). Importantly, we also do not see accumulation of classical ubiquitin-proteasome
b5nq | 469 substrates such as PSD-95, Homer1, or GKAP(94-96) (Fig 4G). We also fail to observe an
p2om | 470 increase in p62, LC3b, GabarapL1, or any other marker of autophagy(1, 97) (Fig 4G). This
ynxq | 471 provides orthogonal evidence that iBEp does not detectably penetrate cells and demonstrates the 472 validity of this approach to determine the consequences of selective neuroproteasome inhibition.
uoj7 | 473 These validate our previous data identifying neuroproteasome substrates(4) and extend them by
vwkw | 474 demonstrating neuroproteasome-dependent substrate turnover in a context without modulating 475 neuronal activity and over extended periods of time.
tutj | 476
xclk | 477 Next, our quantitative proteomics analysis revealed a selective pattern of protein insolubility
pah4 | 478 following neuroproteasome inhibition. We find that only 52 proteins become sarkosyl-insoluble
2avs | 479 in response to neuroproteasome inhibition (Fig 4H, Table S3), in contrast with over 250 proteins
d0nn | 480 increasing in the soluble fraction (Fig 4F). To narrow in on this list, we quantitated which
nv44 | 481 proteins show a greater than log-fold change in the insoluble fraction, but showed no change in
l6cw | 482 the soluble fraction (Fig 4I). This analysis identified only four proteins which show significant
z8po | 483 increases in the insoluble fraction relative to the soluble fraction (Ckmt1, Tau, Taf15, and
wm8m | 484 Hspb1) and one protein which significantly increases in the soluble fraction and showed no
fmj9 | 485 change in the insoluble fraction (Plk2) (Fig 4I). Of note, Taf15 has previously been observed in 486 detergent-insoluble fractions of brains from Alzheimer's patients, correlated with both Amyloid
50jk | 487 ß and Tau insolubility(98-101). Ckmt1 has also been found in Neurofibrillary tangles and interacting with phosphorylated Tau inclusions(102-104).

n7w8 | 493 Our findings raise the intriguing possibility that a fraction of endogenous mouse Tau becomes
