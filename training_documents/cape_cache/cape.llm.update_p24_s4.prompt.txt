You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

Convocation can only deduce that the delay is deliberate. If we do not see evidence of correspondence to that effect.
94ul | 10. The following questions arise to be answered?
0vdu | i. What is the justification for the undue delay in processing Dr. Essien-Baidoo's application?
a230 | ii. What is the evidence that the documents were sent out to external assessors within the time limit set out in the Criteria for the Appointments and Promotions Committee?
dvoe | iii. What prevented the Provost and the Directorate of Human Resources from officially updating the applicant on the application status before the first 12th May, 2021.
677t | iv. What prevented the Vice-Chancellor from sending the papers to fresh assessors if the old ones were delayed unduly?
5hk6 | The delays amount to a clear breach of the letter and the spirit of the Criteria for Appointments and Promotions without any reasonable justification. Furthermore, Dr. Essien-Baidoo is demoralized and indicated his intention to exit the University, especially as applications of his juniors have been fast-tracked and promoted ahead of him. This confirms our earlier suspicion that the delay is deliberate to favour some people so they can occupy administrative positions or due to certain reasons Convocation might know.
viei | E. Concerns on Appointment to Positions
rk0j | i. The 2016 Statutes of UCC provide for the Appointment of Dean for the Centre for International Education, now called the Office of International Relations. For the avoidance of doubt, statute 26.2 reads, "There shall be a Dean of the Centre for International Education to be known as the Dean of International Education, who shall be of Professorial rank and appointed by the Vice-Chancellor on behalf of Council."
c6x9 | ii. There is no express provision for the Appointment of a Vice-Dean of International Relations. It is to be noted that provision has been made under statutes 19.8 - 19.11, which clearly applies to Vice-Deans of Faculty/School, as the whole of Statutes 19 is on Faculties and Schools.
g5at | iii. Recently the Vice-Chancellor appointed a Vice-Dean of the Office of International Relations on behalf of the Council without recourse to any criteria or process. It is to be noted that the Vice-Chancellor's discretion in appointment is unfettered and does not extend to such appointments as prescribed by the University Statutes.
re3j | iv. The Academic Board has not approved the creation of such a position.
6z45 | V. Be as it may, the said unwarranted appointment was also done without consideration for seniority and experience. Given that the Dean must be of a Professorial rank, it is prudent that even if the Vice-Chancellor wanted to ignore the Statutes, he could have fallen on one of the numerous professors in the University for Appointment to the position of a Vice-Dean as clearly stated in the Statute.
20af | Conclusions/Reliefs
huae | i. A declaration that the promotion of a senior member, as aforesaid hereinafter, to the rank of Associate Professor is in breach of the Criteria for Appointment and Promotion of Senior Member of the University.
rblh | ii. The undue delays in the processing of promotion documents of some Senior Members, to the rank of Associate Professor is unfair, tantamount to abuse of process and offensive to the spirit and letter of the Criteria for Appointment and Promotion of Senior Members.
gl5i | iii. All stalled promotion applications including that of Dr. Samuel Essien-Baidoo, Dr. Adeladza Kofi Amegah, Dr. Patrick Kafui Akakpo and Dr. Harold Aryeetey should be expedited.
x0yg | iv. The application of the recommendations in Report of the 2016 Ad Hoc Committee on UTAG Grievances to any pending application in a manner that overrides the Statutes and Criteria for the appointment and promotion of Senior Members should cease forthwith.
mjt8 | v. The Vice-Chancellor should explain the cause of the undue delay in promotion of some Convocation Members.
htcn | vi. The appointment of a Senior Lecturer as the Vice-Dean of the Centre for International Education was unlawful and discriminatory and tantamount to abuse of process.
86d4 | vii. The University should set up a committee to draw up a policy document for appointing and creating of offices that is not addressed by the statute.
z7qp | viii. This report, sensitive as it may be, Convocation is very resolute in demanding all the answers as requested and further state that the Vice Chancellor and his Management Team should as a matter of importance and urgency, deal with all the issues raised and
6t1g | any other(s) which has not come to the attention of Convocation appropriately and convincingly to engender good corporate governance and transparency in the management and administration of the University of Cape Coast.
cpls | Report of the special Committee of Board of Convocation: Promotional issues and its related developments
m50n | Introduction
eztf | . The impetus to form this Committee came from a groundswell of complaints regarding promotions, appointments and interpretation of the University's policies.
bwsu | . Based on documents in our possession, the College of Health and Allied Sciences seems to be suffering from promotion-related issues; therefore, most of the lecturers, especially the clinicians, do satisfy their core mandate but are not putting in their maximum effort to continue to enhance teaching and especially research, and also perform their affiliate duties at the teaching hospitals as it used to be.
oqod | . Also, scholars who have contributed to UCC's current ranking and grooming the medical school to be number one in Ghana, their promotions are treated with disdain.
tey0 | . Intelligence picked indicates that promotions delays are creating some tension in the University and disaffection because there is undue advantage given to others.
ghiv | . Additionally, this University's appointment is based on seniority and experience, but this practice has not been adhered to.
o5ts | · Application for promotion criteria is applied selectively.
hd7d | · Members believe there is much misinterpretation of statutes and policies by management and boards.
ehux | . There are communication lapses in promotion/appointment decisions
poxj | Committee Members
2xvb | · To bring clarity to issues a 4 -member committee was constituted to investigate and seek clarifications from management and council regarding these anomalies.
m1hx | · The 4 - member committee comprises:

qdn7 | Findings
dib4 | The Committee after its interactions with Convocation Members and Management of Schools, . Colleges and the University, a common trend runs through their narratives. Though not exhaustive, below are the issue found out by the Committee:
yvqj | " Delays in the processing of promotional documents at both the College and the Department, thereby affecting their arrears and pentions or superannuation.
vz2f | " There are challenges relating to external assessment of their promotional documents:
wyu0 | · The time it takes to receive an update on assessment outcome is too long (some colleagues have outstanding issues over 3-5 years)
s8xw | · Clarity of assessment results of assessment communicated; an example is "Two reports received to submit two new assessors" even though they have re-submitted the names of assessors countless times
afv1 | · Delay and clarity on some decisions taken on the promotion of some colleagues at A&P
fwf1 | " That issues revolving around fellowship and the acquisition of terminal degrees before colleagues are considered for promotion to a higher rank pose a demotivation to colleagues who have contributed immensely to the University's achievements
