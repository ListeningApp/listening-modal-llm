You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

a0mb | 9.3.3.2 Cross-shelf distribution
ki8m | Pacific hake form dense daytime aggregations on the continental shelf break and near the edges of mid-shelf banks and basins, sometimes extending 40 km or more offshore over water depths as great as 2000 m (Bailey et al., 1982; Dorn, 1995; Ware and McFarlane, 1995; Swartzman, 2001). Pacific hake are found primarily between depths of 50 and 500 m during the day, most commonly in aggregations at depths of between 150 and 250 m.
km8w | 242
wzno | Figure 9.4 Left, shaded area represents summer distribution of adults on shelf and slope in recent years. Right, oblong areas represent variable, patchy offshore spawning locations, inferred from recent collections of larvae and young juveniles and reports of a northward shift of spawn- ing location in the literature. Arrows indicate the general direction of movement and migration in both panels. The 200-m isobath is shown in grey. This figure reprinted from review by Ressler et al. (2007).
xagm | From south to north in the CCLME, Pacific hake aggregations increase in depth and move further offshore along the continental shelf to the shelf break (Swartzman, 1997). This pattern probably reflects ontogenetic effects on depth preferences, that is, smaller, younger juvenile fish do not migrate as far north as older Pacific hake (Hollowed, 1992; Dorn, 1995; Ware and McFarlane, 1995), and juvenile Pacific hake exhibit a greater preference for shallower shelf loca- tions than mature fish (Methot and Dorn, 1995; Saunders and McFarlane, 1997). At least in some years, hake have been shown to be preferentially aggre- gated off the shelf break at the depth of the sub-surface poleward-flow of the California Undercurrent (Agostini et al., 2006).
iwn5 | Temperature gradients may be an important mechanism driving Pacific hake depth distribution, but preferred temperature ranges for Pacific hake have not been established. The distribution of Pacific hake across years demonstrates that they are able to live within a range of temperatures. Temperature and depth are correlated with other factors, including currents and prey availability. Swartzman (2001) suggests that euphausiids sense and orient to oceanographic factors (e.g. bottom depth, temperature and flow) and Pacific hake sense and orient to euphausiids.

jfsr | 9.3.3.3 Diel migrations
u15r | Adult Pacific hake form pelagic schools during the day, mostly between the depths of 50 and 500 m, then disperse and migrate towards the surface at dusk; during spawning, they neither feed nor migrate vertically (Best, 1963; Nelson and Larkins, 1970; Bailey et al., 1982; Stauffer, 1985). The vertical migration is usually thought to facilitate predation upon fish and zooplankton in the water column (Alton and Nelson, 1970) and may be influenced by several factors (e.g. prey, light, avoidance of predation and metabolism), as observed in other marine fishes (Neilson and Perry, 1990).
lq35 | 9.3.4 Prey and predation
3g9w | Pacific hake is both an important food source for many predators and likely the most important consumer of zooplankton and forage fish in the CCLME (Field, 2004). Larvae and smaller juvenile hake feed on copepod eggs, copepods and juvenile euphausiids (Sumida and Moser, 1980; Grover et al., 2002; Cass-Calay, 2003). The diet of large juveniles and adults is composed primarily of euphausiids, fish and pandalid shrimp, with evidence of adult cannibalism on juveniles (Alton and Nelson, 1970; Bailey et al., 1982; Livingston, 1983; Brodeur et al., 1987; Buckley and Livingston, 1997, Field et al., 2006; Emmett and Krutzikowsky, 2008). The amount of spatial overlap (and cannibalism) between adult and juvenile fish varies annually in response to environmental and demographic factors as discussed previously (Buckley and Livingston, 1997). Larger zooplankton and fish become more important dietary components as Pacific hake grow. Pacific hake are usu- ally considered to be opportunistic feeders (Best, 1963), particularly upon schooling or aggregating prey (Livingston and Bailey, 1985). The daily ration for juvenile and adult Pacific hake has been estimated variously between 0.4% and 3.5% of body weight (Francis, 1983; Livingston, 1983; Rexstad and Pikitch, 1986; Tanasichuk et al., 1991). Euphausiids nearly always appear as a very important component of the Pacific hake diet, but some studies have demonstrated seasonal and inter-annual changes in the mix of prey types utilised throughout the CCLME (e.g. Bailey et al., 1982; Livingston, 1983; Buckley and Livingston, 1997; Emmett and Krutzikowsky, 2008). These shifts include from primarily euphausiid prey (primarily Thysanoessa spinifera) to increased consumption of Pacific herring in late summer off Vancouver Island (Tanasichuk et al., 1991; Ware and McFarlane, 1995) and during the 1997-1998 El Niño (Nelson, 2004), and from mostly fish prey to euphausiids in the summertime off Oregon and Washington (Brodeur et al., 1987).
d09o | Pacific hake are also important prey for other species. Pacific hake embryos and larvae are preyed upon by copepods, amphipods and gelatinous zoo- plankton (Bailey and Yen, 1983; Livingston and Bailey, 1985). Pacific hake juveniles and adults are also prey for other nekton, including dogfish (Squalus acanthias), sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), lingcod (Ophidon elongates),

ex5k | arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) and tunas (Thunnus spp.), as well as apex predators such as California sea lions (Zalophus californianus californianus), Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardii), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) and other tooted whales, sooty shearwaters (Puffinus griseus), western gulls (Larus occidentalis) and common murres (Uria aalge) (Fiscus, 1979; Ainley et al., 1982; Livingston and Bailey, 1985; Baraff and Loughlin, 2000; Field, 2004). The predation of Humboldt squid (Dosidicus gigas) upon adult Pacific hake has recently received attention (Field et al., 2007; Zeidberg and Robison, 2007), as these squid have become periodically more common in the northern CCLME. In particular, the northward expansion of Humboldt squid in 2009 resulted in considerable overlap in depth and geographic range with Pacific hake. This hake forms an important link between upper and lower trophic levels in the CCLME.
9d4o | 9.3.5 Population dynamics
cjq2 | Pacific hake live more than 20 years, attaining lengths of over 50 cm of total length, with 50% reaching maturity by the age of 4 years, at about 37 cm. Dorn et al. (1993) estimated a natural mortality rate (M) of 0.23 per year. Hamel and Stewart (2009) used a meta-analytical approach incorporating multiple life-history correlates to develop a log-normal prior for M with mean 0.193 per year.
5esx | Recruitment dynamics in the coastal stock of Pacific hake are characterised by episodic strong year classes, which can vary in number by as much as two orders of magnitude or more relative to weak year classes (Bailey and Francis, 1985; Methot and Dorn, 1995; JTC, 2013; Figure 9.5). The occurrence of these dominant year classes appears to be largely independent of spawning stock size, so a reliable stock-recruitment relationship has been difficult to establish (Bailey and Francis, 1985; JTC, 2013). Varying levels of mortality during the pre-recruit period is a common explanation for similar recruitment dynamics in other species.
m5ka | Hollowed et al. (2001) found that Pacific hake appeared to respond more strongly to inter-annual variability than to decadal climatic variability. Strong year classes often occurred in years with unusually warm surface temperature anomalies in coastal waters north of the tropics, 'Niño North' conditions that do not always correspond to El Niño events. The frequency of these conditions will affect the size and variability of the coastal Pacific hake stock.
byu8 | Individual growth of Pacific hake can also be quite variable (Dorn, 1992). Helser et al. (2008) examined length-at-age data from the acoustic and bottom trawl surveys and found that both of the von Bertalanffy growth parameters K (Brody growth coefficient) and L. (asymptotic size) declined for individual cohorts from the early 1970s and the mid-1980s and subsequently increased again. Temporary decreases in parameter estimates could be due to warmer waters and reduced productivity following the 1977 regime shift,

vafm | increased competition due to strong year classes, or both. Individual growth was depressed during the 1983-1984 El Niño (Hollowed and Francis, 1987), perhaps due to reduced euphausiid abundance (Miller et al., 1985; Rexstad and Pikitch, 1986).
2zmw | 9.4 Fisheries
bf9k | The fishery for the coastal population of Pacific hake occurs along the coasts of California, Oregon and Washington in the United States and British Columbia in Canada, typically from May through December. The primary fishery is con- ducted with mid-water trawls over bottom depths of 100-500 m; Pacific hake are also caught incidentally in other coastal fisheries. Catch averaged 222,000 t per year during 1966-2012, with nearly three-quarters of that catch coming from the U.S. waters. Recent coast-wide catches have been greater than the long-term average, averaging 243,000 t per year during 2008-2012 (Figure 9.6).
otkr | Pacific hake were caught incidentally in commercial fisheries targeting more valuable species dating from the late 19th century but were discarded or pro- cessed into animal food and fishmeal until the 1960s. Annual landings never exceeded a few 100 t during this period. In 1964, the U.S. National Marine Fish- eries Service (NMFS) demonstrated the potential for large catches of Pacific hake (up to 30 t in a single half-hour trawl) off Washington and Oregon using state-of-the-art depth telemetry systems on mid-water trawlers. The domestic fishery in the United States grew from less than 500 t in 1964 to about 9000 t in 1967, although these levels were not sustained afterwards due to lack of profitability.

pk06 | Pacific hake. Japanese vessels, whose primary target was Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus), also harvested Pacific hake in the late 1960s. Vessels from Poland, the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and Bulgaria joined the fishery for Pacific hake in the 1970s. Foreign annual catch of Pacific hake from 1966 through 1979 averaged 167,000 t.
7wn9 | Joint venture fisheries commenced in 1978 and completely supplanted the foreign fishery by 1989 in the United States and 1992 in Canada. The entry of domestic motherships and catcher-processors into the U.S. Pacific hake fishery in 1990 accelerated the change to a wholly domestic U.S. fishery that took the entire catch by 1991. The domestic Pacific hake fishery in Canada developed at a slower pace in the absence of these larger domestic processing vessels and remains largely a domestic shoreside fishery, with a small joint venture fishery in most years.
wcd0 | 9.4.1 Management strategy and challenges
caos | Since implementation of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act in the United States and the declaration of a 200-mile fishery conservation zone in Canada in the late 1970s, annual harvest quotas have been the primary management tool used to limit the catch of Pacific hake. Scientists from both countries collaborated through the Technical Subcommittee of the Canada-U.S. Groundfish Committee, and there were informal agreements on the adoption of annual fishing policies. During the 1990s, however, disagreements between the United States and Canada on the allotment of the catch between the U.S. and Canadian fisheries led to quota overruns. This, coupled with the decline of abundant year classes from

1pmc | the mid-1980s, led to Pacific hake being declared overfished (i.e. below 25% of - average - unfished spawning biomass) in the United States in 2002. The strong 1999 year class was subsequently observed in the acoustic survey and fisheries, and a new assessment and abundance estimate led to the stock being declared rebuilt in 2004.
5z6q | The allocation issue was resolved with the development and eventual implementation of the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada on Pacific Hake/Whiting (the Treaty), which was signed in November 2003. The Treaty specifies a process for developing annual stock assessments and total allowable catch (TAC), including a default harvest rate of F40% and fixed allocations of 73.88% and 26.12% for the United States and Canada, respectively. The Hake Treaty established a Joint Management Commission (JMC) that decides the annual TAC. JMC decisions are guided by the terms of the Treaty and the JMC's three advisory bodies consisting of the Joint Technical Committee (JTC), the Scientific Review Group (SRG) and an Advisory Panel. The JTC conducts the annual stock assessment and develops potential yield amounts for JMC consideration. The SRG assures the technical integrity of the stock assessment and the assessment's potential yield estimates. The Advisory Panel is composed of hake industry participants from the United States and Canada, who provide their perspectives about the fishery.
