The simple one-step stool method enables processing for Xpert testing at the primary healthcare level. We modelled the impact and cost-effectiveness of implementing the simple one-step stool method at primary healthcare for the diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis in Ethiopia and Indonesia, compared with the standard of care.\nbgre | Setting All children (age under fifteen years) presenting with presumptive tuberculosis at primary healthcare or hospital level in Ethiopia and Indonesia.\n57lp | Primary outcome Cost-effectiveness estimated as incremental costs compared with incremental disability-adjusted life-years saved.\nukth | Methods Decision tree modelling was used to represent pathways of patient care and referral. We based model parameters on ongoing studies and surveillance, systematic literature review, and expert opinion. We estimated costs using data available publicly and obtained through in-country expert consultations. Health outcomes were based on modelled mortality and discounted life-years lost.\nkpvt | Results The intervention increased the sensitivity of tuberculosis diagnosis by nineteen to twenty-five percent in both countries leading to a fourteen to twenty percent relative reduction in mortality. Under the intervention, fewer children seeking care at primary healthcare were referred (or self-referred) to higher levels of care; the number of children initiating anti-tuberculosis treatment increased by eighteen to twenty-five percent; and more children (eighty-five percent) initiated anti-tuberculosis treatment at primary healthcare level. Costs increased under the intervention compared with a base case using smear microscopy in the standard of care resulting in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of one hundred thirty-two dollars and ninety-four dollars per disability-adjusted life-year averted in Ethiopia and Indonesia, respectively. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of zero point five times gross domestic product per capita, the projected probability of the intervention being cost-effective in Ethiopia and Indonesia was eighty-seven percent and ninety-six percent, respectively. The intervention remained cost-effective under sensitivity analyses.\njie2 | Conclusions The addition of the simple one-step stool method to national algorithms for diagnosing tuberculosis in children is likely to be cost-effective in both Ethiopia and Indonesia.\nd0ik | Original research\n0x0s | STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY\n4exe | The first study to evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of including the simple one-step method to the existing national algorithms for diagnosing tuberculosis in children.\n0myz | The evaluation used a systematic literature review to inform model parameters.\nxh3i | The analysis is based on two very diverse settings and is likely to have global relevance to countries with high tuberculosis burden.\nsyiw | Limited availability of local data to inform some important parameters, including referral rates and primary cost data.\nkg3t | Patient costs were not included, meaning any patient benefits from reduced referrals were not captured.\nlvae | BACKGROUND\no9sc | It was estimated that in twenty eighteen, around one point one million children below fifteen years of age fell ill from tuberculosis. In the same year, two hundred fifty thousand children died of tuberculosis, mostly because tuberculosis was not diagnosed or was diagnosed too late. It is estimated that fifty-five percent of tuberculosis cases are missed, particularly in the youngest age group. Tuberculosis in children presents with non-specific signs and symptoms, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli are usually not detected. Partly, this is because the main specimen used for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis is sputum, which is challenging to obtain, especially from young children. Therefore, semi-invasive methods such as nasogastric aspiration and sputum induction are often required. These methods are painful and stressful for children and caregivers and sometimes require hospitalisation. Moreover, not all primary healthcare facilities in tuberculosis endemic areas, where parents with children usually first seek care, have facilities and qualified staff to perform these procedures. Alternative, non-invasive specimens, such as stool, can\n121u | be used for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in children using GeneXpert M T B R i f technology.\nzh03 | Since January twenty twenty, WHO recommends Xpert testing of stool specimens as a primary diagnostic test for tuberculosis in children with signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis. This recommendation has the potential to improve bacteriological confirmation of tuberculosis in children, and is increasingly being adopted by national tuberculosis programmes, for example, Ethiopia. However, to make the test fit for use at the primary healthcare level, a simple, non-hazardous and cheap method to process stool for Xpert testing was needed. Several centrifuge-free methods have been proposed, but all need additional equipment and or consumables which may not be easily available in peripheral lower-level public health facilities. Therefore, we developed a simple one-step stool processing method for Xpert testing. This method can be applied in any laboratory with an Xpert machine, as it does not require additional equipment or consumables than those delivered routinely with the Xpert cartridges. Limited preliminary data suggest that Xpert Ultra on stool samples processed using the simple one-step stool method has higher sensitivity compared with other stool processing methods. Available systematic reviews on the diagnostic accuracy of stool testing have reported sensitivity of fifty to sixty-seven percent. The variation in sensitivity estimates may be explained by a variation in studies included, and thus, variation in study populations, stool processing methods and reference standards sputum culture or a combination of sputum culture and sputum Xpert included in each review. This method has the potential to significantly impact the number of children receiving a bacteriological confirmation of tuberculosis, including rifampicin resistance profile. Consequently, more pediatric tuberculosis patients can be diagnosed at lower levels of the healthcare system, with a reduced time to diagnosis because no referrals to higher levels of healthcare are needed as well as reduced costs for both the healthcare system and families.\n1mvw | However, evidence on the impact and cost-effectiveness of the simple one-step Xpert stool processing method is needed to inform implementation and scale-up in routine healthcare systems. Therefore, we modelled the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of bringing this test to the lower healthcare level where children present first, focusing on Ethiopia and Indonesia. Specifically, we aimed to estimate the impact of implementing the Xpert stool test for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis among children at the primary healthcare level on rates of bacteriological confirmation of tuberculosis and mortality among children, the costs to the healthcare provider, and the incremental cost-effectiveness of the approach. Ethiopia and Indonesia are currently among the thirty high tuberculosis burden countries in the world. The incidence of tuberculosis was estimated to be three hundred one per one hundred thousand population with eight hundred twenty-four thousand people falling ill with tuberculosis in twenty twenty in Indonesia. In Ethiopia, the incidence of tuberculosis was estimated to be one hundred thirty-two per one hundred thousand population with one hundred fifty-one thousand people falling ill with tuberculosis in twenty twenty. While tuberculosis\n6d4s | diagnosis and treatment in Ethiopia largely occur in the public sector, the private sector plays a substantial role in Indonesia.\nmqah | METHODS Conceptual approach\nxxr8 | We developed a conceptual model of care pathways for children (age under fifteen years) with presumptive tuberculosis presenting at either primary healthcare facilities or hospitals, referral (including self-referral) between these levels, and clinical and bacteriological assessment and reassessment. This description of stages in patient care was based on national tuberculosis guidelines and local knowledge, and were broad enough to capture pathways in both Ethiopia and Indonesia, and incorporate the standard of care as well as the intervention.",
