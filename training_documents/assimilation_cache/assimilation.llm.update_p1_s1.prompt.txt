You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

1i8b | Chapter 20 Data Assimilation
5sfj | Data assimilation is a powerful methodology for incorporating data into a mathematical model in a way that is consistent with physical processes. In this chapter we present a Bayesian approach to data assimilation, discuss the Kalman filter algorithm for data assimilation for linear processes and linear data models in the presence of Gaussian noise, and describe a simple version of the ensemble Kalman filter, which relies on stochastic simulation.
vk4h | 20.1 . Data Assimilation and Climate
nsm3 | To predict the state of the climate system at any future time or to recreate its past, we must necessarily rely on mathematical models and numerical simulations. Throughout this book, we have encountered several types of models, some of them conceptual and others closer to the "real" world of physics, chemistry, and biology. Most of these models are process models-models that are described by systems of equations that determine the state variables (also called process variables) and their evolution in time. In data assimi- lation, one links such process models with data models-models of observational data of these same state variables, together with their uncertainties. The idea is that, by making it consistent with the available observations, a process model becomes better at predicting future states of the system. Data assimilation is an essential technique in any scientific dis- cipline that is data-rich and for which well-founded predictive mathematical models exist. The technique originated in engineering and has found widespread application in many other disciplines, most notably in weather prediction, where it has extended the ability to predict weather more or less accurately from hours to days. Not only does the technique generate estimates of the state of the weather system, but it also produces an assessment of the uncertainties in the prediction, often in the form of probability distributions for pro- cess variables or parameters. For an overview of data assimilation techniques in weather prediction and climate science, we refer the reader to [48, 89].

epbj | Data assimilation can be applied to estimate process variables at a certain time using all available observational data, including those made at a later time (reanalysis or smooth- ing mode), or to estimate the present state using past and present observations (analysis or filtering mode), or to estimate process variables that are inaccessible to observations, such as future states or states between measurements (forecasting or predicting mode). In any of these modes, problems can be approached with a variety of techniques, including opti- mization methods, which attempt to find the best fit of a parameterized process model to a given set of data; maximum likelihood methods, which work in a similar spirit but have more detailed statistical models for the uncertainties in the process; and Bayesian methods.
nmn2 | 20.2 - Example
g3tm | The following example (adapted from [121]) illustrates the application of data assimilation methodology to reanalysis, filtering, and forecasting.
tfra | Consider a process with four real-valued state variables, {X; : i = 1, ... , 4}. The state variables are related by the process model
5lm9 | X1+1 =ax; + {;, i= 1,2,3, (20.1)
wp2c | where a is a known positive constant and the random process error terms 5, are either identically zero or have a standard normal distribution, §; ~ N(0,1). (The convention is to use upper-case letters (X, Y, Z, etc.) for random quantities and the corresponding lower-case letters (x, y, z, etc.) for their realizations. Random error terms are indicated by Greek letters.)
us5v | The data model consists of two observations, {Y; : i = 2,3}, and is related to the process model through the identities
rs2m | Yi=X1+{; i= 2,3, (20.2)
uz9y | where the random observational error terms {; are independent and identically distributed with a standard normal distribution, {; ~ N(0, 72). The entire model is shown schemati- cally in Figure 20.1. The problem of estimating X1 from the observations Y2 and Y3 is a reanalysis problem, estimating X2 from Y2 or X3 from Y2 and Y3 is a filtering problem, and estimating X4 from Y2 and Y3 is a forecasting problem.
