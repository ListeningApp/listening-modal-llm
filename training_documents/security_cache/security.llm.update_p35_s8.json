They develop over time, and the earlier you are aware of potential problems, the more effective you will be as a security manager\nc8ra | . Complexity is the enemy of clarity. Do not allow your systems to become overly complex - especially if that doesn't add to your operational capability\np1l0 | . Even the largest and most high profile operations fail for simple reasons - breakdowns in communications, breakdowns in command structures, lack of leadership\n1i8b | . Security management is not a single event, but is a never-ending process - review your own operations on a continuous basis, and keep on improving them\n5sfj | Seven point eleven. Self-assessment exercises\nvk4h | Exercise one: Identify an incident that has been the direct result of organizational complexity (it can be one of the incidents mentioned in this module, or another one of your own choosing), and analyze how and why the incident happened, and what steps could have been taken to prevent it.\nnsm3 | Exercise two: Take an organization that is known to you, and design an Annual Security Review that will allow you to assess the level of security within the organization, identify potential weak spots, and allow you to make recommendations as to how the system can be improved over the next management cycle.\njdfw | Exercise three: Identify three 'Normal Accidents' that could be indicators of systemic weakness within the security management program, and show how the underlying causes can be dealt with in order to prevent those Normal accidents from occurring, and potentially escalating into full-blown crisis status.\nuc9r | Seven point twelve. Further Reading\nl0ap | Eight. Adding Value\nx815 | As should already be clear from the previous sections of this module, for security management to be truly effective it should be embedded into the very heart of an organization, intricately connected with every aspect of its operations and general management culture. However, the truth is that in many, if not most, organizations security management lacks the status of other aspects of the organization's management processes, and in many ways is seen as being something that can be considered once a year at an annual review. There are a number of reasons why that happens, which will be touched upon in this section, but it is certainly the case that the way that security management represents itself often causes it to be seen as a 'poor cousin', one lacking the status and respect that it deserves. In many organizations, security managers are seen as being involved with operational matters, rather than strategic decision makers. As such, they are considered in the same group as facility managers, fleet hire managers and other members of the 'back room staff'. If security management is to be given the central role that we believe it should, then security managers in turn must make sure that they have the skills and capabilities that will allow them to fulfill that role in an effective and appropriate manner.\nepbj | Eight point one. Cost or Investment?\nnmn2 | One of the fundamental reasons that security is not given the place it merits at the director's boardroom is that, rather than being seen as 'adding value' to an organization, it is considered to be a 'non-productive cost'. This, in turn, causes it to become a 'grudging spend', rather than a well-supported investment. Security management is undoubtedly spend-driven - there is a need for a high level of technology, whether CCTV, fencing, lighting, control rooms, vehicles, personnel, etcetera, which needs to be both maintained and upgraded on a regular basis. However, there is also a case that could be made that effective security management can rationalize the security management program, and especially in a larger organization where security functions are spread across different sites, and can find effective cost savings without compromising security. In many cases, there is a business case to be made that by upgrading and taking advantage of newer technology, real savings can be made across the organization's security spend.\ng3tm | Eight point two. Business Manager\ntfra | The power of the above argument demonstrates another basic truth about the modern security manager - he or she is a Business Manager of a significant division within the organization, and therefore should be able to bring all of the skills to the business management aspect of their role as would the equivalent head of any other division. This should be reflected in the language used to describe the value of the security division to the organization, the way that it is presented and the supporting material that is produced. The security manager should be able to identify strategic objectives for their department, recruit the right people, develop effective protocols and manage the budget, at all times being aware of how that fits in with the wider strategic objectives of the company as a whole.\n5lm9 | Eight point three. Competitive Advantage\nwp2c | In many situations, security management is seen as a business inhibitor rather than an opportunity enabler. For many people within the organization, the only contact they have with the security operation is when they arrive in the building in the morning, or have a problem with their pass card. However on a wider perspective, the security management program should be a business enabler, allowing the organization to gain a competitive advantage over its competitors. This may be because they can gain 'First Mover Advantage' by expanding into new markets where their competitors cannot - this is especially true in what might be seen as high-risk areas that could be an inhibitor to business development by organizations with less well-developed security management capabilities.\nus5v | A Risk Management Framework such as shown in Figure nineteen, allows an organization to assess whether it is viable to develop operations in a high-threat environment: (note the use of terminology previously covered in this module: risk assessment, likelihood and impact, avoid or transfer risk, acceptance of risk, standard operating procedures, regular review, contingency plans).\nrs2m | Eight point four. Subject Matter Expertise\nuz9y | The security manager's role has traditionally seen to have been relatively unskilled when compared to the level of professional capability expected from the heads of the finance division, business development division, marketing and branding division, etcetera. This is a hangover from the era when security managers were traditionally hired on the basis of their previous police experience, and the function that they fulfilled was often little more than in-house policeman. However, that has been changing over the last ten years, and there are now a wide range of professional and academic security management training programs available. If the security manager is to achieve the same status as comparable managers in other divisions, it is necessary for them to show that they are able to bring the same level of expertise and professional development as their equivalents would. The security manager should expect to be the point of reference for all issues relating to security within their organization, whether it is personal, as in foreign travel, operational, as in day-to-day management of security operations, or strategic, as in contributing to the organization's continued growth and development.\n8ov0 | Eight point five. Proactive Risk Management\nmj9m | Whilst a large part of a security manager's function will naturally be involved with managing the routine tasks associated with the security team, it is also necessary for them to become part of the 'Over the Horizon' thinking that is an essential part of any strategic management project. The nature of the present world means that the risks and threats facing any organization are radically different than those that would have been faced in previous generations. Whether it is natural disasters, technological breakdowns, political upheavals, or the 'unknown unknowns' that could strike at any time, the role of the security manager is to bring these threats to the attention of strategic decision makers and to ensure that appropriate risk management procedures are in place.\n94h3 | Eight point six.
