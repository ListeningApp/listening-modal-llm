You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

nv42 | Origin of Unusually Large Isotope Effects. The observed isotope effect for compound Q decay exceeds by severalfold the classical limit for a deuterium isotope effect. Large isotope effects typically arise in reactions that include (i) branched pathways, (ii) multiple steps with cumulative effects of more than one isotope-sensitive step, (iii) a hydrogen- tunneling process, or (iv) a magnetic isotope effect (Hwang & Grissom, 1994).4 The effects of a branched reaction are usually seen in the product distribution rather than the direct observation of the decay of a reactive, chromophoric intermediate as reported here. The participation of more than one isotope-sensitive step is feasible, but the possibilities for such a process are constrained by the fact that no loss of hydrogen other than from the bond where oxygen insertion occurs is observed. Thus, it is unlikely that two hydrogen atoms are removed during the course of the reaction. In preliminary studies, we have not been able to observe magnetic isotope effects in the product distribution.5 Con- sequently, of the possibilities noted, hydrogen tunneling appears to be the most likely origin of the large isotope effect.6
xags | Observations characteristic of tunneling include (1) a large <LATEX>\mathrm { K I E } > 7 ,</LATEX> (2) curvature in the Arrhenius plot, (3) AAH > 1.3 kcal/mol, and <LATEX>\left( 4 \right) a n</LATEX> Arrhenius preexponential factor ratio of <LATEX>A ^ { \mathrm { H } _ { \star } } A ^ { \mathrm { D } } < 1</LATEX> (Brunton et al., 1976; More O'Ferrall, 1975). We have shown here that the compound Q decay reaction
jc47 | in the presence of methane fulfills three of these criteria, in that it has a large KIE, a large difference in activation energies, and an apparent <LATEX>A ^ { H } : A ^ { D }</LATEX> of slightly less than 1. Curvature in the Arrhenius plot is not expected to be observable within the small temperature range that could be accessed in this study. Although tunneling is consistent with the data observed, under the assumption of tunneling both the apparent <LATEX>\Delta \Delta \mathrm { H }</LATEX> and <LATEX>A ^ { H } : A ^ { D }</LATEX> will depend strongly on the temperature range in which the measurements are made. Thus, measurement of these parameters over a single small temperature range cannot be used to directly distinguish between tunneling and a classical Arrhenius mechanism.
ko3c | Tunneling of the hydrogen atom during the abstraction process could elicit a large isotope effect, especially for a small, light molecule such as methane. Molecular orbital calculations of the hydrogen-atom abstraction process for methane have been carried out by Pudzianowski and Loew (1983). An intramolecular deuterium isotope effect for CH3D of 34 was calculated for the process in the absence of tunneling and was 56 when a tunneling factor was added. The calculated AG was very small, -0.2 kcal/mol (298 K). Significantly, results from this computational experiment indicate that methane has a uniquely large KIE compared to the other hydrocarbons examined. These calculations7 assumed that the hydrogen-atom abstraction was carried out by a ground state triplet oxygen atom and predicted a linear transition state with complete C-H bond fissure, as we have proposed for the mechanism of MMO.
xek3 | A factor that can elevate the apparent KIE is differential solvation of the <LATEX>H -</LATEX> and D-atoms on the substrate (Pal et al., 1995). Due to the highly ordered solvent "cage" surrounding the hydrophobic substrate, the deuterium could be less easily accessed by the reactive oxidant than hydrogen. This type of effect is not related to the transition state. We discount this process as a significant contributor for our reactions because the second-order rate constants for CH4 and <LATEX>\mathrm { C D } _ { 4 }</LATEX> are essentially independent of the fraction of <LATEX>D 2 0</LATEX> in the solvent.8 The slight decrease observed can be accounted for entirely by the effects of the increased viscosity of <LATEX>D _ { 2 } O</LATEX> on a collisional reaction.
bbpr | Differences in partitioning of deuterated and protiated methane between the solvent and the hydrophobic interior of the enzyme might also cause anomalously large isotope effects. However, intramolecular isotope effects for the isotopic homologs of methane should not be affected by such bulk partitioning.
5zyf | Comparison of the Isotope Effects Determined from Compound <LATEX>Q</LATEX> Decay and from Product Distribution. The deuterium isotope effects determined from product ratios, although large, are not as large as those determined directly from the kinetics of compound Q decay. In a single-turnover system, this would not normally be expected if compound Q reacts with substrate directly to form product as we propose. One possible explanation is that the reaction cycle

bqfb | branches before compound Q, so that only a small fraction of the reaction proceeds with an isotope effect approaching 100. This seems unlikely because it is known from Möss- bauer spectroscopy that compound Q is formed by at least half, and probably significantly more than half, of the MMOH sites after reaction with O2 (Lee et al., 1993a). Also, the extinction coefficient of compound Q was estimated to be 7500 M-1 cm-1 at 430 nm on the basis of the assumption that all of the observed product is formed via compound Q (Lee et al., 1993b). If this is not the case, then the extinction coefficient of compound Q is much larger than 7500 M-1 cm-1, which seems unlikely for a non-heme iron complex containing only two irons. A branch in the reaction pathway after the decay of compound Q would not alter the observed isotope effect unless it introduces a reversal of the hydrogen- atom abstraction. It is this possibility and the frequent correlation between a large primary KIE and a free energy change within several kilocalories/mole of zero [Bell (1973) and references cited therein] that leads us to put forth the scheme illustrated in Figure 5.
wwdt | In this scheme, compound Q reacts with methane with a very large deuterium isotope effect. It is further proposed that the intermediate methyl radical can react by either reabstracting the original hydrogen atom or abstracting hydroxyl radical to complete the oxidation reaction. If the hydrogen atom is reabstracted, a different form of compound Q, designated Q', is proposed to form. This scheme would decrease the observed isotope effect in the product distribu- tion because the hydrogen-atom reabstraction reaction would also show an isotope effect, while it is reasonable to assume a negligible isotope effect for the radical recombination process involving OH(D). Accordingly, the methane mol- ecules that had lost deuterium would have a greater tendency to go on to product than those that had lost hydrogen, resulting in a lowering of the isotope effect as seen in the product analysis. Simulations of this scheme show that it models both the isotope effects determined from the kinetics of compound Q decay and from product yield if the reabstraction isotope effect is about 10 and the abstraction isotope effect for compound Q' is in the range of 10-100. However, there are many other values for these constants that also give good fits to the data. The reaction scheme requires that the methane generated by hydrogen-atom reabstraction in the active site exchange freely with methane in solution because if this were not the case, no isotope effect would be observed when a 1:1 mixture of CH4 and CD4
