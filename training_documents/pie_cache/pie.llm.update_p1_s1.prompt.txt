You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

5zyf | The causal pie model: an epidemiological method applied to evolutionary biology and ecology
9own | Introduction
bqfb | Life is all about cause and effect. A general concept for thinking about causality facilitates swift comprehension of results, while the vocabulary that belongs to the concept is instrumental in cross-disciplinary communication. Although in and of itself it does not lead to different results than those obtained with more specific models, a general model provides a quick grasp of the commonali- ties of seemingly diverse situations. Rothman's "causal pie model" (Rothman 1976, 2012) has fulfilled this role in epidemiology, and we propose that it could be of similar value in biology, in particular in evolutionary biology and ecology. We introduce the model, discuss some generali- ties that derive from it, and show a wide-ranging sample
wwdt | Abstract
mn1r | A general concept for thinking about causality facilitates swift comprehension of results, and the vocabulary that belongs to the concept is instrumental in cross-disciplinary communication. The causal pie model has fulfilled this role in epidemiology and could be of similar value in evolutionary biology and ecol- ogy. In the causal pie model, outcomes result from sufficient causes. Each suffi- cient cause is made up of a "causal pie" of "component causes". Several different causal pies may exist for the same outcome. If and only if all compo- nent causes of a sufficient cause are present, that is, a causal pie is complete, does the outcome occur. The effect of a component cause hence depends on the presence of the other component causes that constitute some causal pie. Because all component causes are equally and fully causative for the outcome, the sum of causes for some outcome exceeds 100 . The causal pie model pro- vides a way of thinking that maps into a number of recurrent themes in evolu- tionary biology and ecology: It charts when component causes have an effect and are subject to natural selection, and how component causes affect selection on other component causes; which partitions of outcomes with respect to causes are feasible and useful; and how to view the composition of a(n appar- ently homogeneous) population. The diversity of specific results that is directly understood from the causal pie model is a test for both the validity and the applicability of the model. The causal pie model provides a common language in which results across disciplines can be communicated and serves as a tem- plate along which future causal analyses can be made.

meyw | The Model
2e62 | To paraphrase Rothman (2012), the lights at home shine because they each have a light bulb, there is wire to the light bulbs, the switches are on, there is a power grid, and there is a power source. Take any of these factors away, and there is no light: The system contains 500 causality, for all five factors are 100 causative for the shining of the light. There is no limit to the sum of causes for some outcome (Rothman 2012).
75y3 | The causal pie model, depicted in Figure 1 after Roth- man's original (1976), represents this way of conceptualizing
s2g2 | causality. A sufficient cause is a constellation of component causes, the causal pie, that leads to an outcome. A compo- nent cause can be a component of more than one suffi- cient cause. If and only if all the component causes that make up a causal pie of some sufficient cause are present does the outcome occur. As a result, the effect of a com- ponent cause depends on the presence versus absence of the other component causes that make up some causal pie. These are called complementary component causes, which jointly make up the complementary set of a compo- nent cause. In the absence of any one of the complemen- tary component causes, a component cause in itself has no effect. Referring to the example above, if there is no con- nection to the power grid, varying the position of the switch does not alter the light being on or off.
q1q2 | This model is deterministic in the sufficient causes: If all component causes of some causal pie are present, then the sufficient cause is present and the outcome occurs. This does not prohibit the model from having statistical properties: If one (or more) of the component causes is described statistically, the (joint) distribution function of the (mixed) statistical model describes the outcome as a random variable.
cb7r | The level of detail required for an analysis determines the biologic outcome of interest, the number of sufficient causes that can exist for the same biologic outcome, and what component causes make up the sufficient causes. For instance, a stroke that is caused by high blood pres- sure may be classified as an outcome different from a stroke that is not caused by high blood pressure. The lat- ter clearly does not include sufficient causes that contain high blood pressure as a component cause, while the out- come "any stroke" would.
68xu | As discussed above, causality adds up to more than 100 . Variation in the occurrence of an outcome due to
hd35 | Causal Pies in Ecology and Evolution
2zpk | variation in a specified component cause is bound by 100 . To illustrate this, consider another example (Roth- man 2012): The disease phenylketonuria (PKU) is charac- terized by abnormal metabolism of an amino acid, leading to severe symptoms such as mental retardation. PKU occurs only in people with a mutated gene. The var- ious human diets on planet Earth include the amino acid, so that 100 of the occurrence versus nonoccurrence of PKU on planet Earth is explained genetically. However, consider a hypothetical "other planet", the inhabitants of which all have the genetic mutation, but do not all have a diet that contains the amino acid. On the other planet, 100 of the observed variation in the occurrence of PKU is explained by variation in the diet.
epu7 | Variation explained is a matter of prevalence of com- ponent causes given some context. Although the percent- age of variation explained might be of interest, of even greater interest are statements that are generally true, not just on planet Earth or on the other planet. Such a state- ment is that 100 of the incident cases of PKU is caused by a mutant gene and 100 is caused by diet. On planet Earth, variation in the prevalence of PKU is explained by genes. Yet, it is another component cause, diet, that is targeted as a treatment. This illustrates why general insights into causality are the more interesting kind of insights.
7od1 | Application of the Model to Evolutionary) Biology and Ecology
0bqy | The causal pie model has a number of implications for (evolutionary) biology and ecology: It charts under what circumstances component causes have an effect and there- fore can be subject to natural selection, and how compo- nent causes modulate the effect of and natural selection on other component causes; it shows which partitions of outcomes are useful and which are not; and it provides a way of viewing the composition of a(n apparently homo- geneous) population. Each of these points is developed below, and examples are given and framed in terms of the causal pie model.
b780 | Component causes, their effects, and the force of selection
ccmb | The causal pie model explains when and why biologic fac- tors (component causes) have an effect. When component causes produce an effect, they could affect Darwinian fit- ness and hence become subject to natural selection. Com- ponent causes also influence whether other component causes have an effect and become subject to natural selec- tion. We outline some generalities regarding this thinking,
