You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

v3r2 | Safety and effectiveness of self-managed medication abortion provided using online telemedicine in the United States: A population based study
nv42 | Summary
xags | Background As access to clinical abortion care becomes increasingly restricted in the United States, the need for self-managed abortions (i.e. abortions taking place outside of the formal healthcare setting) may increase. We exam- ine the safety, effectiveness, and acceptability of self-managed medication abortion provided using online telemedicine.
jc47 | Methods We retrospectively examined records of the outcomes of abortions provided by the sole online telemedicine service providing self-managed medication abortion in the U.S. We calculated the prevalence of successful medica- tion abortion (the proportion who ended their pregnancy without surgical intervention); the prevalence of serious adverse events (the proportions who received intravenous antibiotics and blood transfusion); and assessed whether any deaths were reported to the service. We also examined the proportions who were satisfied and felt self-manage- ment was the right choice.
ko3c | Findings Between March 20th 2018 and March 20th 2019, abortion medications were mailed to 4,584 people and 3,186 (70%) provided follow-up information. Among these, 2,797 (88%) confirmed use of the medications and pro- vided outcome information, while 389 (12%) confirmed non-use. Overall, 96.4% (95% CI 95.7% to 97.1%) of those who used the medications reported successfully ending their pregnancy without surgical intervention and 1.0% (CI 0.7%-1.5%) reported treatment for any serious adverse event. Among these, 0.6% (CI 0.4% to 1.0%) reported receiv- ing a blood transfusion, and 0.5% (CI 0.3% to 0.9%) reported receiving intravenous antibiotics. No deaths were reported to the service by family, friends, the authorities, or the media. Among 2,268 who provided information about their experience, 98.4% were satisfied and 95.5% felt self-management was the right choice.
xek3 | Interpretation Self-managed medication abortion provided using online telemedicine can be highly effective with low rates of serious adverse events. In light of increasingly restricted access to in-clinic abortion in the U.S., it may offer a safe and effective option for those who cannot access clinical care.
bbpr | Introduction
5zyf | Abortion access is approaching cross-roads in the United States. The Supreme Court is currently consid- ering an enacted Mississippi law that bans abortion at 15 weeks' gestation" and recently allowed a 6-week ban in effect in Texas to stand.2 Although the right to choose established by Roe v. Wade in 1973 still currently stands,
9own | access to abortion in the clinic setting is moving further out of reach due to restrictive state legislation. One hun- dred and eight abortion restrictions were enacted in state legislatures in 2021, more than any other year since Roe.3 These laws make clinical abortion harder to access by imposing waiting periods and medically unnecessary medical tests on patients and requiring clinics and providers to conform to unnecessary admin- istrative regulations.3
bqfb | Research in context
wwdt | Evidence before this study
mn1r | In many U.S. states, access to abortion in the clinic setting is becoming increasingly restricted. In the face of dwin- dling access, there is evidence that people in the United States are self-managing their abortions (i.e. sourcing and conducting them outside of the formal healthcare setting). While self-managed abortions have been hap- pening in North America for centuries using botanicals, and later misoprostol, one important contemporary method of self-management is the use of online tele- medicine to provide the abortion medications mifepris- tone and misoprostol. No studies, however, have examined the safety, effectiveness, and acceptability of self-managed medication abortion using this model in the United States. We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE and PubMed using the MeSH terms 'Abortion', 'Self-managed', 'United States', 'Safety' and 'Effectiveness' with no language or date restrictions, and found no rele- vant reports as of September 2021. Using data from the sole online telemedicine organization that provides self- managed medication abortion to people in the United States, we provide here an analysis of the reported out- comes of self-managed abortions provided between March 20th 2018 and March 20th 2019. We report both the proportion that resulted in successful termination of pregnancy and the proportion that resulted in serious adverse events. We also describe the acceptability of these self-managed abortions based on user experience.
5vqw | Added value of this study
meyw | This study presents the first evidence that self-managed medication abortion provided through online telemedi- cine in the United States is effective, acceptable to users, and has a very low rate of serious adverse outcomes. This evidence adds to a global body of data showing that self-managed medication abortion is safe and effec- tive. In this study, 70% of those to whom medications were shipped provided follow-up information about their abortions, and among these 2,797 (88%) confirmed use of the medications and provided outcome information, while 389 (12%) confirmed non-use. Among those who used the medications, 96% were able to end their preg- nancies without surgical intervention from a clinical pro- vider, a rate comparable with the in-clinic setting. Treatment for serious adverse events was uncommon with 1% receiving a blood transfusion or intravenous antibiotics. No deaths were reported to the service by family, friends, the authorities, or the media. Among the 2,268 people who provided information about their experience, 98% expressed satisfaction with their abor- tion experience and 96% said it was the right choice.
2e62 | Implications of all the available evidence
75y3 | As restrictive abortion legislation continues to create substantial barriers to in-clinic abortion in many U.S. states, abortion self-managed outside of the formal healthcare setting is an important option for those who
s2g2 | cannot or prefer not to access clinical care. This study provides key evidence for clinicians, policymakers, and the public that safe, effective, self-managed medication abortion is available in the United States. However, peo- ple who self-manage are still vulnerable to legal risks and in some states unjust prosecutions have occurred. Rather than being subject to criminalization, self-man- aged abortion should be a legitimate part of a spectrum of options for abortion care that must be made avail- able in the United States.
q1q2 | Recent research suggests that one possible conse- quence of increasing barriers to in-clinic abortion is that more people will self-manage.4,5 A self-managed abor- tion is one that takes place outside of the formal health- care setting, and includes a spectrum of methods, such as the abortion pills mifepristone and/or misoprostol, menstrual extraction, botanicals, herbs, vitamins, bever- ages, and ingestion of toxic substances and physical injury. Self-managed abortion has been happening in North America for centuries and recent estimates sug- gest that approximately 7 percent of U.S. women have attempted a self-managed abortion in their lifetime.6
