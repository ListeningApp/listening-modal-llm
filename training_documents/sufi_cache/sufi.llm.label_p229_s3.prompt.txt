You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ggnb | Either realise this, and satisfy your attention-demanding and comfort-seeking appetites separately from your studies; or realise it and accept whatever the Teaching can offer you.
w3d0 | In the latter case, you will have to follow a course dictated in its conditions and forming by effectiveness and not sentiment.
u3z1 | It is the true discrimination between diversion and gen line aspiration which generally precedes the emergence of the capacity to learn.
ag51 | Physical presence is not always real presence.
j0m4 | Mechanical performance of actions and reliance on totemistic objects and slogans, which is in fact what many people do and imagine that they are following a teaching, are forms of attachment to what are or amount to objects. Of course, genuine aspiration is hard to maintain, and it is the falling by the wayside of the people ('the birds') in Fariduddin Attar's classic Mantiq al-Tair, the 'Conference of the Birds', which is caused by their craving this attachment.
sc0s | Even the intellect, as he reminds us in that book, cannot help - only what is called by the Sufis Love; and yet this itself is love of something to which one cannot attach as to a person or even to a familiar concept. Many Sufi practices, carried out in accordance with the right directions, aim at defeating this mechanical ten- dency and awakening the capacity for attachment to the Real.
pnsc | Being physically present, seeking system and a certain kind of familiar regularity in studies, is something which comes from automatistic thinking. To demand it because one has a predilec- tion for it is hardly constructive.
p1qs | 237
k5kg | Q: But [someone said] in all forms of study known to me there is regularity and organisation, a system, which is adhered to. Surely it is no wonder that people look for system, and not sur- prising that if they do not find it, they cease to be interested.
e002 | A: Let me ask you a question, to help me to get things clearer, then I will answer you. The question is: 'If there is a formula for approaching a study, written down, say, seven hundred years ago, and found in books published continuously since then, and practised by millions of people, would you yourself be negligent if you did not know about it and asked questions about how to find this formula, or would the people involved in this study be responsible, rather than you?' [The questioner answered]: If the answer to the question which I have just asked were available in English at this rime, in a generally circulated book on this subject (since I think I have read all of them) then I would be negligent, and not you or others like you.
9klo | A: [Continues]. Very well. Now, have you read Professor Arberry's 1961 translation of Professor Faruzanfar's 1952 edition of Rumi's thirteenth-century Fihi ma Fihi, published in England? [Questioner]: Yes.
pbpw | A: [Continues]. Let us now look at that book. On page sixty Rumi likens the stages of a journey by sea to one on land, and also makes dear the differences between the two, does he not? He tell us that, whereas the landmarks are visible - which I will call the familiar system - when going by land, the equivalent stages, if you are travelling by sea, are not visible in the same way, not marked. They are known to the Captain. The ship's captain knows them, but they are not told to landsmen, since they are not able to understand. Can you therefore say that the system is not there, and that it is not being carried out? Certainly not. Do you now see that you are asking for the recipe for making jam by the method for growing wheat?
6tr9 | [Questioner]: I do, indeed. I can only say that I am not accus- tomed to thinking in that way, to approaching things by such a method ... Obviously, I need to take a more flexible view of these written materials.
06s5 | 238
f3g2 | The Way to Sufism
zlrt | Q: Could we have any remarks on the present character of receptivity of man to Sufic ideas, as seen from the Sufi view- point?
8szg | A: Metaphysicians, no less than market researchers, monitor the condition and receptivity of the minds with which they are trying to communicate.
hh47 | The main difference between the activities of, say, the sociolo- gists and those of the spiritual workers is that the results of the latter are not widely published, publicised, employed in academic treatises. They are used in supplying verification material for trainees who would otherwise find it impossible to credit the facts about humanity.
adpv | Which facts? Here are instances:
sy8a | You may have something to teach, and yet be unable to teach it because die people who 'want to learn it' effectively prevent them- selves from learning; at the same time protesting that they 'want to learn', or 'cannot understand'. Such people reason unconsciously, that if they protest you will keep your attention upon them. In this way they gain your attention (or hope to do so). In any other way, they might lose it.
11zj | Of course, if you try to point this out, you will find that the answer-again preventing progress - will be 'this man is excusing himself, or 'he is mistaken'.
dza1 | It is for this reason that it is traditional to confine one's teach- ings to a small rather than a large group: those who really are prepared to learn.
5gil | If you speak, or write, in the above vein, a certain proportion of the would-be elect will protest that you are insensitive, or even that you are not teaching metaphysics at all. This is because they have been accustomed to a belief that real teaching is something which they will themselves instantly recognise.
n91l | Now it is a matter of almost daily verification in real esoteric
iknb | 239
3ohm | classes that it is easy to become established as a 'true meta, physician' in the eyes of the self-styled students of higher thought What do you have to do? Nothing more or less than make them feel emotionally aroused. All you have to do is to make sure that you use what they regard as 'spiritual' terminology.
enn6 | But say the above words, or publish them, and you will, in all likelihood, immediately be accused of being superficial, unaware of the 'real values', and so on.
voir | It is little wonder that many sensible people will have nothing at all to do with the people known as 'spiritual'.
bxm5 | Few organised communities and doctrinally-aligned movements realise, and it has never been widely known, that they inhabit a ghetto. There is a rigid exclusionism in ideas which too often characterises a 'systematic' approach to higher human development and makes it impossible to help raise man higher. Methods have been devised and operated for thousands of years to circumvent this. These methods are externally so dissimilar from the familiar atmosphere, phraseology, ritual and form of 'meta- physics' that not one self-styled Seeker After Truth in twenty will recognise them.
6cnd | But say this, or write it, or try to transmit it, and you will often be derided, accused of heightening mystery, or of taking 'essential mystery' away - of anything that comes into the mind of a frustrated person.
z41z | If you try to set the record straight by describing the barriers, pitfalls, misunderstandings and limiting factors, you will widely be considered to be someone who is complaining, at the very least.
k1hn | These are some of the characteristics of the present-day situa- tion which mean that progress is extremely difficult.
853d | The fault lies partly in the cultural infrastructure. There is a widespread lack of real higher experience, as distinct from imagined experience. There is a serious lack of suitable informa- tion about areas of higher study which are not generally known nor reproduced in books. As a consequence of this, any teacher will in the contemporary world find that he is like the university professor ushered into a lecture-hall to speak of nuclear physics, and finds that his students have not yet learned simple equations.
px3f | Mention this, and you will most surely be accused of giving
28wa | 240
1jce | yourself airs and graces.
jfbn | Try to live down this reputation, and you will have a hard time of it-
cn1a | you may have to associate people with yourself literally for years before die fact penetrates into their minds that you are not a monster, not a mahatma, but a man trying first of all to teach them the basic tools of their own possible learning process, which should have been in their possession years before. It is these tools that should have been conveyed by the secondary type of teacher who passes on traditional learning.
0j5u | Take another instance. Primitive thought depends strongly upon regularity, upon rhythm, upon reassurance. This is per- petuated in our time in the atavism whereby people have been encouraged to believe that they must be taught at a certain time (preferably the same time each day or week) in the same surround- ings, in the same manner. Tell them that this belongs to children and they may take it in one way, but they will tend to become confused and refuse, in effect, to take it in another.
u6dp | But do the reverse: give them authority figures, canonical books, hierarchies of authority, symbols, chants and costumes, and they will worship you and believe that you are on the 'right lines', whether they are or not; whether or not you have made up the cult the day before.
hnb4 | This, too, real teachers have been compelled to demonstrate in actual instances before people would credit it.
a0sw | If you cannot rationalise their previous learning with your teaching, you will have a hard time of it. You will be like a man telling a bedtime story to a child who refuses to agree that the wolf did not really eat up Red Riding Hood's grandmother after all.
aak4 | You will break the primitive totems at your peril. The irony here is that, if you allow yourself to be discredited in the eyes of the learner, you will harm him as well: for he has no other recourse, more often than not, than to adhere to some other system: one which will reassure him while inhibiting his progress.
7l7y | Now there is another category of people. Those are the ones, who listen to, or read, entire expositions like the foregoing, and feel that they are exactly right. This feeling leads them to suppose
p1kn | 241
49ym | that they must surely be first-class material. The real fact is that people who can attain a higher knowledge are those who can feel it in the right way: not just the people who decide that they are the 'right people'.
abvj | In contemporary civilisations there is hardly a real thought about the possibility that people who feel a thing strongly may be feeling it in an erroneous and unconstructive manner except in delusion situations; let alone a word or words to describe the various states in which one can feel the conditioned conscience.
k4xq | The bitter truth is that, if a real metaphysical path is to be opened and maintained, it has to be mainly recruited from and staffed by people who have perhaps never heard of 'higher con- sciousness' or 'self realisation' in their lives. This is because the associative mechanism which does so much harm to man has long ago taken over the major part of the mentation of the would-be illuminated. Those who can save them are those whom they tend to discount, even to despise. They are people who are often younger, less experienced.
ok5a | Esoteric studies today, as viewed by someone from outside, are an oldster's world, redolent of all the bitternesses and stupidities of the unregenerate old. A bitter thought in itself? Only if you are yourself bitter. If you can see a little more objectively, these remarks are statements of fact, and therefore of constructive potential.
2ngm | What is so amazing is that people will so readily throw away the promise of a lifetime for what Rumi called the 'nuts and raisins and games' of shallower satisfactions.
mtp1 | No wonder riper minds, hearing of esoteric studies, laugh and shrug them off.
171k | Are you innocent of confabulation, rationalisation, of accepting lower satisfactions, of calling self-indulgence 'higher activity', of oppressing others in the name of an assumed seniority, a little brief authority, of suppressing your own inklings and of mas- querade?
gugp | At the risk of adopting unfashionable terminology, I have to say that for all these and many other ways of thinking, feeling and acting, payment has some time to be made.
axri | The question of the present-day receptivity of people to Sufi
iqve | 242
o7st | ideas has not changed since the times when, 1,000 years ago, Hujwiri in his Revelation of the Veiled gave a little story which pointed out that you cannot receive if your mind is blocked with crude aspirations.
jsfl | FAVOURS AND SLAVES
0px6 | A dervish and a king met. The king, following the custom in the East when a ruler meets a subject, said: 'Ask me a favour.'
9n3l | The dervish said: 'I will not request a favour from one of my own slaves.'
09gz | The king asked him how he could see him as a slave.
pppg | The dervish answered: I have two slaves who are your own masters: greed and expectation.'
clpf | The receptivity of man to Sufi ideas, which you ask about, is sometimes clouded by the demand for "being given' something. I say clouded, because there are really three conditions which have to be looked at. First, there is the potential of the human being- the endowment which he already has; second there is the inter- vention of the teaching function; lastly there is the effort which the individual makes in accepting the teaching and preserving the endowment.
ish5 | The last item is one about which people seem to have the least idea. Human potentiality is an endowment: and one which can be preserved, enriched and also spent.
gazp | So, in addition to getting something, how about some attention to the matter of not losing something? Although I admit that this is a matter more easily understood by perception of how people are wasting their assets in this direction, at least the question can be stated in so many words.
ospq | THOUGHTLESSNESS
l6fu | There is a parable about this, attributed to Jesus, but which does not appear in the approved gospels: though this does not make the analogy itself any less true. It is found in the putative Gospel of Thomas, which was found in Egypt in 1945.
031c | In this story, reference is made to a, woman carrying a container
grg5 | 243
0n4f | of meal and walking a long distance. Unknown to her, the meal flows out behind her 'and she did not know how to work'. When she arrived at her house, she put down the container and found it to be empty. This parable refers to the 'Kingdom of the Father", and its applicability to our contention about the imperceptible loss of potentiality, through a form of thoughtlessness (called by the Sufis 'heedlessness') is very apposite to this subject
wbhc | SELLING HALF THE HOUSE
kqsp | About giving and getting, Nasrudin visited a house-agent one day: 'I want to sell one half of the house I live in' he said.
hone | 'But Mulla, I know your house - you only own one-half of it'
sngr | That is exactly the point. I want to sell my half to buy the other half with the money I raise from the deal.'
ojot | 244
rg5s | The Giving of Charity
yppk | Q: Have you any remarks to make on the giving of Charity among Sufis?
et9b | A: One commanding principle of all Sufis, binding upon them, is secret charity. Charity takes many forms. As to monetary charity:
