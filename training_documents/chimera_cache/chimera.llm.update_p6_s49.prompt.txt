You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

oksu | To select the best configuration of <LATEX>W</LATEX> and <LATEX>D ,</LATEX> we build a perfor- mance model to predict the runtime of a single training iteration (represented by <LATEX>\left. T \right)</LATEX> for each available configuration. For the compu-
wtow | we measure the runtime of the forward pass on a <LATEX>F _ { t } .</LATEX> The runtime of backward pass (represented as
o22k | two times of the forward pass if no activation recomputation is used, and three times otherwise. We define the critical path as a series of pipeline stages with dependency that determine the overall computation overhead of a single training iteration. An example of critical path is shown in Figure 6. Let <LATEX>C _ { f }</LATEX> and <LATEX>C _ { b }</LATEX> denote the number of forward passes and backward passes on the critical path of the pipeline, respectively. For the example shown in Figure 6, <LATEX>C _ { f } = 6</LATEX> <LATEX>C _ { b } = 1 0 .</LATEX> The total computation overhead is
nwfz | <LATEX>F _ { t } C _ { f } + B _ { t } C _ { b } .</LATEX> To model the communication overhead, we assume bidirectional and direct point-to-point communication between the compute nodes, and use the classic Latency-Bandwidth <LATEX>\mathrm { d t h } \left( \alpha - \beta \right) .</LATEX> The cost of sending a message of size L is <LATEX>\alpha + \beta I ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> (latency) and <LATEX>\beta</LATEX> (the transfer time per word) can be measured using micro benchmarks. As discussed in Section 3.2, Chimera has two types of communication: <LATEX>p 2 p</LATEX> communication <LATEX>\left( C o m m _ { p 2 p } \right)</LATEX> between stages and allreduce <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { C o m m } _ { a l l r e d u c e } \right)</LATEX> for gradient synchronization. <LATEX>C o m m _ { p 2 p }</LATEX> can be simply modelled by the <LATEX>\alpha - \beta</LATEX> cost model. The total <LATEX>p 2 p</LATEX> communication cost is <LATEX>\left( C _ { f } + C _ { b } \right) C o m m _ { p 2 p } .</LATEX> Note that <LATEX>C o m m _ { P } 2 p</LATEX> can be partially overlapped by the intermediate bubbles if there are any, but to simplify the model we do not consider that effect.
nvfy | For Commallreduce, we assume its implementation makes use of Rabenseifner's algorithm [42, 53], whose cost is
mror | <LATEX>= 2 \left( \log _ { 2 } r \right) \alpha + 2 \left( r - 1 \right) \beta L / r</LATEX> where L is the size of gradients to be synchronized and <LATEX>r</LATEX> is the num- ber of stage replicas. Note that Rabenseifner's algorithm reaches the lower bound on the bandwidth term for host-based allreduce, and therefore works best for large models. We model the effect of com- munication overlapping (discussed in Section 3.2) for Comm allreduce. Figure 6 shows an example of the free regions (i.e., exceeding which will increase the total runtime) utilized in Chimera to over- lap the gradient synchronization. Note that there are two stage replicas on each worker. Regions (a) and (b) can be utilized to overlap the gradient synchronization for the first stage replica (the one with a larger stage ID), and region (c) can be utilized to overlap the gradient synchronization for both stage replicas. Let <LATEX>\mathrm { C o m m } _ { \mathrm { u n o v e r l a p p e d } } \left( i \right)</LATEX> represent the portion of <LATEX>\mathrm { C o m m } _ { a l l r e d u c e }</LATEX> which can not be overlapped by the free regions on worker <LATEX>i</LATEX> i, and then the max of <LATEX>\mathrm { C o m m } _ { u n o v e r l a p p e d } \left( i \right)</LATEX> among the <LATEX>D</LATEX> workers con- tributes to the total runtime.
zlxc | Overall, the runtime of <LATEX>a</LATEX> single training iteration is modelled as
k0bw | <LATEX>T = \left( F _ { t } + C o m m _ { p 2 p } \right) C _ { f } + \left( B _ { t } + C o m m _ { p 2 p } \right) C _ { b } +</LATEX> <LATEX>m a x \left\{ C o m m _ { u n o v e r l a p p e d } \left( i \right) : i \in \left[ 0 , D - 1 \right] \right\} .</LATEX> (1)
aq5a | We use this model to select the best configuration of <LATEX>W</LATEX> and <LATEX>D</LATEX> (see Section 4.2.2).
sc5y | 3.5 Scale to More Micro-Batches
0yab | For a large <LATEX>\widehat { \mathcal{B} } ,</LATEX> there may be more than <LATEX>D</LATEX> micro-batches in a training iteration for each worker (i.e., <LATEX>\left. N > D \right) ,</LATEX> especially when the compute resources are limited. To scale to a large <LATEX>\widehat { B } ,</LATEX> we first choose the
w95z | <LATEX>B</LATEX> <LATEX>D</LATEX> <LATEX>a n d \quad s c h e d u l e \quad t h e s e \quad D \quad m i c r o - b a t c h e s \quad u s i n g \quad b i d i r e c t i o n a l \quad p i p e l i n e s \quad a s</LATEX> as a basic scheduling unit, and scale to a large <LATEX>\widehat { B }</LATEX> by concatenating K <LATEX>\left( K = N / D \right.</LATEX> and <LATEX>\left. N = \widehat { B } / W / B \right)</LATEX> basic units together. Figure 7(a) presents an example with N=2D micro-batches in a training iteration for
