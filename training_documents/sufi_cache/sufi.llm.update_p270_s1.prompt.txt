You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

r2i6 | His intention was to get money and goods. What did he get?
sgha | His defence lawyer explained in Court. In every single one of the nine shops which he visited, identifying himself as the coun- cillor, he was assailed by complaints about the public services. 'At one stage, to get out of a shop, he even left his telephone number for a lady shop assistant to contact him about the transfer of a house.'
y3c5 | He was found guilty of forgery and housebreaking: but the disparity between his expectation and the reality was due to the fact that he made assumptions about what would be likely to happen if he did certain things: and his ignorance was his undoing.
10g0 | If people know about the effects of these exercises, they do not need to ask such questions as we have here. If they do not, it cannot be explained to them better than through an allegory such as this, taken from real life.
nl64 | I like the headline to the account. It is: 'The thief who stole another man's burden.'
a6si | Random exercises are more likely than not to have the effect which taking Mulla Nasrudin's advice would have had, in this example of his wisdom:
o25a | 'Nasrudin, you are a man of experience,' said a philosopher; 'Have you heard of a cure for aching eyes? I read a lot, and mine are giving me trouble.'
u5gt | 'All I can say is,' replied the Mulla, 'that I once had pain in two teeth. It did not stop until I had them both out.'
f50c | On the Lines of a School
8x23 | Q: When is a student in a school, and when is he only 'working on the lines of a school'?
nf5i | A: When you are in a school, and not working along the lines of a school, you are not effectively in a school at all, are you? If you are in a workshop and you are fast asleep, it is, effectively, a bedroom, is it not?
6f7n | When you are 'working on the lines of a school', you are in a school. The only kind of 'working' that I can think of in which it could be said that you are 'only working along lines' is if you are being imitative. For instance, I would call 'working on lines', as near as I can interpret the phrase, as 'pretending to do something'; as when one might be amusing oneself while imagining that one is doing something more useful or important. But I would not use your turn of phrase to describe this condition, since I assign a technical-term value to the word 'working'.
r0bb | 'Working' means to me 'doing what a school does and not pre- tending to do it or inventing reasons or interpretations for it.' In this kind of working, it is the relationship between the people and the activity which constitutes 'The Work', and this work cannot but be along the right lines.
ucxa | If I wanted to look at this question so as to obtain some sort of study advantage from it, I would have to rephrase, and to make a general kind of statement, like:
dpzv | 'People want to learn. What tends to prevent most of them, consequently at best providing considerable delays in learning, at worst a distorted kind of activity for personal and group amuse- ment, is the maintenance of disabling tendencies, manifested by greed to learn, lack of self-observation, desire for social esteem beyond a reasonable amount, reluctance to learn creating a desire to fantasise instead, personal over-valuation or impatience resulting in attempting to achieve irrelevant or premature target ..
p3zg | Sufi study must be real, not imitation. 'Working on lines' is imitation.
dcq6 | To be engaged in the work of a school, the student must be able to approach this definition, given by Abu'l-Hasan Nuri, that the aim is to achieve 'freedom and generosity and abandoning [unnecessary] burdens, weakness of mind and liberality with the world.'
4onb | As Hujwiri explains, this means that to attain to real Sufi status, freedom includes the leaving off of the influence of attachments - what we would call the effects of conditioning and meanness- and giving those things which belong to mundane estimation 'generously', as it would appear, to those who prize them.
j6i2 | This is the 'reality without a name' in Abu'l-Hasan Fushanji's memorable cry, over a thousand years ago: 'Being a Sufi today is a name without a reality: and formerly it was a reality without a name.'
su8b | People constandy insist that, since information and knowledge about Sufi principles and practices are so widespread, all that is needed is to put them into practice.
ap79 | And yet one sees almost every day how the really sad thing about supposedly serious people is that they actually disdain to learn from things which they regard as trivial: but which have important lessons for them if they would only see. The fact is that they do not see, and that is why there has to be a real school, to make sure that all appropriate actions and teachings are ob- served.
o2lj | The tale of the Emperor's New Clothes, of course, teaches that one should be able to learn from any source and not reject it when it is not interesting enough to you, or if it lacks a million dollars, or a PhD, or mighty arms, or a spiritual reputation . . .
9ksk | It is characteristic of humanity (which includes people trying to 'work on the lines of a school') that, while all necessary knowledge or information may be present, people either take no notice of it, or only adopt such parts as they please.
3rje | INFORMATION AND ACTION
1ib3 | This current example [The Times, London, 18 November 1976, p. 8, col 2/4] puts it in a nutshell. Just because it is about eating and not about other intakes, however, how many people will spot the parallel?
lokq | The German Society for Nutrition checked 50,000 households to see how people ate. In spite of widespread public information about wrong diet and overeating, it was found that the damage done to health through wrong eating habits stands annually as DM 17,000 million (£4,250 million or $7,225 million). The damage done by smoking and drinking is only DM 3,000 million a year, in contrast. One West German in two is overweight. All categories of people get the wrong balance and quantities of calories and proteins. Only 10% of the populace are their correct weight. Almost everyone gets too few vitamins.
i9g3 | Like all the other parallels which one notes, this is not intended to single out a specific community-in this case Germans-for we may find similar, equivalent, data everywhere.
aprs | Conduct- Teaching
nna4 | Q: We read about people spending time with Sufi teachers, and we know that Sufis may remain in contact with those who want to learn for periods of years. Many accounts of the lives and actions of Sufi teachers and their interactions with disciples and also members of the ordinary public have been constantly published, originally in the East, and more recently widely in the West. What is the purpose of the 'conduct teaching' of the Sufis, as distinct from the purpose of spiritual exercises or explanations and ad- monitions?
83b6 | A: Interaction-teaching between a teacher and a learner has many aspects. One which is perhaps the most readily grasped but very neglected in understanding by students is that the impacts, stimuli and activities devised by the Sufi are intended to illustrate behaviour and expose subjective reactions. Great Sufis 'shocked' people, for instance, to let them experience the narrowness of their own cast of mind. Sufis continue to shock narrow-minded people, though there is of course no guarantee that such people will benefit from this experience. Sometimes mere onlookers benefit instead. Remember that the definition of a learner is one who learns, not one who thinks that he is a student.
