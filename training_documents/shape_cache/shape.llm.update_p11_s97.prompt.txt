You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

The t-test achieved Power(1 - ß err prob) = 1.0, Effect size <LATEX>d z = 1 . 0 ,</LATEX> satis- fying our statistical power requirements. The mean increase in waist location height was 1.22 cm, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 1.67 to 1.27 cm. The eta- squared statistic (0.56) indicates a large effect size. Our results show that 71.9% of participants had a higher waist

The large number of participants with their smallest waist existing above SizeUK's <LATEX>S o B + 4 . 0 \quad c m</LATEX> region illustrates the need to consider measurement placement and its impact on shape definitions.
8hul | We, therefore, accept Hypothesis 3.
87vz | Shoulder measurement's influence
ym66 | Investigating hypothesis 4, we added shoulder measure- ments to a Multinomial Logistic Regression model
l0a3 | <LATEX>\left( \alpha = 0 . 0 5 \right)</LATEX> containing only the intercept. Adding shoul- der measurements significantly improved the fit between model and data: x2(18, <LATEX>\left. N = 1 6 7 9 \right) =</LATEX> 322.386, Nagelkerke <LATEX>R ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 8 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>p < 0 . 0 1 .</LATEX> Shoulder-to- Shoulder measurements - Horizontal and Calliper - made significant contributions to the model, as Table 4 shows. Shoulder girth (full) did not, however, signifi- cantly contribute to the model. We confirmed Horizontal and Calliper shoulder measurements' Goodness of Fit through Hosmer-Lemeshow tests for each pair of groups, with both tests reporting
u8nw | <LATEX>p > 0 . 0 5 .</LATEX> Considering parameter estimates, the Horizontal and Calliper shoulder measurements' predictor has six parameters: one for each of the FFIT body shape clas- sifications, excluding the hourglass shape that acted as the reference group. To interpret the differences between predictors, Table 5 shows the parameter esti- mate and lists each shoulder measurement, standar- dised to: <LATEX>M = 0 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>S D =</LATEX> 1.
l2v9 | Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal) is the most powerful predictor for body shape classification com- pared to the hourglass shape. Bottom Hourglass pre- diction is, however, the exception.
afbe | To improve the model's predictive power, we culled Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Calliper) from the model because of its insignificant association with the FFIT Body Shape Classification. The resulting model was statistically sig- nificant <LATEX>x ^ { 2 } \left( 1 6 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. N = 1 6 7 9 \right) = 2 7 7 . 2 6 5 ,</LATEX> Nagelkerke <LATEX>R ^ { 2 } =</LATEX> 0.16, <LATEX>p < 0 . 0 1 ,</LATEX> correctly classifying 37.2% of all partici- pants FFIT Body Shape. Despite the significant result, the model cannot correctly predict: Inverted Triangle, Triangle, Top Hourglass, or Spoon shapes, as Table 6 shows. Hourglass was the only shape with a high level of predictive capability: correctly identified in 63.2% of
78r8 | cases. Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal) may, therefore, be a further factor in defining body shape. Systems like FFIT could include this measurement.
320g | We, therefore, reject hypothesis 4.
tp8g | A one-way between-groups analysis of variance explored the FFIT body shape's association with shoul- der-to-shoulder (horizontal) measurements. There was a statistically significant difference at the <LATEX>p < 0 . 0 5</LATEX> level for shoulder measurements for the FFIT's seven body shapes; <LATEX>F \left( 6 , 8 8 . 8 7 \right) = 4 1 . 6 5 8 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>p < 0 . 0 1 .</LATEX> The <LATEX>^ { 2 }</LATEX> was 0.16, indicating a large effect size. The ANOVA test achieved <LATEX>\left( 1 - \beta \right.</LATEX> err <LATEX>\left. \mathrm { p r o b } \right) = 1 . 0 ,</LATEX> Effect size <LATEX>f =</LATEX> 0.41, satisfying our statistical power requirements.
