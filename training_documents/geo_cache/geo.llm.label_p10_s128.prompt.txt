o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

(2017) suggests that water may ascend towards the production well under these conditions, making seasonal storage of hydrogen in porous storage systems challenging.
bqfb | While the hydrogen density and thus the compressibility in the depth range of UHS systems mainly increases with increasing pressure (Figure 1A), the dynamic viscosity increases significantly with increasing temperature (Figure 1B). In the range of standard conditions up to pressures of 50 MPa and temperatures of 50℃, the viscosity shows a comparable temperature and pressure dependence. For example, hydrogen viscosity increases by about 15% from standard temperature and pressure conditions to an elevated temperature of 50℃ (at standard pressure; Leachman et al., 2009). At standard temperature, viscosity increases by about 18% in the pressure range from 0.1 to 50 MPa (Leachman et al., 2009). In direct comparison, the viscosities of CH4 and CO2 are larger than those of H2, and both show a dominant pressure dependence that far exceeds the behavior of H2 viscosity (Figures 2B, D). Hence, hydrogen has a much higher mobility than CH4 and CO2. The viscosities of H2 and CH4 are still most similar here in comparison and are in the same order of magnitude. As elaborated by Muhammed et al. (2023), underground hydrogen storages could thus be used as a direct substitute for CH4 storage. Due to their viscosities, according to Edlmann et al. (2016) and Heinemann et al. (2018), H2 and CH4 can be stored in a wide range
wwdt | of underground reservoirs because they are not limited by reservoir conditions or depth. Rather, reservoirs are determined based on the geologic characteristics of the reservoirs, as appropriate containment features are required to seal against these mobile gases (Muhammed et al., 2023). But, Paterson (1983) and numerous subsequent studies have shown that the low density, viscosity, and molecular size of H2 result in more viscous fingering and poorer conformation during injection, faster migration toward structurally high sites, and some amount of unrecoverable hydrogen (e.g., Hagemann et al., 2014; Feldmann et al., 2016). For this reason, Epelle et al. (2022), for example, recommend adjusting the flow rate of hydrogen and the size of the wellbore (Sørensen, 2007; Zivar et al., 2021) compared to operation with natural gas to minimize diffusion in porous media.
mn1r | As previously described by us and other studies (e.g., Iglauer, 2022), the optimal depth, d, for UHS systems is in the range of 800-1,100 m depth. Assuming a mean surface temperature of 8.2℃ and an average geothermal gradient of 32℃/km (Agemar et al., 2012), a temperature range of 33.8-43.4℃ results for the target depth. For an average density, Plith, of the overlying rock of 2,300-2,600 kg/m3 and a lithostatic factor, Flith, of 0.5-0.7 (Foh et al., 1979), the pressure at which hydrogen could be stored in UHS systems can be determined using the following simple relationship:
5vqw | PH2 = Flith Xd x 9.81 m.s2 x Plith = 9.03 . . . 19.64 MPa. (2)
meyw | This temperature and pressure range corresponds to the optimal conditions for the geological storage of hydrogen in porous storage systems (black rectangles within Figures 1, 2). The so-called lithostatic factor was introduced here to represent the ratio of working pressure to lithostatic pressure in the reservoir. For this typical geological conditions for porous media storage, hydrogen has a low density and viscosity in the narrow ranges of 6.6-13.5 kg/m3 and 9.2-9.6 µPa-s, respectively (Figures 1A, B). The influence of temperature and pressure variations on the density and viscosity of highly compressible hydrogen is thus almost negligible at this reservoir depth. In contrast, the thermophysical properties of CO2 and CH4 behave in a much more pressure- and temperature-dependent manner, which is reflected in the relative density and viscosity ratios (Figure 2). Within the proposed reservoir range, the density and viscosity ratios of H2 and CH4 do not vary too much (max. +25%; Figures 2A, B), whereas the corresponding ratios of H2 to CO2 can vary by up to a factor of about 2-3 (Figures 2C, D). This has to be considered when re-using former natural gas reservoirs with H2.

75y3 | 4.1 Technical hydrogen storage capacity in former and current UGS systems
s2g2 | Underground gas storage facilities can be adapted for hydrogen storage and some of the currently operating underground storage facilities have already stored town gas with a hydrogen content of about 50-60% in the past. Thus, in a first step, we focus on the installed capacity of underground pore storages in Germany. The hydrogen storage capacity is calculated based on the recoverable volume of natural gas as reported by the State Authority for Mining,

68xu | Energy and Geology in Germany (Landesamt für Bergbau, Energie und Geologie, LBEG). These data are based on empirical values, which are derived from technical and economic considerations for natural gas and, thus, provide sound estimates of the dynamic recovery of hydrogen. The amount of energy stored as hydrogen in the working gas, which describes the portion of gas that is cycled in and out of the reservoir, EH, is calculated according to the modified equation after Mouli-Castillo et al. (2021), that writes
hd35 | EH2 = HHV H2 X WV CH4 X PCH4,STP x PHaires, PH2,STP (3)
2zpk | where HHV H2> WV CH4> PH,STP, and PCHA,STP denote the higher heating value of hydrogen (3.54 kWh/m3), the working gas volume of natural gas in the storage system at STP, and the density of hydrogen and methane at STP, respectively. PH2,res and PCHA,res refer to the hydrogen and methane density at pressure and temperature when the reservoir is full (Pmax). However, estimates on the operating gas pressure Pmin / max are not publicity available and we, therefore, estimate the maximum gas operation pressure to be 70% of the overburden pressure in accordance with Foh et al. (1979). In Eq. 3, the product of the density ratio is utilized for the conversion of reported methane working gas volumes at STP to hydrogen gas volumes at STP. However, our data suggest that a constant conversion parameter of 0.85 can be used over a range of temperatures and pressures relevant to underground gas storage, as shown in Table 2. The results are summarized in Table 2 and Figure 3. At present, there are 16 underground pore storage facilities installed in Germany that have total installed capacity of around 8 bcm of natural gas with a thermal energy content of 95.244 TWh, estimated using a higher heating value of 11.07 kWh/m3 for methane. This represents about one-third of the total underground storage capacity of natural gas in Germany. The remaining natural gas is stored in 272 salt caverns. In contrast, the corresponding hydrogen storage capacity is lower, amounting to around 7 bcm of hydrogen gas with a thermal energy content of 25 TWh, given its lower energy content per volume (3.54 kWh/m3). The distribution of these pore storages is shown in Figure 3. Hence, more volume is needed to store the same amount of energy compared to natural gas and other common fuels. Furthermore, decommissioned pore storage facilities could potentially provide an additional storage potential of 1 bcm of hydrogen or 4 TWh of hydrogen energy equivalent. Hence a total of 8 bcm of hydrogen, which amounts to 29 TWh of hydrogen energy equivalent could be stored in current and former UGS pore storage systems. Figure 3 shows the distribution of all pore storage (active and inactive) and compares it to the planned network expansion initiative IPCEI.
epu7 | 4.2 Theoretical hydrogen storage capacity in saline aquifers
7od1 | Additional underground storage capacities may become available in saline aquifers that hold the highest storage potential due to their widespread occurrence. In order to assess the hydrogen storage capacity in saline aquifers, we employ the volumetric assessment of CO2 storage capacities in saline aquifers, as previously conducted by Knopf and May (2017). This probabilistic approach yields a proven, median, and

Most of these resources are located in the North German Basin with estimated CO2 storage capacities ranging from 19.3 Gt (P10)-108.6 Gt (P90) (Knopf and May, 2017). By applying this data, we can estimate the thermal hydrogen energy content using

y7ea | where EH2 is the energy content of hydrogen (in PWh), Mco2 is the mass of stored CO2 (in Gt), HHVH2 is the higher heating value of hydrogen (39.4 kWh/kg), RG is the recoverable working gas volume (i.e., portion of the working gas volume: 0.4-0.6), and the ratio PH2 is used to convert the mass of stored CO2 to the mass PCO2 of stored hydrogen. Knopf and May (2017) set an upper vertical limit of 800 m (Reinhold et al., 2011) in their analysis, at which

e8nr | CO2 is typically subjected to temperatures and pressures that preserve CO2 in a supercritical state. At these conditions the resulting CO2 densities are two orders of magnitude greater compared to gaseous H2 (Figure 1). The CO2 storage capacity can therefore be converted to the mass of stored hydrogen, MH2 (in Gt), based on a conversion factor of 0.01 (i.e., Pco) PH2 = 0.01; Figure 2C). Hence, saline aquifers may yield an additional capacity of 81.6 (Mt)-691.8 (Mt) working gas volume of hydrogen resulting in 3.2-27.3 PWh of hydrogen energy equivalent, but almost all of these storage capacities are restricted to the North German Basin, which may hold 3.0-25.7 PWh of hydrogen energy equivalent. Nevertheless, one should keep in mind that these estimates represent theoretical capacities, and the extent to which these reserves can actually be used should be verified based on the storage criteria proposed here, but will also depend on technical, economic, environmental, and social aspects and requires further analysis.

g9du | 5 Discussion
f682 | 5.1 Storage capacities and requirements in Europe
li1k | Existing and decommissioned underground pore storage facilities may account for up to 30 TWh of energy equivalent of hydrogen, but are unlikely to meet future storage requirements of 34-667 TWh (Lux et al., 2022), not least because an overall conversion of all storage facilities from natural gas to hydrogen is unlikely. To meet these future storage requirements, additional capacities may be needed in the form of depleted hydrocarbon fields and saline aquifers. Approximately 3.2-27.3 PWh of hydrogen energy equivalent could be stored in saline aquifers in Germany, which is comparable to the technical storage potential in salt caverns that has been estimated at 35.7 PWh (Caglayan et al., 2020) and similar to the hydrogen storage potential in saline aquifers in the UK with an estimated capacity of 2.1 PWh of energy equivalent of hydrogen (Scafidi et al., 2021). In practice, many of the storage sites may, however, prove unsuitable, given the technical, economic and social constraints or not least because of the increasing competition between different geotechnical applications, be it geothermal energy or storage of natural gas, CO2, or hydrogen (Suchi et al., 2014).
pbea | Other additional storage options that have been discussed in the literature include depleted gas and oil fields, which are considered appropriate for hydrogen underground storage because of their proven containment of natural gas, well explored subsurface, and developed capacity and infrastructure (e.g., see reviews by Raza et al., 2022; Zivar et al., 2021; Heinemann et al., 2021c). Capacity estimates in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands show large potentials. Scafidi et al. (2021) identified 95 suitable depleted gas fields on the UK continental shelf with a total working gas capacity of 6.9 PWh energy equivalent of hydrogen. This estimate is slightly higher than the total hydrocarbon storage capacity in gas fields reported by Mouli-Castillo et al. (2021), which is based on the initial gas-in-place capacity of the respective hydrocarbon fields resulting in 2.7 PWh energy equivalent of hydrogen. Large storage potentials in depleted gas fields were also predicted for the Netherlands, one of the largest producers of natural gas in Europe. Estimates based on the original- gas-in-place analysis show that onshore capacities of 277 TWh and offshore capacities of 179 TWh could add up to a total of 456 TWh energy equivalent of hydrogen in the Netherlands, which is an order of magnitude higher than the estimated hydrogen storage potential in salt caverns of 43 TWh. In Germany, too, depleted gas and oil fields could offer large storage capacities, but estimates on the original gas in place capacity are not publicity available, only cumulative production numbers (LBEG, 2021). Cumulative gas production from all fields at STP is 1.058512 x 1012 m3 (current as of 1 January 2021; LBEG, 2021). Of this, 114.719 x 109 m3 of natural gas was produced from gas fields that are depleted today, most of it in Lower Saxony (LBEG, 2021).
