You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

a2kn | Even if you come up with something you're not actually willing to do, it's okay. The goal here is to push your limits and jog your brain into thinking of a different version of the solution you'd normally default to. This is where you get to flex your entrepreneurial creativity.
84li | Reminder: You only need to do this once. Literally one time for a product that may last years. This is high-value, high- leverage work. You ultimately get paid for thinking. You got this. This should be fun. Go ahead and list out all your possibilities now. Then I'll take you through my example. I'll just use the buying food problem from earlier as an example. I like to group things by how many people I'm going to deliver this thing to at once.
oh1c | My list is below. And at the bottom, I've given you my "cheat codes" for how I think through this to get even more creative.
apax | Problem: Buying Healthy Food Is Hard, Confusing, and I Won't Like It
zc7j | If I wanted to provide a one-on-one solution I might offer . . .
96pn | 1. In-person grocery shopping, where I take clients to the store and teach them how to shop
txea | 2. Personalized grocery list, where I teach them how to make their list
8oh3 | 3. Full-service shopping, where I buy their food for them. We're talking 100 percent done for them.
m27u | 4. In-person orientation (not at store), where I teach them what to get
s0b6 | 5. Text support while shopping, where I help them if they get stuck
ihlu | 6. Phone call while grocery shopping, where I plan to call when they go shopping to provide direction and support
r3zr | If I wanted to provide a small group solution I might offer . . .
j6ku | 1. In-person grocery shopping, where I meet a bunch of people and take them all shopping for themselves
zt0d | 2. Personalized grocery list, where I teach a bunch of people how to make their weekly lists. I could do this one time or every week if I wanted to.
ej0q | 3. Buy their food for them, where I purchase their groceries and deliver them as well
dg44 | 4. In-person orientation, where I teach a small group offsite what to do (not at store)
lhtj | If I wanted to provide a one to many solution I might offer . . .
ns07 | 1. Live grocery tour virtual, where I might live stream me going through the grocery store for all my new customers and let them ask questions live
q8bx | 2. Recorded grocery tour, where I might shop once, record it, then give it as a reference point from that point onwards for my clients to watch on their own
lftq | 3. DIY grocery calculator, where I create a shareable tool or show them how to use a tool to calculate their grocery list
hyaf | 4. Predetermined lists, where each customer plan comes with its own grocery list for each week. I could make this ahead of time so they have it. Then they could use it on their own time
9etn | 5. Grocery buddy system, where I could pair customers all up, which takes no time really, and let them go shopping together
2bic | 6. Pre-made, insta-cart grocery carts for delivery, where I could pre-make insta-cart lists so clients could have their groceries delivered to their doorstep with one click
jras | As you see, the list can really go on and on here. This is just to illustrate the many ways to solve a single problem. Now do this for all of the perceived problems that your clients encounter before, after, and during their experience with your service/products. You should have a monster list by the end of this.
dwvf | Product Delivery Cheat Codes
ic87 | What's that? You're having trouble being creative? I'm going to give you the cheat codes right now, kind of like I did with the brick example: "the brick could be gold, or plastic, or have holes in it, or be a lego, etc." Here are my "cheat codes" for product variation/enhancement and a visual to break down the process for you from my consulting deck:
bxpw | Delivery Cube
4g09 | I-I, Sm Gr, I-Many
txr8 | Consumption
rsup | LIVE
hk1c | Speed & Convenience
na8b | DIY-DWY-DFY
a4wk | M-F?
bi02 | 24/7 9-5
yc23 | DIY
ki0m | IOX & 1/10th Test
6wrx | Support
u4q7 | X
jd7m | IOX or
sknv | SMS
usuw | <LATEX>I / I O X</LATEX> ACQUISITIONIM
d4hr | 1. What level of personal attention do I want to provide? one-on-one, small group, one to many
ph8j | 2. What level of effort is expected from them? Do it themselves (DIY) - figure out how to do it on their own; do it with them (DWY) - you teach them how to do it; done for them (DFY) - you do it for them
bemf | 3. If doing something live, what environment or medium do I want to deliver it in? In-person, phone support, email support, text support, Zoom support, chat support
s9l9 | 4. If doing a recording, how do I want them to consume it? Audio, video, or written.
bs07 | 5. How quickly do we want to reply? On what days? during what hours? 24/7. 9-5, within 5 minutes, within an hour, within 24 hrs?
y6eq | 6. 10x to 1/10th test. If my customers paid me 10x my price (or $100,000) what would I provide? If they paid me <LATEX>1 / 1 0 ^ { \text { th } }</LATEX> the price and I had to make my product more valuable than it already is, how would I do that? How could I still make them successful for <LATEX>1 / 1 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }</LATEX> price? Stretch your mind in either direction and you'll come up with widely different solutions.
0tl4 | In other words, how could I actually deliver on these solutions I am claiming I will provide. Do this for each problem because solutions from one problem will give you ideas for others you wouldn't normally have considered.
vbq2 | Remember, it's important that you solve every problem. I can't tell you the amount of times one single item becomes the reason someone doesn't buy.
pfrt | Anecdote: Why We Must Solve Every Perceived Problem
iws8 | One month I really needed to make some sales to pay rent. My next sale walked in the door - it was a business exec looking to lose weight. As we got into the sales presentation, she told me the program wouldn't work for her because she went out to eat for lunch everyday. Normally, I would have lost this sale. I was a stickler for making people not eat out. But I really needed the money. Refusing to lose the sale because of this one thing, I conceded "I'll make you an eating out guide for when you go to restaurants so you can eat our 100 percent of the time and still hit your goal. How does that sound?" She agreed, and I closed the sale.
n452 | I took the time to make an eating out guide for her. But from that point going forward, whenever someone said "but what about eating out ?? " I had the solution. Over time, I continued solving obstacles with templates and trainings until there were no more "one things" to prevent my sales. This lesson has stuck with me to this day. Don't get romantic about how you want to solve the problem. Find a way to solve every problem a prospect presents with. When you do that, you make an offer that's so good, people just can't say no. And that's what we're building here.
ztct | Note: You must resolve every obstacle a buyer believes they will have to convert the highest amount of people. That's not to say that if you don't, you won't sell people. Not at all. But you won't sell as many people as you otherwise could have. And that's the goal, to sell the most people, for the highest possible price, with the highest possible margin.
