        "content": "d5bz | EWAS of life span was done in twenty-eight thousand three hundred eighteen CpGs that apply to mice and humans according to calibration and titration data (correlation with calibration exceeds zero point eight) and mappability information as described in. Because the distribution of maximum life span and other life history traits were highly skewed, we imposed a log transformation on these phenotypes before conducting EWAS. Our tissue type-specific EWAS was conducted in tissues with enough species P greater than twenty-five available. For our various EWAS of log-transformed maximum life span, significance threshold eighteen times ten to the negative six based on the conservative Bonferroni adjustment. We report an FDR in our enrichment studies to adjust for multiple comparisons.\nap5o | DNA methylation networks underlying mammalian traits\n7zvf | Editor's summary\nmov9 | DNA methylation installs a methyl group to cytosine, placing an epigenetic mark that regulates gene expression. Comparative epigenomics combines epigenetic signatures with phylogenetic relationships to understand species characteristics. Haghani et al. evaluated methylation levels in highly conserved DNA sequences, profiling approximately fifteen thousand samples across three hundred forty-eight mammalian species. Phylogenetic trees suggest that the divergence of DNA methylation profiles closely mirrors genetic evolution. Species with longer maximum life spans have developed tidier methylation patterns within the genome, characterized by unique peaks and troughs of methylation. Methylation patterns associated with maximum life spans generally differ from those connected to age or interventions that affect mortality risk in mice. These data provide a rich resource of information for fields including evolutionary biology and longevity research. - Di Jiang",
