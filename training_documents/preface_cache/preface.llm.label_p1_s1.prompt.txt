You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1pjs | Preface to the Revised Edition
o2kr | S ince the publication of the first edition of this book, trends of increasing concentration in food and agricultural industries have only intensified, but so has increasing awareness and resistance to these trends. In the United States, politicians from both major parties are more likely to criticize dominant firms in concentrated industries, or at least some of the most egregious ways this power is employed. A rapidly expanding number of books and articles call for greater government action to foster more competitive markets, and new coalitions are forming to take on corporate power. Perhaps the biggest surprise has been the growing number of economists willing to conduct research that challenges the pro-concentration assumptions of their discipline, which have been hegemonic in recent decades.
v6sk | The Covid-19 pandemic has also helped more people to recognize problems with placing control over what we eat into so few hands. A disproportionate number of cases occurred among food chain workers, for example, which resulted in plant closures, empty retail shelves for some products, and purchasing restrictions for others. These consequences illustrated how much of our food supply is controlled by a small number of firms, and how fragile this system is in a crisis-although this has yet to translate into significant government action to reduce concentration. Jeff Bezos, for instance, was already the world's wealthiest individual, as CEO of online retailer Amazon, yet from March to August of 2020 his fortune increased 63 percent. During the same period, approximately one-third of restaurants in the United States, mostly independent, closed permanently.
1wj6 | The pandemic catalyzed support for alternatives to concentrated food systems, however, as well as the creation of new alternatives. Community Supported Agriculture farms, which were struggling to compete with venture capitalist-funded produce delivery firms, experienced skyrocketing demand, and growing waitlists in many regions. Other alternatives, such as retail food cooperatives, local food hubs, and small-scale meat processors also saw rapidly growing interest. Many farmers who lost wholesale and institutional buyers moved quickly to set up roadside stands or online ordering systems to connect with local consumers. These shifts helped to demonstrate the resilience of more democratic food systems in response to a crisis.
936l | PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION
06yq | This new edition updates data on the constantly changing dominant firms' names, market shares, and locations of their headquarters-nearly all of the figures and tables have been revised accordingly. This edition analyzes the progress of their strategies to increase power as well, such as the growing reliance on big data to shape the behavior of farmers and consumers, and the greater role of some governments, particularly China and Brazil, in supporting acquisitions of competitors. Expanding resistance and new alternatives are also examined, such as new ecolabels that embody criteria stricter than USDA organic. Reflecting on both the positive and negative changes since the first edition, I agree with David Dayen, author of Monopolized: Life in the Age of Corporate Power-in an interview with ProMarket (August 27, 2020) he said, "I see a lot of near-term peril, but some long-term hope."
dpv6 | I am grateful to Bloomsbury, and series editors David Goodman and Mike Goodman for making this second edition possible. Thank you Ginger, Drake, and Aya for your encouragement and understanding.
