You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

oae5 | Zhang also observed technological advancements made by other compa- nies. He was particularly impressed by Apple's iPad, which became "magical" once app designers were invited in to populate the iPad boxes with their ideas, and once Apple's customers could personalize their iPads with the variety of apps becoming available, in the process transforming each iPad into a truly unique device. Zhang argued that the iPad was a "platform" for expressing and realizing
s0fl | the dreams of other ecosystem players-app designers and users-and that Haier could similarly be transformed into a platform for the dreams of others, and, in the process, would become faster, more open, and without boundaries.
43ia | Consequently, in December 2012, Haier formally announced that it was "entering the networking stage." On the open platforms that Haier has created as part of developing Rendanheyi 2.0, customers are involved in designing products through discussing product features, product uses, accessories, and potential innovations. These online platforms vary greatly in size and scope, but-as pointed out elsewhere25-they have no organizational boundaries so that different teams of specialists and even former competitors and other partners can join a platform and can draw on considerable resources to unleash entrepreneurial talent and better connect with customers. For example, Haier's online platform for smart- ovens has created an online community of oven users who communicate, exchange cooking recipes, and exchange ideas on ingredients. Oven customers have strong personal incentives for using the platform, and, in the process, they provide a wealth of feedback to the relevant Haier micro-enterprises. As another example, Haier created an online water purification platform that allows users to order a test of the water quality at their home, and, subsequently, Haier offers the user suitable water purification solutions. Prior to the establishment of this plat- form, Haier struggled to sell its newly developed water treatment technology; the platform allowed the Haier micro-enterprise to significantly increase sales and to attract substantial venture capital.
3g2y | Systematic interactions with users and partners on Haier's platforms directly led to the development of an eclectic mix of new products ranging from a Haier mini washing machine for washing children's clothes to new financial prod- ucts such as the Hongsheng platform for financing egg farms. Against this back- ground of substantial technological transformations, Rendanheyi resolved or reduced the impact of ambiguity surrounding the directions for future consumer demand and helped toward realigning technologies and management practices.
gc7v | Institutional. China's institutional context was not entirely conducive to the sort of transformation of the workplace that was required by Rendanheyi. In order to tackle the VUCA environment, Zhang believed that Haier needed to overcome several institutional rigidities and change some of the well-entrenched prac- tices that were perceived to be no longer appropriate or effective. At the core of this transformation was to ask employees to take ownership of their work and become more entrepreneurial. This was a major departure from the tradi- tional top-down approach dominating Chinese organizations. A former adviser to Zhang told us that taking ownership is "not a breakthrough concept in West- ern management, but in Chinese management is really a new concept." The Chinese educational system emphasized conformity and uniformity, producing employees who are used to waiting for orders and are relatively passive. Zhang recalled that it was difficult for employees in 2005 to accept that Haier needed "a transformative process not only for our mindset, but more importantly, for our managerial and organizational structure." In fact, in the ten years after the

j30a | launch of Rendanheyi in 2005, more than 20,000 employees left Haier because they did not or could not buy into the new management system. So, it seems like employees have self-selected to be part of this set of management practices.
7bdk | At the same time though, China's institutional context was conducive to a company that wanted to rapidly transform itself. There is a vibrant entrepreneur- ial culture in China. On one hand, this was facilitated by the Chinese government policy's push for entrepreneurship to become one of the key driving forces for the economy and encouraging and facilitating entrepreneurial activities.26 On the other hand, collectivist societies such as China provide a suitable context for entrepreneurship. In such societies, the feeling of social inclusiveness, collective accountability, as well as reliance on social networks, enhance the entrepreneur's capability to tolerate uncertainty and risk. Collectivist societies may also be par- ticularly conducive to obtaining social capital for new ventures.27
fim0 | The flexibility in the enforcement of China's Employment Contract Law (ECL) provided Haier with an ability to quickly reduce its size from more than 80,000 in 2012 to 60,000 staff in 2016 in order to implement Rendanheyi 2.0. While downsizing in China is subject to some strict rules, the government has long supported the re-structuring of state-owned enterprises that includes mass layoffs.28 Critical for innovating firms in China, Article 41 of the ECL specifi- cally permits mass layoffs when a firm "switches production, introduces a major technical innovation, or revises its business method."29 Likewise, Haier was able to shift the basis of remuneration from paying salaries toward remunera- tion based entirely on performance. Senior Haier managers in foreign subsid- iaries in the United States and Europe state that their legal systems, as well as entrenched employment relationships in these countries, are incompatible with Rendanheyi 2.0 as practiced in China, which is why Haier had to make adaptations when introducing Rendanheyi in its foreign subsidiaries. Rendanheyi was most successfully transplanted by Haier to Russia, but the head of Haier's Russian operation said to us that it is not possible to have quite the same remuneration systems that Haier uses in China because "in Russia we have local law and local worker protection issues" and also because "it is quite difficult for some persons to understand why they should invest money when they join the company."
ojro | China's corporate governance systems also assisted in the introduction of Rendanheyi. The Haier Group and Zhang enjoyed considerable decision-making freedom thanks to the nature of the ownership structure. Although the Haier Group is under partial public ownership, it is technically a "collective" company, whereby its employees own the company. Haier's exact ownership stakes are typi- cally not known, as the ownership of state-owned enterprises (SOE) in China is often shrouded in secrecy, and finding out who the real owners are, let alone the ownership percentage, is extremely difficult.30 In reality, the employees receive no dividends and do not even know how much they own, and the rank-and-file employees have negligible influence on the strategic direction of the firm. The real strategic power resides in a high-degree of strong, top-down leadership at Haier.
l6t9 | Of course, this was also true at Steve Jobs's Apple or Bill Gates's Microsoft, and is presently the case at Alibaba, Xiaomei, Tencent, and other innovative firms.
1ujy | Zhang's freedom to experiment with new management practices was, in addition, strengthened because the Chinese government signaled that Chinese firms should increase the rate of innovation. This was spelled out in the 15-year National Medium- and Long-Term Program for Science and Technology Development that focused on "indigenous innovation" and was issued by the State Council in February 2006. Furthermore, the Shandong provincial govern- ment specifically supported Haier's innovation drive. The Chinese central and provincial governments welcomed Haier's journey into uncharted waters without having to worry about the effects of massive layoffs on public opinion. Thus, China's institutional context actually encouraged putting into place radical new management practices as part of the Rendanheyi platform.
