In response to this case study, two separate teams of experts in creatine metabolism wrote letters to the editor of Lancet. However, the notion that creatine supplementation leads to kidney damage and/or renal dysfunction gained traction and momentum.\n320g | Since this case study was reported in nineteen ninety-eight, experimental and controlled research trials investigating the effects of creatine supplementation on kidney/renal function has substantially increased. Overall, in healthy individuals, there appears to be no adverse effects from consuming recommended doses of creatine supplements on kidney/renal function. Interestingly, Gualano et al. reviewed a small number of case studies which reported renal dysfunction in individuals who were supplementing with creatine. Similar to the case report by Pritchard and Kalra, these additional case reports were confounded by medications, pre-existing kidney disease, concomitant supplement ingestion, inappropriate creatine dosages (e.g., one hundred times recommended dose), and anabolic androgenic steroid use.\ntp8g | It is prudent to be cautious when ingesting any dietary supplement or medication. Survey data indicates that creatine supplementation usage ranges between eight and seventy-four percent in athletes and other exercising individuals. Even with a low estimate of eight percent of exercising individuals using creatine supplements, this indicates thousands of exposures across several decades. If the link between creatine supplementation and kidney health was valid, there would be an expected increase in kidney damage / renal dysfunction in low risk (i.e. young, physically fit, healthy) individuals since nineteen ninety-two after Harris et al. published their seminal work. After nearly thirty years of post-marketing surveillance, thousands of exposures, and multiple clinical trials, no such evidence exists.\ngxfd | In summary, experimental and controlled research indicates that creatine supplementation, when ingested at recommended dosages, does not result in kidney damage and/or renal dysfunction in healthy individuals.\ns2v1 | Does creatine cause hair loss / baldness?\njkp9 | The vast majority of speculation regarding the relationship between creatine supplementation and hair loss/baldness stems from a single study by van der Merwe et al. where college-aged male rugby players who supplemented with creatine (twenty-five grams per day for seven days, followed by five grams per day thereafter for an additional fourteen days) experienced an increase in serum dihydrotestosterone\nz8tt | (DHT) concentrations over time. Specifically, DHT increased by fifty-six percent after the seven-day loading period, and remained forty percent above baseline values after the fourteen-day maintenance period. These results were statistically significant compared to when the subjects consumed a placebo (fifty grams of glucose per day for seven days, followed by thirty grams per day for fourteen days thereafter). Given that changes in these hormones, particularly DHT, have been linked to some (but not all) occurrences of hair loss/baldness, the theory that creatine supplementation leads to hair loss / baldness gained some momentum and this potential link continues to be a common question / myth today. It is important to note that the results of van der Merwe et al. have not been replicated, and that intense resistance exercise itself can cause increases in these androgenic hormones.\n9g22 | DHT is a metabolite of testosterone, formed when the enzyme five-alpha-reductase converts free testosterone to DHT. In males, DHT can bind to androgen receptors in susceptible hair follicles and cause them to shrink, ultimately leading to hair loss. However, in the van der Merwe et al. study, no increase in total testosterone was found in the sixteen males who completed the study. Free testosterone was not measured. Moreover, the increase in DHT and the DHT: testosterone ratio remained well within normal clinical limits. Furthermore, baseline (prior to supplementation), DHT was twenty-three percent lower in the creatine group (zero point ninety-eight nanomoles per liter) compared to the placebo group (one point twenty-six nanomoles per liter). Thus the small increase in DHT in the creatine group (plus zero point fifty-five nanomoles per liter after seven days of supplementation and plus zero point forty nanomoles per liter after twenty-one days of supplementation), in combination with a small decrease in the placebo DHT response (minus zero point seventeen nanomoles per liter after seven days of supplementation and minus zero point twenty nanomoles per liter after twenty-one days of supplementation) explains the \"statistically significant\" increase in DHT noted by van der Merwe et al. While it is possible that creatine supplementation upregulated five-alpha-reductase activity in these males (potentially leading to increased formation of DHT), no study has reported hair loss/baldness in humans.\n41fx | To date, twelve other studies have investigated the effects of creatine supplementation (i.e. doses ranging from three to twenty-five grams per day for six days to twelve weeks) on testosterone. Two studies reported small, physiologically insignificant increases in total testosterone after six and seven days of supplementation, while the remaining ten studies reported no change in testosterone concentrations. In five of these studies, free testosterone, which the body uses to produce DHT, was also measured and no increases were found.\n7um8 | In summary, the current body of evidence does not indicate that creatine supplementation increases total testosterone, free testosterone, DHT or causes hair loss/baldness.\n```",
