        "content": "ewfp | In this meta-study, for each SNV, we integrated the data by considering a TF bound to SNV in different cell types or a cell type and different TFs bound to the same SNV. Surprisingly, ASB identification through data aggregation had better sensitivity than standard ChIP-Seq peak calling at the level of individual data sets. Particularly, in GTRD, the ChIP-Seq peak calls were gathered from four different tools, but only eighty-five to ninety percent of significant ASBs were detected within peak calls, suggesting that up to fifteen percent of ASBs could be lost if the ASB calling was restricted to the peak calls only.\noczy | Each particular ASB can either be a \"driver\" directly altering TF-binding affinity, or a \"passenger\" with differential binding resulting from differential chromatin accessibility, or a protein-protein interaction with the causal TF. In terms of machine learning, we expected the TF ASBs to provide an easier prediction target since they could be mostly determined by the sequence motif of the respective TF. However, as found, the percentage of \"passenger\" ASBs is rather large, and the TF-specific models showed a limited ASB prediction quality. Further surprise came from cell type-specific models which displayed a notably higher performance. We interpret these data as follows: the cell type ASBs are easier to predict by learning a small set of cell type-specific master regulators, while passenger TF-level ASBs are very diverse, as coming from data aggregation of many different cell types with varying cell type-specific features such as key TFs.\n2ttg | ASB events should be distinguished from other sources of allelic imbalance such as aneuploidy and local CNVs, which can imitate ASB by varying the allelic dosage. Commonly used cell types are often aneuploid: K five sixty-two and MCF seven cells are triploid on average, and fifty-nine of one hundred twenty-one cell types overlapping between ADASTRA and COSMIC also have median copy number above two. The ADASTRA pipeline, to our knowledge, includes the first control-free approach to\nhis3 | reconstruct the genomic map of BAD directly from SNP calls and to use this map as a baseline for detecting genuine allelic imbalance. Despite a multitude of available software for ASB calling, there has been no approach suitable for the uniform analysis of diverse existing data. Thus, when developing ADASTRA, the intention was to be able to process and include most of the data including non-replicated experiments, data sets lacking genomic input controls, or with the controls sequenced at low coverage, at the expense of general sensitivity achieved at particular data sets. Further on, such a pipeline might be applicable to other sequencing data that allow allele specificity, e.g., analyses of allele-specific expression or chromatin accessibility. With matched cell types, BAD-corrected data on allele-specific chromatin accessibility will also allow for better classification of driver and passenger ASBs and better application of machine learning techniques.\nm50z | Our collection of ASB events per se is also useful for other research areas involving TF-DNA interactions. First, ASBs provide unique in vivo data on differential TF binding and can be used for testing the predictive power of computational models for precise recognition of TF-binding sites. Second, the TF binding not only affects transcript abundance, but also affects RNA splicing, localization, and stability. Thus, ASBs may affect other levels of gene expression, particularly, the mRNA post-transcriptional modification: out of sixty-five RNAe-QTLs reported, four are listed as ASBs in ADASTRA.\nme84 | Last but not least, ADASTRA reports hundreds of TF-switching ASBs, where alternative alleles are preferably bound by different TFs. This possibility has been discussed previously but, to our knowledge, we are first to report the genome-wide inventory of such events. Importantly, the respective SNVs exhibit the highest enrichment with phenotype associations. Probably these sites serve varying and allele-dependent molecular circuits. A particularly interesting example is rs two eight three seven two eight five two located in the G elongation factor mitochondrial one gene promoter. According to ADASTRA, rs two eight three seven two eight five two serves as the Alt-ASB of CREB one and Ref-ASB of MXI one, and in both cases, the allelic imbalance is concordant with the respective binding motifs. Also, according to GTEx, GFM one is the target of rs two eight three seven two eight five two eQTL. According to UniProt, CREB one is a transcriptional activator, while MXI one is a transcriptional repressor, suggesting that ASB can directly switch the gene expression activity. At the same time, UniProt reports four amino acid substitutions in GFM one that are associated with combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency. Interestingly, according to ClinVar, this SNP is benign in regard to combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency; and in this case we speculate that ASB data might facilitate reevaluating the variants' functional roles and pathogenic potential. We believe that further analysis of TF-switching ASBs in the scope of metabolic and regulatory pathway alterations will provide valuable insights into molecular mechanisms underlying particular normal and pathologic traits.\no56m | Methods\nslz6 | Variant calling from GTRD alignments. We used seven thousand six hundred sixty-nine premade short read alignments against hg thirty-eight genome assembly produced with bowtie two and stored in the GTRD database. PICARD was used for deduplication, followed by GATK base quality recalibration. Next, the variants were called with GATK HaplotypeCaller, with dbSNP common variant set of the build one hundred fifty-one for annotation. The\n90k5 | must be listed as an SNP in the dbSNP one hundred fifty-one common set. Of note, we considered all eligible SNVs as candidate ASB, not necessarily located within ChIP-Seq peak calls.\n9m8s | We restricted ourselves with variants from the the following reasons: (one) allelic read counts at de composition of the cell population rather than the local copy-number ratio or ASB; (two) de novo point mutations within particular copies of duplicated segments\n893y | duplications will exhibit allelic imbalance and may lead to false-positive ASB calls.",
