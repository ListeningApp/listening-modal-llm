Data analyses\nspl6 | The data were used to assess the prevalence of achieving the aforementioned endpoints at the subject-level and, when possible, tooth level. Although 'stable periodontitis' defines a case at the subject-level, the composite measures defining the endpoint P P D less than or equal to four millimeters and P P D equals four millimeters plus BoP were used at the tooth level to identify the teeth responsible for not meeting the endpoint. The number of diseased teeth per patient, as per WWC twenty seventeen, was calculated using the total number of 'unstable' teeth divided by the total number of (i) subjects and (ii) 'unstable' subjects.\n7wzm | Incidence of tooth loss within a minimum duration of five years of SPC was recorded at the subject- and tooth-level in relation to the various endpoints. The number of teeth lost per patient per SPC year was calculated using the total number of teeth lost divided by the total number of subjects with tooth loss data divided by the weighted average SPC years.\ne9xj | Authors of journal articles were contacted if any queries arose from the data. Where data were unavailable for a subject, the corresponding subject was eliminated from the analyses.\n9vl6 | Meta-analyses were performed using 'RStudio' application and R core software to determine the association between the incidence of tooth loss during SPC, as a summary risk ratio, and the unsuccessful achievement of various endpoints. Studies answering FQ-2 with zero subjects or teeth within one of the arms (successful or unsuccessful in meeting endpoints) were not included in the meta-analyses, as two arms were required for the calculation of relative risk. The zero count was inflated to zero point five to avoid computational errors for studies where no events (tooth loss) were observed in one or both arms. Sub-analyses of studies following conventional APT, as per EFP's S three treatment guideline, or those reporting periodontitis-related tooth loss were performed to explore possible causes of heterogeneity among study results. Relative risks, their ratios and the corresponding ninety-five percent confidence intervals were calculated as effect sizes. With treatment outcome affected by subject-, tooth- and treatment-related factors, a random effects model was deemed appropriate to calculate the average distribution of mean effects, based on clinical and statistical reasoning. The Paule-Mandel method was chosen to\nc2fd | WWC twenty seventeen- smokers: twenty-three Stages Three or Four; Grade B within two weeks.

Knapp-Hartung adjustments were used to calculate the confidence interval around the pooled effect.\nba1e | The extent and impact of inter-study heterogeneity was assessed by inspecting the forest plots and by calculating the tau squared absolute heterogeneity and the I squared statistics relative heterogeneity, respectively. I squared defined the proportion of total variability in the result explained by heterogeneity, and not chance. We considered arbitrarily I squared greater than seventy-five percent to represent considerable heterogeneity.\nen95 | Meta-analytical positive predictive values (a subject/tooth not meeting an endpoint and experiencing tooth loss) and negative predictive values (a subject/tooth meeting the endpoint and not experiencing tooth loss) were estimated at the subject and tooth level using pooled sensitivity and specificity for tooth loss across studies. For the meta-analytical pooling of the sensitivity and specificity, the bivariate approach was used as an improvement and extension of the traditional summary receiver operating characteristic approach and the mada function in R.\nl3do | RESULTS\nu9bo | Three point one. Study selection\n7avo | The initial search generated one thousand six hundred eighty-two articles from all databases combined, nine from manual search and one via editorial contact.\nuzo6 | Following screening of titles and abstracts, two hundred thirty articles qualified for full-text screening. The Cohen's kappa value for inter-reviewer agreement was zero point nine three at first stage of screening and zero point nine two at the second stage. Corresponding authors of the sixty-two articles considered potentially suitable for inclusion were contacted for confirmation that all requested data were available. Individual patient data were available for nine studies and summaries of the requested data were made available via completed contingency tables for a further six studies. There were no important issues in checking individual patient data integrity.\n89b4 | Three point one point one.
