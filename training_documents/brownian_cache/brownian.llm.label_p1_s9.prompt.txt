o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before.

936l | We apply the functional Renormalisation Group (fRG) to study relaxation in a stochastic process governed by an overdamped Langevin equation with one degree of freedom, exploiting the connec- tion with supersymmetric quantum mechanics in imaginary time. After reviewing the functional integral formulation of the system and its underlying symmetries, including the resulting Ward- Takahashi identities for arbitrary initial conditions, we compute the effective action I from the fRG, approximated in terms of the leading and subleading terms in the gradient expansion: the Local Potential Approximation and Wavefunction Renormalisation respectively. This is achieved by coarse-graining the thermal fluctuations in time resulting in e.g. an effective potential incorporating fluctuations at all timescales. We then use the resulting effective equations of motion to describe the decay of the covariance, and the relaxation of the average position and variance towards their equilibrium values at different temperatures. We use as examples a simple polynomial potential, an unequal Lennard-Jones type potential and a more complex potential with multiple trapping wells and barriers. We find that these are all handled well, with the accuracy of the approximations improving as the relaxation's spectral representation shifts to lower eigenvalues, in line with ex- pectations about the validity of the gradient expansion. The spectral representation's range also correlates with temperature, leading to the conclusion that the gradient expansion works better for higher temperatures than lower ones. This work demonstrates the ability of the fRG to expedite the computation of statistical objects in otherwise long-timescale simulations, acting as a first step to more complicated systems.
06yq | I. INTRODUCTION
dpv6 | Stochastic processes appear in all kinds of contexts in physics: from the Brownian motion of small particles in a thermal bath [1, 2] to exotic scalar fields experiencing quantum fluctuations in the early inflationary universe [3], many problems of interest can be described by the overdamped Langevin equation (4). In this work we em- ploy an effective description of the stochastic dynamics that captures the aggregate effect of fluctuations embod- ied in an effective action I[x(t)], a functional of the av- erage position x(t) = (x(t)) which can be thought of as an analogue to the statistical free energy and can be de- rived from the partition function or generating functional via a Legendre transform. Once obtained, the effective action can be used to compute n-point correlation func- tions of the particle's position (x(t1)x(t2) ... x(tn)), char- acterizing the system's statistical properties. To obtain this effective action we will be coarse-graining the system in time such that we obtain e.g. an effective potential that incorporates thermal fluctuations on all timescales. To achieve this we will use a technique known as the
8r5j | functional, or exact, or non-perturbative Renormalisa- tion Group [4, 5] - see [6] for a review and an entry point to the literature on the subject, [7] for a comprehensive overview of applications as well as e.g. [8, 9] for more elementary introductions.
2taz | The renormalisation group (RG) was brought to full force through the work of K. Wilson [10] who used it to understand phase transitions and since then the RG has become a widely used technique in modern physics with many applications in both particle physics [11] and con- densed matter physics [12, 13]. The RG is relevant when- ever fluctuations significantly influence the state (static or dynamical) of a physical system. A recent popular in- carnation of this programme is the functional RG (fRG) formulation. Wetterich showed [4] - see also [5] - how one can define I' at some particular energy or momentum scale A in the UV (for us this will correspond to small timestep/high frequency) where the theory is known and then create an RG flow that interpolates through all en- ergy (frequency/momentum) scales down to the IR (i.e. decreasing fluctuation frequency/increasing characteris- tic timestep of fluctuation here). This change of the effec- tive theory at different scales, the fundamental idea be- hind the RG, can be formulated in an integro-differential equation known as the Wetterich equation:
o3ya | (1)
r5il | where Ik is the effective action at scale k, Tr denotes a trace over spatio-temporal points (an integral over space- time) and a trace over all other relevant indices, Rk is an IR regulator that acts as a cut-off for fluctuations below (momentum/frequency) scale k, and I.2) is the second functional derivative of Ik. A simple zero-dimensional manifestation of this flow equation in the context of the Boltzmann equilibrium distribution is illuminating and is reviewed in Appendix A. At the end of the flow, as k -> 0, all fluctuations are included and the full effective action T is obtained.
5gui | In this work we solve equation (1) in the context of the dynamics of particles under the influence of a deter- ministic force, stemming from an arbitrary potential, and thermal fluctuations. We will study a simple polynomial potential, a double Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, as well as one containing multiple barriers/trapping wells, serv- ing as a toy model of an energy landscape on which par- ticles can diffuse. To solve (1) we employ a widely used approximation scheme, the gradient expansion, to second order. We find good agreement with simulations (and the Fokker-Planck equation where it proved amenable to a numerical solution) at moderate to high temperatures and that this correlates with the spectral representation of the relaxation process, i.e. the overlap between the ini- tial condition (a delta function initial probability distri- bution) and the spectrum of the Fokker Planck operator. In particular, the more the resulting spectrum is shifted towards lower-lying eigenvalues, the better the gradient expansion agrees with the exact evolution. This is in line with expectations about the validity of the gradient expansion, namely that it better captures slower evolu- tion which should be associated with the lower eigen- values. Furthermore, we expect that for a fixed initial condition lower temperatures correspond to a spectrum shifted towards higher eigenvalues and, correspondingly, worst performance of the gradient expansion.
82qc | We start in Sec. II by reviewing the connection be- tween Langevin dynamics and Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics in imaginary time, first shown in [14] - see e.g. [15] for a review of this connection. The path integral formulation then allows us to apply the fRG program di- rectly. We include a brief summary of how the Langevin equation can be reformulated in terms of a probability distribution function whose evolution is described by the Fokker-Planck equation (32) and how the latter relates to a Euclidean Schrödinger equation. We close the sec- tion by discussing the symmetries of the resulting theory and their implications through Ward-Takahashi type re- lations, paying attention to the fact that the initial state may not be that of equilibrium.
ls7d | In Sec. III we present the flow equations for the ef- fective action utilising a slight modification of the re- sults of [16] for supersymmetric RG flows. As we ex- plain, the flow equation derived from the supersymmetric formulation ensures compatibility with the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution, a feature not directly obvious from the application of the renormalisation group to the
tzt3 | Onsager-Machlup form of the generating functional. To turn the functional integro-differential equation (1) into a mathematically more tractable form we employ two commonly used approximations for the effective action Tk: the Local Potential Approximation (LPA) as well as the LPA augmented by Wavefunction Renormalisation (WFR). In the LPA, the effect of fluctuations is progres- sively taken into account during the flow by the effective potential Vk (x) experienced by the particle, which is al- tered compared to the bare, fundamental potential V (x). Wavefunction Renormalisation (WFR) involves a second function Zk(x) which can be interpreted as a redefini- tion of position x -> Z(x). These are also known as the first two (leading and subleading) orders in a gradient expansion of T.
t8vv | In Sec. IV we derive the effective equations of motion (EEOM) through variational derivatives of the effective action T. We do this first for the one point function, or average position x, whose equation of motion simply reduces to an over-damped equation in an effective poten- tial with no noise i.e. purely classical. We then obtain an equation for the evolution of the two point function; this Green's function equation allows us to solve for the Vari- ance and Covariance of the stochastic process. Solutions to these deterministic equations with appropriate initial conditions can then approximate the relaxation towards equilibrium.
qvnu | In Sec. V we present numerical solutions to the flow equations for three types of potential: a simple polyno- mial one, an unequal LJ type potential and a "rugged" potential consisting of an underlying harmonic x2 poten- tial with the addition of six Gaussian bumps and dips. We also consider different temperatures, effectively con- trolling the strength of thermal fluctuations compared to the classical force. Naturally, we find that the end results of the flow equations differ, with higher tempera- tures resulting in potentials that carry less memory of the bare potentials' morphology. In section VI the numerical solution of the LPA flow equation accurately reproduces static equilibrium quantities, as it should. We also exam- ine the characteristic decay behaviour of the connected 2-point function (x(0)x(t)) or covariance at equilibrium by utilizing both the effective potential Vk->0 and the WFR function Zk-10 and find good agreement with exact results down to relatively low temperatures when devia- tions start becoming pronounced.
kggw | In Sec. VII we examine how well the LPA + WFR approximation to the effective action can handle relax- ation towards equilibrium in our potentials starting from a fixed initial condition (Pini (x) = 8(x - Xini)). Numer- ical solutions to the EEOM for the one- and two-point functions are compared to direct numerical simulation of equation (4) and/or numerical solutions to the Fokker Planck equation. We find that under the LPA + WFR approximations, the fRG solutions give a good descrip- tion of the relaxational evolution and are able to capture overshoots of the variance in the potentials we exam- ine. Similarly to equilibrium, the approximations fare
xrd1 | worse as the temperature is decreased and the classical force determined by the potential's slope becomes dom- inant. We suggest that this behaviour is correlated to the spectral decomposition of the relaxation in terms of eigenvalues of the relevant Fokker-Planck operator: the more the spectral decomposition of <LATEX>\langle x \left( t \right) \rangle ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\langle x \left( t _ { \mathrm { i n i } } \right) x \left( t \right) \rangle</LATEX> and <LATEX>\langle x ^ { 2 } \left( t \right) \rangle</LATEX> is shifted towards lower eigenvalues, the bet- ter the <LATEX>\mathrm { L P A + W F R }</LATEX> approximation performs.
5746 | We conclude in Sec. VIII. Appendix A derives the zero- dimensional analogue of the Wetterich equation (1) for the effective potential corresponding to the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution while in Appendix B we include a derivation of the solution of (113) that provides the two- point function. In Appendix <LATEX>\mathrm { C }</LATEX> we explicitly show that the determinant appearing in the path integral directly follows from the boundary conditions imposed in II A.
