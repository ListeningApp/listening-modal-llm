        "content": "xwza | Anyone can think of several schools, cults, religions, systems of psychology or philosophy which fall into the above classifications.\nkw2g | We must categorically affirm that it is impossible to increase human knowledge in the higher field by these methods. The statistical possibility of useful gains within a reasonable time is so remote as to be excluded from one's calculations.\nevst | Why, then, do people persist in raking over the embers and looking for truth when they have so little chance of finding it? Simply because they are using their conditioning propensity, not their capacity for higher perception, to try to follow the path. There is intellectual stimulus and emotional attraction in the mere effort to plumb the unknown. When the ordinary human mind encounters evidences of a higher state of being, or even when it conceives the possibility of them, it will invariably conclude that there is some possibility of progress for that mind without the application of the factors of teaching-teacher-students-time-and-place which are essentials.\nr4ei | Man has few alternatives in his search for truth. He may rely\nv3un | upon his unaided intellect, and gamble that he is capable of perceiving truth or even the way to truth. This is a poor, but an attractive, gamble. Or he can gamble upon the claims of an individual or institution which claims to have such a way. This gamble, too, is a poor one. Aside from a very few, men in general lack a sufficiently developed perception to tell them:\nmmh7 | One. Not to trust their own unaided mentation;\n15mo | Two. Whom or what to trust.\nhaqw | There are, in consequence, two main schools of thought in this matter. Some say 'Follow your own promptings'; the other says: 'Trust this or that institution'. Each is really useless to the ordinary man. Each will help him to use up his time.\n89i1 | The bitter truth is that before man can know his own inadequacy, or the competence of another man or institution, he must first learn something which will enable him to perceive both. Note well that his perception itself is the product of right study; not of instinct or emotional attraction to an individual, nor yet of desiring to 'go it alone'. This is 'learning how to learn'.\ngfu5 | All this means, of course, that we are postulating here the need for preparatory study before school work takes place. We deny that a man can study and properly benefit from school work until he is equipped for it: any more than a person can study space-navigation unless he has a grasp of mathematics.\nmvzl | This is not to say that a man (or a woman) cannot have a sensation of truth. But the unorganised and fragmented mind which is most people's heritage tends to distort the quality and quantity of this sensation, leading to almost completely false conclusions about what can or should be done.\nbuwu | This is not to say, either, that man cannot take part in studies and activities which impinge upon that portion of him which is connected with a higher life and cognition. But the mere application of special techniques will not transform that man's consciousness. It will only feed into, and disturb, more or less permanently, centres of thought and feeling where it does not belong. Thus it is that something which should be a blessing becomes a curse. Sugar, shall we say, for a normal person is nutritionally useful. To a\nzsfu | diabetic it can be poison.\nhyvo | Therefore, before the techniques of study and development are made available to the student, he must be enabled to profit by them in the direction in which they are supposed to lead, not in a short-term indulgence.\n5l9v | Thus our curriculum takes two parts: the first is the providing of materials of a preparatory nature, in order to equip the individual to become a student. The second is the development itself.\n6tv1 | If we, or anyone else, supply such study or preparatory material prematurely, it will only operate on a lower level than it could. The result will be harmless at best. At worst it will condition, train, the mind of the individual to think and behave in patterns which are nothing less than automatic. In this latter way one can make what seem to be converts, unwittingly play upon emotions, on lesser desires and the conditioning propensity; train people to loyalty to individuals, found and maintain institutions which seem more or less serious or constructive. But no real progress towards knowledge of the human being and the other dimension in which he partly lives will in fact be made.\nl79g | The preparation of the student is as important as anything else which he does. The Sufi poet Hafiz says:\nd8ia | 'The Seeker must not be unaware of the way and method of the stages.' This awareness comes through following the teaching course, which is taking part in the activities of a school, plus abiding by the directions of your teacher.\nv012 | In learning how to learn from a Sufi school, the intending student should take note of this admonition, which indicates his difficulties:\ncrl5 | 'If you are too soft, you will be crushed; if you are too dry, you will be broken; if you are too hard, you will cause hurt; if you are too sharp, you will inflict wounds.'\nxqom | The curriculum of a School is one which may work with secondary things, but which employs them instrumentally, and certainly not imagining that they are primary things.\nmwss | In the words of Sheikh Al-Intaki, quoted over a thousand years ago by Hujwiri in his Revelation of the Veiled:\nqba8 | the honour of the ordinary [person] is to accept secondary\n24cj | [things as real] causes, while the honour of the dervish is to reject secondary [supposed] causes, insisting on The Cause.\nkkr4 | The School works with what is primary. The (to some) apparently purposeful activity of those who use correct materials but apply only the ordinary, limited senses, is portrayed in the actions of Nasrudin with his seedlings:\np3um | Right idea, wrong materials\nfcs1 | The Mulla once spent a whole day transplanting some seedlings in his garden.\n5rxi | When he stood back to admire his work, a sudden thought struck him.\ncm65 | Dusk was falling as he started to pluck the plants from the ground, wrapping them in sackcloth by the light of a lantern.\nux5y | Going home along the fields some cronies called to him. 'Whatever are you doing, Nasrudin?'\nc8vn | 'Acting in accordance with careful consideration. I realised late in the day, but not too late as you see-that it is better to keep one's property in the house, under proper supervision.'\nalzc | The secondary ('commanding') self in everyone is the false self which everyone takes to be the real one. It stands in relation to the real being of the person as the face does to the person: virtually a persona. Everyone, says Rumi, in Fihi ma Fihi, likes a mirror, and is enamoured of the reflection in the mirror of his attributes and attainments: though he does not know the real nature of his face.\n0dos | The veil which he sees on the looking-glass he imagines to be his face. Take the covering from your face, so that you may see me as the mirror of your real face: so that you will realise that I am a mirror.'\nbc48 | The curriculum of a School, from 'inside the School' as you put it, is based on the teacher being able to be that mirror. He is therefore able to assess the peculiarities and needs of the student. His miming is often of the student, so that the latter may see himself mirrored and react accordingly.\nf3v7 | Knowing all about Someone\n8s6f | Q: Is it enough to associate with a man of knowledge to acquire some of it? Does the Teacher not need the Student?\nx7h9 | A: You must remember instances, at least, when you have not said anything and everything in your mind.\nygmb | Have you ever thought about the people whom you may know who do not discuss with you things which they know, even though such things might be of abiding interest to you?",
