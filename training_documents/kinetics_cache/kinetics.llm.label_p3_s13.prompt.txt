You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

lq35 | Maximum likelihood estimation of parameters
3g9w | Here we introduce a method of estimating the kinetic pa- rameters in our hierarchical model using the expression data of each gene. For a given expression read of observed cells, the most common parameter estimation method is the maximum likelihood estimation, which can be formulated as the following optimization problem of five parameters 0 = (a, b, c, k, h) in our case

ylhz | arg min (-L(y;0)) = arg min θ -In(P(Y=y;0)), (8) y where P(Y = y;0) is described in Equation (6).
a3td | Because of the complex integral and unnormalized prob- ability mass function in Equation (6), calculating the inte- gral directly through the MCMC method (50) would be at a high cost of computation, and in particular, it is hard to use in the analysis of genome-wide data. Therefore, we ap- ply the Generalized Gauss-Laguerre Quadrature Rules (51) to Equation (6) instead of the use of the MCMC method, realizing a rapid calculation in inference:

9d4o | EN wif (xi), i=1
cjq2 | (9)
5esx | where xi, wi can be determined by the generalized Laguerre polynomials.
m5ka | In particular, a simple algebraic transformation in Equa- tion (7) yields the explicit expression of the probability dis- tribution in the case of non-feedback:
byu8 | P(Y= y ;- ) = 100 (x)" y! ο-λχ
76b0 | bar (a) 1 xa-le-x/bdx
zxz6 | = (a+y) B(a, y+1) (b)+1)/+a' (bx)y
xnth | (10)
vafm | where B(., .) is the Beta function.
2zmw | Optimization method and initial values setting
bf9k | To realize a fast calculation for solving the optimization problem (Equation (8)) of parameter estimation, we use the fmincon function in the LBFGS method of MAT- LAB (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), a nonlinear programming solver, to find the minimum of the optimization problem given a set of initial val- ues and parameter intervals a =(10-1,30), b = (1, 20), k = (1,103), h = (-10, -1)or(1, 10). For each gene and each case of positive, negative, and non-feedbacks, we repeatedly solve the optimization problem 30 times.
otkr | We restrict that the initial values of the optimization problem obey the following rules. First, we consider initial
ibgs | points of a (burst frequency) and <LATEX>b</LATEX> (burst size). Here <LATEX>X</LATEX> is a random variable of the distribution in Equation (5). Since Gamma distribution is a special case of Equation (5), we assume that the initial points <LATEX>a</LATEX> and <LATEX>b</LATEX> follow
colo | <LATEX>\mathrm { E } \left[ X \right] = a b , \mathrm { V a r } \left[ X \right] = a b ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> (11)
d6r4 | On the other hand, by considering the initial values of <LATEX>Y</LATEX> generated by our hierarchical model, we have
9mrz | <LATEX>\mathrm { E } \left[ Y \right] = \mathrm { E } \left[ \mathrm { E } \left[ Y | X \right] \right] = \lambda \mathrm { E } \left[ X \right] = \lambda a b ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { V a r } \left[ Y \right] = \mathrm { E } \left[ \mathrm { V a r } \left[ Y | X \right] \right] + \mathrm { V a r } \left[ \mathrm { E } \left[ Y | X \right] \right] = \lambda a b + \lambda ^ { 2 } a b ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> (12) (13)
pk06 | Given the expectation and variance of <LATEX>Y ,</LATEX> we can in return estimate burst frequency <LATEX>a</LATEX> and burst size <LATEX>b</LATEX> by rearranging Equations (12) and (13), which are then taken as initial val- ues
7wn9 | <LATEX>a = \frac { \mathrm { E } \left[ Y \right] ^ { 2 } } { \mathrm { V a r } \left[ Y \right] - \mathrm { E } \left[ Y \right] } , b = \left( \frac { \mathrm { V a r } \left[ Y \right] } { \mathrm { E } \left[ Y \right] } - 1 \right) / \lambda .</LATEX> (14)
wcd0 | Usually, the transcriptional rate in the OFF state is much smaller than that in the ON state. And a small enough leaky rate does not affect the distribution shape of gene expres- sion. Therefore, we fix & at the constant of 0.05 during our inference. The <LATEX>h</LATEX> value is extracted from a uniform distribu- tion between the integer -5 and -1 (positive feedback) or in- tegers 1 and 5 (negative feedback). And the values of param- eter <LATEX>k</LATEX> are extracted from the log-uniform (logarithm base 10) distribution on interval
caos | <LATEX>\left[ 0 , 2 \right] .</LATEX> Model selection
qrvy | Using the above inference method, we obtain 90 inferred re- sults for each case of positive, negative, and non-feedbacks. Then, we filter out the unreliable results on the inference boundary, which are possibly caused by the optimization program setting. On this basis, we compute the value of the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) (52) and se- lect the best model corresponding to the smallest AICc,
pn9j | <LATEX>\mathrm { A I C c } = - 2 \log L \left( \widehat { \theta } \right) + 2 k + \frac { 2 k \left( k + 1 \right) } { n - k - 1 } ,</LATEX> (15)
1pmc | where the maximum likelihood <LATEX>L \left( \widehat { \theta } \right)</LATEX> is the result during the inference run, <LATEX>k</LATEX> is the number of model parameters, and n is the sample size of observed data.
5z6q | Validation on synthetic scRNA-seq data
yeoh | In order to check whether the above statistical inference method can effectively infer burst frequency, burst size, and feedback form in our hierarchical model, we produce syn- thetic single-cell RNA data. Given a set of model param- eter values <LATEX>\theta = \left( a , b , \varepsilon , k , h \right) ,</LATEX> we first calculate the prob- ability distributions of these parameters according to the method described in the above section and then carry out random samples according to the probability of each pa- rameter value to obtain the input data for the inference pro- cess.

And the error be- tween true parameters <LATEX>\theta ^ { \mathrm { t r u e } } = \left( b f ^ { \mathrm { t r u e } } , b s ^ { \mathrm { t r u e } } \right)</LATEX> and estimated parameters <LATEX>\theta ^ { \mathrm { e s t } } = \left( b f ^ { \mathrm { e s t } } , b s ^ { \mathrm { e s t } } \right)</LATEX> is calculated according to:
y5r7 | <LATEX>\mathrm { E r r o r } \left( \theta ^ { \mathrm { t r u e } } , \theta ^ { \mathrm { e s t } } \right) = \left( \log \left( b f ^ { \mathrm { t r u e } } \right) - \log \left( b f ^ { \mathrm { e s t } } \right) \right) ^ { 2 }</LATEX> <LATEX>+ \left( \log \left( b s ^ { \mathrm { t r u e } } \right) - \log \left( b s ^ { \mathrm { e s t } } \right) \right) ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> (16)
lrry | We show the robustness of the inference in the cases of positive, negative, and non-feedbacks, respectively (Supple- mentary Figure S4-S6). To explore the robustness of the cell numbers to the inference, we select different sampled cell numbers (200, 300, 500, 1000, 5000) to synthesize data 50 times, and at each time, set 30 different initial points for optimization in each case of feedback forms. The optimiza- tion process is the same as the inference process of real data. The same process is used to explore the effects of stochastic losses of mRNA molecules (sensitivity), missing randomly at a certain probability (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 or 0.9) from suf- ficient samples (number = 2000). The results of inference robustness analysis are illustrated with two different distri- bution examples in the three cases of feedback forms (Sup- plementary Figure S4-S6).

863b | Inference evaluation
fj24 | To assess whether the observed data came from the distribu- tion generated via the parameters inferred by our method, we use goodness-of-fit statistics that obey chi-square distri- bution of large samples:
uz3c | <LATEX>\mathcal{X} ^ { 2 } = \sum _ { k = 0 } ^ { \infty } \frac { \left( O _ { k } - E _ { k } \right) ^ { 2 } } { E _ { k } } ,</LATEX> (17)
d5bi | where <LATEX>O _ { k }</LATEX> is the observed sample number whose mRNA number is <LATEX>k ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>E _ { k }</LATEX> is the expected sample number. Note that in some sequencing techniques, the cell samples of scRNA-seq data are not large enough, so it is needed to use the Monte Carlo method to generate the null distribution of chi-square goodness-of-fit test instead of the asymptotic distribution. For each gene, we first generate the same num- ber of samples as that in the observed data from the prob- ability of each point with the inferred parameters and then compute the <LATEX>\mathcal{X} _ { s i m } ^ { 2 }</LATEX> statistic according to Equation (17). After repeating the Monte Carlo simulation procedure for 1000 times, we judge whether the resulting inference is a good fit by comparing <LATEX>x _ { o b s } ^ { 2 }</LATEX> with the resulting 1000 <LATEX>\mathcal{X} _ { s i m } ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> The crite- rion that an inferred parameter is a good fit is that the <LATEX>x _ { o b s } ^ { 2 }</LATEX> is at least less than five percentage numbers of <LATEX>\mathcal{X} _ { s i m } ^ { 2 }</LATEX> (Supple- mentary Figure S7a).

We utilize the processed scRNA-seq data for 10727 genes of transcriptomes from 224 individual mouse embryonic fibroblasts for each allele <LATEX>\left( C 5 7 \times C A S T \right.</LATEX> (16). In that paper, the quantification of gene transcription is based on the Smart-seq2 scRNA-seq libraries, and UMI counts is used to reduce the amplifica- tion noise. To ensure that the inference process is not hin-

We filter out the genes ex- pressed in less than 50 cells. Also, we filter out the cells ex- pressed in <2000 genes. In addition, we filter out the genes whose overall average expression levels are <2. After these manipulations on each allelic data (C57 × CAST), the genes that meet the conditions are combined to facilitate infer- ences from more adequate samples and give a single-cell ex- pression matrix composed of 2162 genes and 413 cells. This treatment is based on the assumption that the distributions of almost all genes for the CAST and c57 alleles have simi- lar shapes and that the transcriptional dynamic behavior is consistent between alleles for most genes, which is also sup- ported by previous studies (16,53). And, we removed the outlier data with the tail 5% of the distribution. In addi- tion, our method can be also applied to any high-quality non-allelic scRNA-seq data.
06ht | Identification of promoter motif and TSS distribution. The recognition and coordinates of the promoter motifs (TATA box, Initiator, CCAAT box, GC box) are downloaded from 'the Select/Download Tool' of the EPD New database (54). In order to determine the TSS distribution of mouse embry- onic fibroblasts, MEFs FANTOM5 Cap Analysis of gene expression data is retrieved through the CAGEr R package (55). After normalization and TSS clustering, TSS distribu- tion is defined as 'sharp' if the promoter width is less than 15bp (this length is taken as the median of all genes), and as 'broad' otherwise.
