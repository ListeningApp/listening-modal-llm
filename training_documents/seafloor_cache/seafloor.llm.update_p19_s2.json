        "content": "nuxs | MINERALIZATION AND ALTERATION OF THE TINAKULA S M S DEPOSIT\numx0 | The alteration assemblages vary with location and depth, generally progressing downward from the seafloor in the order montmorillonite/nontronite to nontronite plus corrensite, to illite/smectite plus pyrite, to illite/smectite plus chamosite, to chamosite plus corrensite. Footwall breccias from site A are dominated by chamosite plus corrensite alteration, with localized illite/smectite plus chamosite alteration that varies in abundance over short distances and is interpreted to reflect proximity to inferred synvolcanic faults. Alteration at site B is semiconformable, varying downhole from illite/smectite plus pyrite, to illite/smectite plus chamosite, to chamosite plus corrensite. Site C is characterized by nontronite near the surface, followed by nontronite plus corrensite and chamosite plus corrensite at depth.\no306 | Alteration at site D varies from illite/smectite plus pyrite near the surface, to illite/smectite plus chamosite at depth. End-member illite and rectorite is present in all samples from site D, reflecting high temperatures (greater than two hundred twenty degrees Celsius) and a progression from argillic to phyllic alteration at depth. The variations in alteration assemblages identified at different sites along the NS-trending fissure appear to reflect variable thermal gradients and permeability structure.\nqm1b | Smectite is ubiquitous throughout the footwall in every alteration assemblage as discrete montmorillonite/nontronite replacing volcanic glass and/or mixed-layer clays. illite/smectite clays range in composition from fifty percent illite to approximately ninety-one percent illite, with an average of seventy-four percent illite.\nn9ms | Amounts indicated are major, minor, and trace; uncertain identifications are indicated by question mark.

Chlorite may form directly from smectite or through an intermediate corrensite step. At Tinakula, chamosite appears before corrensite in the downhole progression of alteration assemblages, suggesting that corrensite is not an intermediate phase. Corrensite appears after illite/smectite, following a transition from illite/smectite plus chamosite to chamosite plus corrensite. This suggests that corrensite forms as an alteration product of the mixed-layer illite/smectite clays.\nwtse | and two thousand two hundred twenty-eight nanometers, with wavelengths of two thousand one hundred eighty-nine to two thousand one hundred ninety-five nanometers for paragonite and two thousand two hundred to two thousand two hundred thirteen nanometers for muscovite and illite. In addition, small absorption features are present at two thousand three hundred fifty and two thousand four hundred fifty nanometers for the white micas. Montmorillonite is distinguished by a narrow and symmetrical two thousand two hundred-nanometer feature with a small shoulder on the H two O plus OH absorption feature at one thousand four hundred fifty to one thousand four hundred sixty nanometers. Chlorite is identified by the strong absorption feature at two thousand three hundred forty nanometers, the wavelength of which increases from two thousand three hundred twenty-four nanometers for Mg-rich compositions to greater than two thousand three hundred fifty nanometers for Fe-rich compositions. Gypsum is identified by the OH plus H two O feature at one thousand four hundred nanometers, together with the OH feature at one thousand eight hundred nanometers. The alteration mineral assemblages observed in the SWIR analysis progress downhole from smectite (montmorillonite/nontronite), to white mica (paragonite\nbm7g | Alteration minerals were also characterized by SWIR spectroscopy.

However, SWIR analyses with both montmorillonite and white mica reflect the presence of mixed-layer illite/smectite clays rather than discrete end members, with progressive increases downhole in aluminum content that shift the Al-OH absorption feature to lower wavelengths.\ns9fn | Alteration Geochemistry",
