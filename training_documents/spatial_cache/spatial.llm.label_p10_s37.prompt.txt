You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

qy1i | It must be remembered that <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> is based on a variable that is positive and has a natural origin. Thus, for example, it is inappropriate to use <LATEX>\mathrm { G } \left( d \right)</LATEX> to study resid- uals from regression. Also, for both <LATEX>I \left( d \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> one must recognize that trans- formations of the variable <LATEX>X</LATEX> result in different values for the test statistic.

k16v | EMPIRICAL EXAMPLES
b2lm | The following examples of the use of <LATEX>G</LATEX> statistics were selected based on size and type of spatial units, size of the <LATEX>x</LATEX> values, and subject matter. The first is a problem concerning the rate of sudden infant death syndrome by county in North Carolina, and the second is a study of the mean price of housing units sold by zip- code district in the San Diego metropolitan region. In both cases the data are explained, hypotheses made clear, and <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>I \left( d \right)</LATEX> values calculated for com- parable circumstances.
ti7f | 1. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) by County in North Carolina
oksu | SIDS is the sudden death of an infant one year old or less that is unexpected and inexplicable after a postmortem examination (Cressie and Chan 1989). The data presented by Cressie and Chan were collected from a variety of sources cited in the article. Among other data, the authors give the number of SIDs by county for the period 1979-1984, the number of births for the same period, and the coordinates of the counties. We use as our data the number of SIDs as a proportion of births multiplied by 1000 (see Figure 1). Since no viral or other causes have been given for SIDS, one should not expect any spatial association in the data. To some extent, high or low rates may be dependent on the health care infants receive. The rates may correlate with variables such as income or the availability of physicians' services. In this study we shall not expect any spatial association.
wtow | Table 3 gives the values for the standard normal variate of <LATEX>I</LATEX> and <LATEX>G</LATEX> for various distances.
o22k | Results using the <LATEX>G</LATEX> statistic verify the hypothesis that there is no discernible association among counties with regard to SIDS rates. The values of <LATEX>\mathrm { Z } \left( G \right)</LATEX> are less than one. In addition, there seems to be no smooth pattern of <LATEX>Z</LATEX> values as <LATEX>d</LATEX> increases. The <LATEX>Z \left( I \right)</LATEX> results are somewhat contradictory, however. Although none are statistically significant at the .05 level, <LATEX>Z \left( I \right)</LATEX> values from 30 to 50 miles, about the distance from the center of each county to the center of its contiguous neigh- boring counties, are well over one. This represents a tendency toward positive spatial autocorrelation at those distances. Taking the two results together, one should be cautious before concluding that a spatial association exists for SIDS

sc5y | Table 4 and Figure 2 give the results of an analysis based on the <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>G _ { i } ^ { * } \left( d \right)</LATEX> statistics for a <LATEX>d</LATEX> of thirty-three miles. This represents the distance to the furthest first-nearest neighbor county of any county.
0yab | The <LATEX>G _ { i } ^ { * } \left( d \right)</LATEX> statistic identifies five of the one hundred counties of North Carolina as significantly positively or negatively associated with their neighboring counties (at the .05 level). Four of these, clustered in the central south portion of the state, display values greater than + 1.96, while one county, Washington near Albemarle Sound, has a <LATEX>Z</LATEX> value of less than - 1.96 (see Figure 2). Taking into account values greater than + 1.15 (the 87.5 percentile), it is clear that several small clusters in addition to the main cluster are widely dispersed in the southern part of the state. The main cluster of values less than - 1.15 (the 12.5 percentile) is in the eastern part of the state. It is interesting to note that many of the counties in this cluster are in the sparsely populated swamp lands surrounding the Albemarle and Pam- lico Sounds. If overall error is fixed at 0.05 and a Bonferroni correction is applied, the cutoff value for each county is raised to about 3.50. However, such a figure is unduly conservative given the small numbers of neighbors.

p6pq | In this case it becomes clear that an overall measure of association such as <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> or <LATEX>I \left( d \right)</LATEX> can be misleading because it prompts one to dismiss the possibility of significant spatial clustering. The <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> statistics, however, are able to identify the tendency for positive spatial clustering and the location of pockets of high and low spatial association. It remains for the social scientist or epidemiologist to explain the subtle patterns shown in Figure 2.
zse6 | 2. Dwelling Unit Prices in San Diego County by Zip-Code Area, September 1989
p2n3 | Data published in the Los Angeles Times on October 29, 1989, give the adjusted average price by zip code for all new and old dwelling units sold by builders, real estate agents, and homeowners during the month of September 1989 in San Diego County (see Appendix). The data are supplied by TRW Real Estate Information Services. One outlier was identified: Rancho Santa Fe, a wealthy suburb of the city of San Diego, had prices of sold dwelling units that were nearly three times higher than the next highest district (La Jolla). Since neither statistic is robust enough to be only marginally affected by such an observation, Rancho Santa Fe was not considered in the analysis.
ohh7 | Although the city of San Diego has a large and active downtown, San Diego County is not a monocentric region. One would not expect housing prices to trend upward from the city center to the suburbs in a uniform way. One would expect, however, that since the data are for reasonably small sections of the metro- politan area, that there would be distinct spatial autocorrelation tendencies (see Figure 3). High positive <LATEX>I</LATEX> values are expected. <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> values are dependent on the tendencies for high values or low values to group. If the low cost areas dominate, the <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> value is negative. In this case, <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> is a refinement of the knowledge gained from
vbni | <LATEX>I .</LATEX> Table 5 shows that there are strong positive values for <LATEX>Z \left( I \right)</LATEX> for distances of four miles and greater. <LATEX>Z \left( G \right)</LATEX> also shows highly significant values at four miles and beyond, but here the association is negative, that is, low values near low values are much more influential than are the high values near high values. Moran's <LATEX>I</LATEX> clearly indicates that there is significant spatial autocorrelation, but, without knowledge of <LATEX>G \left( d \right) ,</LATEX> one might conclude that at this scale of analysis, in general, high income districts are significantly associated with one another.
dgcw | By looking at the results of the <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> statistics analysis for <LATEX>d</LATEX> equal to five, the individual district pattern is unmistakable. The <LATEX>Z \left( G _ { i } ^ { * } \left( 5 \right) \right)</LATEX> values shown in Table 6

There is a strong tendency for the negative values to be higher. It is for this reason that the <LATEX>\mathrm { Z } \left( G \right)</LATEX> values given above are so decidedly negative. The districts with high values along the coast have fewer near neighbors with similar values than do the central city lower value districts. The

d52l | CONCLUSIONS
qlbb | The <LATEX>G</LATEX> statistics provide researchers with a straightforward way to assess the degree of spatial association at various levels of spatial refinement in an entire sample or in relation to a single observation. When used in conjunction with Moran's <LATEX>I</LATEX> or some other measure of spatial autocorrelation, they enable us to deepen our understanding of spatial series. One of the <LATEX>G</LATEX> statistics' useful features, that of neutralizing the spatial distribution of the data points, allows for the devel- opment of hypotheses where the pattern of data points will not bias results.
nhsg | When <LATEX>\mathrm { G }</LATEX> statistics are contrasted with Moran's I, it becomes clear that the two statistics measure different things. Fortunately, both statistics are evaluated using normal theory so that a set of standard normal variates taken from tests using each type of statistic are easily compared and evaluated.
