        "content": "ma93 | Those who look to knowledge in thinking about regime effectiveness rest their case on the proposition that ideas matter independently of configurations of power and interests. Their view, developed in many cases in counterpoint to the arguments of the realists or structuralists, suggests that governance systems-in international society as elsewhere-are reflections of deeper worldviews or intellectual paradigms that structure the way people think about relations among states. On this account, a regime is likely to be effective, in at least some of the senses articulated earlier in this chapter, when it rests on a common conception of the problem to be solved and some degree of consensus regarding what is needed to fashion a solution. A particularly provocative line of thinking in this connection centers on the idea of hegemony in the cognitive or Gramscian sense. The idea here is that a system of thought, which may or may not be an outgrowth of the views of an actor that is a hegemon in the material sense, can hold sway over the thinking of policymakers in many dif-\nc6hh | ferent national settings and that the presence of some such cognitive construct is critical to the success or failure of international regimes created to cope with specific problems. Yet there is no reason to confine our thinking about knowledge as a source of effectiveness to such a grand theory. It may well be that more mundane considerations regarding knowledge are relevant as well in efforts to explain variations in observed levels of institutional effectiveness.\ny7ea | Linkage Variables\nnav4 | Some students of international regimes have suggested that effectiveness depends on the difficulty or the \"malignness\" of the problem an institutional arrangement is intended to solve. This intuitively appealing idea rests on the assumption that we can rank problems from those that are easiest to solve or most benign to those that are most difficult to solve or most malign. So, for example, coordination problems, which require only some adjustment of behavior to avoid common aversions, seem easier to solve than cooperation problems, which require both active collaboration and some mechanism for ensuring compliance to produce some valued products. On reflection, however, it is by no means clear how far this line of reasoning can carry us in explaining or predicting levels of effectiveness. The idea of difficulty, in the hands of many, is a measure of the intensity of the conflicts of interest among those engaged in interactive decision making. To the extent that this is the case, the argument might better be left to interest-based thinking, which offers more sophisticated analytic tools than the simple notion of difficulty. Approached from another angle, regimes involve efforts to solve problems that are hard to classify on a scale of difficulty, except in very gross terms. In all but the simplest of situations, in fact, the degree of difficulty of the problem to be solved is likely to become a subject of lively debate rather than something to be treated as an objective condition. The current controversy over the extent to which the problem of climate change is\ngem8 | Effectiveness\ne8nr | more difficult to solve than the problem of ozone depletion illustrates this point aptly.\nk78w | Another approach to this general topic, which captures some of what is at stake in the discussion of difficulty, focuses on the fit between the character of an international regime and the problem it is intended to solve. Whereas some problems (for example, the conservation of polar bears) can be solved through the elaboration of coordination regimes featuring common rules coupled with decentralized administration, other problems (for example, the setting and allocation of catch quotas for krill in the Southern Ocean or the allocation of broadcast frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum) can be solved only through the establishment of some social choice mechanism capable of making collective decisions on a continuing or recurrent basis. Regimes for high seas fisheries, in which it is relatively hard to monitor compliance with specific regulations, pose different requirements than regimes for nuclear safety, in which it is virtually impossible to hide serious accidents. Governance systems that work well when the members are modern states with strong central governments frequently fail when the governments of the participating states have a more limited capacity to control what goes on within their own jurisdictions (for example, the activities of poachers engaged in practices banned under the terms of the CITES regime). Similarly, the need for built-in flexibility is greater with regard to problems in which scientific understanding is changing rapidly (for example, ozone depletion or climate change) than for problems whose levels of uncertainty are much lower (for example, regimes to allocate the flow of water in shared river basins).\ng9du | Overall, there is much to be said for the view that the ability to customize the provisions of a regime to fit the circumstances at hand constitutes an important determinant of institutional effectiveness. This is, of course, easier said than done. Not only is it difficult to foresee how complex institutional arrangements will work in practice, but also individual participants are subject to continual pressure both from incentives to capture short-term gains to the detriment of longer-term considerations relating to institutional effectiveness and from the maneuvers of those endeavoring to protect special interests in a way that detracts from regime performance. Then, too, there is the problem of making appropriate adjustments over time. Institu-\nf682 | tions are like relationships among individuals; they require continuous monitoring and adjustments to remain viable. It is not sufficient simply to wind them up and set them in motion on the assumption that they will adjust to changing circumstances on their own in the absence of conscious interventions. It follows that any clear-cut conclusions we are able to reach about linkages between endogenous factors in the sense of attributes or properties of the regimes themselves and exogenous factors in the sense of features of the physical, biological, and social environment should prove directly relevant to the search for effectiveness in the establishment and management of a wide range of governance systems in international society.\nli1k | CONCLUSION\npbea | Effectiveness, it is clear, is not a simple matter when we are assessing the consequences of international environmental governance systems. Not only is it possible to conceptualize effectiveness in different ways, but it is also common to look to a variety of factors in efforts to explain the levels of effectiveness attained by specific regimes. What is more, much of the variance in our thinking about effectiveness is surely attributable to the disciplinary perspectives and larger worldviews that we as analysts bring to the study of this subject. Thus it will come as no surprise that our understanding of the determinants of effectiveness in international governance systems is rudimentary at this stage. Nonetheless, the effort to improve knowledge of this complex subject must be placed at the top of the agenda for students of international governance. The study of governance systems in international society cannot prosper in the absence of a better understanding of the determinants of effectiveness. Those responsible for designing governance systems to cope with growing threats to the earth's habitability demand knowledge that they can use to devise regimes that will prove effective. It is time, therefore, to get on with the task of studying effectiveness in a systematic and empirically grounded fashion.",
