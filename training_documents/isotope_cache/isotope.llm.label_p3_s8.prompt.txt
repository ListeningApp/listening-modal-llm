You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

u6ty | Methanol Derivatization. The alcohol products produced by MMOH were first derivatized by the Schotten-Baumann procedure (Loudon, 1988). The reaction solution following the single turnover was added to CH2Cl2 (50 mL) and then esterified using 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl chloride (2 mmol), N,N- dimethylaniline (2 mmol), and NaOH (2 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 17 h at room temperature. The organic layer was washed with 3 x 100 mL of HCI (1.0 M) followed by 3 x 100 mL of 5% NaHCO3-2 M NaCl, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evaporated to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in 2.0 mL of CH2Cl2. Thin- layer chromatography using silica gel plates and CHCl3 as the mobile phase allowed separation of the methyl ester product at an Rf of 0.5-0.7. The area containing the product was scraped off and eluted with CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 was evaporated to a minimal amount and the product was analyzed by mass spectrometry.
awvu | Mass Spectrometric Analysis. GC-MS was performed by using a Carlo-Erba gas chromatograph with a capillary DB-5 column, with direct injection into a Kratos MS-25 spectrometer. The retention times were determined using authentic material. The mass spectrometer was set to an ionization potential of 70 eV and selectively measured the molecular ion. Differential deuteration of the derivatized product resulted in partial separation of the two products on the GC column, necessitating the summing of multiple mass measurements (approximately 15) as the products eluted off the GC column. Each sample was analyzed in this way four times and the numbers were averaged. The isotope effect was calculated from the ratio of the products formed by H and D abstraction. Statistical factors were used when necessary to correct for different amounts of H and D of the substrate isotopic homologs.

h27a | Steady State Kinetic Experiments. The reaction rates were monitored by measuring the rates of oxygen consumption using a Clark-type oxygen electrode fitted to a reaction chamber sealed with a very small bore (<0.5 mm) glass stopcock to minimize the flux into and out of the reaction chamber. In all cases, the initial oxygen concentration was 250 uM. The methane concentration was varied from 10 uM to 1.2 mM by making appropriate additions of methane- saturated buffer to the reaction vessel. The total volume was held constant by the addition of nitrogen-saturated buffer. The concentrations of MMOH, MMOB, MMOR, and NADH were 370 nM, 925 nM, 375 nM, and 250 uM, respectively. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 uL of NADH solution and repeated 2-3 times for each of 10 different substrate concentrations. The buffer and temperature were the same as for the transient kinetic experiments, 100 mM MOPS, pH 7.7, at 4 °C.

xmgs | Rate of Compound Q Decay in the Presence of Deuterated Methanes. Compound Q formation and decay rates are easily determined by monitoring a single-turnover reaction at 430 nm using stopped-flow kinetic techniques and analyzing the data as described in Experimental Procedures. The rate of decay of compound Q is strongly dependent on the type and concentration of substrate present. Figure 2 shows the dependence of the compound Q decay rate constant on CH4 and CD4 concentrations. Each substrate caused a linear increase in the pseudo-first-order rate constant with increas- ing methane concentration. The slope of each line shown in Figure 2 gives the second-order rate constant for the reaction. Remarkably, the second-order rate constant for the CH4 reaction is ~100 times greater3 than that for the CD4 reaction, indicative of an exceptionally large KIE. In contrast, no significant KIE or substrate concentration dependence was observed for the compound Q formation reaction.

This demonstrates that the CD4 samples used did not contain an inhibitor for the reaction and reinforces the observation that CD4 is essentially unreactive compared to CH4. Also, it shows that the methane is in rapid equilibrium between the enzyme and the solvent, so that binding of the methane to (or collision with) the enzyme does not necessarily commit the reaction to completion.
vpgq | The same experiment was carried out with mono-, di-, and trideuterated methanes with the second-order decay rate constants shown in Figure 3. The observed second-order rate constant decreases linearly with the extent of deuteration. Thus, the <LATEX>\mathrm { C } - \mathrm { D }</LATEX> bonds appear to be nearly inert to oxygen insertion in comparison with the C-H bonds.

The formation reactions showed the same activation energies (37.3 kcal/mol) and preexponential factors within experimental error.
m4ju | Effect of Methane Deuteration on Product Ratio from Compound Q Decay. The methanol produced from a single turnover of diferrous MMOH was readily analyzed by GC- MS following derivatization as described in Experimental Procedures. Analysis of the results was simplified in some cases by the use of 18O2 in the oxygenation reaction, which served to shift the product mass by 2 units, so that it became distinct from the trace amounts of derivatized methanol originating from the extraction solvent. When <LATEX>C D _ { 4 }</LATEX> and 1802 were used as the substrates the only product was CD318OH, showing that no exchange of oxygen or methyl hydrogens occurred.

uooz | DISCUSSION
pxbq | MMO presents a unique opportunity to utilize isotopic substitution to probe the oxygenase catalytic process because it is the only alkane oxygenase for which the reactive intermediate in the catalytic cycle has been directly moni- tored. In general, KIEs in monooxygenases such as cyto- chrome P450 and dopamine <LATEX>\beta</LATEX> monooxygenase must be measured by steady state kinetics or product analysis. Consequently, a direct measurement of the intrinsic isotope effect in the actual oxygen insertion step cannot be achieved and may be masked by slower steps such as product release or electron transfer (Gelb et al., 1982; Glickman et al., 1994; Hwang & Grissom, 1994; McMurry & Groves, 1986; Northrop, 1975; Sugiyama & Trager, 1986). In the current study, we have shown that the decay of the reaction cycle intermediate compound Q, which appears to encompass the product-forming step, is very sensitive to the deuteration of methane. The mechanistic significance of this observation is discussed in the following sections.
jfsr | Origin of Unusually Large Isotope Effects. The observed isotope effect for compound Q decay exceeds by severalfold the classical limit for a deuterium isotope effect. Large isotope effects typically arise in reactions that include (i) branched pathways, (ii) multiple steps with cumulative effects of more than one isotope-sensitive step, (iii) a hydrogen- tunneling process, or (iv) a magnetic isotope effect (Hwang & Grissom, 1994).4 The effects of a branched reaction are usually seen in the product distribution rather than the direct observation of the decay of a reactive, chromophoric intermediate as reported here. The participation of more than one isotope-sensitive step is feasible, but the possibilities for such a process are constrained by the fact that no loss of hydrogen other than from the bond where oxygen insertion occurs is observed. Thus, it is unlikely that two hydrogen atoms are removed during the course of the reaction. In preliminary studies, we have not been able to observe magnetic isotope effects in the product distribution.5 Con- sequently, of the possibilities noted, hydrogen tunneling appears to be the most likely origin of the large isotope effect.6
