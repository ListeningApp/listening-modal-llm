You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ap5o | A total of 12 studies (Aimetti et al., 2020; Baumer et al., 2020; Cortellini et al., 2020; De Wet et al., 2018; Graetz et al., 2020; Jiao et al., 2017, 2018; Nibali et al., 2017, 2020; Saleh et al., 2021; Saydzai et al., 2022; Sonnenschein et al., 2017) including 1190 subjects had a minimum of 5 years of follow-up in SPC and were included in the qualitative and quantitative analyses (Tables 1, 3 and 4). Eight studies including 869 subjects had complete site-level data and so were used in the analyses assessing the relationships between 'stable periodonti- tis' and 'endpoints of therapy' and subsequent tooth loss. Ten studies followed conventional APT. Five studies reported on periodontitis- related tooth loss, and so this data were used when available. Studies without two arms (i.e., zero subjects or teeth when assessing tooth loss in relation to successfully or unsuccessfully reaching the end- points) were subsequently not included in the corresponding meta- analyses when analysing the WWC 2017 (De Wet et al., 2018; Jiao et al., 2018) and PPD ≥ 6 mm (Aimetti et al., 2020).

ks7m | Subject-level data
w1w1 | Of 12,563 subjects who had complete site-level data, 1.35% (n = 169) fulfilled the criteria of 'stable periodontitis' and 11.00% <LATEX>\left( n = 1 3 8 2 \right)</LATEX> met the 'endpoints of therapy'. 'Controlled periodontitis' was achieved in 34.62% <LATEX>\left( n = 4 4 6 0 \right)</LATEX> of the 12,884 subjects, while PPD < 5 mm and PPD < 6 mm were achieved in 6.70% (n = 863) and 30.45% (n = 3923) of subjects, respectively. Achievement of end- points varied greatly across studies. The prevalence of reaching each of the five subject-level endpoints increased when studies following conventional APT were analysed (9.43% fulfilled the criteria of 'stable periodontitis', 27.6% met the 'endpoints of therapy', 52.42% achieved 'controlled periodontitis', while 21.08% and 49.76% achieved PPD < 5 mm and PPD < 6 mm, respectively).

A total of 54.69% and 73.55% of teeth met the composite measures described in 'stable periodontitis' and 'endpoints of therapy', respectively, and 68.52% and 87.32% of all included teeth had <LATEX>P P D < 5</LATEX> mm and PPD < 6 mm, respectively.

As per WWC 2017, there were 11.36 and 11.51 'diseased' teeth per patient after APT among all 12,563 subjects and 12,394 'unstable' subjects, respectively. This reduced to 4.79 and 5.29 'diseased' teeth in all 732 subjects and 663 'unstable' subjects, respectively, from studies following conventional APT.

Supplemental Material S6 reports results relative to studies reporting periodontitis-related tooth loss. Heterogeneity in subject-level studies/analyses varied from unim- portant to substantial but did not seem to affect the direction of effects but affected only the precision with which the summary effect was cal- culated. Contour-enhanced funnel plots showed small sample bias among all meta-analyses. Studies showing statistically significant results were most frequently found in analyses of 'controlled periodontitis' and ‘PPD < 6 mm'.

Non-achievement of all endpoints at the tooth level was statistically significant and associated with an increased risk of tooth loss (Figure 3) ('stable periodontitis' <LATEX>\left[ R R = 1 0 . 3 3 ; \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. p < . 0 0 0 1 \right] ;</LATEX> 'endpoints of therapy' <LATEX>\left[ R R = 1 6 . 3 4 ; \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. p = . 0 0 1 \right] ;</LATEX> <LATEX>P P D < 5 \quad m m</LATEX> <LATEX>\left[ R R = 9 . 6 6 ; \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. p < . 0 0 0 1 \right] ;</LATEX> PPD < 6 mm <LATEX>\left[ R R = 1 0 . 8 7 ; \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. \left. p < . 0 0 0 1 \right] \right) .</LATEX> The results remained largely unchanged in sub-analyses of studies following conventional APT (Table 4; Supplemental Material S8) and those report- ing periodontitis-related tooth loss (Supplemental Material S9).
