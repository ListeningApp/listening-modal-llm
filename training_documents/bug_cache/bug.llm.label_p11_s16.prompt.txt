You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

l0a3 | Rethinking the Satisfaction-Contextual Factors Interactions
u8nw | Although we found significant interactions between sat- isfaction and contextual factors, the pattern of the relation- ships was the opposite of what we had predicted. Those with higher satisfaction were more responsive to the situa- tional factors than those with lower satisfaction. This un- expected finding suggests the need to review the assump- tions behind our hypotheses.
l2v9 | High satisfaction implies high plasticity. We had as- sumed that those with high satisfaction with the group were fulfilling their values, in part, through the group and that this would cause them to be more attached to the group. We expected that their attachment to and depen- dence on the group for continued satisfaction would cause them to engage in voice regardless of contextual factors. That is, we did not expect voice to vary significantly across situations for highly satisfied individuals. The pat- tern illustrated by the plots in Figures 3 and 4, however,

78r8 | reveals that the favorability of group conditions (i.e., small or self-managed groups ) had a strong influence on the voice behavior of highly satisfied individuals. Highly satisfied individuals in large or traditionally-managed groups engaged in the same amount of voice as those who were less satisfied. However, when highly satisfied individuals were in small or self-managed groups, they engaged in more voice than those who were less satisfied. Kahn's (1990) research on "personal engagement" pro- vides one possible explanation for this finding.
320g | When individuals feel their work situation has meaning- fulness (perceiving a positive return on their physical, cognitive, or emotional energy), they tend to become per- sonally engaged in their work. That is, they more fully employ themselves in terms of harnessing their physical, cognitive, and emotional energy so that they are more mindful and cognitively vigilant during task performance. Perhaps, in contrast to our initial thinking, satisfied indi- viduals' attachment to the group increased their personal engagement. Perhaps their dependence on the group for continuing satisfaction made them particularly sensitive to contextual information that might bear on the group's well-being. In the context of the present study, favorable conditions based on group size and style of management may convey information to those strongly attached to the group regarding means of dealing with the group's issues. That is, relative to large or traditionally-managed groups, the ambient and discretionary stimuli in small or self- managed groups may signal that it is desirable, appro- priate, and/or at least acceptable to engage in challenging or controversial behavior for the benefit of the group.
tp8g | Low satisfaction implies low plasticity. We had also expected that individuals with lower satisfaction with the group would be less attached and less dependent on the

9g22 | group for fulfilling their needs. Accordingly, we had ex- pected them to be less self-determined and more influ- enced by situational factors. Instead, our data demon- strated that the voice of those who were less satisfied varied less as a function of situational factors than the voice of those who were more satisfied. The lower respon- siveness of less satisfied individuals to the contextual fac- tors can also be explained in terms of Kahn's (1990) research.
41fx | When individuals do not perceive positive returns on their physical, cognitive, or emotional effort, they may withdraw from their work role. Such personal "disen- gagement" entails an absence of physical, cognitive, and emotional energies directed toward the task. Personal dis- engagement implies behavior that is automatic, detached, and effortless. Personally disengaged individuals are "cognitively unvigilant" and therefore, less responsive to situational stimuli. To the extent that individuals with low satisfaction do not perceive positive returns from their energies, they are likely to be personally disengaged and, thus, should be less responsive to situational factors such as group size and style of management.
7um8 | The research on positive affectivity (e.g., Tellegen, 1985) provides a similar explanation for the lower situa- tional responsiveness of less satisfied individuals. Positive affectivity is the global tendency to experience positive emotions and moods. It indicates the extent to which indi- viduals are "positively engaged in the world around them" (George, 1996, p. 146). Perhaps those with low satisfaction (like those with low positive affectivity) are "disengaged" from their environment and, thus, less re- sponsive to situational characteristics. We note that al- though positive affectivity refers to a global personality trait, satisfaction with the group reflects an individual's general attitude toward an object (the group). Thus, whereas low positive affectivity relates to disengagement from the environment in general, low satisfaction with the group relates to disengagement within a particular group.
uow2 | Overall, our results suggest that voice will be highest when personal factors (high self-esteem or high satisfac- tion) are combined with favorable situational factors (small group size or self-management). Although the above provides a plausible explanation for our unexpected findings, the logic is post hoc and accordingly should be examined in future research.
iat7 | Significant Control Variables
ywwr | In addition to the nature of the satisfaction-context interactions, we were also surprised by the relatively large amount of variance explained by the control variables (R2 = . 07). In retrospect, however, several of these relation- ships could have been predicted in advance and perhaps even included as a priori hypotheses. The sex differences
0i6j | literature, for example, suggests that males tend to partici- pate more in groups than females (Johnson & Schulman, 1989), especially in task-related as opposed to socio-emo- tional behaviors (Piliavian & Martin, 1978). This litera- ture also suggests that males tend to initiate communica- tions and provide their opinions, whereas females tend to be more reactive and strive for consensus (Strodtbeck & Mann, 1956). Finally, this literature suggests that females may have less influence than males in mixed-sex groups (Izraeli, 1985; Ridgeway, 1982); thus, females may have lower confidence that they will be "heard" above mem- bers of the traditional majority. We note that a similar argument could be made for a relationship between eth- nicity and voice. Overall, therefore, the literature suggests that males and Whites would tend to engage in more voice than females and non-Whites.
87cq | The relationship between education and job status and voice could have also been predicted a priori. Education imparts general knowledge that translates into a greater ability to recognize problems or opportunities and to offer a greater number of possible solutions. Education may also increase an individual's confidence that he or she possesses the skills and knowledge necessary in order to make suggestions at work (Farr & Ford, 1990). Thus, it is probable that those who possess more knowledge and confidence will be more likely to engage in voice. Job status reflects access to information and the freedom one has regarding behavior on the job. The more status, the more information and latitude one has regarding accept- able job behaviors. Suggestions that "buck-the-system" or challenge the status-quo may require such latitude. In addition, higher job status may provide a sense of power as well as a sense of responsibility for outcomes that facilitate expression of voice. This is different for individ- uals in low-level jobs who may have less access to infor- mation, fewer degrees of freedom regarding their behavior at work, and who may feel less responsible for group outcomes.
0qs3 | Research on the related behavior of whistle-blowing also suggests that demographics might be important in predicting voice. Whistle-blowers tend to be older, male, more tenured, more educated, and hold supervisory or professional jobs (Near & Miceli, 1996). Thus, in sum, there is certainly empirical support for the linkage be- tween demographics and voice behavior. Future research, however, needs to focus on developing an understanding of the nature of these relationships. The explanations for the demographic relationships outlined in the two previ- ous paragraphs suggest at least two crucial mediating vari- ables-ability to engage in voice and efficacy to engage in voice. That is, before individuals engage in voice they must have the ability to generate suggestions for improve- ment and the confidence that they can get their message across. As suggested above, factors such as education,

51vd | VOICE IN WORK GROUPS
baj1 | tenure, and job-status should promote this type of ability and efficacy. However, it is also likely that contextual variables influence individuals' ability and efficacy to en- gage in voice. Organizations that are supportive of whis- tle-blowing, for example, have higher levels of this behav- ior (Near & Miceli, 1996).
n1wo | Practical Implications
5bq3 | We believe the findings reported in this study are im- portant because they expand our understanding of the an- tecedents of voice. This knowledge should be especially relevant to managers in organizations with dynamic envi- ronments where change and new ideas are essential for organizational adaptation, innovation, survival, and suc- cess (Howard, 1995). For instance, the relationships be- tween the person-centered characteristics and voice sug- gest staffing interventions. When an organization wants to increase voice, group members could be selected on traits known to be associated with satisfaction (e.g., posi- tive affectivity). Alternatively, other literature links group composition with members' cohesion (Haythorn, 1968) and cohesion with members' satisfaction with their group (Lott & Lott, 1965; Shaw, 1981). Thus, it may be possible to staff groups to promote cohesion, and in turn, promote voice. Group composition may also promote voice through group members' reactions to one another. For example, research suggests that group members may be less willing to suggest ways to overcome a weak mem- ber's performance deficiency if the weak member is low on conscientiousness (LePine, Hollenbeck, Ilgen, & Hed- lund, 1997). In addition to staffing interventions, our re- sults for the situational antecedents also suggest group- design interventions that will enhance voice. For instance, it may be possible to increase voice by structuring groups such that they are smaller and self-managed.
ezla | The significant Person X Situation interactions suggest that it may be worthwhile to consider the benefits of con- tingent staffing and group-design interventions. That is, either fit people to certain types of groups or structure groups to fit certain types of people. For instance, if an organization has members with low global self-esteem, it may be beneficial (in terms of promoting voice) to struc- ture groups so they are smaller, self-managed, or both (see Figures 1 and 2). Likewise, if an organization has small, self-managed, or both types of groups, it may be beneficial to select people who are somewhat predisposed to be being satisfied (see Figures 3 and 4).
rsbu | Overall, we believe that it may be possible to promote voice in work group settings. However, additional re- search needs to investigate the validity of our suggestions. Research should also examine additional variables that might influence voice in organizational settings.

tb74 | Limitations
8l69 | Although our study had several strengths (longitudinal design, data collected from multiple sources, fairly large and diverse sample), it had several limitations that we note here. As alluded to above, we examined a limited subset of the many possible theoretically-based personal and situational antecedents, and thus, our predictive model explained a relatively small amount of variance in voice. Assessing models of voice with other theoretically rele- vant antecedents should be a goal of future research. Re- searchers could begin by assessing other antecedents sug- gested by Van Dyne et al. (1995) such as psychological ownership, career-professional involvement, justice per- ceptions, need for achievement, and environmental dynamism.
1jyv | A second limitation of our study was that we did not examine the processes associated with our predictions. For example, we did not manipulate management style and observe changes in member affect, cognition, and behavior. As another example, although we originally as- sumed that group performance is an outcome of voice, one reviewer suggested that it may play an indirect role as an antecedent. High levels of group performance may increase member satisfaction and the amount of autonomy given to a group to manage its own affairs. As a final example of the need to consider process issues in the future, certain types of groups may attract and retain cer- tain types of people, and thus, it is possible that manage- ment style and group size are really capturing some indi- vidual difference variable.
olce | A third limitation is that we did not sample randomly within some population of firms. Accordingly, it is diffi- cult to specify where our results might or might not gener- alize. Although no single study is likely to address this question adequately (Cook & Campbell, 1979), research with theory-based predictions as to the generalizability of our findings should be conducted.
erx1 | Finally, although our sampling strategy was designed to rule out situations where peers could not directly observe group members' behavior, we did not directly ask group members how much day-to-day interaction they had. Al- though our measure of voice did demonstrate acceptable levels of interrater agreement, we nevertheless suggest that researchers ask about frequency of peer interaction when using peer rating scales in the future.
b3bt | Conclusion
0w8m | Innovation is critical for the long-term survival of orga- nizations (Ancona & Caldwell, 1987). Innovation begins with recognition and generation of novel ideas or solu- tions that challenge past practices and standard operating procedures (Scott & Bruce, 1994). However, if individu- als generate ideas and solutions but are unwilling to speak

However, it is problematic to equate vari- ance explained with practical significance (Abelson, 1985; Prentice & Miller, 1992). The research reported in this study has important implications for managers be- cause it suggests levers (i.e., staffing and group-design interventions ) that managers can use to influence the ex- tent to which employees speak up with constructive sug- gestions for change. Given the importance of innovation in today's competitive environment, we recommend future research that continues to enhance our understanding of voice. We suggest that researchers broaden their focus and examine additional variables as well as the underlying processes that lead to voice.
