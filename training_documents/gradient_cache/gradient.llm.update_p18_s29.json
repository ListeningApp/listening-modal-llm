        "content": "ilrs | Complex modules can be constructed from simpler modules by simply defining a new class whose slots will contain the member modules and the intermediate state variables between those modules. The fprop method for the class simply calls the fprop methods of the member modules, with the appropriate intermediate state variables or external input and outputs as arguments. Although the algorithms are easily generalizable to any network of such modules, including those whose influence graph has cycles, we will limit the discussion to the case of directed acyclic graphs (feed-forward networks).\n0a03 | Computing derivatives in a multimodule system is just as simple. A \"backward propagation\" method, called bprop, for each module class can be defined for that purpose. The bprop method of a module takes the same arguments as the fprop method. All the derivatives in the system can be computed by calling the bprop method on all the modules in reverse order compared to the forward propagation phase. The state variables are assumed to contain slots for storing the gradients computed during the backward pass, in addition to storage for the states computed in the forward pass. The backward pass effectively computes the partial derivatives of the loss E with respect to all the state variables and all the parameters in the system. There is an interesting duality property between the forward and backward functions of certain modules. For example, a sum of several variables in the forward direction is transformed into a simple fan-out (replication) in the backward\nauae | direction. Conversely, a fan-out in the forward direction is transformed into a sum in the backward direction. The software environment used to obtain the results described in this paper, called SN three point one, uses the above concepts. It is based on a home-grown object-oriented dialect of Lisp with a compiler to C.\n5b6y | The fact that derivatives can be computed by propagation in the reverse graph is easy to understand intuitively. The best way to justify it theoretically is through the use of Lagrange functions. The same formalism can be used to extend the procedures to networks with recurrent connections.\n1y10 | B. Special Modules\n6mnx | Neural Networks and many other standard pattern recognition techniques can be formulated in terms of multimodular systems trained with gradient-based learning. Commonly used modules include matrix multiplications and sigmoidal modules, the combination of which can be used to build conventional Neural Networks. Other modules include convolutional layers, subsampling layers, R B F layers, and \"softmax\" layers. Loss functions are also represented as modules whose single output produces the value of the loss. Commonly used modules have simple bprop methods. In general, the bprop method of a function F is a multiplication by the Jacobian of F. Here are a few commonly used examples. The bprop method of a fanout (a \"Y\" connection) is a sum, and vice versa. The bprop method of a multiplication by a coefficient is a multiplication by the same coefficient. The bprop method of a multiplication by a matrix is a multiplication by the transpose of that matrix. The bprop method of an addition with a constant is the identity.\ntynp | Interestingly, certain nondifferentiable modules can be inserted in a multimodule system without adverse effect. An interesting example of that is the multiplexer module. It has two (or more) regular inputs, one switching input, and one output. The module selects one of its inputs, depending upon the (discrete) value of the switching input, and copies it on its output. While this module is not differentiable with respect to the switching input, it is differentiable with respect to the regular inputs. Therefore the overall function of a system that includes such modules will be differentiable with respect to its parameters as long as the switching input does not depend upon the parameters. For example, the switching input can be an external input.\nob0u | Another interesting case is the min module. This module has two (or more) inputs and one output. The output of the module is the minimum of the inputs. The function of this module is differentiable everywhere, except on the switching surface which is a set of measure zero. Interestingly, this function is continuous and reasonably regular, and that is sufficient to ensure the convergence of a gradient-based learning algorithm.\n50o1 | The object-oriented implementation of the multimodule idea can easily be extended to include a bbprop method that propagates Gauss-Newton approximations of the second derivatives. This leads to a direct generalization for\ncw76 | modular systems of the second-derivative back propagation given in Appendix C.\nlkk5 | The multiplexer module is a special case of a much more general situation, described at length in Section Nine, where the architecture of the system changes dynamically with the input data. Multiplexer modules can be used to dynamically rewire (or reconfigure) the architecture of the system for each new input pattern.\nmolj | C. G T N's",
