You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

1k9e | Our study addresses several knowledge gaps to further improve the understanding of stability and change in symp- toms of psychopathology from childhood into adolescence. First, prior work by Basten et al. within the current sam- ple, assessed the stability and change of psychopathology symptoms until early childhood [6], not yet covering late childhood and early adolescence. Studying the stability and change of psychopathology symptoms in this age period is crucial, given the rapid changes in behavior that occur dur- ing adolescence [14] and since many psychiatric disorders emerge during adolescence [15, 16]. Second, despite the fact that the two previous longitudinal studies applied similar analyses, they used different measures of psychopathol- ogy. Basten et al. used parent reported questionnaire data, assessing psychopathology as symptoms along a continuum, whereas McElroy et al. used a structured clinical interview, implemented as a parent reported questionnaire, generating binary variables for the presence of psychiatric diagnoses [6, 7]. Thus, it remains unclear whether the substantial dif- ferences in prevalence can be attributed to age differences or to differences in sample or methodology.
5bjs | Within this context, it is the primary goal of this study to assess developmental trajectories of children with psy- chopathology symptoms as they progress into adolescence.
uodj | We evaluate which psychopathology subgroups are present in the general population at different ages and the probabil- ity that individuals remain within or transition between the observed psychopathology subgroups over time. Based on previous literature, we hypothesized that we would observe four psychopathology subgroups (no problems, internaliz- ing, externalizing and DP) in all age groups, and that the psychopathology subgroups become more stable with age, except for the DP group. We hypothesize that this group will begin to diverge during adolescence, transitioning to primar- ily either internalizing or externalizing subgroups.

b2lm | Participants
ti7f | This study was embedded within the Generation R Study, which is a large longitudinal birth cohort in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, in which pregnant women with a delivery date between April 2002 and January 2006 were invited to participate [17]. Since recruitment, the children and their families have been invited for multiple waves of data col- lection. Children were included in this study if their parents filled out the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at 5 to 8 <LATEX>\left( T 1 , n = 6 1 9 4 \right) , a t \quad 9 \quad t o \quad 1 2 \left( T 2 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { n } = 4 8 8 4 ,</LATEX> or at 13 to 16 (T3, <LATEX>\left. n = 4 7 0 5 \right)</LATEX> years of age. This resulted in a total sample of 6,930 participants who were eligible for inclusion. Of these participants, 736 had missing data at T1, 2046 had missing data at T2 and 2225 had missing data at T3. The majority of participants <LATEX>\left( n = 3 6 3 3 \right)</LATEX> participated in all measurement waves, 1587 participated in two measurement waves and 1710 participated in one measurement wave.

The study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the Erasmus Medi- cal Centre in Rotterdam and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from the legal representatives and, when children were older than 12 years-of-age, children also provided informed assent.
o22k | Instruments
nwfz | Child Behavior
nvfy | Child behavior was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The CBCL version 1.5-5 years consists of 99 items, with a three-point Likert scale (0= not true, 1 = somewhat true, 2 = very true). Seven empirically derived syndrome scales were calculated, being Anxious/Depressed, Aggressive Behavior, Emotionally Reactive, Somatic Com- plaints, Withdrawn, Sleep Problems and Attention Prob- lems. Similarly, the CBCL version 6-18 years consists of 112 items, of which eight syndrome scales were derived, Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn/Depressed, Somatic Com- plaints, Thought Problems, Attention Problems, Rule- breaking Behavior and Aggressive Behavior. Both versions are reliable and valid questionnaires for assessing behav- ioral problems [18, 19]. The primary caregiver completed the questionnaires, which was the CBCL v1.5-5 at T1 and CBCL v6-18 at T2 and T3 [20, 21]. Notably, given the age range included at T1, for some children the CBCL v1.5-5 and for other children the CBCL v6-18 would have been age appropriate. The CBCL v1.5-5 was used at T1 for all participants to keep the CBCL version consistent with earlier measurement waves of Generation R [20, 21]. T-scores of all syndrome scales were computed based on normative data for both the CBCL/1.5-5 and the CBCL/6-18 using ASEBA- PC [22].
mror | Demographic Characteristics
zlxc | Sex was obtained from birth records. Maternal education and household income were assessed through questionnaire. Maternal education was categorized into low (no education, primary school), middle (high school, vocational training) and high (higher vocational training, university). Household income was scored low in Generation R when parents had less than 2000 euros a month and high when parents had more than 2000 euros a month. Child national origin was based on the birth country of the parents and categorized as western (Dutch, American western, Asian western, Euro- pean, Indonesian & Oceania) and non-western (African, American non-western, Asian non-western, Cape Verdean, Dutch Antilles, Moroccan, Surinamese & Turkish).
k0bw | Statistical Analyses
aq5a | Latent Profile Analysis (LPA)
sc5y | Psychopathology profiles at T1 were previously derived using the same procedures described below [13]. In earlier work, the Sleep Problems syndrome scale of the CBCL was not included in the analyses. Here, we applied LPA to define
0yab | psychopathology subgroups at T1, T2 and T3, using CBCL T-scores of all available syndrome scales as indicators, includ- ing Sleep Problems. Consistent with earlier work within Gen- eration R, we used five criteria to determine the optimal num- ber of profiles [6, 13]. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the bootstrapped likelihood ratio test (BLRT) were used to evaluate the fit of each model. The BIC is a measure of model fit considering the rule of parsimony, with a lower BIC indicating a better fit. The BLRT is a likelihood ratio for k classes versus k - 1 classes, with a p-value greater than 0.05 indicating that k - 1 classes are sufficient. Entropy of the models was evaluated with values closer to 1 indicating better classification. Moreover, all profiles obtained should include a minimum of 1% of the participants. Lastly, all profiles were inspected visually to ensure each additional profile had a dis- tinct severity or shape pattern.
