You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ojro | Somehow, in the transition between "passionate to help others" and "owning my first business," we gradually realized that we don't even know the first thing about business, let alone turning a profit.
l6t9 | We may know a lot about our passion, about why we started the business, but that doesn't mean we know anything about succeeding in business. Much to the disappointment of the idealists on the sidelines, succeeding in business means getting prospective customers to trade us money for our services. Our passion for their hard-earned coins. That's the agreement. The only way to facilitate that exchange, to transact, to literally carry out business as a business is by making the prospect an offer.
1ujy | What's An Offer Anyways?
qzor | The only way to conduct business is through a value exchange, a trade of dollars for value. The offer is what initiates this trade. In a nutshell, the offer is the goods and services you agree to give or provide, how you accept payment, and the terms of the agreement. It is what begins the process of getting customers and making money. It is the first thing any new customer will interact with in your business. Since the offer is what attracts new customers, it is the lifeblood of your business.
a0by | No offer? No business. No life.
u1ky | Bad offer? Negative profit. No business. Miserable life.
htm9 | Decent offer? No profit. Stagnating business. Stagnating life.
8hul | Good offer? Some profit. Okay business. Okay life.
87vz | Grand Slam Offer? Fantastic profit. Insane business. Freedom.
ym66 | This book helps entrepreneurs craft those Grand Slam Offers. These are the offers that are so effective, profitable, and life- changing that it seems they can only be the result of luck! That's how it looks to an untrained eye, at least.
l0a3 | As you likely now know, I have crafted thousands of offers over the last decade. Most failed. Some did okay. And some struck gold . . . but I never really knew why. As Dr Burgelman, a famous Stanford business school professor said, it is far better to have understood why you failed than to be ignorant of why you succeeded.
u8nw | But, as the data started rolling in, what seemed like "luck" and "fortune" was closer to a repeatable framework. I have been fortunate enough to have struck gold enough times to document these frameworks and have gotten "lightning to strike twice."
l2v9 | I have put the steps and components of those frameworks in a logical and digestible format so they are actually useful. Today. Like now. I'm giving you action. Instead of a sad-but-typical book of vague business theories and mental masturbation.
afbe | The Two Main Problems Most Entrepreneurs Face and How This Book Solves Them
78r8 | Although you can make the list of problems you face a mile long, which is a great way to stress yourself out, all these problems typically stem from two big kahunas:
320g | 1. Not enough clients
tp8g | 2. Not enough cash (excess profit at the end of the month)
gxfd | Seems obvious, right? It costs more money and time to get more clients, thereby solving issue one, and that money is
s2v1 | coming from the profit margins, which creates problem two! What's more annoying, prospects savagely compare and belittle our services in favor of cheaper and crappier alternatives - with the cheapest one "winning." This, of course, when "winning" means getting to work more for even less (sad face).
jkp9 | Let's say you've slashed prices to get more customers. You may even have a full client load. But here you are, barely making it because profit margins are too thin. "Competition" becomes a race to the bottom.
z8tt | If you're struggling with one or both of these issues, you're not alone. I've been there.
9g22 | Heck, I think every entrepreneur has these same challenges.
41fx | I also want you to know that it's not your fault. Typical models weren't designed for profit maximization. They were designed by companies who have boatloads of funding and can operate at a loss for years. When these models are used in the real world, business owners just barely "get by." They essentially "buy themselves a job" and work 100 hours a week to avoid working 40. Crappy trade. My guess is that if you're anything like me, you signed up for something better.
7um8 | Keep an open-mind. The contents of this book, if executed, can transform your business . . . fast.
uow2 | It's okay if you're not into money numbers or business models. I've done all that work for you. I'm walking you through the process step-by-step in these pages. I'm going to explain each of the big two problems we touched on above in detail, including why they don't work. Then I'm going to show you the solutions. And to wrap this adventure up, I'll explain how to enhance value to maximize how much you make per customer, so that you can outmarket everyone and stack cash.
iat7 | We use this offer model for every niche we work with (chiros, dentists, gyms, agencies, plumbers, roofers, dog walkers, physical products, software, brick and mortar stores, and so many more), and it's amazing how fast things can improve with each and every one of them when they use this framework.
ywwr | What's In It For You?
0i6j | I've made every (dumb) business mistake in the book. Now, you can learn from my embarrassing, brutal, multi-million dollar fuck-ups without having to suffer the pain yourself.
87cq | Building these businesses has been a very hard and emotional journey for me. I wouldn't trade these experiences for the world. However, if this book helps just one entrepreneur avoid suffering as I did, keep their business open, or accomplish their dreams, it will all be worth it.
0qs3 | If you are willing to exchange the time it takes to watch two episodes of your favorite tv show and really study this book - and if you implement even a single offer component - I can guarantee you will add more clients and more dollars to your bottom line. Reading this book, and taking it to heart, will be the single best return on time for your business. Nothing else will allow you to do what this book can do in the same amount of time. That is a promise.
z8f7 | As a side benefit - implementing a new offer is about one of the easiest things to do in a business. So you really can do this. This isn't some management practice or culture building hoodoo. This is the real "how you sell shit for lots of money"- type stuff.
7w7j | What's In It For Me?
51vd | I give all these materials (this book, the accompanying course, and all other books and courses which you can find at acquisition.com) for free or at cost in order to help as many people as humanly possible make more and serve more. And I have made these with the intention of providing more value than you can get from a $1000 course, any $30,000 coaching program, and hilariously more than a $200,000 college degree. And I do this because, although I could sell these materials in that format, I just don't want to. I've made my money doing this stuff, not teaching how to do this stuff, contrary to most of the marketing community at large. So my model is different (I'll explain more in a second).
baj1 | That being said, there are two key archetypes I am looking to provide value to with my published materials. For archetype I, entrepreneurs under $3,000,000 per year in revenue, my goal is to help you get there and earn your trust. Try just a couple of tactics from this book, watch them work, then try a few more, watch them work . . . and so on. The more you see results in your own business, the better.
n1wo | Once you succeed, you become archetype II, entrepreneurs at minimum between $3M - $10M in yearly revenue. Once you get there, or if that's you now, I'd be honored to invest in your business and help you cross $30M, $50M, or $100M+. I don't sell coaching, masterminds, courses, or anything like that. Instead, I have a portfolio of companies I take an equity interest in. I
5bq3 | use the infrastructure, resources, and teams of all my companies to fast track their growth. But don't believe me yet ... we just met. If you're curious, my business model is simple, just like the four-piece pyramid logo:
ezla | ACQUISITION.COM
rsbu | 1. Provide value at no cost far in excess of what the rest of the marketplace charges for.
magd | 2. Have entrepreneurs use materials that actually work and make money helping more folks
tb74 | 3. Earn the trust of the hyper-executor business owners who use the frameworks to scale their businesses to $3M- $10M per year and beyond
8l69 | 4. Invest in those businesses to make more impact at scale while helping everyone else for free.
1jyv | If you look carefully, the process reverse-engineers success. I think it's pretty cool. Here's how: I know these business owners can execute the frameworks I have without hand-holding, and therefore, would be very likely to succeed with the next set of frameworks (getting to $30M, $50M, $100M looks different than getting to $3-$10M). They know that my style works for them, because it already has. So we operate on shared trust - I trust they can execute, and they trust that our stuff works - again, because it already has .... all while helping everyone else .... fo' free. So it allows me to preemptively avoid failures and dramatically increases success likelihood. Let me show you how much ....
olce | At the time of this writing, every business I have started since March of 2017 has achieved a $1,500,000/mo run rate. According to the Small Business Administration, the odds of a single business even achieving $10M/year in revenue are .4%, or 1 in 250. Having it happen four times in a row is .4% x .4% x .4% x .4%= very very low probability that it was luck. As such, I can say with conviction that we know how to recreate success using the frameworks I share over and over again. They work because they are timeless business principles.
erx1 | I actively visualize, every day, how it felt to wake up in the middle of the night in cold sweats, wondering how I'd make payroll. That gut-wrenching "meditation" keeps me hungry as an entrepreneur but also grateful for my security and peace of mind. I want the latter for you and anyone else that gives a damn about what they do.
b3bt | Fair enough?
0w8m | Cool. So let's get to it.
vcu3 | Basic Outline of This Book
hjzj | This book is intended to be a resource. As a resource, I mean it will be something you will read through and then keep in your tool box, coming back to it again and again. Why? As Einstein says, "never memorize anything you can look up." Business is not a spectator sport. You're not cramming for some midterm, and you're not some limp-wristed philosopher.
j79f | You do work. And to work, you need tools. This, my friend, is one of those tools.

q5eu | PRICING: THE COMMODITY PROBLEM
a7ao | "Think different."
29a3 | VS .
sb1e | "Grow or Die" is a core tenet at our companies. We believe every person, every company, and every organism is either growing or dying. Maintenance is a myth.
w2yn | What this means is, if your company isn't growing, it's dying. This is a sobering reality for many of us. I learned the hard way, and my businesses suffered for a long time because of it.
ap6l | Let me explain. The market is continuously growing. The stock market grows at 9 percent per year. If we aren't growing at 9 percent per year, we are falling behind. "Maintenance," in the most generic sense, would be 9 percent growth year over year.
iest | Furthermore, if you're in a growing marketplace, then you might have to grow at 20-30 percent per year, just to keep up, or risk falling behind. So you can see how maintenance is a myth.
cox8 | So, then, what does it take to grow? Thankfully, just three simple things:
ppqi | 1. Get more customers
oxou | 2. Increase their average purchase value
495n | 3. Get them to buy more times
awri | That's it.
bl28 | Sure, there are lots of ways to acquire customers and zillions of ways to increase order value and purchase frequency, but, simply put, that's it. Those are the only three ways to grow.
d5bz | Example: If I sell 10 clients a month, and a client is worth $1,000 to me over their lifetime (through avg cart value x avg number of purchases), then my business will cap at $10,000/mo (10 x$1,000).
ap5o | 10 New Clients/mo x $1000 Lifetime Value = $10,000/mo max revenue.
7zvf | If you want to grow, you've got to either sell more clients every month (while maintaining suitable margins) or have them be worth more (by increasing the profit per purchase or number of times they buy). That's it.
mov9 | Author Note - Only Two Ways to Grow
ks7m | To simplify this concept even more. There are really only two ways to grow: get more customers, and increase each customer's value. "Increasing each customer's value" has two sub-buckets: 1) Increasing profit per purchase 2) Increasing the number of times they buy. For the purpose of this book, I highlight both of those sub-buckets as individual growth paths. I did this because I think it will be easier to understand the money models that will come in Volume III. All three - getting more customers, increasing their average purchase value, and getting them to buy more - are repeated themes in this book. But if you seek simplicity, both increasing average purchase value and increasing the number of times a customer buys results in one outcome: increasing each customer's value.
w1w1 | Business Terms
h8gv | Before going any further, and to better flesh out the concepts that follow, we should take a second to define and better understand some key business concepts. When I stood in that Las Vegas penthouse in my "beast mode" t-shirt I was clueless about such terms. Let me help you be better than, well, me.
kwkp | Gross Profit: The revenue minus the direct cost of servicing an ADDITIONAL customer. If I sell lotion for $10 and it costs me $2, my gross profit is $8 or 80 percent. If I sell agency services for $1,000/mo and it costs me $100/mo in labor to run that client's advertising, then my gross profit is $900 or 90 percent. Note: This is not net profit. Net profit is what's left over after all expenses are paid, not just the direct costs of fulfillment.
yj0m | Lifetime Value: The gross profit accrued over the entire lifetime of a customer. This is gross profit multiplied by the number of purchases an average customer will make over their lifetime. Using the example above, if the average customer stays five months, and they pay $1,000/mo while it costs me $100 per month to fulfill, then their lifetime value is $4,500.
