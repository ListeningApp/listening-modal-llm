You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

2e62 | This potential-dependent apparent <LATEX>p K _ { a }</LATEX> of the surface- attached species can also be viewed in terms of a potential- dependent work term due to bringing a proton to the interfacial region. A similar work term is necessary for the ET steps for the same physical reason and to ensure that the overall free energy of the PCET process is independent of path. Therefore, this work term was added to all of the ET and PT steps. Including these work terms for the diagonal steps does not alter the results because they effectively cancel. These work terms are effectively accounting for nonideal behavior at the interface.50,51 The impact of the potential dependence of

For ET, the axial ligand is <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O</LATEX> in the oxidized and reduced states, whereas for EPT, the axial ligand <LATEX>i s \quad O H \quad i n \quad t h e</LATEX> oxidized state and H2O in the reduced state. The inner-sphere reorganization energies were computed to be 0.16 and 0.54 eV for ET and EPT, respectively. The substantial difference arises from the larger change in the distance between Ru and the oxygen of the axial ligand for EPT than for ET (0.19 Å for EPT versus 0.06 Å for ET). The total reorganization energy, which is the sum of the inner- and outer-sphere components, computed for ET is in agreement with experimental measurements at low <LATEX>\mathrm { p H } ,</LATEX> where only the ET channel is accessible.19 The total reorganization energy for EPT is an effective value where the contributions of excited proton vibrational states are also included. A model using <LATEX>\lambda _ { \mathrm { E P T } }</LATEX> without considering the excited proton vibrational states is provided in the SI (Figure S7).
ccmb | Using the parameter values provided and explained in Table S2, we are able to model the pH and potential dependence of the apparent PCET rate constant, as shown in Figure 5. Figure Sa shows qualitatively reasonable agreement with the experimental data in this potential and pH range using eq 15. The weak <LATEX>p H</LATEX> dependence of <LATEX>k _ { \max , \mathrm { a p } }</LATEX> is correctly described, and the curves for <LATEX>p H = 3</LATEX> and 5 are shifted toward lower potentials compared to the curve for <LATEX>\mathrm { p H } = 1 ,</LATEX> indicating larger apparent reorganization energies for <LATEX>p H = 3</LATEX> and 5. Note that this apparent reorganization energy reflects the summation over channels in eq 15 and thus is not as easily interpreted as in eq 14, as discussed further below. One source of the quantitative deviations could be the use of the error function expression in eq 15. In this expression, we assume that the

nav4 | density of states of the electrode is constant, and the electronic coupling is the same for all electrode energy levels, but these assumptions may not be rigorously valid for real systems. On the other hand, the agreement with the experimental data at pH = 1 can be significantly improved if we adjust K1 (Figure S6). Moreover, the slight increase of the pH = 5 curve in Figure Sa at around -0.2 V vs NHE does not appear when a larger ŻEPT is used (Figure S8). Figure 5b shows the apparent maximum rate constant as a function of pH. Here, the apparent maximum rate constant is defined at the lowest potential reached in the experiment, E = - 0.1 V, instead of E = - 00, because not all channels reach saturation in the experimental potential range. Using the same parameters as in Figure 5a, we predict that the apparent maximum PCET rate constant will become pH-independent at high pH. This prediction is confirmed by experimental measurements, as discussed below.
gem8 | To understand the origin of the weak pH dependence of Kmax,app, we analyzed the contributions of each channel at pH = 1, 3, and 5 as a function of potential (Figure 6a-c). With the equilibrium assumption, when pH < pKa,Red any Ru" -OH (Red ) formed through ET2 will nearly instantaneously be protonated to form Ru" -OH2 (RedH). Therefore, ET2 is a PCET channel occurring by the ETPT mechanism. In principle, ET1 is associated with a PCET channel occurring by the PTET mechanism, where the protonation occurs via a pre-equilibrium process. The contribution of each channel to the total rate constant is determined by both the mole fractions

For this system, our previous work showed that the total reorganization energy is significantly larger for EPT than for ET, as discussed above, leading to a higher free energy barrier for the EPT steps. As a result, the ET rate constants are significantly larger than the EPT rate constants at a given electrode potential. Moreover, at a given potential, ET1 is faster than ET2 because it has a more positive reduction potential (i.e., a larger driving force).
f682 | At pH = 1, the ET1 channel dominates over the entire range of potentials considered (Figure 6a). The concentration of Ru™ -OH- (Ox) is much smaller than Ru™ -OH2 (OxH+) over this potential range because the potential-dependent pKa,Ox is always greater than the pH. Therefore, the ET2, EPT1, and EPT2 channels are not accessible due to the low concentration of Ox, especially at negative potentials. Thus, the ET1 channel dominates at pH = 1.
li1k | At pH = 3, the ET1 channel still dominates, although the ET2-PT channel also contributes to a smaller extent at less positive potentials. The concentration of Ru™ -OH2 is negligible at 1.1 V vs NHE because pKa,Ox = 1.2 at this potential, thereby inhibiting contributions from the ET1 channel at this potential. Assuming the potential dependence of pKa,Ox given in eq 13, however, the concentrations of Ru1"I -OH2 and Ru" -OH become comparable at less positive potentials (Figure 6e). Since ET1 is much faster than the other

The concentration of <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathrm { R u } } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } } - O \mathrm { H } _ { 2 }</LATEX> at this <LATEX>p H</LATEX> is much smaller, virtually eliminating the contribution from the ET1 channel.
