        "content": "s6hr | Now, if all this seems very weird, here's why: we often describe physical systems using infinitely many states, with a lowest possible energy but no highest possible energy. In this case the sum in the Boltzmann distribution can't converge for beta less than zero, so negative temperatures are ruled out.\np6cq | However, some physical systems can be approximately described using a finite set of states (or in quantum theory, a finite-dimensional Hilbert space of states). Then the things I just said hold true! And people enjoy studying these systems, and their strange properties, in the lab.\n99rc | It's good to look at a simple example, and work everything out explicitly:\nn6d5 | Puzzle twenty-five. Suppose a system has two states with energies E one and E two. Compute the probabilities pi that it is in either of these states in thermal equilibrium as a function of the coolness B. Then express these probabilities as a function of the temperature T. Using these functions pi of T:\n1kke | . Show that when zero is less than T is less than positive infinity the system is more likely to be in the lower-energy state: P one of T is greater than p two of T.\nzp0n | . Show that when negative infinity is less than T is less than zero the system is more likely to be in the higher-energy state: P one of T is less than p two of T.\nf9ca | 路 Show that\nyidf | T approaches positive infinity, the limit pi of T equals the limit pi of T as T approaches negative infinity.\nysbk | so we can speak unambiguously of the probabilities p at infinite temperature.\n1cv5 | 路 Show that at infinite temperature the system has an equal probability of being in either state.\ncst3 | 路 Show that as T approaches zero from above, the probability of the system being in the lower energy state approaches one.\nw2ec | 路 Show that as T approaches zero from below, the probability of the system being in the higher energy state approaches one.\nov01 | INFINITE TEMPERATURE\nbovo | If a system has finitely many states with energies E i, in thermal equilibrium at temperature T the probability that it's in the i-th state is\natnz | Pi proportional to e to the power of B E i.\n85ak | where B equals one divided by k T and k is Boltzmann's constant.\ngk8u | When B equals zero the system's temperature becomes infinite, and all states become equally probable!\ndyg8 | The probability of finding a system in a particular state decays exponentially with energy when the coolness beta is positive. But for a system with finitely many states, beta can be zero. Then it becomes equally probable for the system to be in any state!\nqoea | Zero coolness means 'utter randomness': that is, maximum entropy.\ned2n | Here's why. The probability distribution with the largest entropy is the one where all probabilities pi are all equal. This happens at zero coolness! When beta equals zero we get exp of negative beta E i equals one for all i. The probabilities pi are proportional to these numbers exp of negative beta E i equals one, so they're all equal.\n3xp7 | It seems zero coolness is impossible for a system with infinitely many states. With infinitely many states, all equally probable, the probability of being in any state would be zero. In other words, there's no uniform probability distribution on an infinite set.\n2hce | One way out: replace sums with integrals. For the usual measure on zero to one, called the Lebesgue measure dx, we have the integral from zero to one of dx equals one. So this is a 'probability measure' that we could use to describe a system at zero coolness, whose space of states is zero to one.\n12p5 | But replacing sums by integrals raises all sorts of interesting issues. For example, there's a unique way to sum over a finite set of states, but an integral over an infinite set of states depends on a choice of measure. So a choice of measure is a significant extra structure we're slapping on our set of states.\ns4t5 | We'll need to think about these issues later, since to compute the entropy of a classical ideal gas we'll need integrals. But we'll encounter difficulties, which are ultimately resolved using quantum mechanics.\n7ojm | Anyway: infinite temperature is really zero coolness, and at least for systems with finitely many states, the entropy becomes as large as possible at zero coolness.\nx0cv | NEGATIVE TEMPERATURE\nd5cm | If a system has finitely many states with energies E sub i, in thermal equilibrium at temperature T the probability that it's in the i-th state is\ncojo | p sub i proportional to e to the power of negative beta E sub i where beta equals one divided by k T and k is Boltzmann's constant.\nlsvc | When beta is less than zero the system becomes 'hotter than infinitely hot'. Its temperature is negative-but the higher the energy of a state, the more probable it is!\nlfgp | A system with finitely many states can reach infinite temperature. It can get even hotter, but then its temperature 'wraps around' and become negative!\ny6yk | The possibility of negative temperatures was first discussed by the physicist Lars Onsager in nineteen forty-nine, and they have been created in the lab with a variety of systems that-within some approximation-can be described as having finitely many states. In quantum theory, this happens for systems that have finite basis of 'energy eigenstates': states with well-defined energies E sub i. For example, the nucleus of an atom may have just two spin states, and if we put it in a magnetic field these will have different energies. The result is the system we studied in Puzzle twenty-five.\n477w | Here is a generalization with more energy states, all equally spaced:\nu0zj | Puzzle twenty-six. Consider a system with two N plus one states labeled by an integer n with negative N less than or equal to n less than or equal to N, where the n-th state has energy E sub n equals alpha n for some energy alpha greater than zero. Compute the Boltzmann distribution for this system at coolness beta for all beta in the real numbers. Compute the expected energy E as a function of beta. What is the qualitative difference in your result between the case of positive temperature beta greater than zero and negative temperature\nlfp7 | beta less than zero. For more, try this:\nafyz | ABSOLUTE ZERO: THE LIMIT OF INFINITE COOLNESS\nmpnc | If a system with finitely many states having energies E; is in thermal equilibrium, the probability p that it's in the i-th state is proportional to exp of negative beta E i where beta is the coolness.\num9m | In the limit of infinite coolness, beta approaches positive infinity, these probabilities go to zero except for the states of lowest energy, which all become equally probable.\nq90z | The limit beta approaches positive infinity is also the limit where T approaches zero from above, commonly called absolute zero.",
