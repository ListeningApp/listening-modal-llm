        "content": "k38m | As explained in Chapter one, one of Vera's most salient interpersonal characteristics is her high need for control. Vera attempts to direct the therapy session from the moment she meets Erika. She asks Erika numerous questions testing her expertise in the area of cancer and insists on talking about cancer treatment and rehabilitation. Moreover, she occasionally confronts Erika when she does not hear an opinion that aligns with her own. A second characteristic is Vera's hyperverbal communication style. This characteristic presents itself in Vera's constant talking during her interaction with Erika. A third characteristic is Vera's capacity for trust. She is equivocal about Erika's credibility and capacity to serve as her occupational therapist. This drives her to behave in an almost interrogational manner. Although we only have a single interaction during which to ascertain whether these characteristics are situational or enduring, we do know from Chapter one that Vera has also been described by her friends as being driven, skeptical, a talker, and strong minded. These characteristics may serve Vera in most contexts, but they have emerged as being problematic for both Vera and Erika during their initial meeting.\nnkj9 | Enduring characteristics are more deeply rooted, typically emerge repeatedly through time, and comprise an interpersonal profile that is idiosyncratic to the client.\n35a8 | Because they coexist in each client, situational and enduring characteristics are mutually informative. Behavior that reflects one's acute emotional reaction to a stressful event may temporarily attenuate, alter, or intensify one's interpersonal behavior in what are usually more stable categories. For example, a client who normally responds to a challenging situation adaptively may become irritated when the therapist recommends a more challenging activity if, earlier in that day, the client underwent a painful biopsy and then discovered she did not have enough money to cover the insurance copay fees upon leaving the physician's office. Irrespective of whether an interpersonal characteristic is situational or enduring, characteristics that are more challenging to work with make it difficult for clients to engage in occupations as planned. The rationale for distinguishing the two categories of interpersonal characteristics is to help inform therapists' understanding of the client in stressful and nonstressful situations so therapeutic responses can be appropriately tailored and modulated. Both situational and enduring client characteristics and how to assess them are described in more detail in Chapter five.\n337o | Interpersonal Events of Therapy\ncuth | An interpersonal event is a naturally occurring communication, reaction, process, task, or general circumstance that occurs during therapy and that has the potential to detract from or strengthen the therapeutic relationship. The therapist's ability to recognize the interpersonal event when it occurs and respond therapeutically determines\n09z2 | Whether additional interpersonal events will follow, possibly prompting an interpersonal event cascade\n13fv | The effect that the event, and its resolution (or non-resolution), will have on the overall relationship with the client\nv5pj | The I R M describes twelve types of interpersonal events that will inevitably occur during therapy, depending on the client, the therapist, and the therapeutic context. Table three point two presents the different event categories along with examples of what would require the therapist's closer attention.\ntrab | In the case example at the beginning of this chapter, the many nonverbal cues evident during the interaction between Mr. Johnson and Rigel were significant moments during Mr. Johnson's communication and may be interpreted as interpersonal events. Additionally, when Mr. Johnson mentioned to Rigel that it wasn't his fault that their interaction the day before was not productive, another interpersonal event occurred: an intimate self-disclosure. Mr. Johnson admitted to Rigel that he was responsible for the interaction having gone poorly.\ngrxs | Event\nu9dn | Expression of strong emotion\nt25w | Power dilemmas\nx62u | Nonverbal cues\naoc8 | Crisis points\n3mdu | Limitations of therapy\nm04v | A client needs a piece of equipment that is unavailable within the therapeutic environment.\n3aip | Contextual inconsistencies\nq3gu | The location of the therapy session changes.\ntxab | During therapy, interpersonal events such as these may be precipitated by the following circumstances.\ndov0 | A client's interpersonal characteristics or reactions to something inside or outside of the therapeutic context\nxd5o | The therapist's behavior, for example, the therapist makes a suggestion or asks a question that the client perceives as intrusive or emotionally difficult.\n3gny | These examples are only a few of the myriad possible interpersonal events that occur during the course of occupational therapy.\nws73 | When interpersonal events of therapy occur, their interpretation is a product of the client's unique set of",
