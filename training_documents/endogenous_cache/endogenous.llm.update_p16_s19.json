        "content": "79vs | Six hundred twenty-four staining of sections from hTau-KI mice stereotactically injected with i-B-E-p and contralaterally\n9bfz | Six hundred twenty-five injected with vehicle control. After stereotactic injections, animals were allowed to recover for\nlrwo | Seventy-two hours and then brains were perfused, sectioned, and stained for ThioS. We find a strong\n627 |\nvlfw | Six hundred twenty-eight vehicle controls. ThioS+ inclusions appear as flame-like inclusions in both the CA1\nfg41 | Six hundred twenty-nine pyramidal layer and the granule cell layer of the Dentate Gyrus.\nd033 | Six hundred thirty Neuroproteasome inhibition-induced flame-like ThioS+ aggregates co-localize with both\nwtvl | Six hundred thirty-one phosphorylated Tau, A-T-eight, and total Tau, D-A-nine, in single Z-plane images from\nu2qd | Six hundred thirty-two neurons in the CA1 and D-G of hippocampus. We conclude that some neuroproteasome-induced\n4kpx | Six hundred thirty-three  aggregates we observe are indeed composed of Tau. In addition to these large ThioS+ inclusions,\n634 |\n2xnd | Six hundred thirty-five widely distributed thin ThioS+ inclusions that appear dispersely throughout the i-B-E-p-injected\n8rp1 | Six hundred thirty-seven hippocampus. The ThioS+ inclusions formed following neuroproteasome\n0z93 | Six hundred thirty-six\nwe3s | Six hundred thirty-eight inhibition appear to resemble neurofibrillary tangle or neuropil thread-like\nvuhu | inclusions observed in various Tauopathies including A-D. While we find it\nq679 | Six hundred thirty-nine highly surprising that ThioS+ Tau inclusions appear just seventy-two hours after neuroproteasome\ntkda | Six hundred forty inhibition, these data support our overall conclusion that neuroproteasome inhibition induces the aggregation of endogenous Tau.\njbzr | Six hundred forty-one\n34rr | Six hundred forty-two De novo protein synthesis is required for neuroproteasome-dependent induction of\ntxr8 | Six hundred forty-three endogenous Tau aggregates\njb8d | Six hundred forty-four\ngj4l | Six hundred forty-five Neuroproteasomes are twenty-S complexes and do not have the machinery to recognize ubiquitin or\n646 |\n647 |\nx4ti | Six hundred forty-seven\nsang | Six hundred forty-nine formation of endogenous Tau aggregates. We incubated primary neuronal cultures with either\nocyy | Six hundred fifty i-B-E-p or Epoxomicin and then co-incubated these cultures with cycloheximide, which blocks\n3vef | Six hundred fifty-one translation elongation. Here, we reproduce i-B-E-p-induced Tau aggregation and find that\n9zxr | Six hundred fifty-two cycloheximide blocks this i-B-E-p-mediated increase in both W-T primary neurons and in\n653 |\n654 |\nl47i | Six hundred fifty-five\nml9u | Six hundred fifty-six sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in vivo in hTau-KI mice. We stereotactically co-injected cycloheximide\n657 |\n0ml0 | Six hundred fifty-eight decrease in sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in the hippocampus from mice co-injected with i-B-E-p and\n3f5x | Six hundred fifty-nine cycloheximide compared to those injected with i-B-E-p alone.\nkh8s | Six hundred sixty cycloheximide with i-B-E-p completely eliminated A-T-eight staining compared to contralateral\nplxa | Six hundred sixty-one injection of i-B-E-p alone. Finally, similar to what we observed with sarkosyl-insoluble\n6wac | Six hundred sixty-two Tau and A-T-eight staining, we also observe a complete return to baseline of ThioS+ staining in\nvil5 | Six hundred sixty-three hippocampi co-injected with i-B-E-p and cycloheximide relative to those injected with i-B-E-p alone.\n2s5u | Six hundred sixty-four There are many mechanisms which could explain our observation that new protein synthesis is required for the formation of neuroproteasome inhibition-induced endogenous Tau aggregates.\nk9cc | Six hundred sixty-seven\n6t52 | Six hundred sixty-eight We interpret our data and argue that neuroproteasome inhibition induces the accumulation of\n08mw | Six hundred sixty-nine newly synthesized proteins important for Tau accumulation. The most straightforward\n6iat | Six hundred seventy candidate protein would be Tau itself. To determine specifically if we observed more newly\npony | Six hundred seventy-one synthesized Tau protein following neuroproteasome inhibition, we took advantage of proximity\nspym | Six hundred seventy-two ligation assays coupled with puromycylation to visualize newly synthesized Tau\nrms6 | Six hundred seventy-three\ndwg7 | Six hundred seventy-four specific antibodies against puromycin. Each antibody is recognized by secondary antibodies\n3o8c | Six hundred seventy-five tethered to oligonucleotides that can ligate and amplify in situ. When antibodies against Tau and\nvm29 | Six hundred seventy-six puromycin are proximal to each other, this permits the oligonucleotide ligation which can be\nkwxl | Six hundred seventy-seven detected by a fluorescent signal under hybridizing conditions. A positive P-L-A signal\nkd8r | Six hundred seventy-eight therefore indicates the presence of newly synthesized Tau. We incubated Puromycin in primary\nz2jh | Six hundred seventy-nine neuronal cultures for only ten minutes, which allows us to visualize a defined short snapshot of\nnvte | Six hundred eighty newly synthesized Tau. We observe no signal in neurons either not treated with puromycin or in\n994g | Six hundred eighty-one neurons where we block protein synthesis using cycloheximide or anisomycin during\np39w | Six hundred eighty-two puromycylation, validating our approach. We observe a striking approximately three point five-fold increase\ng6k3 | Six hundred eighty-three in Puro-P-L-A-Tau signal in i-B-E-p-treated neurons relative to D-M-S-O controls. We then\n684 |\n685 |\nxmvn | Six hundred eighty-six neurons, we observe an increase in the size distribution of P-L-A puncta from i-B-E-p treated\nv2zu | Six hundred eighty-seven neurons. We find that i-B-E-p treated neurons contain an over twofold increase in newly\n688 |\n689 |\nz2nh | Six hundred ninety inhibition, consistent with our observations that neuroproteasome inhibition induces Tau\nyhx0 | aggregation.\nmi09 | Six hundred ninety-two\n15ri | Six hundred ninety-three Discussion\ndfj2 | Six hundred ninety-four\ne9bu | Six hundred ninety-five We conclude that neuroproteasome localization is differentially regulated by Apo E isoforms,\n696 |\nusfq | Six hundred ninety-seven\n4jnl | Six hundred ninety-eight neurons, as well as pathophysiology of neurodegeneration, will be critical to explore in the\nows8 | Six hundred ninety-nine future. The cell-impermeable neuroproteasome-specific inhibitors we have developed and the\nqkak | Seven hundred tools we have built to visualize and purify neuroproteasomes will enable the broad study of\nnlm3 | Seven hundred three The mechanisms by which ApoE interacts with and influences neuroproteasome localization\n704 |\nmuf5 | Seven hundred five carrier. While we demonstrate only lipidated ApoE can influence neuroproteasome\nlqjf | Seven hundred six localization, we do not understand whether the lipids transported by ApoE are involved in\n707 |\n708 |",
