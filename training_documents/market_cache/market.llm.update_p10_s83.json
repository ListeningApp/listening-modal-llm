        "content": "8p6h | What can be said about the overall trend depicted in the figure? First, it seems to us that, once adjusted for inflation, land prices in the long term are relatively 'flat' throughout-as indicated by the log curve, which shows no perceptible upward slope. The two-year moving average (which tends to 'smooth' any one particularly high or low year in the date), also shows this same mod-\npmgl | est 'cyclical' movement, with a clear sense of prices declining in the late nineteen seventies, rising again in the late nineteen eighties/early nineteen nineties to a high(-ish) point mid-decade, before declining again thereafter. Secondly, there appear to have been two notable 'spikes' in higher land prices, in nineteen ninety and again in nineteen ninety-four. Thirdly, lot prices appear to have declined significantly in real times since nineteen ninety-five/ninety-six.\n90no | It should be remembered that most colonia residents bought into these settlements during the nineteen eighties (even if they did not occupy immediately) and that they did so at a time when no services were provided or promised and before major statewide concerns began to be raised about the existence and nature of colonias. Concern and government intervention really only kicked-in as a result of the nineteen eighty-nine and nineteen ninety-one sessions of the state legislature, and then again in nineteen ninety-five which came to represent a major defining moment in legislative intervention. While this latter session led to the creation of the CRG Receivership intervention, the programme did not truly begin until nineteen ninety-seven and quickened\njt0y | from nineteen ninety-nine through to two thousand two, when most titles began to be systematically cleared.\nqb7o | Although we are confident that these trends are an accurate portrayal of land price fluctuations since the late nineteen seventies, explaining them is less straightforward. We propose three tentative conclusions: first, that overall land prices have remained consistently low because, up until nineteen ninety-five at least, unimproved lots were always sold without any firm expectation that services would be provided or that local governments would subsequently intervene one way or another to improve housing conditions. Secondly, it seems likely that the emerging publicity about colonias from nineteen eighty-nine onwards and the beginnings of the State's commitment to intervene in order to prevent their further proliferation, combined with the stated intention to explore financing means that would provide services to colonias, probably provoked a rise in the asking price from the developers and led to a more systematic (i.e. less discretionary) setting of sale prices to interested potential buyers. As Table one clearly shows, this was the high point of lot sales.\noae5 | Our third proposition arising from the data is that, although the actual number of lot sales began to decline in nineteen ninety-four, and did so sharply in nineteen ninety-five, the nineteen ninety-four/ninety-five 'spike' was also motivated by a growing awareness among potential buyers (and developers) that the supply of lots was about to decline or be severely limited altogether. It was widely known that the Texas State government was preparing to intervene in a major way, providing water and wastewater regularisation to colonias; but that the government was also about to get serious and curtail for good any further unserviced platted or unplatted development by developers. Correctly or not, many would-be colonia owners probably saw this as their last chance to break into colonia ownership, but now with the added expectancy that services would come on-line shortly thereafter. Of course, developers had even better information than did the average buyer and for them by nineteen ninety-four the storm clouds were firmly on the horizon with the threat that some developers were about to be prosecuted and might have their land developments sequestrated. It was becoming apparent that major legislation would be considered in nineteen ninety-five (to come into effect in September that year) that would tie developers' hands from further lot sales (without approved platting and servicing) and restrict their ability to sell lots under the Contract for Deed arrangement. This is precisely what happened through House Bill one thousand one and Senate Bill three hundred thirty-six in that year. Therefore, prior to enactment, developers may well have been tempted to offload their remaining lots and get out before they were prevented entirely from engaging in further lot sales.\ns0fl | However, the decline in prices that we observe post-nineteen ninety-five requires some explanation since, if there was a general expectation that services would come on-line and that colonias would become legitimate and enter the formal land market, then one would expect prices to rise-not fall. By itself, the fact that there was a sharp actual decline in sales is not surprising since after nineteen ninety-five developer sales were largely prohibited. Therefore it must be assumed that most sales in the nineteen ninety-six-\n43ia | ninety-nine period were resales (traspasos) by earlier residents/buyers. The lower prices during the later nineteen nineties may, therefore, reflect one or more of the following factors: an oversupply relative to demand after the spate of last-minute sales in nineteen ninety-three/ninety-four (described above); the moratorium on lot sales, and uncertainty about what was going to happen in Starr County colonias generally, and specifically in the CRG-intervened Rio Grande City colonias; and, the switch from a relatively consistent price-setting system on the part of one or two very experienced developers, to a more individualised price-setting by individuals who were less experienced in negotiating land sales than their developer counterparts. Specifically, 'absentee' lot owners living nearby and residents who had purchased more than one lot in the colonia, may have been inclined to sell their vacant lot holdings for fear that they would be dispossessed-if and when the CRG or government formally intervened. Whatever the reason, our data suggest a sharp decline in land prices during the period nineteen ninety-six-two thousand two.\n3g2y | Our interpretation is that this decline was due to the post-nineteen ninety-five uncertainties in the land market, rather than the anticipated impact of CRG intervention. Given the lack of data for two thousand to two thousand two when our survey ended, we cannot say how CRG involvement and the titling programme from nineteen ninety-seven onwards actually affected the operations of the land market in terms of land prices. However, we can note that the expectancy that clear title would be provided, of itself, did not appear to trigger a rise in lot values. But it may simply be too soon to tell. At the very least we do now have good baseline data against which to measure land price changes from two thousand onwards.\ngc7v | Figure two shows the mean real price per square foot. The data indicate that there is some variation over time between settlements in average prices. Las Lomas is the oldest colonia and shows generally lower prices (compared with the other selected subdivisions) during the nineteen eighties (when prices were low), with a moderate increase in the\nwqfv | nineteen nineties and a drop at the end of the period. Mike's colonia has consistently higher land prices than most settlements throughout, but also shows an increase in the mid nineteen nineties, while Share fifty-two colonia has the most dramatic 'spike' of all in the mid nineteen nineties. This alerted us to the possibility that the upward peak noted earlier in Figure one for the mid nineteen nineties may have derived from the Share fifty-two data entering the dataset at that time, but further analysis in the colonia revealed that this represented only five cases for nineteen ninety-four and nineteen ninety-five, and that excluding Share fifty-two data from the overall trend did not change the curve significantly.\nj30a | Local Survey Data and the Determinants of Land Prices",
