        "content": "mror | Process Effectiveness\nzlxc | A way of thinking that appeals to many administrators, lawyers, and political scientists treats effectiveness as a matter of the extent to which the provisions of an international regime are implemented in the domestic legal and political systems of the member states as well as the extent to which those subject to a regime's prescriptions actually comply with their requirements. This approach has the virtue of suggesting relatively straightforward procedures for measurement. It is easy enough to determine whether individual states have ratified conventions or treaties setting forth the provisions of regimes and\nk0bw | passed implementing legislation to put these provisions into practice within their own jurisdictions. An account of the extent to which such actions have led, in turn, to the promulgation of more detailed regulations designed to transform the provisions of a regime into a day-to-day routine is ordinarily feasible as well. Though monitoring compliance is apt to be a more complex process, there is little ambiguity at the conceptual level about what is at stake in such an approach to the assessment of effectiveness.\nsc5y | But what is the relationship between this conception of effectiveness as a political process centering on implementation and compliance and effectiveness in any of the previous senses? Although implementation and compliance are undoubtedly necessary to solving problems and attaining goals, the links between these measures and the other conceptions of effectiveness are far from straightforward. Perfect compliance is not sufficient to solve problems when key provisions of a regime are either inadequate or inappropriate. During the early years of the whaling regime, for example, compliance was high, but the International Whaling Commission set quotas for the harvesting of whales that were not restrictive enough to ensure the recovery of key stocks. Conversely, problem solving can occur even when levels of implementation and compliance are far from perfect. If the move to phase out the use of CFCs convinces the principal producers of these chemicals to close out their production lines and replace them with more benign substitutes, the problem of protecting the ozone layer from further damage may be effectively solved, even if some states participating in the arrangement are somewhat lax in implementing the rules of the regime. The potential for divergences between process effectiveness and behavioral effectiveness is even more apparent. Some shifts in behavior (for example, investments in advanced technologies on the part of those holding fishing permits) are clearly intended to soften the impact of a regime's rules without actually violating the rules. Other behavioral changes (for instance, increased efforts to harvest alternative species or to market unregulated chemicals) are not captured in statistics relating to implementation and compliance at all, though they may well be consequences of the establishment and operation of a regime.\n0yab | Constitutive Effectiveness\nw95z | Quite apart from its success in solving problems or facilitating the attainment of goals, a regime may be effective in constitutive terms in\n0i1k | the sense that its formation gives rise to a social practice involving the expenditure of time, energy, and resources on the part of its members. The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings and the activities they trigger, for example, have become a significant focus of attention for a number of parties even though the Antarctic regime is a rather modest international institution. The International Whaling Commission may or may not succeed in its efforts to protect stocks of certain species of whales, but participation in the political processes centered on the activities of the commission has become a major concern for countries including both the United States, which generally opposes the consumptive use of whales, and Japan and Norway, which have consistently resisted efforts to terminate consumptive use. It may well be that one of the factors that ultimately sank the regime for deep seabed mining articulated in Part Eleven of the Nineteen eighty-two Convention on the Law of the Sea was a reluctance on the part of some countries to commit themselves to a process that would have required the investment of considerable energy and resources on an ongoing basis.\ndqlg | Constitutive effectiveness differs, sometimes dramatically, from the other conceptions of effectiveness under consideration here. A social practice may flourish in the sense that it absorbs a sizable fraction of the attention and resources of those participating in it-it may even play a role in defining their identity-without becoming effective in the sense that its operation either solves the problem that stimulated its creation or attains the goals articulated by its founders. This is, in fact, a central theme of the growing literature on government or nonmarket failure treated as a counterpart to market failure. As experience with a variety of regimes dealing with the conservation or preservation of renewable resources (for example, stocks of fish or marine mammals) attests, this phenomenon is just as common in international society as it is in other social settings. Nor does the emergence of a social practice consuming significant amounts of time and energy offer any guarantee that parties will act to implement a re-\np6pq | gime's key provisions within their domestic jurisdictions or to ensure high levels of compliance with a regime's central rules. It is easy enough to find examples of this phenomenon involving natural resources and the environment; one good example is the problems of ensuring compliance with the rules of the CITES regime in a wide variety of domestic settings. But the classic examples of the phenomenon in international society undoubtedly occur in connection with regimes dealing with arms control and the protection of human rights.\np2n3 | Evaluative Effectiveness\nohh7 | For many observers, effectiveness is fundamentally a matter of performance rather than a simple measure of the consequences flowing from the operation of governance systems. Those who take this view generally do not ask whether a regime makes a difference in some generic sense. Instead, they want to know whether the regime produces results that are efficient, equitable, sustainable, or robust. Specifically, the question is not just whether the whaling regime is succeeding in its effort to conserve whale stocks but whether it is operating in a cost-effective manner in the sense that comparable results could not be achieved at a lower cost or superior results achieved at a comparable cost by substituting some other institutional arrangements. The same is true regarding the extent to which the outcomes generated by international regimes (for example, the allocation of broadcast frequencies or the distribution of benefits flowing from the harvest of fish) are just or fair, either in end-state or in procedural terms. Rapid changes involving international environmental problems (for instance, ozone depletion or climate change) have led many recent observers to place increased emphasis on adaptability to changing conditions as a performance criterion in assessing the effectiveness of regimes.\nvbni | Evaluative effectiveness taps a set of concerns that differ from\ndgcw | those underlying the conceptions above. A regime that is generally effective in solving a well-defined problem (for example, avoiding severe depletions of fish or animal stocks) may seem to many to operate in a manner that is inefficient, inequitable, or both. What is more, a regime that seems effective under current conditions may prove brittle in the face of relatively modest changes in the character of the problem (for instance, the emergence of new entrants or new harvesting technologies). If anything, the link between goal attainment and these performance criteria is even more tenuous. Although the ozone regime may set in motion a process leading relatively quickly to the phasing out of most uses of CFCs, for instance, there is ample room for questioning both the efficiency and the fairness of a process that relies on a (largely) uniform formula calling for equal percentage cuts in the consumption of CFCs. The distinction between evaluative effectiveness and constitutive effectiveness is even more dramatic. A regime is effective in the constitutive sense when it gives rise to a social practice that becomes a major focus of attention for its members. There is nothing in this conception that requires a strong performance with regard to criteria of efficiency and equity.",
