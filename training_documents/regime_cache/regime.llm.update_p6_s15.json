Additionally,\n1anr | (two point seven)\n600w | For all eta less than or equal to eta star, for all n greater than or equal to one, the supremum over t in the set of positive real numbers of the norm of e to the power of t script L sub eta script K sub n with respect to B sub n to the power of infinity is less than or equal to M sub n eta star less than positive infinity, We finally assume that for any n, n prime in the set of natural numbers, there exists m in the set of natural numbers such that script K sub n script K sub n prime in B sub m to the power of infinity. The estimates (two point five) through (two point seven) are usually obtained from Lyapunov conditions of the form\n60w7 | (two point eight)\n1a5g | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS\n0oof | for some a sub n n greater than zero and b sub n eta in the set of real numbers. After integration against psi sub eta, and making use of the invariance of psi sub eta by the dynamics,\np930 | Zero equals the integral over the set X script L sub eta script K sub n psi sub eta less than or equal to negative a sub n eta the integral over the set X script K sub n psi sub eta plus b sub n eta, so that\nxhc7 | One less than or equal to the integral over the set X script K sub n psi sub eta less than or equal to the fraction b sub n eta divided by a sub n eta. The condition (two point five) then follows from the last statement of Assumption two since, for any n greater than or equal to one, there exists C sub n greater than zero and m greater than or equal to one such that one less than or equal to script K sub n squared less than or equal to C sub n script K sub m. Condition (two point eight) also implies the existence of an invariant probability measure for any eta in the set of real numbers when a minorization condition holds. The minorization condition typically follows from a controllability argument and hypoellipticity conditions, see for instance. As for Assumption one, trajectorial ergodicity holds when the generator script L sub eta is either elliptic or hypoelliptic, and there exists an invariant probability measure with positive density with respect to the Lebesgue measure.\n6a60 | We need an assumption in our analysis on the generator script L sub zero of the reference dynamics, which will be useful when stating some technical results later on.\ndfgj | ASSUMPTION THREE (Stability of smooth functions by inverse operators). The space script S is stable by the generator script L sub zero, and script L sub zero and script L sub zero star are invertible on script S sub zero. This means that, for any phi in script S sub zero, there exists a unique solution Psi in script S sub zero to the Poisson equation\n6ptp | Negative script L sub zero Psi equals phi.
