However, tide range less than five meters that occurred one and two days prior to the stranding days were both significantly associated with stranding events (P equals zero point zero one three, chi-squared statistic equals six point one five eight, one degrees of freedom for both one and two day lags). This result indicates that strandings were significantly more likely to follow days of small tidal range than those of larger tidal ranges. However, as shown in Figure four, not all stranding events occurred on days which followed smaller than average tide ranges.\n0b39 | Water temperature increased from twenty point five to twenty-eight point five degrees Celsius over the two-month period from early August until late October. The most significant change was during September water temperatures of Cable Beach increasing from twenty-four degrees Celsius to twenty-seven degrees Celsius between twenty-eight August and twenty-nine September. Chlorophyll-a levels of Cable Beach were low (zero point four to zero point five milligrams per cubic meter) from four August to four September and then increased to one point three to one point five milligrams per cubic meter as chlorophyll-a levels increased first in Roebuck Bay and south and north to Cable Beach and beyond. Winds\nqecd | were easterly on average from four to nineteen August before shifting south-westerly to westerly between twenty August and four September. Winds were again easterly from four to twelve September before shifting westerly to south-westerly between thirteen September and six October. From seven October, winds were variable but predominantly southerly and south-westerly before turning westerly again from fifteen to twenty-two October. From twenty-three to thirty October, winds were again variable from the south and west. Among the thirty-five days that satellite wind data were available during the fifty-eight-day period analysed (twenty-four August to twenty October), seven of eleven (sixty-three point six percent) of strandings occurred when winds were blowing onshore (north-west through to southwest). However, the direction of the wind (all four quadrants compared) was not significantly associated with jellyfish strandings on the days they occurred P equals zero point four three two, chi-squared statistic equals two point seven five one, three degrees of freedom. Neither was it significantly associated with wind direction one or two days prior to strandings P equals zero point nine two one, chi-squared statistic equals zero point four nine one, three degrees of freedom and P equals zero point four one three, chi-squared statistic equals two point eight six seven, three degrees of freedom respectively despite ninety point nine percent of strandings occurring when winds were blowing onshore (north-west through to south-west) with a two-day time lag. It is likely that the small sample size which was affected by the absence of wind data from twenty-three of the days during the period of observation during which time there were eight stranding events. During the fifty-eight days, twelve of nineteen (sixty-three point two percent) of strandings occurred when currents flowed onshore. However, current direction (all four quadrants compared) was not significantly associated with jellyfish strandings on the days they occurred P equals zero point eight six three, chi-squared statistic equals zero point seven four one, three degrees of freedom or one or two days prior to strandings P equals zero point two nine zero, chi-squared statistic equals three point seven four eight, three degrees of freedom and P equals zero point five zero one, chi-squared statistic equals two point three six three, three degrees of freedom respectively. Logistic regression analysis reinforced the importance of tide range as a predictor of strandings. The strongest individual predictor was tide range two days before strandings P equals zero point zero zero nine, see Table one, and the next best was current direction, also with a two-day lag. Wind direction was a worse predictor than either tide or current. The best logistic regression model which combined the two predictors of tide range (two-day lag) and wind speed (two-day lag) provided only slight improvement in the fit over tide range alone according to Aikaike's Information Criteria (AIC) (Table one). The Bayesian Information Criteria (Shwartz's BIC) did not show any improvement in the model fit when tide range and wind speed were combined (Table one).\n1o7p | This difference in model selection is easily explained by the way that Shwartz's BIC penalises attempts to improve model fit simply by an exhaustive exercise of adding more parameters and in analyses with small sample sizes such as ours. For this reason, Shwartz's BIC is favoured by some statisticians. Nevertheless, the improvement gained by the inclusion of current direction P equals zero point zero one eight or wind speed with tide range in the model P equals zero point zero zero eight was slight, and the difference in wind speed between jellyfish stranding days (with a two day lag) and other days was negligible (means of eleven point seven kilometers per hour, standard deviation equals three point six and twelve point eight kilometers per hour, standard deviation equals three point two, respectively). Both the univariate and multivariate approaches reinforced the importance of tide range as an important predictor of strandings. Neither of the two approaches found wind or current direction as a significant predictor of strandings.\ncp13 | Size frequency and individual biomass",
