Only two 'bilinear' scenarios can generate the Kok effect with an abrupt transition point. The 'continuously\nbfax | m to the negative two s to the negative one; R sub d text and A, micromol m to the negative two s to the negative one.

For an 'accelerating decrease' scenario, R sub d was also progressively suppressed by light, but this scenario generated an A-Labs curve where the slope did not decrease but increased, thereby being unable to reproduce the Kok curve. Finally, an 'abrupt suppression' scenario cannot be ruled out, but this scenario generated two linear discontinued segments with the same slope, thereby being unable to reproduce the Kok effect either.\no7qm | As illustrated, the difference in scenarios also has implications for the estimation of Phi sub C O two. Only in the second 'bilinear' scenario and the abrupt-suppression scenario can Phi sub C O two be reliably estimated by the Kok method as the slope of the A minus I sub abs curve above the break point. For other scenarios, the slope represents the combined yield of photosynthesis and of the component of light suppression of R sub four. In fact, it is the scenario of Fig. three-c that the Kok method relies on to estimate R sub d and\nd52l | Phi sub C O two. The observed Kok effect across various O sub two and C O sub two concentrations and various temperatures\nqlbb | Linear plots of A versus I sub abs using our experimental data identified the Kok break point in each curve. The maximum values of the slope below (phase one, b sub one) and above the break point (phase two, b sub two) were achieved at two percent O two, and were zero point zero nine five and zero point zero nine zero mol mol inverse, respectively, similar to experimentally measured or theoretically inferred Phi sub C O two for C sub three species under nonphotorespiratory conditions. A change in the slope from phase one to phase two became more significant with\nnhsg | increasing O two concentrations, with decreasing C O two concentrations, and with increasing temperature. The b sub one to b sub two ratio increased from one point zero six at two percent O two to one point six nine at fifty percent O sub two, from one point zero seven at seven hundred micromol mol inverse C O two to one point eight three at one hundred micromol mol inverse C O two, and from one point one zero at fifteen degrees Celsius to greater than one point three zero at thirty to thirty-five degrees Celsius.\nhy0l | Similarly, the difference in the estimated respiration for phase one and phase two, denoted as r sub d one and r sub d two, respectively, became more significant with increasing O sub two concentrations, decreasing C O two concentrations, and increasing temperature. With the estimated b sub one, b two, r sub d one and r sub d two, the irradiance for the Kok break point, I sub abs, t can be calculated, and it varied from seven to",
