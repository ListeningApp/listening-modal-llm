        "content": "svhz | Kleinridders et al. reported that brain/neuron insulin receptor knockout mice show age-dependent depressive and anxious behavior due to impaired mitochondrial function and increased dopamine turnover by monoamine oxidase, which is normally suppressed by insulin. Insulin receptor knock-out in glial cells, in turn, reduces ATP exocytosis, resulting in decreased purinergic signaling on dopamine neurons and subsequently anxiety- and depressive-like behavior. Mechanistically, a subsequent hyperdopaminergic state within the amygdala is probably responsible for the increase in anxiety observed in insulin-resistant and diabetic rats. Interestingly, down-regulation of the insulin receptor in the hypothalamus can also induce depressive-like behavior in rodents indicating that insulin signaling in the hypothalamus might also affect dopamine signaling in the midbrain.\noaen | Four point two. Therapeutic approaches targeting insulin pathways\n5u67 | Based on the molecular evidence for the role of impaired insulin signaling in the development of depressive and anxious symptoms, these behavioral changes respond to treatments altering metabolic state and/or dopamine signaling: In insulin receptor knockout mice depressive and anxious behavior is reversed by monoamine oxidase inhibitors. In STZ-induced diabetes, depressive symptoms were reduced by insulin therapy, with some (but not all) studies indicating the same impact on anxiety. Furthermore, physical activity and food restriction, as well as the insulin sensitizers rosiglitazone or pioglitazone alleviated depressive-like behavior in insulin-resistant rodents. Despite these promising animal results, the therapeutic link between insulin, dopamine and depression has hardly been examined in humans. Mansur et al. demonstrated that being overweight moderated the association between reduced effort spending, which is dopamine-dependent, and major depressive disorder. Moreover, a single intranasal insulin administration has been shown to improve mood in overweight/obese women without psychiatric conditions. Equally, repeated administration of intranasal insulin across eight weeks improved mood in obese and normal-weight participants without depression. Furthermore, diabetes and overweight attenuate the responsiveness to classical antidepressants and adjunctive therapies that enhance insulin sensitivity including both lifestyle, exercise and dietary intervention improve antidepressant treatment response, even if peripheral insulin resistance is not used for treatment stratification. A similar effect has been reported for adjunctive therapy with\ndvms | insulin sensitizers. Moreover, in the state of insulin resistance, different classes of antidepressants show distinct treatment efficacy and suppressing or enhancing effects on blood glucose levels and body weight indicating that the choice of antidepressant therapy should be influenced by the metabolic state. However, clinical trials targeting this question are still lacking. Overall, current data regarding the association between antidepressant-specific mechanism-of-action and effects on metabolic state and depressive symptoms remain inconclusive but imply that SSRIs might have the best anti-depressive effect in the state of insulin resistance and have a beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity.\nqrd3 | Notably, altered dopamine signaling is only one potential pathway that links insulin resistance and depression. There are several other factors that contribute to this bidirectional link including impairments in serotonergic transmission, HPA-axis, neurogenesis, neuro-inflammation, opioid-mediated pathways, gut microbiome and gut-brain signaling, which are important, but beyond the scope of this review. Nevertheless, these presented findings are collectively of high preclinical relevance as they point toward a metabolic subtype of depression, in which increased insulin resistance might function as a state marker. Targeting insulin resistance in depression might serve as an important avenue toward a personalized medicine approach in psychiatry.\nrxrg | Five. Conclusions\ntf43 | Overall, dopamine signaling in the midbrain and consequently the dopamine encoded reward behavior is modulated by insulin signaling. The effect of insulin on dopamine release, turn-over, and firing rate might seem contradictory at first glance, but this is due to the differential effects of insulin on the somato-dendritic spines in the midbrain and the axonal terminals in the striatum. Different rodent models of insulin resistance have provided clear evidence that insulin resistance leads to altered dopamine signaling and impaired reward behavior. This might represent one critical mechanism in the bidirectional link between insulin resistance and depression. Hence, a detailed molecular understanding of the regulation of dopamine signaling by insulin will lay the basis for therapeutic advances in the metabolic treatment of depressive disorders.\nfcco | Funding",
