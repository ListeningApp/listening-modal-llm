You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

s2v8 | 'Who are the people most notorious in your realm for their envy and inflexibility?' Arif asked.
m2uh | 'The dyers of wool and cloth' said the King. 'Each one thinks that he is a master-dyer, and that his techniques and knowledge are the best. These men combine with one another very seldom, and then generally only to oppose the occasional intruder or minor dyer trying to rise in the profession.'
erho | 'Very well' said Arif; 'cause it to be announced to the dyers that the world's greatest master of their art is coming to take up his abode in your capital city.'
bpnq | When the dyers heard the talk of this possibility spread through- out the city, and were shown samples of Arif the Master Dyer's work, which was magnificent, they went into transports of rage. So bitterly did they begin to hate their unknown rival that it very soon became obvious to almost everyone else that powerful emo- tion, not justice or fidelity to their craft, lay behind their vicious, bitter and often irrational denunciations of the interloper.
3xla | Now the people of the country in general whom the dyers had
fs5q | 184
pse2 | not educated in distinguishing between a good dye-or dyer- and a bad one, heard the attacks, saw the rage, observed the frenzies. Indeed, it was next to impossible for them to avoid these things. And the main effect which the dyers could achieve, though this was of course not what they sought, was to get the name of Arif the Demon on every lip.
rc6c | When Arif at last entered the town, the whole population flocked to see him. He lived quietly and with dignity among the people, who were unable to find the treachery, ignorance and evils which they had been warned against, and consequently began to conclude that they had themselves been deceived about Arifs character. Their acceptance of him, and its acceleration, were correspondingly great. Their contempt for the dyers was equally complete. People not only began to take all their dyeing to Arif, but, as in all the best tales, he inherited the kingdom as well.
batl | Much hp-service is paid to the idea that people should not be envious of others, and many people believe that they are not jealous and that they do not oppose others. In fact the reverse is the case, and much of ordinary life uses envy as its fuel. You may recall the saying that there are three things which every individual considers to be attributable only to others: (i) lack of a sense of humour; (2) bad driving; (3) jealousy.
cbqc | The planning which Sufis do, which is unfamiliar in fact if not in theory in current cultures, is contained in the saying of DÃ±un'nun the Egyptian, quoted by Khwaja Gharib Nawaz:
h0lb | 'Sufis are those who have expunged from their minds the human tendencies of envy and enmity.'
87w1 | I cannot forbear from saying, though, that there are many things expressed in current cultural terms which are of the greatest importance to people who want to understand the Sufi way. Some of them may be indicated for people before they can go beyond their present contexts, as you seem to want to do. Most of the people who want 'esoteric knowledge' do not bother about the basic exoteric senses which come first. In the following tale, the first two pieces of advice could have been given to the tense 'seeker' by anyone. He did not need a Sufi:
7mw9 | 185
c5q7 | MISTAKEN IDENTITY
nbs7 | A certain 'seeker after Truth' rushed into the house which had been pointed out to him as that of the Eastern sage. He grabbed the hand of the figure seated on a prayer-rug and begged for advice.
tiyt | I have three things to tell you,' said the other man. First, you are too excited to understand anything. Second, you are standing on my foot. Third, I am a servant-the Sage lives next door!'
tiha | 186
816q | Method, System and Conditioning
ir95 | THERE are four factors which, when applied upon human beings, 'programme' them like machines. These are the factors which are used in indoctrination and conditioning. By their use, deliberate or otherwise, self-applied or otherwise, the human mind is made more mechanical, and will tend to think along stereotyped lines.
0ypu | Innumerable experiments, recent and ancient, have fully verified the presence and effect of these factors. They are: tension alter- nating with relaxation, sloganisation and repetition.
1ic0 | Because most human beings are trained to accept these factors as part of their 'learning' process, almost everything which is presented to a human being to be learned is generally converted by him into material which he applies by these methods.
rxkz | The test of a teaching system, and of its success, is whether (i) it is applied by these methods, knowingly or otherwise; (2) it develops into a system which uses these methods.
5va3 | In the various groupings of people engaged in this kind of teaching whom I have contacted during the past few years, vir- tually none is free from this element or these factors. The result is that one set of slogans has been changed for another: and phrases like 'man is asleep', words like 'essence', certain exercises and techniques as well as literary material, have been studied so closely and so diligently that they have succeeded in the main only in indoctrination. Their instrumental effect is spent.
iqdo | It is mainly for this reason that tradition repeatedly says that the formulation must change in accordance with the people, the place and the Work.
6rzq | It is extremely easy to test the individuals who have developed (through no fault of their own) this ('conditioned-reflex') response to work-terms and other teaching stimuli. Such people always respond in a typical manner to approaches made to them, and in this respect they do not differ from people who have been in- doctrinated into any static and linear system: political, patriotic,
rjyh | 187
64js | economic, religious, philosophical, where the extra dimension of understanding is weak or absent.
84do | There is, however, a saving grace. This is that if we retrace our position to the point just before the learning and teaching became 'established' as a conditioning in the mind of the individuals, we can reclaim the flexibility which the work demands. The methods used to do this, however, are not ones which are familiar to most people.
n581 | You have to be able to understand before you can verify.
xjjq | People ordinarily do not reach deeply enough into themselves to find out how to learn about what Sufis call Reality. They make premature assumptions about how to learn, and what attracts them must be good, and so on, which in the end defeats their putative purpose.
ozp5 | THE LIMBLESS FOX
df15 | In the Bostan of Saadi there is the tale of the man who once saw a limbless fox and wondered how it managed to be so well- fed. Deciding to watch it, he found that it had positioned itself where a lion brought its kill. After eating, the lion would go away, and the fox would eat its leavings. So the man decided to allow fate to serve him in the same way. Sitting down in a street and waiting, all that happened was that he became more and more weak and hungry, for nobody and nothing took any interest in him.
tuu3 | Eventually a voice spoke and said: 'Why should you behave like a lamed fox? Why should you not be a lion, so that others might benefit from your leavings?'
4lo0 | This story is itself an interesting test. One sometimes finds that it encourages people with a desire to teach to set themselves up as teachers, and enables others, who are more humble, to rearrange their ideas, so that they can learn first, no matter what they readily imagine about being able to teach and benefit others before getting their own focus right.
yskz | Everything man needs is in the world. How does he use it? Think of the Eastern proverb: 'God provides the food, men provide the cooks.'

ihhb | Western Culture
xvgt | Q: Why are you critical of Westem culture?
k2yr | A: The answer, simply, is that I am not really 'critical' of it in the way that I think you mean. You must bear three things in mind when you ask this kind of question, or risk nobody ever bothering to answer it at all: -
y5vm | 1. You have to have some facts to back it up, either specifics or general facts, either to support your question or to get a productive reply.
graj | 2. You have to realise that the modern world in which we at the moment Uve, is very widely suffused with 'Western culture', and that therefore it is almost impossible to miss it if one is critical about almost anything. It is like say- ing: 'Why do you kill millions of innocent beings - bacteria -everytime you breathe in?' The one may be incidental to the other.
stgo | 3. This question is being asked, and answered, in a Western country, a part of Western culture, where, because of that culture, agonising self-appraisals, criticism and reproach almost ad in- finitum have been standard behaviour for a considerable period and without which-if you only listen and read what surrounds you - life would perhaps come to a halt.
r4hn | If there is any really good reason for criticising 'Western culture' as such, it is that one should deplore its failure to nurture and maintain not the criticism on which it constantly prides itself, but the clear-thinking which, say, the Greeks - supposedly Westerners -had, and which should have been passed to you, to enable you to answer this question for yourself, thus saving time and effort, and using mental capacity for something a little more ad- vanced.
7nts | Western people, whatever their ideology, spend much time in the engineering of belief, conviction, commitment - they keep changing the name, but the process is the same. I call it not criti-
68kv | cal, but descriptive, to mention this, and to offer the remedy: in the saying: 'When you are most convinced: that is the rime to use caution about your certainty.'
0b1o | Western culture, like any other culture, could well take to heart this ancient Eastern saying: 'However useful a garment, it is not for eating.'
xogx | 190
cusa | The Western Tradition
yrit | Q: Can we have tales and illustrations from the Western tradi- tion which illustrate or make available the kind of knowledge which is so often quoted from the East?
xwzi | A: You can certainly have such examples, but the problem is that the understanding of the example has, in the West, generally been trivialised - 'give a dog a bad name and hang it'. There are many jokes and stories in Western literature and folklore which may be employed in the development of wisdom. But the conven- tion has been to write them up as short stories, or to laugh at their funny side'. As a result, people are inoculated against the effect which they could have in provoking insights.
7rjv | Q: Why has this not happened to Eastern literature?
daj4 | A: Because the concept of the 'pearl within the (banal) shell' has been constantly repeated and kept alive. Interestingly enough, the concept has been stressed sufficiently often in the Western trans- lations and repetitions of these stories to insist on this element being maintained as a hypothetical possibility. This insistence that the oyster may contain a pearl, in place of merely selling oysters, as it were, makes it possible for the Western man to look for this content in stories which have an Eastern flavour, when he would not tolerate it in a Western story.
dt0u | Q: Is there a ready example?
iroe | THE HERO HUSBAND
m9bf | A: Take the tale of the woman who would not marry a man because 'he was not successful'. She said she wanted a hero for a husband. He went to Africa and became a world-famous explorer. When he came back to claim her, she said that she had married in
44d4 | 191
5rgr | the meantime. He demanded to know who the paragon was who had won her, so that he himself might pay homage to such a man. She confessed: 'He is only the professional at the golf club up the road'. This was made into a wry short story by a Western writer. Its depth, wisdom and sheer power is obscured by the local Western habit of looking only for 'pay-off lines', humour as humour, characterisation, plot, climax, and anti-climax, and so on.
a1gl | In this process, other values of the story have been lost. But if it were put in an Eastern setting, even Western audiences might see something of great instructional value in it. And there are dozens more of this kind.
vxin | Most, but not all, of the word-artefacts formerly current in the West have thus been appropriated by shallow word-smiths or occultists. But some remain, and much more can be retrieved.
vj4s | TALE OF AN EAR
x4c3 | The materials are often to be found in the West, in encounters, in jokes and tales, in events. But the skill in using them is not there, though it can be developed.
jhyp | One of the basic Sufi needs is to enable people to see themselves as they really are, and to clear away imaginings about what they are or what they think they are doing. Here is a Western anecdote, good enough for a Sufi demonstration-tale:
1dwr | A man went to the Van Gogh exhibition in New York. The place was so jammed with people that he could not get near the pictures. He went away and carved an ear from corned beef, then framed it and returned to hang it on the exhibition wall marked: 'Ear of Van Gogh'.
0acx | The crowds surrounded this object, thus allowing the true art- lover to see the paintings, and showing that they were themselves there only for sensation.
9ejb | In a Sufi context, this tale would have been used both to point out the difference between aesthetics and emotion and also for the participants to see themselves as they really were.
3dzn | In the West, however, such tales are usually employed only as jokes: enabling the hearer to feel amused, and perhaps relieved,
tnh4 | 192
cn2s | that he was not there; or superior because others had been 'de- ceived' successfully.
seh0 | It is interesting to reflect that, while the Westerner wants to know if there are traditions in his own history which will help him, the Easterner will tend to want to know whether the material will help him, wherever it comes from.
l0vz | I am reminded of the old saying: The child remarks, 'That hawk is white', while the adult asks 'How sharp are its talons?'
ko4g | And I hope that we do not forget, while we are on this subject, that most of the most prized traditions in the West are derived, and not without pride, from the Middle East, and especially the Eastern Mediterranean ...

qo5h | How does the Sufi Teach?
vg7d | Q: Sufis do not teach by 'stereotypes', as you often say. How does the Sufi teach?
768z | A: The Sufi teacher has the task of communicating his message and reality. He has to reduce, not increase, the effect of his own personality, in favour of content.
8ant | A test of the suitability of a student is to find out whether he can set aside the fixation upon a technique, person or school - and make himself open to receive a comprehensive teaching.
ub5e | The Sufi teacher's mission is to be in the service of those who can learn. He does not exist to please or to displease anyone. To accord with the preconceptions of others as to appearances is irrelevant to his functions: though not necessarily, as Ibn Arabi reminds us, to his social viability.
ec6h | He works in accordance with the prospects of his students and the possibility of maintaining the continuation of the community of Sufis.
w6yy | He does not hand out formulas nor does he insist upon the performance of mechanical procedures. His knowledge, on the contrary, makes it possible for him to prescribe apposite studies for suitable people, at an indicated time, in the proper place.
