o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ousl | DNA methylation in the mammalian germline undergoes two reprogramming events, in which existing DNA methylation is largely eliminated (reviewed in [29]). In mouse zygotes, maternal and paternal genomes show two distinct demethylation patterns upon staining with a 5mC-recognizing antibody. The paternal genome rapidly loses 5mC signal (6-8 hours after fertilization) while the maternal genome gradually reduces methylation dur- ing cleavage-stage development [30,31]. The overall loss of DNA methylation is associated with reduction of repressive chromatin. The molecular mechanism of 5mC loss entails oxidation into 5- hydroxymethyl cytosine (5hmC) by TET dioxygenase and base excision repair (reviewed in [32]). Active paternal DNA demethy- lation in the zygote is found in many mammals, but is not entirely conserved [33-35] and is incomplete [36]. Apart from imprinted loci, which retain their parent-of-origin methylation pattern in imprinting control regions, intracisternal A-particle (IAP), an active murine endogenous retrovirus also remains methylated despite global demethylation [37].
m4ju | Histone modifications offer a system for recording additional information concerning the histone-associated DNA. Functionality of key histone modifications is more conserved across eukaryotic kingdoms than DNA methylation (reviewed in [28]). The "histone code" has many roles including regulation of transcription and DNA repair (reviewed in [38,39]). Importantly, some histone marks are generated because of a specific event (e.g. transcription, DNA dam- age), but are not maintained and do not constitute a true epigenetic mark per se.
a0mb | A detailed catalogue of histone modification dynamics during OET has been provided elsewhere [18,40]. A growing number of chromatin factors has been implicated in establishing the correct epigenetic landscape, including polycomb-mediated gene silencing [41] or histone demethylase KDM1A associated with gene activa- tion or repression in a context-dependent manner [42,43]. Recent advances in analysis of global chromatin architecture allowed also for exploring genome-wide distribution of histone marks, chro- matin accessibility and global chromatin architecture during early development [44-47].

km8w | A notable feature of chromatin remodeling during OET is reduc- tion of parental heterochromatin prior to ZGA. As mentioned above, most paternal histone modifications, including heterochromatin marks, are almost completely erased during spermatogenesis. Maternal heterochromatin histone marks are also reduced after fertilization in mice. H4K20me3 and H3K64me3 are rapidly lost by the 2-cell stage [48,49] and H3K9me3 is reduced in pericen- tric heterochromatin up to the 8-cell stage [41]. These patterns suggest that removal of parental heterochromatin marks is part of the reprogramming process that results in totipotent blastomeres. The pattern is also consistent with the open chromatin structure observed during early development [50,51 ] and reminiscent of the chromatin structure observed in pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESC) [50,52].
wzno | Spatially distinct genome organization was observed using a single-nucleus, high-resolution chromosome conformation cap- ture (Hi-C) in paternal and female pronuclei during mouse OET [47]. Notably, the maternal genome was not segregated into active and inactive compartments (possibly due to inactive transcription in the extended G1 phase) suggesting that its compartmentalization in zygotes is established de novo. In contrast, there was weak, but significant, compartmentalization of the paternal genome which was either rapidly established de novo or inherited from sperm chromatin [47].
xagm | 5. The onset of ZGA in mouse zygotes - the minor ZGA
iwn5 | Mice have the earliest known onset of ZGA among mammals with new RNA transcripts detected in mouse zygotes as early as ~7 h after pronucleus formation [53-55] (Fig. A); a more sensi- tive analysis could possibly detect transcription even earlier. Male pronuclei produce more RNA than female pronuclei [53]. The dif- ference historically has been ascribed to the chromatin remodeling in the male pronucleus that is associated with protamine/histone exchange [56]. This remodeling could provide an opportunity for maternal transcription factors to associate preferentially with the male pronuclear DNA [53].
uooz | The nature of the initial transcription (minor ZGA) at the 1-cell stage has been unclear. Promiscuous or random transcription is supported by the observations that in 1-cell mouse embryos, repet- itive elements such as B2-containing sequences [57] or MuERV-L [58] are expressed. In addition, plasmid-borne reporter gene expression does not require an enhancer for robust expression in 1-cell embryos, whereas an enhancer is required for robust expression in 2-cell embryos [59]. However, apart from detection of MuERV-L retrotransposon transcripts at the late 1-cell stage [58], RNAs produced during minor ZGA could not be detected by microarrays [60,61]. Thus, either minor ZGA did not produce mRNAs or their abundance was too low to be detected by these technologies.
pxbq | NGS analysis of polyA RNA, which can detect low-abundant and unannotated transcripts, documented hundreds of potential minor ZGA mRNAs [15,62,63]. However, whether these mRNAs reflected transcription or de novo polyadenylation that occurs in fertilized eggs [64] was unclear. This issue could be avoided by using total RNA for NGS. Indeed, comparison of published total RNA and polyA RNA NGS data in oocytes and early embryos indi- cates that polyadenylation of maternal mRNAs could be confused with transcriptional activation (Fig. B). Two NGS studies of total RNA addressed the nature of transcripts produced during the minor wave of ZGA [63,65]. One sequenced total RNA (depleted of ribosomal RNA) and identified ~600 genes whose expression was up-regulated >1.5 fold between oocyte and 1-cell stage. The other sequenced total RNA and observed transcription within ~4000 genes. Altogether, NGS data document that the first wave of
jfsr | zygotic transcription is relatively promiscuous, low-level, genome- wide, and produces transcripts that are inefficiently spliced and polyadenylated [63,65].
u15r | Low level, genome-wide transcription that is both inter- and intragenic implies that transcription in 1-cell zygotes only requires minimal promoter features [66]. However, minor ZGA transcrip- tion exhibits some selectivity in that oocyte-specific genes are not transcribed. It has been proposed that minor ZGA could be "primed" by the sperm because >300 minor ZGA transcripts are also expressed in sperm, but not in parthenogenetic embryos [63]. However, only a few highly expressed testis-specific genes are detected during minor ZGA and bioinformatic analysis shows that transcription of many genes, known to be expressed during major ZGA, already can be detected during minor ZGA [65]. This implies that transcription factors controlling gene expression specifically during oocyte's growth phase are replaced by the 1-cell stage with transcription factors controlling embryonic genome activa- tion. Elimination of maternal factors (as documented, for example, for NOBOX [67]) would explain the lack of expression of maternal transcripts and expression of major ZGA genes. The promiscuous transcription would then reflect increased accessibility of poten- tial (cryptic) promoters to the available transcription factors. As chromatin structures further matures, this accessibility would be lost and the cryptic promoters would not be engaged.
lq35 | Another feature of murine minor ZGA is reduced efficiency of splicing and polyadenylation. Spliced transcripts and some degree of termination is detected near the polyA signal [65] and it thus appears that efficiency, rather than specific mechanisms, sup- presses processing of nascent transcripts. It may be that the splicing machinery in 1-cell pronuclei has limited capacity that would be overwhelmed by nascent transcripts in pronuclei with chro- matin highly permissive for transcription. The relaxed control of splicing and polyadenylation correlates with absent nuclear speck- les in 1-cell embryos [65] and disassembly of nuclear speckles is associated with reduced pre-mRNA splicing [68]. While this could explain inefficient processing of nascent transcripts in the larger male pronucleus with its "naïve" chromatin structure, it is unclear how the same would apply to the female pronucleus, where protamine-histone exchange does not occur. However, NGS analysis of parthenogenetic zygotes [63,65] implies that inefficient splicing exists also in female pronuclei.
3g9w | The significance of minor ZGA in mouse zygotes remains unclear. Why would the zygote produce nascent transcripts across the genome that would be inefficiently processed? Inefficient post- transcriptional processing could have a protective role against mis-expression of genes that would compromise development. This could also explain, at least in part, the uncoupling of transcrip- tion and translation observed for plasmid-borne reporter genes in 1-cell embryos [69]. It is also possible that some transcripts among genes transcribed in 1-cell embryos are efficiently spliced and translated into functional proteins important for continued development. Notably, low splicing efficiency would favor pro- tein expression from intron-less genes - in fact, a cluster of intron-less double homeobox genes recently has been implicated in ZGA [70-72]. Investigation of intron-less genes transcribed during minor ZGA is thus one research direction that could shed more light of the significance of minor ZGA. Finally, as transcription itself is required for some cellular processes, e.g., genomic imprinting [73], it should be considered that pioneering transcription itself (i.e. not its products) helps to remodel the chromatin during minor ZGA to set the stage for reprogramming gene expression during major ZGA. This notion resonates with the above-mentioned HiC data show- ing male pronucleus compartmentalization into active and inactive compartments that aligns with H4 hyperacetylation [47], which was known to accumulate rapidly in the male pronucleus [74].

ylhz | 6. The major ZGA in mouse zygotes
a3td | Major ZGA in mouse zygotes takes place during the 2-cell stage and results in a dramatic change in gene expression. While mater- nal mRNA degradation can be viewed as an oocyte identity-erasing mechanism, major ZGA is a zygotic identity-generating mecha- nism. This transition is manifested in transcriptome similarities among different stages of OET. Transcriptome profiling by microar- rays as well as NGS documents an oocyte-like identity of the 1-cell transcriptome while the 2-cell stage transcriptome profile is shift- ing to that of the later preimplantation stages (Fig. ). This shift reflects loss of oocyte-like identity through maternal mRNA degra- dation and accumulation of a novel zygotic transcriptome which conveys cellular totipotency.
ex5k | Importantly, minor and major ZGA differ not only in the volume of transcription, but also in what is transcribed, i.e., the major wave of ZGA is not simply more of the same transcripts expressed during minor ZGA [63,65]. The estimates of genes transcribed during major ZGA vary according to filtering conditions. For example, microarray profiling of mouse early embryos identified ~3000 @-amanitin- sensitive genes in 2-cell embryos [61]. The bulk of transcription (RNA synthesis) in 2-cell embryos occurs in its long G2 phase (Fig. A). A small population of genes activated during major ZGA continue their expression in 2-cell embryos, but become silenced upon establishment of transcriptionally-repressive chromatin at the end of the 2-cell stage. NGS, however, documents that microar- rays underestimate the number of expressed genes because arrays lack many non-annotated genes while NGS has the sensitivity to detect low abundant transcripts. In addition, single-cell sequenc- ing of hybrid zygotes suggested existence of stochastic monoallelic expression and de novo activation of the paternal <LATEX>X</LATEX> chromosome [62]. In any case, ZGA and reprogramming gene expression entails thousands, not hundreds, of genes.
9d4o | 7. Minor and major ZGA in mammals - common and species-specific features
cjq2 | The minor/major ZGA concept developed in mouse zygotes can- not be generalized for all mammals. Human and bovine embryos undergo ZGA several cleavage divisions later (4-16 cells), although NGS data suggest that transcription could initiate earlier than previ- ously thought [14,15]. Expression profiling of 2-cell mouse zygotes identified >3000 major ZGA genes [61-63]. Profiling early bovine development identified ~ 100 transcripts up-regulated at the 4- cell stage and ~1000 and ~1300 transcripts up-regulated at the 8-cell and 16-cell stages, respectively [14]. Profiling of human early development identified ~2500 genes whose expression increased between 4-cell and 8-cell stages [75]. According to another study, human ZGA occurs in three waves, with ~2000 genes up-regulated between 2-cell and 4-cell embryos ("early risers"), ~1500 genes up-regulated between 4-cell and 8-cell embryos ("middle risers"), and ~1400 genes up-regulated after 8-cell ("late risers") [76].
5esx | It might seem that with more sensitive analysis, the ZGA timing in other mammals would shift into earlier stages and the minor ZGA could occur as early as in mice. In fact, Xue et al. reported minor ZGA in human 1-cell embryos [15]. However, there are two arguments against this possibility. First, some of the evidence for early human genome activation is possibly an experimental artifact, especially when the analysis is restricted to polyA RNA (Fig. B). Second, the whole transcription correlation data paint a different picture when comparing mice with human or bovine early embryos (Fig.)
m5ka | The mouse model is exceptional in that minor and major ZGA produce distinct sets of RNAs that are separated by the cleavage between 1-cell to 2-cell embryos. This can be visualized as a dif- ference in developmental stage transcriptome correlations when
