        "content": "0myz | A pMMO/MDH supercomplex would provide a direct pathway for methanol produced at the proposed dicopper active site in the pMMO pmoB subunit to the active site of MDH where it is oxidized to formaldehyde. In addition, such a complex could directly provide reducing equivalents to pMMO through the cytochrome c sub L, the electron acceptor of MDH. Another and perhaps more widely accepted electron source for pMMO involves ubiquinol generated by a type two NADH: quinone oxidoreductase. In support of this pathway, NADH is an effective reductant for membrane-bound pMMO, but duroquinol is the only reductant that is effective after detergent solubilization. Duroquinol may mimic the function and redox potential of endogenous quinols, and it is known that methanotrophs produce a range of ubiquinones, but not menaquinone. Moreover, addition of NADH and NDH-2 to purified pMMO samples leads to a modest increase in propylene epoxidation activity. NDH-2 and pMMO can be copurified, but there is no evidence that they form a specific protein-protein complex. Finally, in M. capsulatus Bath, a cytoplasmic hemerythrin protein increases the activity of pMMO, suggesting that hemerythrin facilitates oxygen delivery to pMMO. However, there is no evidence for a protein-protein interaction between pMMO and this hemerythrin.\nxh3i | Mechanism\nsyiw | Soluble MMO. The details of how sMMO activates dioxygen have been probed extensively by single turnover kinetic studies, resulting in the identification of transient oxygen intermediates, the kinetic and spectroscopic properties of which are detailed elsewhere. First, the reduced diiron two MMOH reacts with O two in the presence of two equivalents of MMOB to form a species O in which O two is bound, but not directly to the diiron cluster. Intermediate O is then converted to peroxo intermediates P star and P. For M. capsulatus Bath MMOH, P star is observed to be a diiron three site that differs from the subsequent intermediate P only in ligand arrangement. However, recent studies of M. trichosporium OB3b MMOH utilizing a variant of MMOB that slows conversion of P star to P indicate that P star contains a diiron two site similar in structure to the diiron two site in reduced MMOH. In this system, P star is proposed to form by displacement of the H two O by O two without electron transfer from the diiron two center. Thus, it remains unclear whether the two intermediates denoted P star are the same. The second peroxo intermediate, P, is a diiron three species, and spectroscopic comparisons as well as computational work suggest that a mu one two peroxo bridge is likely. Formation of P is pH-dependent and exhibits a kinetic solvent isotope effect in D two O, indicating that proton transfer plays a role. It is also possible to bypass the requirement for MMOB and MMOR in these steps by reacting the oxidized MMOH with H two O two as a source of both oxygen and\nkg3t | Biochemistry\nlvae | electrons. However, very high concentrations of H two O two are required, with an apparent K m value of approximately sixty-six mille M.\no9sc | Intermediate P is then converted to Q in a proton-dependent step that results in O-O bond breaking. Intermediate Q is the species that reacts with methane to break the C-H bond. On the basis of MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopic data indicating the presence of two Fe ions in similar coordination environments and EXAFS data best fit with an Fe-Fe distance of two point four six Angstroms, Q was proposed to adopt a di mu-oxo diamond core structure. Difficulty reproducing this distance computation-\n121u | ally combined with the observation that a model complex with an open core terminal Fe equals O unit can oxidize C-H bonds rapidly, although not those in methane, suggested Q might have an alternative structure. However, a recent time-resolved resonance Raman study reveals a vibration from Q that best matches vibrations observed for the diamond core in model compounds. Additional experiments with mixed isotopes of O two further indicate that Q forms via homolytic cleavage of the O-O bond. Once Q is formed, there are several mechanistic possibilities for C-H activation, including both concerted and radical or cationic processes. A range of approaches, such as the use of chiral alkane and radical clock substrates, the measurement of kinetic isotope effects, and computational analysis, have been used to investigate these options. After methane oxidation, Q is converted to the product complex T, which is proposed to have a mono-mu-oxo bridged structure.\nzh03 | Particulate MMO. Mechanistic studies of pMMO are far behind those of sMMO, due to ongoing difficulties isolating highly active purified enzyme and uncertainty as to the atomic details of the active site. Density functional theory and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics studies suggest that a monocopper Cu two-oxo species or a di mu-oxo Cu two Cu two species could oxidize methane and that formation of the dicopper species is more favorable. Calculations using a dicopper active site model suggest that either a mu-eta one:eta two-peroxo Cu one Cu two or mu-eta two:eta two-peroxo Cu two Cu two species is formed first and then is transformed into the more reactive di mu-oxo Cu two Cu two species after O-O bond cleav- age.",
