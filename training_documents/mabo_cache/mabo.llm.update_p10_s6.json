        "content": "7a0a | This approach is well illustrated by an example provided by Brennan J. A reservation of land for a public purpose, other than for the benefit of indigenous persons, will not of itself extinguish native title if a right to continue to enjoy native title is not inconsistent with that public purpose. However, if such land is then used in a manner inconsistent with the continued enjoyment of native title, then native title will be extinguished. Thus, a reservation of land for use as a school, public office or courthouse does not, of itself, extinguish native title. But the construction of a building on the reserved land would be inconsistent, as it is incompatible with the maintenance of the enjoyment of native title.\no1qp | As may be inferred from the foregoing discussion concerning the nature of native title, that native title may also be extinguished by surrender to the Crown voluntarily or by the indigenous people's abandonment of their presence on, or connexion with, the land.\njrik | Where native title is extinguished, the Crown becomes the absolute beneficial owner of the land. In all of the great torrent of words about Mabo, there was precious little discussion about the derogation from native title fully recognised in the High Court's decision. Landholders in the suburbs and towns of Australia became alarmed that their hard-earned assets may be lost to claims by Aboriginal Australians based on supposed native use hundreds of years ago. As is made clear from the Mabo decision itself, such fears are, in general, completely groundless.\nxv78 | COMPENSATION FOR THE EXTINCTION OF NATIVE TITLE\nsdks | As stated earlier, the majority of the High Court took the view that the Crown's extinguishment of native title since seventeen eighty-eight was not 'wrongful' in the sense that it gave rise to a claim for compensation. However, Deane, Gaudron and Toohey JJ took the view that the extinguishment of native title after the introduction in nineteen seventy-five of the Racial Discrimination Act would be invalid unless accompanied by the payment of compensation. Toohey J noted that any claim for compensation for wrongful extinguishment of native title would be subject to the operation of limitation statutes. Dawson J disagreed with this position. Brennan J (with whom Mason CJ and McHugh J agreed) did not finally decide the point. Deane and Gaudron JJ, further, took the view that such extinguishment of native title would have to accord with section fifty-one subsection thirty-one of the Australian Constitution - that is, it would have to be on 'just terms'. In the face of these differing views, the issue of compensation remains unclear. However, the majority appears to have sent out reassuring messages concerning the scope for rights of compensation.\ny8fb | Fair-minded Australians, I assume, would not object to the notion that Australian Aboriginals be justly compensated by the Crown for the extinguishment of their legitimate native title. For surely, such fair-minded citizens would expect just compensation if their own title to land were extinguished by the Crown. Indeed, as noted by Deane and Gaudron JJ, such a right to just compensation is enshrined, in certain circumstances, within the Australian Constitution itself. We should accord to the indigenous people of this continent in our law no lesser fundamental rights than we decided to reserve to ourselves in the charter of our Federal Commonwealth.\n521q | THE HIGH COURT AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS DOCTRINE\nyogo | The High Court of Australia has been criticised by commentators, including thoughtful and temperate ones, for acting legislatively rather than judicially in the Mabo decision. As will be shown, such criticism may be unwarranted given the true nature of the judicial function and the High Court's proper role as a court of ultimate authority in this country.\n2285 | Typical of the criticisms of this kind is that voiced by the Tasmanian Premier, Mr Groom. He is reported to have said of the High Court and the Mabo decision:\nys0g | It seems to me extraordinary that the High Court, an unelected body, could move in one decision to overthrow all of our land tenure laws that have served Australia so well for two hundred years.\n7zvp | Mr Groom's statement appears prompted by a belief that 'the High Court in the Mabo case, and many others, had taken on a legislative role that should be confined to democratically elected representatives'. Similarly, in emphatic terms, the former Connolly J of Queensland wrote, in response to the rhetorical question: 'What was wrong with the decision?'.\nww6u | The first answer is that it was sheer invention or, if you prefer a politer word, sheer legislation. As Dr Colin Howard has observed, 'The philosophy of the common law is, above all, evolutionary, not revolutionary. Mabo is above all, revolutionary, not evolutionary.' In order to emphasise this point, I shall hereafter refer to the decision as the legislation of third June nineteen ninety-two. Now, if we had a Bill of Rights, there might conceivably be something in it upon which to hang such legislation, but there was nothing. My thesis is, and I regret to have to put it so bluntly, that this is the naked assumption of power by a body quite unfitted to make the political and social decisions which are involved.\nhpi6 | Another example of this same accusation will be sufficient to allow this point to be made. Professor Geoffrey de Q. Walker, Dean of the Faculty of Law in the University of Queensland, has written:\n4uhb | The polemic that has followed Mabo highlights the fact that from a constitutional viewpoint it was not (except in relation to the Murray islanders) a judicial decision at all. Most of the controversy has centred on how the Court's decision should be 'implemented', by federal or State legislation, or both. Yet the hallmark of a genuine judicial decision is that it requires no legislative implementation, for the simple reason that it declares what the current law is, and applies it to the facts. Each time a court applies a principle to new facts it is to a degree developing the law, but sweeping new proclamations of policy, or calls to arms that require Acts of parliament to put them into effect, are quite outside the judicial function. The Mabo case, therefore, except in relation to the Murray islanders, represents yet another usurpation by the Court of the constitutional powers of the Australian parliaments and people.\nepyi | The comments of Dawson J in his lonely dissent in Mabo also give some support to the claim that the High Court, in this case, intruded impermissibly into the legislative province. After concluding that any traditional land rights of the Australian indigenes had long since been extinguished, Dawson J wrote:\ny51p | Accordingly, if traditional land rights (or at least rights akin to them) are to be afforded to the inhabitants of the Murray Islands, the responsibility, both legal and moral, lies with the legislature and not with the courts.\nx95m | Similarly, in the context of Australia's history of European settlement, Dawson J concluded:",
