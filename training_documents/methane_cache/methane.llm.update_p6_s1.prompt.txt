You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

cp13 | Soluble MMO. MMOH interacts with MMOB and MMOR. MMOB is essential for efficient hydrocarbon oxidation by MMOH. Binding of MMOB increases the reaction rate of reduced MMOH with O2 by 1000-fold,77,78 lowers the redox potential of the diiron center," changes the regioselectivity of substrate oxidation, and affects the structure of the diiron center.3 59,81,82 The 2.9 Å resolution structure of the M. capsulatus (Bath) MMOH-2MMOB complex reveals that MMOB binds to the canyon region at the dimer interface of MMOH, leading to the ordering of the N-terminal 35 residues of MMOB, which are not observed in the NMR structures, 83,84 into a ring-like fold (Figure 7A).55 MMOB binding also causes

In addition, Thr213 of the MMOH a subunit rotates inward toward the active site, forming new hydrogen bonds with Glu240 and closing the hydrophilic pore (Figure 7B,C). This residue has been proposed to play a role in proton delivery. Finally, MMOB binding induces small changes in

kpvt | MMOR transfers two electrons from NADH one at a time to the diiron site in MMOH via its FAD and [2Fe-2S] cofactors.85,86 There is no crystal structure of the MMOH- MMOR complex, but NMR titrations indicate that residues 24-34 in <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> helix 1 and residues 67-69 in <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> helix 2 interact with MMOH. Chemical cross-linking studies have suggested that MMOR interacts with both the <LATEX>a ^ { 8 8 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\beta ^ { 8 1 }</LATEX> subunits of MMOH, and recent work using hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and computational docking suggests that the ferredoxin domain of MMOR binds to MMOH at the same location where MMOB binds. At this binding site, the MMOR [2Fe-2S] cluster is positioned 14 Å away from the diiron active site and does indeed interact with both subunits. Consistent with these findings, MMOB inhibits MMOR binding as well as electron transfer. However, it is also possible that MMOB inhibits MMOR binding by forming a complex with MMOR.81
jie2 | Recent fluorescence anisotropy experiments suggest that MMOB has a higher affinity for MMOH in the reduced form <LATEX>\left( K _ { d } = 0 . 1 7 \mu M \right)</LATEX> than in the oxidized form <LATEX>\left( K _ { d } = 0 . 5 5 \mu M \right) _ { j } ^ { 9 0 }</LATEX> an observation that is difficult to reconcile with the lowered redox potential of MMOH in the presence of MMOB.79,91 Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopic data further suggest that the conformation of the N-terminal tail of MMOB is more rigid when MMOH is reduced." The key role of the MMOB N-terminus is underscored by data showing that mutants of MMOB disrupting the N-terminus display significantly reduced activity.55,92 In one functional model, MMOR is proposed to replace MMOB, transfer electrons to reduce the active site, and then MMOB is proposed to rebind to the reduced form, displacing MMOR, and initiating <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> activation and methane oxidation. In the absence of experimental evidence for MMOR displacing MMOB from the oxidized MMOH, this scenario remains speculative.
d0ik | Particulate MMO. Protein-protein interactions are not required for pMMO activity in vitro, but protein-protein complexes involving pMMO have been suggested. Besides the interaction with the mystery helix observed crystallographically (Figure 3), 24-26 26 pMMO has been proposed to interact with the next enzyme in the methane oxidation metabolic pathway, methanol dehydrogenase (MDH).93 MDH is a periplasmic enzyme that oxidizes methanol to formaldehyde and is composed of a 63 kDa a subunit, which contains a pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)/calcium ion cofactor, and a 8 kDa <LATEX>\beta</LATEX> subunit arranged as an <LATEX>\alpha _ { 2 } \beta _ { 2 }</LATEX> dimer.94, The <LATEX>M .</LATEX> capsulatus (Bath) MDH can also form higher order heterogeneous oligomers.95 A putative pMMO-MDH super- complex was isolated, and its structure was determined to 16 <LATEX></LATEX> resolution by electron microscopy. This structure was interpreted as three aß MDH monomers capping the periplasmic pmoB soluble domains of the pMMO <LATEX>\alpha _ { 3 } \beta _ { 3 } \gamma _ { 3 }</LATEX> trimer." This pMMO-MDH complex exhibited moderately higher propylene epoxidation activity than pMMO alone, 96,97 but its methane oxidation activity was not reported. Recent biolayer interferometry studies of MDH and pMMO from <LATEX>M .</LATEX> <LATEX>c a p s u l a t u s</LATEX> (Bath) reveal a specific protein-protein interac- interaction was also detected between MDH and the spmoB recombinant protein, indicating that the periplasmic regions of pmoB are involved.95 These data are consistent with reports that MDH is associated with the membranes in various methanotrophs.98-10 The observed complex is likely dynamic

4exe | since a stable complex cannot be isolated by size exclusion chromatography, and its formation may depend on the presence of the membrane or other proteins. One proposal is that the lysine-rich <LATEX>\beta</LATEX> subunit of MDH, of which the function is not known, interacts with pMMO and/or negatively charged phospholipid headgroups at the periplasmic membrane," thus associating with pMMO in a fashion that would be difficult to reconstitute in vitro. Such a model would not apply to methanotrophs that utilize a subset of MDH enzymes lacking the <LATEX>\beta</LATEX> subunit, but these methanotrophs, which include the Verrucomicrobia,102 also have different types of membranes.36
