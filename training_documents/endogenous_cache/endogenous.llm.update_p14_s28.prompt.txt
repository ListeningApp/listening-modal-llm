You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

gyzb | 561 isoforms regulate neuroproteasome localization (ApoE4<E3<E2), we predicted that neurons
rrp1 | 562 from ApoE4-KI mice would be more susceptible accumulating sarkosyl-insoluble Tau relative to
8b70 | 563 neurons from ApoE3-KI or ApoE2-KI mice. To test this prediction, we crossed each of the
nivt | 564 ApoE-KI lines to the hTau-KI lines, generating mice which endogenously express ApoE2, E3, or
8925 | 565 E4 as well as hTau. DIV14 primary neurons from each line (hTau/ApoE2 double KI,
y2tz | 566 hTau/ApoE3 double KI, and hTau/ApoE4 double KI) were then treated with a range of iBEp
p769 | 567 doses spanning four log units. Neurons were then separated into sarkosyl-soluble and insoluble
jhwn | 568 fractions and immunoblotted. We found no sarkosyl-insoluble Tau aggregates at baseline in any line, which suggests that the ApoE4-induced reduction of neuroproteasomes levels alone is not 570 sufficient to drive Tau aggregation (Fig 5G, S5I). However, after treatment with even the lowest 571 dose of iBEp, we found accumulation of sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in hTau/E4-dKI neurons,
o1y4 | 569
3rdp | 572 rendering E4 neurons over 25-fold more susceptible to Tau aggregation than E3 neurons (Fig
2n4o | 573 5G). Conversely, neurons from hTau/E2-dKI mice were over 10-fold less susceptible to
31ya | 574 neuroproteasome-inhibition induced Tau aggregation than neurons from hTau/E3-dKI mice (Fig 5G). Overall, these data demonstrate that ApoE isoforms differentially shift the threshold for the neuroproteasome-dependent formation of endogenous sarkosyl-insoluble Tau inclusions.

3fxr | 58 We noticed that neuroproteasome inhibition induces the shift of sarkosyl-insoluble Tau into a 582 species which migrates at a higher molecular weight on an SDS-PAGE gel, at approximately 64kDa (Fig 5A, B, D, F, G, S5B, S6A). Similar shifts in molecular weight of Tau are observed 583
1rwa | 584 in the AD brain and is a hallmark phenotype of multiple neurodegenerative disorders (109, 110).
40h8 | 585 This molecular weight shift can in part be due to Tau phosphorylation at many residues.
9w49 | 586 Therefore, we wanted to address whether iBEp-induced Tau aggregates are phosphorylated.
kgl8 | 587 Rather than profiling by a panel of phospho-specific antibodies against Tau, we took a more
kq4g | 588 unbiased approach and measured Tau phosphorylation by quantitative phosphoproteomics. We
qjp8 | 589 treated primary WT neurons with iBEp for either 1, 6, or 24 hours and then performed sarkosyl
pc64 | 590 fractionations. Soluble and insoluble fractions were processed for TMT labelling in preparation
mbrx | 591 for quantitative mass spectrometry and then peptides were run over an Fe-NTA column to enrich
pcd0 | 592 for phospho-peptides (Fig 6A). We then used this enriched population for quantitative phospho-
txkp | 593 proteomics analysis at the single peptide level (Table S4). Here, we find a time-dependent
mxqe | 594 increase in Tau phosphorylation at only 4 of 26 identified sites which correspond to human S202,
y9ob | 596 T205, T217, and S404 (Fig 6A). This is a specific signature of phosphorylation which
twm6 | 595
8qsp | 597 corresponds to sites at which Tau is phosphorylated in the AD brain and detected by established antibodies (S202 - CP13(111), T205 - AT8(112), and S404 - PHF1(113)) as well as CSF 598 biomarkers for AD progression (T217)(114).

hthe | 600 To validate these data, we treated hTau-KI neurons with iBEp and then fixed and stained these
otjm | 601 neurons. We observed no staining in neurons cultured from Tau-KO mice using the R2295
q0fv | 602 antibody to detect total Tau or the CP13 antibody to detect phosphorylated S202 (Fig S6B).
v9vo | 603 Incubating neurons with secondary antibodies alone showed no signal (Fig S6C). We therefore
rwty | 604 exclusively used CP13 for our ICC experiments to detect phosphorylated Tau. We find a
ki97 | 605 significant elevation of CP13 signal in iBEp-treated primary hippocampal hTau-KI neurons 606 compared to controls (Fig 6B). This iBEP-induced signal appears punctate and distributed in
099j | 607 both axons and MAP2+ dendrites (Fig 6B). To validate these data, we conducted
m7zf | 608 immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of sections from hTau-KI mice stereotactically injected with iBEp and contralaterally injected with vehicle control (0.07% DMSO). After stereotactic 610 injections, animals were allowed to recover for 72 hours and then were perfused and sectioned
2ghw | 609
hnfy | 611 612 for IHC. We observed no staining in the Tau-KO mice using the AT8 antibody or with secondary antibodies alone (Fig S6D, S6E). We observe a threefold induction of phosphorylated Tau signal
w6d9 | 613
lbm8 | 614 in hippocampi injected with iBEp compared to the contralateral PBS controls. We see a strong increase in AT8+ inclusions mislocalized to somatodendritic compartments in iBEp-injected
krjy | 615 hippocampi, which extend into the stratum radiatum and stratum moleculare (Fig 6C).
n7dw | 616 617 While sarkosyl-insoluble Tau reflects aggregated Tau species(99, 106, 115-117), there are
9nt1 | 618 varying definitions of a protein aggregate: misfolded proteins which cluster together, proteins
fr45 | 619 which form stable inclusions, inclusions which are resistant to varying detergents, and then in
s2ty | 620 some cases, proteins which form very stable aggregates and even amyloids(118, 119). Thioflavin
3cdb | 621 S (ThioS) is a dye that stains the ß-sheet structures of amyloid aggregates, including both
6hsm | 622 aggregated Tau tangles and amyloid plaques. Therefore, ThioS is used for the neuropathological
om5d | 623 diagnosis of a wide variety of neurodegenerative disorders(8, 54, 120). We conducted ThioS
0svq | 624 staining of sections from hTau-KI mice stereotactically injected with iBEp and contralaterally
1too | 625 injected with vehicle control. After stereotactic injections, animals were allowed to recover for
pti9 | 626 72 hours and then brains were perfused, sectioned, and stained for ThioS. We find a strong 627 increase in ThioS staining from the CA1 region of hippocampi exposed to iBEp relative to
4mtx | 628 vehicle controls (Fig 6D). ThioS+ inclusions appear as flame-like inclusions in both the CA1
rgxy | 629 pyramidal layer and the granule cell layer of the Dentate Gyrus (Fig 6D, E, S6F-J).
vsq9 | 630 Neuroproteasome inhibition-induced flame-like ThioS+ aggregates co-localize with both
d5a1 | 631 phosphorylated Tau (AT8) and total Tau (DA9) (Fig 6F, G, S6K) in single Z-plane images from
qtb8 | 632 neurons in the CA1 and DG of hippocampus. We conclude that some neuroproteasome-induced
g395 | 633 aggregates we observe are indeed composed of Tau. In addition to these large ThioS+ inclusions, 634 we also observe some thread-like ThioS+ inclusions in the hippocampal neuropil as well as
wfvy | 635 widely distributed thin ThioS+ inclusions that appear dispersely throughout the iBEp-injected
7yfb | 637 hippocampus (Fig 6G, S6L, M). The ThioS+ inclusions formed following neuroproteasome
