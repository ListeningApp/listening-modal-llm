You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

xnth | To study in detail why ADASTRA failed to capture ASBs found in other studies, we used the set of ASB SNPs identified by one of the most advanced methods for ASB calling, BaalChIP19. ASB event could be missed at the SNP calling stage, could fail to pass the read coverage thresholds, or fail to pass the significance threshold for FDR-corrected P value estimated against BAD. To assess the contribution of different stages of our pipeline to ASB calling sensitivity, we performed a stage-by-stage analysis of the underlying SNP set (see Fig. 3d). It turned out that the fraction of BaalChIP ASB SNPs recovered by ADASTRA was different for different cell types, with most of ASBs recovered for the cell types with the deepest sequencing coverage.
vafm | On the one hand, the basic coverage filters significantly reduced the number of SNPs under consideration resulting in a major loss in the fraction of recovered ASBs. On the other hand, we did not observe critical effects from any of the subsequent stages. For all cell types, the number of BaalChIP ASB SNPs recovered by ADASTRA decreased monotonously, suggesting that there was no particular bottleneck defining the sensitivity of the whole pipeline except the basic coverage filters. As more sites were recovered for cell types with better coverage, one can predict that the difference between different ASB calling pipelines would decrease as soon as more ChIP-Seq data would become available for analysis.
2zmw | In general, there is an overlap between ADASTRA ASBs and the existing data on regulatory SNPs, including sites of allele- specific DNA accessibility16 and reporter assay quantitative trait loci6 (Supplementary Fig. 5), but the vast majority of ADASTRA data are novel.
bf9k | Given the diversity of assessed TFs, it became possible to systematically compare SNVs carrying TF ASBs and identify the pairs of TFs preferring to share ASBs (Supplementary Fig. 6). Indeed, hundreds of TF pairs are significantly enriched for common ASBs (one-tailed Fisher's exact test P value from 0.05 to 10-300 upon correction for multiple tested TF pairs with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure). As a rule, shared ASBs were not related to interacting TFs (considering protein-protein interactions from STRING-db31). However, there was a systema- tic overlap between ASBs for chromatin-interacting epigenetic factors and related proteins, suggesting many of shared events are "passengers" in regions of allele-specific chromatin accessibility with TFs bound only to the accessible chromosome. Still, some interacting proteins (such as CTCF-RAD21) strongly prefer to share ASBs, and the same holds for particular composite elements of binding sites such as AR-FOXA132.
otkr | Motif annotation is concordant with ASB calls. For TFs spe- cifically interacting with DNA, it is possible to perform compu- tational annotation of ASBs with TF-recognized sequence motifs33. When a strong binding site overlaps an ASB SNP and the alternating alleles directly change the key nucleotides in the TF-binding DNA sequence, this SNP likely relates to different TF-binding affinity to the sites at homologous chromosomes, which directly produce the ChIP-Seq allelic imbalance. We call such events "driver" ASBs to distinguish them from side effects of piggyback TF binding and chromosome-specific local chromatin accessibility, the examples of "passenger" ASBs. Motif annotation highlights the driver ASBs and allows comparing the observed ASB effect (the allelic imbalance) and the effect predicted by sequence analysis (the difference in binding specificity reflected in the motif prediction scores), providing an independent evaluation of the reliability of ASB calls.

d6r4 | An ASB was considered as overlapping the TF motif occurrence if the TF position weight matrix (PWM) scored a hit with P≤ 0.0005 for any of the two alleles. The log ratio of P values corresponding to PWM hits at alternative alleles was used as an approximation of the TF affinity fold change (FC). Fig. 4a compares the ASB significance (X-axis, signed log10 FDR; the sign set positive for Alt-ASBs and negative for Ref-ASBs) with the log ratio of motif hits P values (Y-axis) for 218 TFs having at least 1 ASB within a motif hit. Predominantly, at heterozygous sites, alleles with more specific motif hits are covered with more ChIP- Seq reads, revealing the prevalence of motif-concordant ASB events (blue dots in Fig. 4a). Such concordance persists for more than 80% of SNVs with ASB allelic imbalance FDR < 5%, growing with decreasing ASB FDR and saturating at about 90% of SNVs (Fig. 4b). At 5% FDR, good motif concordance stands for many TFs, as illustrated by the top 10 TFs with the highest number of motif hits at ASBs (Fig. 4c). Importantly, even at larger FDR, there are more concordant than discordant ASBs.
9mrz | Yet, for ~10-20% of SNVs, the motif hit odds ratios are discordant with the allelic imbalance (corrected for BAD), that is, more reads are attracted to the weaker motif hit (red dots in Fig. 4a and red bars in Fig. 4c). We believe that in such cases the allelic imbalance arises from other contributors (allele-specific chromatin accessibility or indirect TF binding), which override the sequence-specific TF affinity. Also, we use the motif prediction scores as a proxy of the TF-binding affinity and it is possible that the observed limited discordance partly reflects the imperfectness of the utilized motif models.
pk06 | To quantify ASB allelic imbalance for BAD other than one, we defined the ASB effect size (ES) as follows (see "Methods" for details). For individual SNV (SNV in a single data set):
7wn9 | ESRef = log2 (CRef / E (CRef ICAIt)) and ES Alt = 10g2 (CAlt/E(CAIt |CRef))
wcd0 | Here CRef and CAlt are the read counts at the Ref and Alt alleles, and E is the expectation. For BAD = 1: ESRef = log2(CRef/CAIt).
caos | The aggregated ES of an ASB is calculated as a weighted mean of ES values for the same allele for SNVs aggregated at the same genome position over TFs or cell types, with weights equal to negative logarithms of individual P values, separately for each of the alleles.
qrvy | BAD-corrected estimates of the ASB ES allow to visualize the magnitude of allelic imbalance at different positions of significant motif hits. To this purpose, we introduce a staveplot (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 7) that is partitioned into sections corre- sponding to the motif positions, and each section is a stave of four strings denoting the minor allele. Individual ASBs are shown as the beads on the staves, with the major allele encoded with color, following the palette of the motif logo diagram that is shown underneath. As an illustrative example, we use ASBs of the CEBPB TF (Fig. 4d). For example, the first string from the left denotes A as the minor allele found in the first position of CEBPB motif hits. The string carries multiple beads, each of which is the major allele of a particular heterozygous SNV within an ASB site of CEBPB. The position of a bead on the Y-axis shows the ASB ES in log-scale. The most conserved motif positions 3-7-9-10 are almost unicolor, with the major allele usually being the same as the consensus letter in the motif (hence the beads on the strings depicting minor alleles mostly share the color of the preferred major allele). Lowly conserved positions (e.g., 1 or 12) allow for more options with various pairwise combinations of alleles (i.e., with minor allele strings carrying the beads of all four possible colors). Of note, the staveplot reveals a clear pattern where beads found in core motif positions are located generally higher, i.e., marking a greater ES for heterozygous variants at conserved motif

yeoh | positions. This agrees with the commonly accepted testimony that substitutions in the core motif positions bring about larger changes in TF-binding affinity.
b8hf | Particularly for CEBPB, position 6 is of special interest: it displays frequent T/C ASBs with C being the major allele. These cytosines belong to the core CG pair which is prone to spontaneous deamination. The produced mismatches are then protected from repair through enhanced CEBPB binding resulting in mutation fixation34. Such ASBs, on the one hand, confirm frequent mutagenesis of CEBPB binding sites, and, on the other hand, suggest the action of purifying selection that stabilizes such sites as heterozygous variants. The staveplots for other TFs are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7.
hntf | Machine learning predicts ASBs from sequence analysis and chromatin accessibility. With previously published ASB sets of smaller volumes, it was possible to predict ASB from chromatin properties and a sequence analysis20. To assess to what degree this holds for ADASTRA data, we applied machine learning with a random forest model35 atop experimentally determined allele- specific chromatin DNase accessibility data16, predicted allele- specific chromatin profile from DeepSEA11, and sequence motif hits (Supplementary Table 5).

y5r7 | A generic classification problem (ASBs vs non-ASBs) can be formalized in two subtasks: (1) general assessment, i.e., to predict if an SNV makes the ASB for any of the TFs or in any of the cell types, and (2) TF- and cell type-specific assessment, i.e., to predict if an SNV makes the ASB for the particular TF or in the particular cell type. Models for both subtasks were trained and validated using multiple single-chromosome hold-outs: iteratively for each of 22 autosomes, one autosome was selected for validation, and 21 other autosomes were used for training. At each iteration, the model performance was estimated at the held-out autosome, and the resulting ROC and PRC were averaged.
lrry | For the first subtask, the performance at TF and cell type ASBs was 0.74 and 0.73 for the area under the receiver operating characteristic (auROC), and 0.44 and 0.56 for the area under the precision-recall curve (auPRC), respectively (see the plots in Supplementary Fig. 8). For the second subtask, we used the top 10 TFs and top 10 cell types with the highest numbers of ASBs, and a dedicated model was trained for each TF and each cell type (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 8). The quality of the models was different for different TFs and cell types, with the highest auROC of 0.72 and 0.81 for CTCF (of TFs) and HepG2 (of cell types), and the highest auPRC of 0.35 and 0.64 for CTCF and A549. Of note, RAD21 ASBs were also predicted with
