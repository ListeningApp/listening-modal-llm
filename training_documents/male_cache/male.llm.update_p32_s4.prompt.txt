You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7hgg | v) Spermiation requires testosterone action.
xwsv | c) Indirect Hormonal Requirements
756b | i) FSH binds to the Sertoli cells and elicits its effect via the cAMP signal transduction pathway.
6bx7 | ii) Androgen receptors are present in Sertoli cells. Testosterone action on the developing germ cells is mediated by the Sertoli cell.
spl6 | iii) LH is the gonadotropin responsible for the regulation of testosterone biosynthesis. LH binds to receptors on the Leydig cell and results in the activation of the enzymes involved in the conversion of cholesterol to testosterone. Therefore, LH indirectly affects spermatogenesis by stimulating sufficient levels of androgens to be produced.
7wzm | iv) Prolactin synergizes with LH to stimulate testosterone production. Leydig cells have receptors for prolactin. Prolactin causes an increase in the numbers of LH receptors on Leydig cells and may function in this way to potentiate LH action.
e9xj | v) Retinoic acid acts directly on the germ cells to stimulate their entry into the meiotic pathway and also to affect Sertoli cell cyclicity
9vl6 | vi) Thyroxine regulates Sertoli cell numbers during development
c2fd | 14) TEMPERATURE REGULATION OF THE TESTIS
jzvp | a) The testes in humans are located outside the body and are contained in a sac-like structure called the scrotum. The scrotum is a highly specialized structure which is designed to keep the intratesticular temperature at a constant 34℃, which is several degrees cooler than normal body temperature. This cooler temperature is absolutely crucial for maintaining normal spermatogenesis.
f71y | b) In order to ensure proper intra-testicular temperature, the cremasteric muscle in the scrotum raises the testes closer to the body when the ambient temperature is low and relaxes to lower the testes away from the body when the ambient temperature is hot. The
31e1 | scrotum also has sparse hair and is rugose ("wrinkled"), which serves to increase surface area allowing further cooling of the testes.
40ry | c) The pampiniform plexus (see Figure 1) is a network of interconnected veins, which drain the blood from the testes. The pampiniform plexus plays an important functional role in maintaining testicular temperature in the appropriate range for sperm production by cooling blood in the testicular artery before it enters the testes. Abnormalities of the pampiniform plexus, such as seen with a varicocele (varicose veins in the spermatic cord of the scrotum), can have adverse effects on spermatogenesis by interfering with the cooling mechanics of the plexus. It can also negatively affect spermatogenesis through a variety of other poorly understood factors.
d1j2 | 15) MALE GENITAL TRACT
wstc | a) The Epididymis: The efferent ducts fuse to form the ductus epididymidis of the epididymis. The epididymis is characterized by a scalloped outline. This is a single highly coiled tube (4-6 m in length). This canal is surrounded by connective tissue and blood vessels. It is lined with pseudostratified columnar epithelium (rounded basal cells and columnar cells). The cells are supported by smooth muscle cells characterized by peristaltic contractions that move the sperm along the duct. The surface of the epithelium is covered by microvilli called stereocilia (these cells absorb fluid) and ciliated cells that contribute to the transport. The epididymal duct system is about 20 feet long while the vas deferens is about 18 inches in length. The glandular portion of the vas deferens is called the ampulla (see Figure 1). The ampulla contributes a small amount of fructose to the ejaculate. The secretions from these glands are the third in sequence to be expelled during ejaculation and contain the spermatozoa.
ba1e | b) Functions: The epithelium uptakes and digests the residual bodies remaining after spermatogenesis. During transit through the epididymis, the sperm acquire the ability to be motile (progressive motility required for fertilizing capacity). There are three regions: the head or caput, the body or corpus, and the tail or cauda. The height of the epithelium varies in thickness depending upon which portion of the epididymis is examined (increasing thickness from head to tail). Sperm epididymal maturation requires approximately 10 days. Thus, the period of time from the initiation of spermatogenesis to the release of mature sperm into the lumen of the tubules (64 days) plus the time required for sperm to migrate to the head of the epididymis (10 days) is approximately 74 days.
en95 | The epididymis (Figure 19) is comprised of several ductuli efferentes that empty into a single, highly coiled ductus epididymidis, which ends as the straight ductus (vas) deferens. The epididymis is divided anatomically into the caput (head), the corpus (body), and the cauda (tail). Sperm transport through the epididymis takes approximately 16 days in humans. This amount of time added to the 74 days defined above suggests that a total of approximately 90 days is required from the time of initiation of spermatogenesis to the time when mature sperm are ready for ejaculation. Therefore, the adverse effects of any insult to the testis (fever, etc.) that results in damage to spermatogenesis may not be seen in the ejaculate for as long as 3 months.
l3do | During the time of epididymal migration, spermatozoa undergo maturation, gain the capability of motility, and gain the capacity to fertilize. The sperm are then stored in the cauda epididymis and the vas deferens. Depending on the frequency of ejaculation, there is equilibrium between the breakdown of aged spermatozoa and the fullness of the epididymis.
u9bo | c) The epididymis serves several functions in the male:
7avo | i) Maturational Changes of Spermatozoa: As spermatozoa emerge from the testis and appear in the caput epididymis, they possess no progressive motility and have no in vivo fertilizing capacity. Sperm acquire these two properties gradually during transit through the epididymis. Maturation may involve deposition of specific glycoproteins on the sperm surface. Additional changes include a change in net sperm surface charge; alterations in sperm-lectin binding properties; changes in immunoreactivity and iodination characteristics; acquisition of an increased capacity for glycolysis; modification of adenylate cyclase activity; alterations in cellular phospholipid and phospholipid-like fatty acid content; formation of disulfide bonds within the nucleus and tail and oxidation of sperm membrane sulfhydryl groups; and an increased ability to adhere to the zona pellucida. Full fertilization capacity and motility of spermatozoa is probably not achieved until they reach the cauda epididymis. The motility and fertilization capacity of epididymal sperm is regulated by androgens.
uzo6 | d) Release of Spermatozoa: The release of spermatozoa during ejaculation is mediated by short, adrenergic contractions of the cauda epididymis and vas deferens. Spermatozoa are then mixed with the secretions of the accessory glands (see below).
89b4 | e) Elimination of Aged Spermatozoa: Although the epididymal environment is favorable for survival of sperm, they are not preserved indefinitely and gradually age and lose their viability:
