Click on the View Data icon to see a sample of your data set.\nqzb9 | Three. Click on the search icon (the little magnifying glass) to search for fields.\nacan | Four. Click on the arrow that points downwards, which is the Context menu, to create calculated fields, parameters, and change the sort/view options for the Data window.\nj623 | Tableau Public Interface Features\nd7ly | Visual cues\nplf9 | Within the Data pane, each field name is displayed, but there is also a visual cue that tells you what type of field it is. Field types determine the function and capability of joining data sources. In addition to showing the field type, Tableau Public allows you to change a field's type by right-clicking on it and selecting the Change Data Type option. The following list shows the fields and their descriptions:\nvk11 | The A B C field: This indicates that the field is a string field, which means that the contents of the field may include letters, special characters, or numbers\njj0l | The calendar icon: This indicates a date, datetime, or time field\nqdqt | The pound sign: This indicates a numeric field that can have any type of native numeric format, from bigint to decimal\n6h7m | The globe icon: This icon indicates that the field has geographic attributes\nb6vb | The paper clip icon: This indicates that the field is a group that you have created in Tableau Public\nc5h2 | The Venn diagram icon: This indicates a set\neccu | The parameters have their own data types, which can be established when you create them.\nrtpq | The Analytics pane\npo9y | The Analytics pane is next to the Data pane. You can access it by clicking on its header. It provides you with the ability to add summaries, average lines, constant lines, distribution bands, medians, boxplots, forecasts, and other visual analytics to your visualization. You can then customize and edit them by using the reference line and formatting user interfaces.\nw5lk | The Analytics that you can add are dependent on the data elements in your visualization, which include the following:\npb48 | Summarized Analytics: This includes the following elements:\nnriw | A constant line: This is an integer on an axis that you can input\nh7kb | An average line: This displays the mean of the measure that you have selected either across the table, pane, or cell\n2mrs | Median line with twenty-five percent and seventy-five percent quartiles: This creates a median reference line and a quartile distribution band that you can edit\nf7it | Chapter Two\no9jm | Modeling: This includes the following elements:\ngz4c | Average, or mean, with confidence intervals\nu30w | Trend lines with the most commonly used models, such as linear, exponential, and so on\nee2o | Custom: With the help of this element, you can add custom reference lines and distribution bands as well as box plots, which can also be used by right-clicking on an axis\np87c | In the following screenshot, we added the average delay in minutes per day to the graph as a reference line by performing the following operations:\nreyp | One. Click on Analytics to see the Analytics pane.\n9vu6 | Two. Drag Average Line to the y axis, which is the vertical axis.\nli13 | Three. Select Table as the scope, as shown in the following screenshot:\nyb5z | Menus and toolbars\nl7da | The menus in Tableau Public are arranged and named in a way that is similar to those in other modern applications. Their primary uses are shown in the following screenshot:\n24j5 | Tableau Public Interface Features\nsyjc | Let's look at each of them in the following list:\nijx9 | File: You can open and save your work to Tableau Public via this menu. Remember that Tableau Public does not auto-save.\nsosd | Data: From here, you can add new data sources and modify the existing ones.\nzxxx | Worksheet: From here, you can create new worksheets, copy the visualization or data on your worksheet, and modify the title, caption, tooltip, and other features.\ne6pm | Dashboard: This is used to create and format dashboards as well as to add actions.\nml6c | Story: This is used to add Story Points, which enhance the narrative capabilities of a data visualization. Story Points refers to a specific function in Tableau Public, and it's beyond the scope of this book.\nujdt | Analysis: This can be used to aggregate and disaggregate measures, create forecasts, totals, and trend lines, and create and edit calculated fields.\numn7 | Map: By changing the Map options, you can modify background maps and images, and add custom geocoding and W M S.\nt2yx | Format: This is used to modify the appearance of visualizations.\n70qq | Window: This can be used to switch between the presentation and development mode as well as other views in the workbook\n2421 | Help: You can use this to get help and manage performance.\nlvcg | The buttons on the toolbar are graphically descriptive of their function. When you roll over each with your mouse, the instructions for use pop up as well.\nf9cy | The buttons of the toolbar include the following:\n3vhx | The Start button: This takes you back to the Start screen\n1lk7 | The Undo button: This reverses the previous action that you took and can go as far as back to the state of the workbook when you opened it\nrkgd | The Redo button: This repeats actions that you have reversed\njbj0 | The Save button: This is critical, as Tableau Public does not auto-save\nf7b0 | Add New Data Source: This adds a new data source\n9bdp | Add New Worksheet: This adds a new worksheet\nb1jn | The Duplicate button: This duplicates the current worksheet\nf02j | The Clear button: This clears the current worksheet\nuc93 | The Swap button: This swaps the fields on the Rows and Columns shelves\n24jr | Chapter Two\nweol | Ascending: Sorts in ascending order\nzo3w | Descending: Sorts in descending order\nbqsc | Group: This is inactive in the view, as shown in the previous screenshot\nc2j4 | Show Mark Labels\nk611 | The Reset cards: These allows you to show legends and cards that you might have hidden or removed\n6s1a | Fit: This allows you to change the fit of the visualization within a window\nxwwb | Fit Axes: This allows you to set axis ranges\notfh | Highlight: This allows users to click on dimension members and highlight the related records in other visualizations on the dashboard\n6dzi | The Presentation mode: This hides the menus, the Data pane, or the Dashboard pane\nnk46 | Canvas and Column/Row shelves\nsbg4 | Tableau Software has a user interface that is very different from that of the older reporting or data analysis tools that you may have used at work or in school. It uses a methodology of dragging and dropping objects for most of the functions that you need to perform to build a visualization. The areas of the workspace where you place objects are called Shelves and Cards. Many of the tasks in this book instruct you to drag a field to the Columns or Rows shelf.\n0vsm | The far right side of the screen is called the canvas area. It is where sheet objects, such as a chart, are built. The chart area itself starts out blank, and you must drag the fields that you want to analyze to an axis, header, or the Columns or Rows shelf, which also determines on which axis or header the field appears.\nrrsc | Tableau Public Interface Features\nxjfg | In the following screenshot, we have highlighted the Columns and Rows shelves, the canvas, the Marks card, the Filters shelf, and the Pages shelf. This screenshot shows how the workspace looks before we add fields to it, and the description is as follows:\niw9o | The Columns Shelf one is where you put fields that you want on the horizontal header or the x axis, that is, the axis that goes from left to right. The Rows shelf is where you put fields that you want on the y axis.\nenxg | The Canvas two has three places where you can drop fields, namely the x axis/header, the y axis/header, and the visualization space itself.",
