        "content": "afqg | It is impossible to spend time with virtually any religious, philosophical and esotericist group, or even to read its literature, without seeing that a large number of the people involved, perhaps through no fault of their own, and because of ignorance of the problems, are using these formats for sociological or psychological purposes of a narrow kind. It is not that their spiritual life is right in these groups. It is that their social life is inadequate.\nvz07 | 'As above, so below'. Just as in ordinary worldly considerations there can be inefficiency or confusion as to aims, so there may be in approaching higher knowledge. You may be able, initially, to pursue higher aims through lower mechanisms and theories, but you cannot pursue them by indulging short-term personal interests.\n8wou | You must follow your personality interests somewhere else. In an advanced society there are more institutions catering for such outlets than anyone could possibly need. Make sure that your professional, commercial, social, psychological and family needs are fulfilled in the society to which you belong. The rest of you is the part which can be communicated with by means of the specialised techniques available to those who have a comprehensive and legitimate traditional learning: and who have the means of safeguarding it.\n6x7z | This is what you have to study first of all. Most people are\n1q42 | trying to effect something else, no matter what they imagine that they are doing. Fortunately, it is not hard to recognise this if enough sincere effort is expended.\n5ycu | In ordinary life, if you think that your family is largely a commercial proposition, people will point out that you are misguided. If you thought that your profession was mainly for social purposes, people would soon put you right. It is time that you were correctly informed in this field as well. You must know, or find out, the difference between meeting to learn and experience something, and meeting in order to be emotionally stimulated or intellectually tested or socially reassured.\nlhe0 | There is no harm at all in a social ingredient in a human relationship: far from it. But when this gets out of balance, and a human contact becomes an excuse for a social contact, you are not going to learn, no matter what materials you are working with. 'Due proportion' is a secret skill of the teacher.\narcp | The repeated upsurge of apparently different schools of higher study in various epochs and cultures is due in large part to the need to rescue genuine traditional teachings from the automatism and social-psychological-entertainment functions which regularly and deeply invade and, for the most part, eventually possess them.\n8wsg | Certain physical and mental exercises, as an example, are of extremely significant importance for the furthering of higher human functions. If these are practised by people who use things for emotional, social or callisthenic purposes, they will not operate on a higher level with such people. They become merely a means of getting rid of surplus energy, or of assuaging a sense of frustration. The practitioners, however, regularly and almost invariably mistake their subjective experiences of them for 'something higher'.\nm65y | It is for this reason that legitimate traditional higher teachings are parsimonious with their materials and exercises. Nobody with a task to perform can possibly (if he knows about his task) do so in a manner which is not benefiting people on the level required.\nm652 | The foregoing information should be read and studied and understood as widely as possible. Without it there is little possibility of serving any group of people, anywhere, otherwise than socially or with shallow psychology, no matter what theories, systems or exercises are employed.\n00j4 | Where there is ideology, conditioning and indoctrination, a mechanical element is introduced which drives out the factor of extradimensional reality perception which connects the higher functions of the mind with the higher reality.\nfkpa | Sufi experiences are designed to maintain a harmony with and nearness to this Reality, while mechanical systems effectively distance people from it.\n7ovw | WHO GUARDS THE COAT\n7h0s | Attar, in his Recitals of the Saints, tells a story of the great Sufi Habib Ajami, when he went to a river to wash, leaving his coat lying on the ground. Hasan of Basra was passing and saw it. Thinking that someone should look after this property, he stood guard over it until Habib returned.\n7cdl | Hasan then asked Habib whom he had left looking after the coat.\n8mej | 'In the care' said Habib, 'of him who gave you the task of looking after it!'\nmlec | This anecdote, intended to indicate the way in which affairs work out for Sufis, is often taken by raw imitators as something to copy, so that they test 'destiny' by abandoning things and neglecting duties: with results which correspond with their stage of ignorance.\nllys | Sorrow in 'Spiritual Enterprises'.\nrmu5 | Q: How is it that involving themselves in spiritual enterprises can cause so much sorrow and trouble to some people? Some become deranged, and worse characters than they ever were before ...\n3o98 | A: First, remember that this tendency has been observed and commented upon by all religious and other systems. People are always being driven off their heads by something or other, however respectable the creed, and nobody has yet found any method of preventing this. People sorrow and go mad everywhere, and in everything.\nzd6z | Secondly, attempts are always made by those who are really aware of this psychological problem to cut down on the harmful effects, not of the processes, but of the state of mind of the sufferer upon whom the processes are grafted or applied.\nk1a2 | It is for this reason that Sufi teachers have tried to ensure that certain of their disciples do not undertake various exercises. Some of them even insist that such people do not - for instance - perform the pilgrimage to Mecca, which is an obligation for all Moslems. For this reason the Sufis have been blamed for 'opposing that which is permitted or enjoined', by people who are too stupid to understand that, in Islam, the sick are not supposed to do things, even when enjoined, which might increase their infirmity.\nnlu6 | The 'sorrow and trouble' to which you refer are due to an inner sickness. This sickness is one which is made worse by anything - even spiritual things - which approach it, because when a spiritual element approaches certain forms of sickness, the ailment itself distorts the approaching element and misuses it. You can verify this for yourself, by noting how a perfectly salutary thing, employed in the wrong manner or at the wrong place, or with the wrong people, can cause damage.\nsiqn | STEPPING OFF THE FOURTEENTH FLOOR\n2ae7 | There were two news items in the British newspapers not long ago. In one of them, a man stepped off the fourteenth floor of a building because of his 'religious' faith, confident that 'God would save him'. He died. In the other case, it was assumed by spiritually-minded people that a man was possessed by devils. An attempt was made to 'exorcise' these demons, by a ritual taught by the Church. The attempted casting-out of the devils by a Priest of the Church of England was followed by the man murdering his own wife, within hours of the ceremony, by tearing out her eyes and tongue.\nu9wd | Such things can happen when people mistake for a spiritual matter a medical one. This, in turn, happens when people imagine that their doctrine, not their experience, enables them to identify 'spiritual' matters. Dogma has these limitations: the newspapers are frequently to be seen featuring such tragedies as lead to 'sorrow in spiritual enterprises', generally because of this reason.\n6i0o | It has often been observed by Sufis that people who try to follow spiritual paths without the primary training of disengaging their pride frequently encounter sorrow and worse.\n54u3 | 'People who try to mould the world's evil ways' says Hasan of Basra - which to the Sufi includes one's own personality without doing it in correct sequence -'are ruined.'",
