        "content": "yj0m | One limitation of Carrera and Oceja's study is that retrospective, recall-based measures tend to be less accurate than those collected in real time as the emotional episode unfolds, in part because people can have trouble remembering their experiences of emotion. Thus, stronger tests of the vacillation hypothesis require online continuous measures of happiness and sadness. Studies one A and one B provided two such tests.\newfp | Study one A: The Button Press Measures\noczy | J. T. Larsen et al. developed online continuous measures of positivity and negativity by asking subjects to press one computer mouse button whenever they felt good during a computerized gambling task and another button whenever they felt bad. Subjects were also instructed to press both buttons if they felt both good and bad and neither button if they felt neither good nor bad. The gambles included several disappointing wins, which J. T. Larsen defined as good outcomes that could have turned out even better. Subjects spent more time simultaneously pressing both buttons after receiving disappointing wins than after receiving outright wins, which indicates that disappointing wins can elicit simultaneously mixed emotions. These data do not speak to whether people can experience simultaneously mixed emotions of happiness and sadness, however, because J. T. Larsen measured positivity and negativity in general, rather than happiness and sadness in particular. In Study one A we provided a strong test of the vacillation hypothesis by asking subjects to indicate whether they felt happy and sad with the button press measures as they watched a clip from Life Is Beautiful.\n2ttg | Method. Subjects were forty-seven Texas Tech undergraduates (twenty-one women; forty-five percent). In this and all studies, they received partial course credit for participating.\nhis3 | Subjects completed the study individually and watched the bittersweet clip or the control clip by random assignment. After providing the foreign language comprehension cover story, the experimenter asked subjects to hold the mouse in both hands, to press the left button with their left thumb whenever they felt happy, and to press the right button with their right thumb whenever they felt sad. The experimenter also mentioned that they should not press any buttons if they felt neither happy nor sad and that they should press both buttons if they felt both happy and sad at the same time. Throughout the clip, the experimenter observed subjects on a video monitor. If subjects removed one of their thumbs from the mouse button for more than thirty seconds, the experimenter asked them over an intercom to keep both thumbs on the buttons. Data from one subject were discarded because she ignored several such requests. The computer recorded all changes in the state of the mouse buttons. Offline, we determined whether each button was or was not being pressed every one hundred milliseconds.\nm50z | After subjects completed a film comprehension test, the experimenter conducted a funnel debriefing to determine whether sub-\nme84 | jects suspected that we were interested in mixed emotions. After explaining that psychology studies are designed to answer questions about how people think, feel, or behave, the experimenter asked subjects what they thought we were interested in. The experimenter then asked about why we might be interested in their emotions and why we asked them to report their happiness and sadness separately and continuously. The experimenter then told subjects that we were interested only in one thing and asked what that one thing might be. Finally, the experimenter told subjects that we were interested in something about their emotions and asked what that one thing might be. No subjects suspected that we were interested in mixed emotions.\no56m | The experimenter also asked subjects whether they thought they were allowed to press both buttons at the same time. Data from three subjects, six percent, who had watched the control clip were removed because they did not think they were allowed to do so. None of these subjects ever pressed both buttons, so excluding them worked against the hypothesis that people who watched the control clip would report less mixed emotions. In all, data from four of forty-seven, nine percent, subjects were excluded.\nslz6 | Results and discussion. The proportion of subjects who reported happiness and who reported sadness at each moment of each clip is shown in Figure three. People who watched the control clip often reported happiness during the first eleven minutes and rarely reported sadness. During the final eight minutes, they rarely reported happiness and often reported sadness. People who watched the bittersweet clip often reported happiness during the first three minutes and rarely reported sadness. In addition, they often reported happiness at several points during the remaining seventeen minutes even though they often reported sadness throughout that portion as well.\n90k5 | To further examine how evocative the clips were, we computed how much time each subject pressed each button. We submitted these data to a two clip control bittersweet by two emotion happiness sadness mixed-model analysis of variance, where clip was a between-subjects variable. The analysis of variance revealed a main effect of clip, such that subjects reported more emotion during the bittersweet clip\n9m8s | Control Clip\n893y | The main effect of clip was qualified by a clip by emotion interaction. Follow-up T tests indicated that the bittersweet clip elicited more sadness than the control clip, but no more happiness,",
