You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

wh96 | Secure Base Reflection Questions
2ukf | In each of your relationships that are attachment-based, or for the relationships that you would like to become more attachment-based, ask yourself:
jtpi | . How is this partner already acting as a secure base for me?
ysej | . What does growth look like for me? Is it usually a shared or a personal expe- rience, or both?
mj7h | . Are there other ways that I want encouragement or support in my individual growth or with my visions and dreams?
3avc | . How could my partners support me in regard to my other relationships?

pnz1 | . How could | better show genuine interest or curiosity in things that are important to my partners?
0jt4 | . How could I better support my partners in their other relationships?
mk0a | A benefit of nonmonogamy is that you don't have to provide or expect to receive all of this from one partner. Different partners can be more of a safe haven, a secure base or both, offering different facets of each. We all have different strengths and it can be wonderfully satisfying to have some partners that support you in safe haven ways, while others offer more of a secure base.
zn35 | When I first began presenting at nonmonogamy conferences, I was nervous. I had experience presenting in academic settings and in leading workshops, but the conference format was different. I didn't know whether the nonmonogamous audi- ence would connect with what I was talking about (I was presenting on emotional triggers, so in retrospect it was a slam-dunk topic for nonmonogamous folks). At this time, I was still nursing my infant son on demand, so being away from him for more than three or four hours felt like a big deal. I needed both emotional support and logistical help with my son. Thankfully, I had two different partners who could take on these roles for me.
rrn2 | My co-parent (and husband at the time), Dave, was an amazing secure base. He cleared his day to be with our son and gave me the freedom and encour- agement to go rock it as a presenter. He reassured me that my son would be fine while I was gone and that he wouldn't starve if he couldn't nurse at the exact mo- ment he wanted to. Dave reminded me to remember to have fun while I was pre- senting, which was precisely what I needed to hear right before I gave a talk. In this incident, he was the secure base that I needed to be able to confidently turn away from my family and go take a risk in the larger world. However, since he was care- taking our son, he was understandably not available for any of the safe haven types of emotional support that I also needed. This is where my other partner, Sam, stepped in. Sam wasn't able to be at the conference with me, but they made them- self available to talk on the phone right when my talk was done. They were excited to hear about my experience and gave me their full attention as I debriefed every- thing I needed to. In that instance, Sam was my safe haven. I could let my guard down with them, lean into them, and experience being accepted with love, warmth
foid | and attunement. Both partners came through for me exactly how I needed, and nei- ther needed to be or do more than they did.
152h | On a separate but similar note, I presented the information in this chapter at a different polyamorous conference and bumped into an attendee from that confer- ence several months later. She told me that after hearing my talk, she realized that all three of her current partners were a safe haven for her, but that none of them were really functioning in secure base ways. This person was fulfilled and content with how her partners were showing up for her, so she decided not to request that any of them take on more of a secure base role. She also felt that it wasn't neces- sary to take on a fourth partner who could provide a secure base. Instead, she de- cided to start acting in more secure base ways for herself, which she did by encour- aging her own growth and expansion. In just a few short months she started a blog that she had long thought about and also bought and renovated the vintage car of her dreams. To me, this demonstrates the importance of how we do not always have to turn to our partners to meet our safe haven or secure base needs, espe- cially when our pre-established relationship dynamics are working well. We can focus on cultivating a more secure attachment with ourselves, which is one of the pillars of being polysecure. Chapter Nine focuses on the importance of being our own safe haven and secure base, so that we can better establish a secure attach- ment with our self. When attachment ruptures and traumas occur, we can lose ac- cess to the parts of ourselves that are able to be a safe haven through self- soothing, self-nurturance, self-compassion and self-acceptance, and to the parts of us that are able to be a secure base through self-encouragement, healthy stan- dards, appropriate boundaries and alignment with our values. While having mul- tiple partners to turn to for a secure base or safe haven is a definite benefit of non- monogamy, we can't forget how powerful and important it is to also rely on our self in these ways.
jvjk | CHAPTER EIGHT THE HEARTS OF BEING POLYSECURE
s2v8 | NOW THAT WE'VE COVERED being a safe haven and secure base-the two broader strokes of being polysecure-I want to focus on some more specific things you can do to cultivate being polysecure in your multiple relationships. I've combed through the literature on the conditions needed to create secure attachment in adult romantic relationships and considered what I've experienced and witnessed in the polyamory partnerships that I've counseled. The result is the acronym HEARTS, which I use to encapsulate the different ingredients, skills, capacities and ways of being required for secure functioning in multiple attachment-based part- nerships.
m2uh | HHere (being here and present with me) EExpressed Delight AAttunement RRituals and Routines TTurning Towards after Conflict SSecure Attachment with Self
erho | The first five letters in HEARTS cover the relational level of being polysecure. When explaining these, I suggest different behaviors and practices that you can exper- iment with and take on in your attachment-based polyamorous relationships. The S in HEARTS focuses on the individual level of being polysecure. I have dedicated the whole next chapter to this, where I will guide you through suggestions and prac- tices for applying HEART to yourself. An important caveat is that you do not need to be perfect in all of these things all of the time, but my hope is that if you prioritize these things at the heart of your relationships, you will discover beautiful and pow- erful ways to thrive in love.
