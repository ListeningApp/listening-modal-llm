You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

1ujy | Farquhar & Busch (2017) did not estimate quantitatively the extent of the explanation.
qzor | The modelled <LATEX>b _ { 1 } : b _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratios were lower than the observed <LATEX>b _ { 1 } : b _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratios shown in Table 2. Our prediction used measured <LATEX>C _ { i }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> as input and took the effect of <LATEX>g _ { m }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { \star }</LATEX> into account, and therefore the effects of varying <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> were already considered in the modelling. This suggests that the plot of the modelled <LATEX>b _ { 1 } : b _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratios vs the <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> ratios should reflect the com- bined effect of both varying <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> and varying <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } } .</LATEX> The intercept of the plot for the modelled <LATEX>b _ { 1 } : b _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratios vs the <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> ratios was again close to 1; but its slope was 0.944 (Fig. 5b), much lower
a0by | than 2.559 - the slope of the observed <LATEX>b _ { 1 } : b _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratios vs the <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> ratios (Fig. 5a). As the intercept remained unaltered, this indi- cates that the combined contribution of varying <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> to the observed Kok effect can be estimated from slope values, that is, c. 36.9% <LATEX>\left( = 0 . 9 4 4 / 2 . 5 5 9 \times 1 0 0 \% \right) .</LATEX> Therefore, the effect of varying <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> alone explained c. 25.3% (36.9-11.6%) of the observed Kok effect across various <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> concentrations and various temperatures.
u1ky | Quantifying the maximum extent of inhibition of day respiration by light
htm9 | Our modelling procedure aimed to quantify the contribution of <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> and varying <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } } ,</LATEX> and therefore, as is the usual case, assumed that <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } } \mathrm { a n d } f _ { \mathrm { a c t } }</LATEX> did not vary with irradiance or with measurement <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> conditions. The remaining unexplained contribu- tions (c. 63%) must be a result of light inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> and
8hul | possibly variable <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { a e t } }</LATEX> and/or <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 } .</LATEX> We are not able to separate the contribution of light inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { 4 }</LATEX> from the effect of variable <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { a c t } }</LATEX> and/or <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 }</LATEX> if the variation of <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { a c t } }</LATEX> and/or <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 }</LATEX> with irradiance can- not be ruled out. If we assume that the variation of either <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { a c t } }</LATEX> and/or <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 }</LATEX> with irradiance is negligible with the limiting light range, as is often assumed in measuring <LATEX>\Phi _ { \mathrm { C O 2 } } ,</LATEX> we can quantify the real inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> by light by removing the effect of chang- ing <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c } ,</LATEX> as described in the following. As such, this esti- mate should be considered as the maximum real inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { 1 }</LATEX> by light.
87vz | The apparent relative inhibition in case of the Yin method is:
ym66 | <LATEX>\mathrm { I n h i t i o n } _ { \mathrm { a p p a r e n t } } \left( \% \right) = \frac { R _ { \mathrm { D 1 m e a u r c d } } - R _ { \mathrm { D 2 m e a s u r c d } } } { R _ { \mathrm { D 1 m e a s u r c d } } } \times 1 0 0 \quad \mathrm { E q n } 4</LATEX> The similar apparent relative inhibition can be proposed for the Kok method. The apparent inhibition was higher according to the Kok method than according to the Yin method (Fig. 6a), owing to the fact that the Kok method ignores the decrease of <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> with irradiance. Overall, the Kok method overestimated the apparent inhibition of <LATEX>R _ {</LATEX> by <LATEX>\mathcal{C} .</LATEX> 18%, as compared with the Yin method.
