However, such models are inherently limited; non-human animals lack the rich conceptual and linguistic processing of humans (and probably even have restricted emotional reactions compared with us). An additional source of inspiration are the effects of brain damage on human behaviour and cognition. In both cases, facts about neuroanatomy, particularly connectivity between areas, should have a crucial role in theory development. However, in the end we must pull ourselves up by our bootlaces. We must devise theories, test them, revise, and test again, keeping our eyes open for the unexpected all the while, just as in any other branch of science.\noae5 | Neuroimaging is an enormously exciting field because of the possibility of new discoveries about fundamental relations between mind and brain, and the chance to make concrete what have hitherto been very abstract ideas. However, if we are to do this correctly, we must know what questions we are asking and just how far we can go in answering them with these techniques. Simply finding that certain areas of the brain are active when someone performs a task is not enough.\n```",
