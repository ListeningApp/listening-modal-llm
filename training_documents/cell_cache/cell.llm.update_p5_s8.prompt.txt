You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

g9du | It might seem that with more sensitive analysis, the ZGA timing in other mammals would shift into earlier stages and the minor ZGA could occur as early as in mice. In fact, Xue et al. reported minor ZGA in human 1-cell embryos [15]. However, there are two arguments against this possibility. First, some of the evidence for early human genome activation is possibly an experimental artifact, especially when the analysis is restricted to polyA RNA (Fig. B). Second, the whole transcription correlation data paint a different picture when comparing mice with human or bovine early embryos (Fig.)
f682 | The mouse model is exceptional in that minor and major ZGA produce distinct sets of RNAs that are separated by the cleavage between 1-cell to 2-cell embryos. This can be visualized as a dif- ference in developmental stage transcriptome correlations when
li1k | separating exon and intron NGS data in mice (Fig.). When such analysis is done on mouse NGS, intron data show that the 1-cell zygote is already establishing a "zygotic" nature. This is apparently because introns in maternal mRNAs were already spliced out and degraded while nascent transcripts transcribed at the 1-cell stage come often from genes expressed at the 2-cell stage, but never from oocyte-specific genes. At the same time, exon data from the 1-cell zygote show its "maternal" identity (because of the high abun- dance of residual maternal mRNAs). However, such a phenomenon is not observed in bovine early development (Fig.) where one can- not place a clear boundary between minor and major ZGA. Bovine and human early embryos exhibit the major shift between maternal and zygotic transcriptomes at 8-16 cells and 4-8-cells, respectively (Fig.), indicating a later onset of major ZGA in these species com- pared to mouse.
pbea | Mice thus activate their genomes fast (in terms of cleavage stages) and their minor and major ZGA waves are separated by the first cleavage event. This appears as a novel feature that evolved in the mouse lineage while the delayed major ZGA observed in humans and bovine could be the an ancestral trait. It also seems that transcriptional activation in other mammals is more incre- mental during the early cleavage divisions than the two bursts of transcription in 1-cell and 2-cell mouse embryos.
ccpt | 8. ZGA and the nature of the "zygotic program"
0fpw | While the set of genes that are transcribed during early devel- opment can be described by transcriptome profiling, the entirety of the "zygotic program" remains poorly defined. In mammalian development, the priority of the post-fertilization "zygotic pro- gram" is establishing totipotency, i.e. the ability to develop in all cell types, including extraembryonic tissues. During subsequent embryonic lineage commitment [77], the totipotency is reduced to pluripotency, i.e. ability to give rise to all cell types within the developing embryo, but not extraembryonic lineages. Thus, for oocyte-to-embryo reprogramming, three types of transcription programs (or transcription factor networks) can be distinguished:
dqn8 | maternal -the oocyte transcription factor network includes oocyte-specific proteins such as FIGLA, NOBOX, LHX8, SOHLH1/2, FOXO3A (reviewed in [78]), which are responsible for accumula- tion of maternal mRNAs. As mentioned above, NGS data suggest that germ cell-specific transcription factors, which control expres- sion during oocyte growth, do not contribute to ZGA in mouse embryos [65]. This implies efficient removal or repression of these transcription factors during ovulation and after fertilization. For example, NOBOX becomes undetectable in already preovulatory oocytes [67]. In contrast to somatic cells, where transcription fac- tors are retained on mitotic chromosomes and mark promoters for transcription following entry into interphase, this is not the case for condensed metaphase II chromosomes [79].
cop0 | zygotic totipotent -a transcription factor network which forms in mice during the 2-cell stage by maternally-provided zygotic genome-activating transcription factors and transcription factors expressed during minor and major ZGA. It is poorly understood how oocytes produce transcription factors that would be recruited for genome activation while not contributing to transcription in the oocyte. While an obvious candidate mechanism is dor- mancy, where translationally repressed mRNAs become translated in response to developmental stimuli (reviewed in [80]), dor- mancy of maternal transcription factors acting in ZGA has not been explored. Nevertheless, cloning experiments document that the oocyte's ability to reprogram gene expression of a somatic nucleus into a totipotent state resides in the cytoplasm [81,82]. The totipotent program forms before lineage commitment and is responsible for the totipotency of early embryo blastomeres. It

qy1i | is unclear whether this transcription program can exist as a sta- ble program as it has two transient components: transcription factors encoded by maternal RNAs and by genes silenced at the end of the 2-cell stage. Interestingly, analysis of ESCs revealed a minor subpopulation of cells with 2-cell-like expression pattern (e.g. expressing MuERV-L) suggesting that the zygotic totipotent program might be induced in cultured cells) [83].
1k9e | embryonic pluripotent - this transcription factor network is equivalent to that of ESCs and gives cells their pluripotent prop- erties (reviewed in [84]). A subset of these transcription factors, the famous "Yamanaka" factor combination of Pou5f1, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, is sufficient to reprogram gene expression and induce pluripotency in differentiated somatic cells [16]. Importantly, the pluripotent program is inter-related with the zygotic transcription factor network because its formation is initiated during ZGA (Fig.).
5bjs | The set of transcription factors and binding sites in the regu- lated genes that constitute mammalian <LATEX>\mathrm { Z C A }</LATEX> is poorly defined, but details of these gene regulatory networks are emerging. A part of the mammalian ZGA gene regulatory network appears to be the pluripotency network [85]. This raises the question to what extent is ZGA related to induction of the core pluripotency net- work. The answer is that although the major ZGA and induction of the core pluripotency network have some overlap, the two events are distinct. The contribution of core pluripotency factors to mam- malian major ZGA seems small judging by the frequency of known binding sites of the core pluripotency factors [86] in proximity of genes transcribed during major ZGA (Svoboda and Franke, unpub- lished observation). Furthermore, zygotes lacking both maternal and zygotic Oct4a expression can still activate the genome and form a Nanog-expressing inner cell mass [87]. This situation con- trasts with zebrafish where a conserved core network component consisting of Nanog, Pou5f1, and SoxB1 family members represent >75% of transcripts during the first wave of zygotic gene expression [88].
