You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

3g9w | The surface expression of hydrothermal precipitates cov- ers ~77,000 m2, including ~ 13,800 m2 of active chimneys and mounds, 51,800 m2 of inactive chimneys and mounds, and 9,300 m2 of partially buried chimneys and mounds (Fig. 2). Areas of low-temperature venting, dominated by Fe and Mn oxides, occur over an additional 130,000 m2 (91,000 m2 of Fe oxides and 38,000 m2 of Mn oxides), although these areas commonly overlap those of the chimneys and mounds. The area of subseafloor sulfide mineralization is not completely known, so the full size of the deposit could be much larger. The areal extent of this deposit is significant compared to others discovered along mid-ocean ridges and along arcs and back-arc basins; fewer than 10% have dimensions larger than 5,000 m2 (Hannington et al., 2010). Modern sulfide deposits with comparable sizes (by area) include the Solwara 1 deposit in the Eastern Manus basin (90,000 m2) and the Mir zone, Ashadze-1, and Ashadze-2 deposits on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (50,000 m2 each) (Hannington et al., 2010, 2011). It should be emphasized, however, that the large areal footprint of the Tinakula deposit may not necessarily correlate with a large tonnage of massive sulfide.

ylhz | Ship-based multibeam bathymetry operating at 50 kHz (RESON SeaBat 8160) was collected over 685.6 km2 in the Starfish-Tinakula area, and the data were gridded with a cell size of 50 m. Higher-resolution bathymetry was collected over ~2.2 km2 that includes the Tinakula deposit, using an ROV-mounted multibeam system (RESON SeaBat 7125- ROV2 at 400 kHz with inertial navigation) and gridded with a cell size of 0.2 m. Bottom observations and grab samples were collected during 13 ROV dives. Shallow seafloor drilling,

ex5k | including push-coring and rotary diamond drilling, was car- ried out using the Benthic Geotech portable remotely oper- ated drill PROD-3. Approximately 270 m of drill core was logged and sampled to establish between-hole correlations along the length of the NS-trending eruptive fissure (sites A-D; Fig. 2; App. Figs. A2-A18). Mineralogical and chemi- cal data are reported here on 41 ROV grab samples and 21 drill core samples of chimney and mound material and on 61 drill core samples of clay-altered volcaniclastic rocks. Pol- ished thin sections of the sulfide-sulfate chimney samples and epoxy-impregnated clay-altered volcaniclastic samples were prepared by Dettmar Dissection Technology (Bochum,
9d4o | Germany). Clay-altered samples were cut using an industry- standard water-free technique that employs kerosene in order to prevent clay swelling, slaking, and dissolution of anhydrite. Thin sections were analyzed by transmitted- and reflected- light microscopy.
cjq2 | Whole-rock geochemistry was determined on 45 bulk samples of sulfide-sulfate material and 47 samples of fine (<63 um) clay-altered volcaniclastic material at Activation Laboratories (Ontario, Canada). For the sulfide samples, a sodium peroxide fusion was used; major elements (Al, Ca, K, Mg, P, Si, Ti) were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma- optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and trace elements

For the clay-altered samples, a lithium metaborate/tetraborate fusion was used; the major elements (SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3(T), MnO, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O, TiO2, P205) were analyzed by ICP-OES, and trace elements (Ba, Be, Bi, Co, Cs, Ga, Ge, Hf, In, Mo, Nb, Rb, Sr, Ta, Th, Tl, U, V, W, Y, Zr, REEs) by ICP-MS, with additional elements (Ag, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) analyzed by ICP-OES following a total acid digestion technique. In both sample types, cold-vapor atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) was used to determine Hg; infrared (IR) detection was used to determine total S. Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) was used to determine Au, Ag, As, Ba, Br, Cr, Fe, Hf, Ir, Lu, Na, Sb,

76b0 | Sc, and Zn in the sulfides and Au, As, Br, Cr, Ir, Sc, Se, and Sb in the clay-altered samples. Duplicates and standard ref- erence materials were analyzed after every 10 to 15 samples and indicated a precision of better than 10% and accuracy of better than 5% for most elements in samples where the ana- lytical values are well above the limit of detection, with values degrading rapidly as the limits of detection are approached.
zxz6 | Sulfide mineral compositions were determined in 16 sul- fide-sulfate samples using a JEOL-JXA 8200 electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) equipped with five wavelength dis- persive spectrometers and one energy dispersive detector at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel. A 15-keV accelerating potential and 50-nA probe (cup) cur- rent were used for the analyses. Standards used were chalco- pyrite (FeKa, SKa, CuKa), rhodonite (MnKa) gallium arsenide
xnth | (GaLa, AsKB), sphalerite (ZnKa), silver telluride (AgLa), indium antimonide (InLa, SbLa), cadmium sulfide (CdLa), gold (AuLa), cinnabar (HgMa), and galena (PbMa).
vafm | Alteration mineralogy was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of bulk samples of the altered footwall rocks. Fine (<63 um) and coarse (>63 um) fractions were separated by wet sieving, followed by separation into silt (2-63 um) and clay (<2 um) by settling in cylinders of standing water, fol- lowing the technique of Moore and Reynolds (1997). The mineralogy of the <2-um clay fraction from 58 samples was determined using a Philips PW 1710 X-ray diffractometer, equipped with a Co tube and an automatic divergence slit and monochromator, located at GEOMAR. Operating conditions were 40 kV and 35 mA. Oriented mounts were prepared by wet suspension followed by air drying and were measured with a 20 scanning angle of 3º to 40° at a scan rate of 1 s per 0.01° step. Samples were then saturated with ethylene glycol following a standard vaporization technique and reanalyzed. MacDiff v.4.2.6 software was used for mineral identification and display of the XRD data.
2zmw | Short-wave infrared (SWIR) reflectance spectroscopy was also used to identify alteration assemblages and compositional variations in the altered footwall rocks. Spectral measurements of fine (<63 um) fractions were conducted using a Fieldspec® Pro spectroradiometer at the University of Ottawa, with a spectral bandwidth of 3 to 10 nm and a scan time of 100 ms. Duplicate measurements were made for every sample; white reference measurements were made every fifth sample. The data were normalized, and mineral phases were automatically identified using The Spectral Geologist (TSG) 7 software and a built-in reference library (e.g., Jinfeng et al., 2014). The spectra were then manually assessed to confirm mineral iden- tifications based on the shape and wavelength minima of the absorption features.
bf9k | Five samples consisting of hydrothermally altered and sul- fate-cemented volcaniclastic material were selected from drill hole TKAD001 for fluid inclusion studies. Doubly polished thick sections (~130 um) were prepared at Dettmar Dissec- tion Technology using a water-free technique. Fluid inclusion petrography in barite, anhydrite, and sphalerite is described in detail in Anders (2016). Microthermometric measurements were made on a Linkam™M THMS 600 heating and freezing stage at GEOMAR. Salinities were calculated from freezing- point depression values following Bodnar and Vityk (1994). Homogenization temperatures were corrected for pressure at the sample depth (1,107.61 m b.s.l .; 108.65 bar) follow- ing Zhang and Frantz (1987). Accuracy was determined by measuring phase transitions in synthetic fluid inclusions (Syn Flinc®); replicate measurements of homogenization and freezing-point depression temperatures were performed every five to 10 analyses, resulting in estimated errors of less than ±0.2℃ for salinity measurements and ±4℃ for homoge- nization temperature measurements. The critical points, bulk molar volumes, densities, and isochores were calculated using the program FLINCOR (Brown, 1989).
otkr | Oxygen and hydrogen isotope analyses were performed on 14 samples of monomineralic clays (<2 um), free from Fe and Mn oxides as determined by XRD. The analyses were car- ried out by the Queen's Facility for Isotope Research (Queen's University, Ontario, Canada). Oxygen was extracted from
ibgs | 5-mg samples at 550° to 600℃ using the BrF5 technique of Clayton and Mayeda (1963). Samples were analyzed via dual inlet on a Thermo-Finnigan DeltaPlus XP isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). For hydrogen isotope measurements, samples were weighed into silver capsules, degassed for 1 h at 100℃, and then crushed and loaded into a zero blank autos- ampler. Hydrogen isotope compositions were measured using a Finnigan thermos-combustion elemental analyzer (EA) coupled to a Thermo-Finnigan DeltaPlus XP continuous-flow IRMS. All values are expressed in the conventional ò notation as per mil (%0) deviation from V-SMOW (Vienna-Standard Mean Ocean Water), with analytical precision and accuracy for 8180 values of ±0.1%% (lo) and for OD of ±3%% (lo) and ±1.5%% (lo), respectively.
