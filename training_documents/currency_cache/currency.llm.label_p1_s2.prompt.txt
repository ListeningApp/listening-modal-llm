You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before.

b8r7 | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT
38m6 | Abstract
hffd | Local currency holds promise for relieving poverty while enhancing social capital and helping communities meet goals. In spite of this, governmental policies have created barriers to its full success. This paper examines local currency from a community development perspective, reviews the policy environment in the United States, and identifies policy changes that can support local currencies. Four major types of local currency-proxy, fiat, local exchange trading systems, and time banks-are described. Federal policy barriers in the U.S. Constitution, statutes, and tax regulations as well as state prohibitions to local currency are examined.
29tz | Introduction
vfdc | Throughout American history, local communities have promoted the wellbeing of their members by developing and utilizing economic, social, environmental, and human capital (Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011). Local governments and community-based organizations engage in community development to provide economic opportunities, safe environments, education, and social support (Fisher, 2005; Preston, 1991; Vargas-Hernández & Noruzi, 2010). Two important community development approaches are people-centered and bottom-up (Kang, 2011). People- centered community development emphasizes local control and self-efficacy. Bottom-up community development arises from the citizens and is based on local resources and perspectives. These approaches allow communities to tailor initiatives to their visions and values.
4lum | In impoverished locales, one of the major challenges of community development is the lack of financial resources (Community Development Foundation, 2010; Weyers & van den Berg, 2006). To the frustration of concerned citizens, there may be resources available in the community-underemployed individuals with available time, vacant lots that could become

psc7 | community gardens, yoga classes with room for more students-yet there is not enough money to engage this capacity (Eisenstein, 2011; Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011). Vacant lots stay vacant, classes stand empty, and human potential remains underutilized. A study of community development corporations (CDCs) in Detroit, Michigan, (Silverman, 2003) found they faced difficulty funding their initiatives. Many of the CDCs reported that available grant funding did not match the true needs of their communities. Instead, the CDCs molded their missions to meet funders' visions; this "top-down nature of the grant process" (p. 2743) precluded CDCs from setting their own community-based agendas, impeding people-centered and bottom-up approaches to community development.
6d4z | Since 2011, federal funding for many community programs such as tutoring, job training, education, and meals for elderly citizens has been cut (Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013; Budget Control Act of 2011; Liberto, 2013; Matthews, 2013). The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development reduced spending on Community Development Block Grants, which are designed to encourage citizen participation and improve low- to moderate-income communities, from $4.45 billion in 2010 to $2.798 in 2014 (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, n.d.). Even public libraries are experiencing lean times, requiring cuts to collections, staff, and hours of operation (Hoffman, Bertot & Davis, 2012). Though much of the funding for social services still originates from the federal government, increased responsibility is being placed in the hands of local communities. However, smaller geographies are often at the mercy on the national and global economy and have limited influence on their own economic wellbeing (Eisenstein, 2011; Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011).
2ww3 | A people-centered, bottom-up tool that has the potential to give local communities more control over their development efforts is local currency (Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011). Described

7h2f | in detail below, local currency can take a variety of forms and operates in conjunction with the national currency. Local currencies have existed in the United States since colonial times (Solomon, 1996b) and recent decades have seen a resurgence in their use. In 1991, the Ithaca HOURS printed currency was introduced in Ithaca, NY (Raddon, 2003). Since then, over 200 local currency systems have started in the United States (Collom, 2011). Though touted as way to reduce poverty and empower individuals and communities, local currencies are often inhibited from fully flourishing by governmental policies. This paper examines local currencies from a community development perspective, reviews the policy environment in the United States, and identifies policy changes that can support local currencies and their promise for community development and poverty reduction.
td95 | Local Currency as a Community Development Tool
9rkk | Local currencies are a form of complementary currency that operate in conjunction with national legal tender and are not intended to supplant it, but to complement it. From airline mileage points (Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011) to the online currency Bitcoin (Nakamoto, 2008), complementary currencies facilitate the exchange of goods or services. Local currencies are a specialized type designed as a public good in geographic areas to help promote community goals for cultural, human, social, and economic capital and infrastructure (Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011).
el7h | Like community gardens and alternative financing, local currency is a part of a re- localization movement and aspires "to increase exchange activity at the local level and support all of the positive cultural and social outcomes of greater local employment, mutual self-help and cooperation" (Raddon, 2003, p. 43). Local currencies are crafted to reflect the unique characteristics of a community because backing a currency with local goods or services promotes those products. For example, a community currency in Philadelphia bases its currency creation

2lig | on volunteerism ("Equal Dollars," n.d.) and a food-based currency in Montpelier, VT, increases supply and demand for locally produced food (Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011).
3b9j | The literature indicates that local currency helps develop social and human capital (Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011; Williams, 1997). Local currency has been shown to build relationships and increase social support (Graugaard, 2012; Jacob, Brinkerhoff, Jovic, & Wheatley, 2004; Nakazato & Hiramoto, 2012), increase community pride (Graugaard, 2012; Jacob et al., 2004; Raddon, 2003), help people develop new skills (Jacob et al., 2004), and enhance personal growth, wellbeing, and mental health (Graugaard, 2012; Lasker et al, 2011; Letcher & Perlow, 2009; Richey, 2007). Promoters of local currencies also see them as a way to improve economic conditions and resiliency, support community values, empower communities and citizens to meet specialized as well as basic needs, and assist economically marginalized citizens (Collom, 2005; Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011; Seyfang, 2002). Economic resiliency and monetary theory suggests community currencies have the potential to make a significant economic impact (Graugaard, 2012; Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011). Research has shown modest, though important, economic effects including increased local wealth, improved business infrastructure and local economy, and altered spending patterns (Graugaard, 2012; Solomon, 1996b; Williams, 1997). Nonetheless, scholars concur that in the present policy environment, local currencies face barriers to increasing their economic impact beyond a small to moderate scale (Eisenstein, 2011; Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011; Schroeder, Miyazaki, & Fare, 2011; Solomon, 1996b).
cyef | Currency Designs
bcz3 | There are many ways to design local currency. In the United States, communities select designs to reflect their goals and values, while operating within the boundaries of state and
y4ss | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT
ihy3 | federal policy (Solomon, 1996b). There are four basic types: (1) proxy, (2) fiat, (3) local exchange and trading systems (LETS), and (4) time banking. To better understand the effects of policy on local currency, a brief description of each type is provided.
pjrx | Proxy currencies are pegged to, backed by, and exchangeable for the national currency (Eisenstein, 2011). They stimulate the local economy through supporting buy local campaigns and raise awareness of local businesses. They have been promoted as a way to increase the tax base and create jobs (New Economy Coalition, 2013). The BerkShares currency in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, is a proxy currency. One-hundred BerkShares can be purchased for $95 U.S. at participating local banks (New Economy Coalition, 2013). BerkShares are recognized by local businesses as having the same value as a U.S. dollar, an incentive which provides a built-in discount for patrons using BerkShares.
z9ml | Local Fiat Currencies are not backed by a currency or commodity (Solomon, 1996b). They are put into circulation through member enrollment, no-interest loan programs, or other agreed upon conditions. The worth of a fiat currency is established by the willingness of users to agree to it as a means of exchange and a measure of value. Local fiat currencies can give unemployed and underemployed individuals increased earning, and thus spending, opportunities. In addition to stimulating the local economy, they help promote community values (Eisenstein, 2011; Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011; Solomon, 1996b). For example, they can be can be issued to participants in health promotion events, community arts projects, environmental cleanup activities, or any type of activity that the community chooses to sponsor (Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011). The Equal Dollars currency in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is a local fiat currency (New Economy Coalition, 2013; "Equal Dollars," n.d.). Equal Dollars are issued when members create accounts and volunteer with local service organizations. They can be spent at an online
evmg | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT
ajzn | marketplace, farmers' market, consignment store, community bicycle program, and other local businesses. Equal Dollars provides low-income individuals with access to necessary goods and services while supporting human service organizations, promoting healthy behaviors, and stimulating the local economy.
gpc2 | Local Exchange and Trading Systems, or LETSs, are mutual credit systems used for the exchange of goods and services. Though not common in the United States (Collom, 2011; Solomon, 1996b), LETSs are perhaps the most prevalent type of local currency in the world (Schroeder et al., 2011; Seyfang, 1997). Upon joining a LETS, members have an account balance of zero. At the point of purchase, the buyer's account is debited and the seller's account is credited for the purchase amount in the currency of the system. Fourth Corner Exchange, a for-profit LETS in Bellingham, WA, coordinates trades using Life Dollars (Fourth Corner Exchange, n.d.). It has a social justice-based mission and has facilitated the exchange of over $1.4 million of goods and services since its inception in 2004 (Fourth Corner Exchange, n.d.). Green America Exchange is run by a non-profit association of 3,000 socially and ecologically conscious business members (Green Business Network, n.d). It uses "Trade Dollars" and a system of buyer and seller ratings and reviews (Green America Exchange, n.d.).
4h3w | Time banking systems are similar to LETSs, but instead of an exchange currency, the unit of account is time (Cahn, 1999). Members offer and seek services in a directory and exchange hours of service throughout the network. In time banking systems, every member's time is valued equally. This egalitarian system is intended to support the "[c]ore [e]conomy of home, family, neighborhood and community" (Cahn, 2001, p. 2) and values domestic and service work. Time banking builds relationships and helps people with low incomes (Eisenstein, 2011). Time banks are prevalent in the United States (TimeBanks USA, 2013). In 2009, the City of
7vce | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT
g3ed | Montpelier, VT, spearheaded the creation of the REACH (Rural Elder Assistance for Care & Health) Care Bank (Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011) which focused on personal health and wellness services for elders in the community (City of Montpelier, 2009).
4evh | Policy Environment for Local Currency in the United States
8zr0 | Although many citizens may be unacquainted with local currency, many forms of it are legal in the United States (Solomon, 1996b). Federal law permits private entities to issue currency; however states (U.S. Const. art. I, §10) and local governments (The Mayor v. Ray, 1873) are not allowed to create currency. This is unfortunate for local currencies because municipal governments have staffing, community relationships, citizen communications, infrastructure, and experience in navigating federal regulations and are well positioned to be successful currency managers. Urban geographer Michael Pacione (1997) argues that "currency issued by a public authority, such as a municipal government, is ... likely to attract a high level of credibility particularly if it can be used to pay fees and taxes" (p. 68).
cytw | Designed as a socially responsible public good, a local currency may be administered by a tax-exempt non-profit organization. Operating as a recognized non-profit organization is beneficial in terms of federal policy. For local fiat currency systems that are not pegged to the U.S. dollar, operating as a non-profit allows the currency organization to be exempt from the Securities Act of 1933 (Solomon, 1996a). Without this exemption, currency organizations would have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, abide by disclosure, privacy, and other administrative requirements, and pay related fees (Securities Act of 1933). For time banks and LETS, the IRS has provided private guidance that operating as a non-profit is a condition which might help ensure a time bank is not considered a "barter exchange" (Swennen, 2012), thus avoiding additional 1099-B reporting responsibilities under the U.S.
4cck | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT
pcqv | Treasury regulations (26 C.F.R. § 1.6045-1). Though nonprofits may gain trust and promote community values (Solomon, 1996b), without sufficient resources they may face difficulties in administering local currencies. In fact, nonprofit currency managers often rely on volunteer staffing and tend to use on word-of-mouth advertising rather than employing more professional marketing methods (Lepofsky & Bates, 2005; Seyfang, 2002; Williams, 1997).
