You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ww6u | Therefore, we get (using t from Output 13.8) values of 0.40 for the covariate, and 0.48 and 0.11 respectively for the comparison of the 30-minute group and control, and the 15-and 30-minute groups:
hpi6 | <LATEX>r _ { \text { Covariate } } = \sqrt { \frac { 2 . 2 3 ^ { 2 } } { 2 . 2 3 ^ { 2 } + 2 6 } } = \sqrt { \frac { 4 . 9 7 } { 3 0 . 9 7 } } = 0 . 4 0</LATEX> <LATEX>r _ { \text { 30 minsvs. control } } = \sqrt { \frac { \left( - 2 . 7 7 \right) ^ { 2 } } { \left( - 2 . 7 7 \right) ^ { 2 } + 2 6 } } = \sqrt { \frac { 7 . 6 7 } { 3 3 . 6 7 } } = 0 . 4 8</LATEX> <LATEX>r _ { 3 0 \text { vs. } 1 5 \text { mins } } = \sqrt { \frac { \left( - 0 . 5 4 \right) ^ { 2 } } { \left( - 0 . 5 4 \right) ^ { 2 } + 2 6 } } = \sqrt { \frac { 0 . 2 9 } { 2 6 . 2 9 } } = 0 . 1 1</LATEX> (13.10)
4uhb | For the effect of the covariate and the difference between the 30-minute and control groups the effects are not only statistically significant but also substantive in size. The difference between the 30-and 15-minute groups was a fairly small effect.
epyi | 13.11 Reporting results
y51p | When using covariates you can report the model in much the same way as any other. For the covariate and the experimental effect give details of the F-statistic and the degrees of freedom from which it was calculated. In both cases, the <LATEX>F -</LATEX> statistic was derived from dividing the mean squares for the effect by the mean squares for the residual. Therefore, the degrees of freedom used to assess the <LATEX>F -</LATEX> statistic are the degrees of freedom for the effect of the model <LATEX>\left( d f _ { M } = 1 \right.</LATEX> for the covariate and 2 for the experimental effect) and the degrees of freedom for the residuals of the model <LATEX>\left( d f _ { R } = 2 6 \right.</LATEX> for both the covariate and the experimental effect) - see Output 13.6. The correct way to report the main findings would be:
x95m | The covariate, love of puppies, was significantly related to the participant's happiness, <LATEX>F \left( 1 , 2 6 \right) = 4 . 9 6 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>p = 0 . 0 3 5 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>r = 0 . 4 0 .</LATEX> There was also a significant effect of puppy therapy on levels of happiness after controlling for the effect of love of puppies, <LATEX>F \left( 2 , 2 6 \right) = 4 . 1 4 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>p = 0 . 0 2 7 ,</LATEX> partial <LATEX>\eta ^ { 2 } =</LATEX> 0.24.
yfum | We can also report some contrasts (see Output 13.8):
ppx4 | Planned contrasts revealed that having 30 minutes of puppy therapy significantly increased happiness compared to having a control, <LATEX>t \left( 2 6 \right) =</LATEX> -2.77, <LATEX>p = 0 . 0 1 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>r = 0 . 4 8 ,</LATEX> but not compared to having 15 minutes, <LATEX>t \left( 2 6 \right) =</LATEX> -0.54,

6zah | had been easy to dismiss Brian at first, he'd seemed like a loser, a waste of her time. But there was more to him than that: he'd been working hard to learn statistics, and he'd made impressive progress. She liked how awkward he was around her, and how he always defaulted to talking stats. It was endearing. It could derail her research, though, and he could never know about that. She was a monster, and if he found out the truth it would be another let-down. Best to keep her distance.
4v5o | The phone rang. It was her brother, Jake. She loved and admired Jake like no one else. Until he left home, he'd been her sanity in the madhouse that they grew up in. Their parents, both highly successful academics, were at home only long enough to pile the pressure on them both to succeed. Jane reacted by spending her youth in books, in a futile pursuit of their attention. Every set of straight As was met with 'these are just a step towards the exams that really matter, you'll need to up your game'. She was tired of trying to impress them. Jake was her opposite - he'd realized early on that he could never win. He let the pressure roll off him, and left home as soon as he could. But he always looked out for Jane.
ha9e | 'Mum is in hospital,' he said as the blood drained from Jane's legs.
xrnt | 'I don't care,' she replied, but she did. She also wanted to see Brian, because he was the closest thing she had to a friend in this town.
c8ra | 13.13 What next?
p1l0 | At the age of 13 I met my heroes, Iron Maiden, and very nice they were too. I've met them a couple of times since (not because they're my best buddies or anything exciting like that, but over the years the fan club put on various events where you were allowed to stand next to them and gibber like a fool while they humoured you politely). You'll notice that the photo at the start of this chapter is signed by Dave Murray. This wasn't possible because I had my own darkroom installed backstage at the Hammersmith Odeon in which I could quickly process photographs, or because I had access to time travel (sadly), but because I took the photo with me when I met him in 2000. I recounted the tale of how terrified I had been about meeting him in 1986. If he thought I was some strange stalker he certainly didn't let on. Uncharacteristic of most people who've sold millions of albums, they're lovely blokes.
