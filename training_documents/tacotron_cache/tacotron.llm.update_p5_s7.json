        "content": "nv42 | We use R equals two (output layer reduction factor) for the MOS results in this paper, though larger R values (e.g. R equals five) also work well. We use the Adam optimizer with learning rate decay, which starts from zero point zero zero one and is reduced to zero point zero zero zero five, zero point zero zero zero three, and zero point zero zero zero one after five hundred thousand, one million and two million global steps, respectively. We use a simple L one loss for both seq two seq decoder (mel-scale spectrogram) and post-processing net (linear-scale spectrogram). The two losses have equal weights.",
