The native helical fragments at N-terminus for the analyzed A three, C nine, and D eleven clones were quite affected. Nevertheless, undisturbed amplification and titration of these clones exclude the significant impact of additional fragments on bacteria recognition and infection, consistent with the literature reports. N-terminus of cardiac TnT is a long, helical structure exposing polar residues outside the helix, according to in silico simulation of appropriate sequence.\nrzhj | Article\nbfax | Phage Concentration Determination Using ELISA.\nf2y8 | Non-specific protein immobilization at the liquid/solid interface (of a microtiter plate) is one of the most commonly used methods of preparing wells for ELISA. This immobilized target is recognized by soluble molecules like antibodies or peptide-displaying phages. Stages of ELISA, which assumes specific recognition, may be described using a modified Langmuir-like isotherm. It should be noted that this model cannot be applied for initial non-specific precaution. Since wells are coated with TnT molecules and the number of available target molecules (active sites), they may bind a limited number of phages. Moreover, the number of bound phages limits the amount of bound horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. The surface density of horseradish peroxidase enzyme (i.e., the amount of horseradish peroxidase immobilized on the liquid/solid interface) is a crucial factor affecting the rate of substrate (three, three', five, five'-tetramethylbenzidine, TMB) oxidation. The reaction rate may be expressed by the rate of the change of absorbance at three hundred seventy nanometers (which is the maximum absorption of the yellow byproduct) under the assumption that the kinetics of the enzymatic reaction is zero order (Michaelis-Menten model and enzyme saturation). In this case, the measured signal is the enzyme activity defined as the slope of the linear time function of absorbance (equation thirteen).\no7qm | Enzyme activity is proportional to the amount of bound horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and indirectly to the number of bound phages (equation fourteen). When the reaction is stopped by the addition of sulfuric acid, the enzyme is denatured. As a result, the blue complex dissociates into a yellow product (adsorption maximum at four hundred fifty nanometers) and transparent TMB.\nd52l | A three hundred seventy nanometers equals a.t plus constant. (thirteen)\nqlbb | a equals f(O horseradish peroxidase) equals f(CM thirteen) (fourteen)\nnhsg | The application of kinetic-based ELISA (also shortened to k-ELISA) was previously described and developed by several authors. The signal recorded in this way has significant advantages such as independence from time-shifting, path length, wells material heterogeneity, and air bubbles. Single-data-point absorbance reading is easier and more high-throughput but generates a higher error.\nhy0l | Figure three presents calibration curves for detecting the A three variant (as an example) and wild-type M thirteen phage. Analysis for\n4jmz | the A three clone gave the calibration curve as y equals zero point zero zero one zero x plus zero point zero zero zero six and R squared equals zero point nine nine six one, indicating specific interaction with the studied target, while for the wild-type variant, it was y equals zero point zero zero zero six x plus zero point zero zero one three and R squared equals zero point six three two three. Such a low R squared coefficient may suggest mainly non-specific interaction of the wild-type phage. For the A three, we also calculated sensitivity to be zero point two six four times ten to the nine abs.mL.pfu to the negative one.min to the negative one. The empirically found range of the linearity of the signal enables the calculation of Ka via ELISA. In this range, da/d(CM thirteen) equals the constant value of sensitivity calculated above. The range of the linearity limits and indicates the range of analysis. To maximize the reproducibility of experiments, we decided to work with a phage concentration of about one point zero to ten point zero times ten to the nine pfu per mL, which corresponds to about one point six to sixteen pM.\nb7cq | Determination of Ka via k-ELISA. ELISA (also k-ELISA) can be used to measure the dissociation constant (Ka), which is commonly applied to describe affinity. According to the mathematical model presented above, the Ka value can be calculated via pre-incubation of a receptor with varied concentrations of ligand and subsequent detection of the soluble receptor (phage) via ELISA. This approach was\n0b39 | Article\nqecd | adapted and applied to evaluate the affinity of several phage-derived ligands but without a theoretical analysis and fulfilling fundamental Friguet's assumptions. In these papers, phages were treated as monovalent receptors while they are tri to pentavalent (due to a varied number of p three protein per phage particle). Moreover, the authors applied a wide range of ligand concentrations, high excess compared to the receptor and treated the concentration-signal function as logarithmic, while the discussion above concluded that it is not possible to apply Frigeut's method for almost completely saturated receptors (due to ligand excess).\n1o7p | In our work, analysis was performed for clones: A three, B seven, D eleven, and wild-type M thirteen. These clones were selected for further analysis because they exhibited the highest affinity in screening and could be easily amplified; therefore, the C nine clone was not chosen. The phages' total concentration was about one times ten to the ten pfu per mL (sixteen pM) and was carefully determined using the biological method immediately before analysis. The range of ratios of total TnT and total phage concentration was one to two, one to one, two to one, and four to one. Increasing TnT concentration causes an increase in the saturation of phage-displayed receptors. As a result, a decrease in the ability to bind to immobilized TnT molecules occurs. Experimental data were analyzed according to the presented mathematical model. Calculated values of Ka (from linear slope regression) are listed in Table three.\n```",
