You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

2285 | numerical investigation of Richards and Uang [51], subsequent experimental studies by Okazaki and his colleagues [29, 31] on wide-flange links constructed from A992 steel confirmed that the above relaxation can be safely applied to short links. However, Okazaki et al. [29, 31] observed strength degradation due to flange buckling in some of the intermediate link specimens. Taking into account previous studies [10, 29, 31, 51] it was permitted as per AISC 341-05 [69] to use moderately ductile flanges for I-shaped links with the slenderness limit of <LATEX>0 . 3 8 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } }</LATEX> only in short links <LATEX>\left( \rho < 1 . 6 \right) .</LATEX> It should be noted that in the numerical study of Richards and Uang [51] and also the recent tests of Okazaki and his colleagues [29, 31] no axial force was imposed on the links. Nevertheless, the above relaxation in the flange slenderness requirements includes all shear yielding links regardless of the level of axial force.
ys0g | Based on the results obtained from an exhaustive numerical parametric study containing more than 200 analyses as well as a subsequent experimental study, Berman and Bruneau [48, 49] concluded that the flange slenderness of built-up box links should be limited to <LATEX>0 . 6 4 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } }</LATEX> . Until 2005, this limit was the seismically compact limit for walls of rectangular HSS members as per AISC 341 [69]. However, in 2010 the more stringent limit of <LATEX>0 . 5 5 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } }</LATEX> was adopted by AISC 341-10 [3] for flanges of highly ductile built-up box sections, which is the case for tubular links.
7zvp | In general, compact webs are used in links to prevent or delay the deteriorative effect of web buckling [3]. Berman and Bruneau [48, 49] suggested that the web slenderness for built-up box shear links should be limited to <LATEX>1 . 6 7 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } } .</LATEX> However, this limit was reduced to <LATEX>0 . 6 4 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } }</LATEX> for intermediate and long built-up box links in which local buckling of both webs and flanges can cause strength degradation [48, 49].
ww6u | 3.2. Web Stiffeners
hpi6 | The proper use of end and intermediate web stiffeners in links is a major parameter for achieving stable and controlled hysteresis behavior. End stiffeners are usually full-depth stiffeners provided for all link length ratios located on both sides of the web at link ends. In 1977, Roeder and Popov [4] provided the rationale for the necessity of using end stiffeners to ensure local stability at a brace-link-
4uhb | beam connection panel. In the previous and current EBF specifications (e.g. [12, 72-74]) the use of end stiffeners has always been mandatory with an aim of improving the link shear force transfer to reacting elements as well as preventing premature local buckling in links.
epyi | In the early experiments by Popov and his colleagues (e.g. [6, 75]) it was observed that in short links tearing of web and severe strength degradation usually occurred shortly after web buckling. Although in some tests (e.g. [6]) a considerable amount of energy was also dissipated by the link in the post-buckling phase, since post-buckling behavior and its subsequent failure are difficult to predict and more hazardous, web buckling is generally considered as the design ultimate state for short links [6, 7, 75]. Popov and his colleagues [6, 18, 75] demonstrated that providing intermediate stiffeners could substantially improve the strength and energy dissipation capacity of links. In 1983, Hjelmstad and Popov [7] proposed the first relation for determining the required intermediate stiffener spacing based on the expected energy dissipation of a link. However, later tests by Kasai and Popov [10] demonstrated that such a relation does not exist and instead, the required intermediate stiffener spacing is dependent upon the expected ultimate link rotation, Yu. In 1986, Kasai and Popov [75] proposed a conservative spacing formula for intermediate stiffeners using a cyclic plastic theory and the experimental data obtained from tests [15] on short links constructed from A36 steel. The stiffener spacing was expressed as a function of the depth of the I-shaped link and its web thickness for three different ultimate rotations. The maximum spacing allowed for the intermediate stiffeners of short links per AISC 341-10 [3] is based on this proposal with slight modifications. It is worth noting that a number of recent studies [31, 34] have mentioned that the shear link stiffener spacing requirements of the AISC Seismic Provisions [3] are somewhat conservative and might be relaxed if justified by further experimental research.
y51p | Malley and Popov [9] investigated the required area and moment of inertia of link intermediate stiffeners using Basler's theory for plate girders [76] and the approach adopted by Bleich [77]. The requirements proposed by Malley and Popov [9] were not included in AISC 341 [3, 68, 69], and instead, the regular requirements of plate girder web stiffeners were recommended for determining the required moment of inertia of link stiffeners with the addition of a minimum thickness limit. Bruneau et al. [50] further discussed this issue and mentioned that the previous reasonable performances of
x95m | EBFs designed as per AISC 341 [3, 68, 69] indicate that the recommendations of Malley and Popov [9] were based on overly conservative assumptions.
yfum | Intermediate stiffeners are also required in links with flexure-dominant behavior. The comprehensive experimental study by Engelhardt and Popov [11, 64] on long links revealed that, unlike shear links, local buckling of flanges will not necessarily cause strength degradation in stiffened long links. It was concluded that placing stiffeners at a distance of 1.5bf from each end of the link, while not preventing flange buckling, would limit the strength loss due to flange buckling [64]. The large scale pseudo-dynamic tests by Tsai et al. [65] indicated that such stiffeners may still be beneficial if substantial axial force is also available in the link. Engelhardt and Popov [64] also mentioned the beneficial effect of placing stiffeners outside the link region, in the brace-link-beam connection panel. Furthermore, it was concluded that intermediate links, which will experience both shear and flexural yielding, should have intermediate stiffeners at 1.5bf from the link ends, and also equally spaced additional stiffeners through the link length based on the requirements of short links. These recommendations have generally been adopted by AISC 341-10 [3]. However, the provisions require no intermediate stiffeners when the link length ratio (p) is larger than 5.0.
