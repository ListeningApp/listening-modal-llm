One image that kept occurring to me was two birds in flight, with the difference in their altitude representing the difference in their polyamorous experiences. My wife constantly soared higher than me, and at times I felt as though she'd lose sight of me, abandoning me for others and other experiences.\n5hiy | The concept of a vessel came about during one of my therapy sessions with Jess. I realized that it was the expansion of the number of partners that my wife had that was more anxiety-producing than the depth and closeness that she had with her current partners, which for me was beautiful and non-threatening. It was the anticipation of the breadth of partners that was triggering me, not depth.\nghiq | The vessel that my wife and I negotiated was four months long, where she continued to be with her two other partners in addition to me, but she would not add any new partners to our polycule. The idea was she could experience as much depth in those months with the two partners as she wanted, but she wouldn't look to expand her breadth with new partners during this time.\nytlm | When she fully consented I immediately relaxed. With her on board, I stopped trying to manage her polyamory, and I was able to in earnest do the hard emotional healing and attachment work that I needed to do to better ground and align myself. I entered into a short, but beautiful, relationship of my own, and spent much less time worried about the distance between us in flight, and focused on keeping my flight steady and with less turbulence. That said, the negative aspect of the vessel was the truth that I had put rules around how my wife could practice poly, and I had to sit with this. On balance I'd say the pros definitely outweighed the cons. Before the vessel I wasn't even sure if we could stay married.\nfg9j | There was definitely some angst on my end when the vessel's period came to an end, but having an end time was important for a few reasons: it gave me the opportunity to test my newfound alignment, which lifted my self-esteem; it allowed for us\nwt58 | to practice polyamory in a less hierarchical way that is important for my wife's ability to have her own agency; and it gives us a moment in time that we can reflect back to with gratitude. It was a very helpful tool, not a permanent design.\ngcgx | The wife:\nxeng | Coming up with the vessel was an important turning point for us. It gave us a temporary container to get into a secure place, which was highly needed. For me the pros of the vessel were:\njf2c | . The vessel allowed my husband space to catch his breath, which had a big impact on me.\n9qk9 | . It gave me a concrete way of showing my husband I care about his needs and feelings. It was a way for me to show him that he is a priority to me.\nmki0 | . I was no longer crossing unspoken boundaries and therefore triggering my husband. So, for the first time, I had clear boundaries to follow!\ndin5 | . It increased the security of my husband and my attachment to him.\nqc24 | . The vessel made a dramatic decrease in my husband being triggered, which was the most amazing thing.\nktw4 | . We were losing each other, and with the vessel we were able to be \"us\" again.\n0wr0 | For me the cons of the vessel were:\n01xg | . When my other relationships were not going as great and my husband's other relationships were going fabulously, I struggled with resentment in having the vessel.\ni6d2 | . It was challenging for me interacting with people who were outside the vessel, but whom I already had varying degrees of an established romantic or sexual relationship with.\nlg8p | Given the pros and the cons, in the end, it was the right choice for me, him and us. Staying Open with No Restrictions:\n3fo4 | When polyinsecurity is at play, another option is to not change anything, staying\nbs9g | completely open to current and potential new partners while simultaneously working through attachment insecurity. To be honest, I have not yet seen this work in more severe cases of attachment insecurity, but I have seen it work when people are experiencing mild to moderate attachment insecurity. I've also seen this work when:\nwyx9 | . Individuals and partners are getting professional support for their attachment struggles.\nlmig | . Partners are highly motivated to work on their own attachment insecurity and are willing to do the HEARTS of being polysecure together.\n63vd | Partners are able to prioritize time together to do the needed healing work.\nihsk | FINAL WORDS\nyohk | Thank you for coming on this journey with me! While this book has now come to an end, I hope that your journey has not. For all the things that I have included in the book, there are just as many things that I have not, and I know with certainty that as the book finally goes off to print I will undoubtedly wake up in the middle of the night tormented by additional edits I should have made or entire sections that I should have added.\n0qgi | We have covered several different aspects of attachment, trauma, non-monogamy and what you can do to become more polysecure. It is my hope that this book will have an influence on our understanding of attachment and trauma by articulating the different levels at which they are experienced. The nested model can be applied to many other areas of identity and marginalization.\nawut | I hope that this book will challenge the monogamous presupposition that attachment theory primarily functions under and that some of the concepts covered are beneficial to people both monogamous and nonmonogamous. Cultivating secure attachment with ourselves is a universally applicable concept, not just for people wanting to be polysecure, but for anyone wanting to have more fulfillment, security and empowerment with themselves and in their relationships, whatever their form.\npjzb | There are still many questions regarding the attachment experiences of polyamorous partners that need to be researched and answered. In particular, I hope that this book will encourage others to pursue further research into how early childhood attachment does or does not correlate with being nonmonogamous as an adult, how long-term polyamorous partners experience attachment throughout the lifespans of their multiple relationships and how the initial attachment challenges that we face when transitioning to nonmonogamy possibly create post-attachment growth, similar to how trauma can initiate positive post-traumatic growth.\na2ry | I know this book is not a panacea for everything related to attachment, trauma or nonmonogamy, but my hope is that it has given you enough insight, perspective and guidance on how to move forward from here. I also hope that you were able to see yourself reflected on some of these pages and that you have more clarity and compassion for yourself, your partners and your metamours. Although the wounds of your past may run deep and you may have had experiences that left you feeling broken, worthless, invisible, unloved or unaccounted for, healing is not out of your reach. I will not lie: the work to heal our personal traumas and attachment wounds and the effort needed to build polysecure relationships are not easy. It takes courage, devotion and perseverance, but please trust me in knowing that it is worth it. As we heal our past, we open up new possibilities for our future, and so it is also my hope that you are able to forge a new path forward, seeking any further support you need and relating to yourself and your loved ones in ever more polysecure ways.\n8zhz | NOTES\n```",
