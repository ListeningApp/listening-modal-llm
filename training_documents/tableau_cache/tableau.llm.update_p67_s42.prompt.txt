You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

mkzd | We have no reason to load rows with null values. Therefore, we can filter them as follows:
uhjq | 1. In the upper-right corner under Filters, click on Add.
6sbj | 2. Click on Add again.
d8m4 | 3. Select the field that you wish to filter. (We filtered on Measure).
x6o5 | 4. Since Measure is a measure and not a dimension, we see a continuous spectrum of values. But we want to include everything except null values.
iw9a | 5. Click on the Special button on the upper-right side.
dni7 | 6. Click on Non-null values.
uhfc | 7. Click on OK.
x4b2 | 8. Click on OK again.
pbg2 | The data source shows values of zero, but not null. The data source is almost complete. The only item that is remaining before we can start using filter is joining it with another table in the same data source.

lr84 | Joining tables
0vq1 | In this exercise, we will join the fact table with a dimension of the countries so that we can group the countries by region. A join is a logic statement in which you tell Tableau's data engine how two tables are related to each other. There are two parts to it, the join types (the left join, inner join, right join, or outer join) and the join conditions.
gkya | . The left join: This keeps all the records from the left (or first) table and the corresponding records from the right (or second) table.
c2iz | . The inner join: This keeps only the records from both the tables that match the join condition.
ya41 | . The right join: It is the opposite of the left join; it keeps all the records from the right table and only the corresponding records from the left table. Outer joins keep all the fields from all the tables.
aa56 | [ The availability of join types depends on your data source. For this data source, we can create an inner join or a left join.
qfgp | A join condition is where you tell Tableau Public's data engine, which is functioning as a database management system in this case, how the two tables are related. In order to join tables, you need to have at least one field whose contents occur in both tables. In the following example, we will join our tables by the country name so that we can see the corresponding region for each country.
yu1c | ]
1j33 | Tableau Public will automatically join your tables on the first fields that occur alphabetically in both the tables and have the exact same field name and field type.
k3a8 | In order to add new tables, you need to drag them from the list of tables on the left into the workspace next to the existing tables:
2s31 | 1. Drag the Country Metadata table into the workspace and drop it next to the Environmental Fact Table.
otwe | 2. Tableau Public automatically detects the field that occurs first in both data sources alphabetically and has the following properties:
4cb7 | ° The exact same field name, including capitalization and punctuation
9wka | ° The same field type

e8ks | 3. You can view and edit the Join details by clicking on the Venn diagram icon between the tables, as shown in the following screenshot. In this case, our data sources are joined by Country Code, which is correct. In order to select different fields, click on the name of the joined field and replace it with someone more appropriate:
072r | 4. When you are satisfied that the join condition is correct, click on the Venn diagram icon again.

mjm3 | . The additional fields, with their source table name appended in parentheses, are included in the data set below the workspace.
lji8 | 5. Just because a field is included in a join condition, it does not mean that you need to load it in the workbook. You also do not need duplicates of existing fields. For that reason, click on the Country Name (Country Metadata) and Country Code (Country Metadata) fields, which already occur in the fact table, and from their context menus, select Hide, as shown in the following screenshot:
cser | 6. If you would like to see the fields that you have hidden, click on the checkbox next to the Show Hidden Fields text above the data source.

dm7r | The data source is now ready to be used in a visualization. To create a visualization, click on a sheet number or name in the ribbon at the bottom. If you'd like to get back to the data source, you can click on the data source icon from any worksheet.
4j98 | When you load a new data source, the following are some of the several items that you should check before you can use it:
98sg | · Confirm that all the dimensions, are in fact in the Dimensions pane, rather than in the Measures pane
9c31 | . Confirm that the data source types of all the fields are correct. For instance, in this data source, Year is formatted as a string, but it really should be a number

zqx9 | Connecting to web-based data sources
87zy | The steps required to connect to OData are different from the steps required to connect to the previously mentioned sources because they involve web servers and network security. These steps are a subset of the steps in Desktop Professional that are used to connect to a server:
g2ke | 1. Enter the URL of the website.
ek4d | 2. Select the authentication method.
odgr | 3. Establish the connection.
vbm1 | 4. Name the data source.
smtx | Connecting to Data
7euw | Another big difference between using local sources and online sources is that while the local sources can be refreshed with just a right-click on the data source name, online sources must connect to the website, which needs to be refreshed.
ysjg | In order to refresh a web-based data source, perform the following steps:
8zjq | 1. Right-click on the data source name in the data pane.
r9c6 | 2. Click on Edit Connection.
h1z1 | 3. In the previous dialog box, which will be populated with the connection parameters, click on the Connect button in step 3 of the preceding list. It isn't necessary to repopulate the connection parameters or create a new connection to refresh the data.

u37t | Summary
989u | In this chapter, you learned one of the most critical concepts of using Tableau Public and producing accurate, informative data visualizations- connecting to, transforming, and loading data. The precepts that we discussed, such as making sure that your data source is clean and formatted properly, are relevant to working with data.
bfwg | In the next chapter, we will discuss the different types of visualizations that you can make with your data and how to use each type correctly and in the most compelling manner.
o74e | 4 Visualization - Tips and Types
1638 | A journalist or blogger who uses Tableau Public must convert data to visualizations so that readers can quickly understand large quantities of data that have been distilled down to a single graphic. The role of an author is data abstraction, the conversion of real-life data into visual cues (primitives, as some people who work in the field of data science call them), such as colors, shapes, lengths, and positions. The role of your reader is to do the reverse, consume data primitives and convert them back into real-life things, events, and phenomenon. If you have done a poor job choosing the elements of your data visualization, your readers will have a difficult time relating your visualization to the real world, which means that the story that you're telling isn't as compelling as it should be. Your visualization will not have the value that you wanted, because the connection between the data visualization and the underlying data has been broken.
80ko | Before you create a visualization for people to utilize, there are several considerations that go into the design. The following are some of these considerations:
