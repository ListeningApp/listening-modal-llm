You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

524j | Most film studies and media studies students are familiar with the formal codes of film language - editing, framing, camera movement, lighting, sound, etc. These formal aspects of cinema work together to make meaning in ways that are familiar, or conventional, to media consumers. Consequently, it makes sense to speak of the cinema as having its own 'language'. Paradoxically, media and film studies courses involve a process of helping students to recognise (and talk about) the codes and conventions that they already know. Most students know how to 'read' the conventional codes from which a cinematic text is constructed, which is why they can enjoy these texts prior to studying them. In similar fashion, most English- speaking children can understand and tell stories in English long before they have ever heard of a preposition, a pronoun, an epithet or a metaphor. To study film form without engaging in critical analysis of its messages and values is analogous to studying English grammar without ever studying English literature. The former is about understanding the structure of the language, the latter is about the various uses to which this language is deployed within social or political contexts.
xd3m | No dichotomy between form and content need be presupposed. It is common to conceive of form as a container and content as something more substantial contained within it. This distinction is questionable, however, when we consider how the formal components work together as a 'meaning system' to create the whole pattern that is perceived. Subject matter and abstract ideas are an integral part

wkbn | of the total system of the text. They may influence our expectations or cue us to draw certain inferences. The subject matter and abstract ideas take on a meaning that is specific to the work. For example, a historical subject such as 'the Vietnam war' is not content-neutral but is placed in relationships with other elements. Platoon (1986) is a story about two regiments of American soldiers. It addresses moral questions about individual conscience versus group loyalty and patriotism; it questions the legitimacy of authority, racism, xenophobia and the American soldiers' experience of disillusionment. All of these issues are woven into the fabric of the film's formal codes of meaning. Apocalypse Now (1979) or The Deer Hunter (1978) may have the same subject matter, and yet be shaped quite differently by the film's formal construction and our perceptions of it.
ftfg | Since films are human artifacts, film-makers cannot avoid relating their works to the social, political, historical and visual culture in which they are situated. Existing works, or aspects of existing works, influence the development of new ones. Traditions, popular forms, trends and styles develop through the imitation and repetition of certain elements. These common modes of representation become conventional or generic. The relationship between the artwork and the world in which it is situated is a reciprocal one. Conventions and genres may influence the artist's output, but likewise the artwork produced from this matrix of meaning becomes a part of the matrix that will influence other artists, and our perception of 'reality' itself.
7xi5 | Cinematic texts do not give us direct access to the world. Although cinema generally attempts to imitate 'real life', it presents us with a constructed world, fabricated through a carefully selected set of representations. Students might be asked: what version of 'normality' is offered in the film? What threatens this normality? What oppositions are established? The answers to these questions shape our ways of thinking, and so our very perception of the world. Often it is unclear whether art imitates life, or life imitates art. Films may reflect or inject values, myths and ideologies. Students should be encouraged to interrogate the social functions of our stories and myths.
w8r5 | Gendered film studies looks at cinematic codes and narratives not just as a language but as discourse. Ideas about discourse can be traced to the French philosopher Michel Foucault (1926-84). Foucault introduced the idea that language, far from being neutral, creates meaning by the ways in which it is used and, in particular, the ways that it is used to wield power. Discourse analysis allows students to recognise film language as a medium through which relationships of power between different groups are maintained, reinforced, exposed, subverted or re-negotiated. Such analysis encourages students to question how ideas are represented systematically. It also sheds light on the struggle over ideas represented by competing discourses.
ybik | STUDYING FEMINIST FILM THEORY
gii5 | This book will help teachers explore the various ways in which ideas about gender have been represented in the predominant Hollywood narrative tradition. This tradition represents a hegemonic system of meaning. The notion of hegemony can be traced to the Italian theorist Antonio Gramsci (1891-1937). Gramsci argued that control by one minority social/political group or ideological system over its rivals need not involve force, since people can just as easily be lulled into compliance by a powerful set of messages, to which they consent in the belief that they are 'better off'. The idea of hegemony allows for flexibility in ideas over time, although always with the same group in power. According to Gramsci, the dominant groups constantly adapt their messages in order to inject them with fresh appeal in order to maintain the consent of those they dominate. The major Hollywood studios have been described as hegemonic because of the power they exert through their overseas trade organisation, the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America). No one literally coerces audiences to consume Hollywood films. However, in reality we have little choice since Hollywood dominates the market. Even if we may disagree with, say, the pro-American (perhaps even xenophobic) subtext of many Hollywood action films, we nevertheless feel that we are 'better off' consuming the box office hits than missing out on the hyped films that command public attention (and box office takings).
q5eu | Since the sexual revolution (and global visual media explosion] of the 1960s, sex is more than what we do in private to make babies. Sex is not just a biological fact; it is an idea, or set of ideas, about men, women, biology, the 'natural', the 'normal', the 'perverse', etc. It is a public concept, constructed and consumed in a proliferation of contexts. It is no longer just a biological category, but a constructed category of experience that functions within historical, political, religious and cultural contexts. This does not mean that there is no biological dimension to human sexuality. However, the biological dimension is open to multiple interpretations. This book examines the role of institutional practices and discourses in the formation of ideas about sexuality.
a7ao | Feminism, strictly speaking, is a doctrine or movement that advocates equal rights for women. This is what the word denotes. Denotation is the 'common sense' definition or meaning of a word. Connotations, by contrast, are implicit or suggested meanings that are not a part of the literal meaning of a word.
29a3 | If this riddle stumps students, then the point is clear - the word 'surgeon' must carry the secondary connotation 'male'. The solution, of course, is that the surgeon is the boy's mother. But often people get hung up trying to figure out how the boy could have two fathers because they automatically assume that surgeons are male.
sb1e | STUDYING FILMS
w2yn | Connotations are associations or ideas that are somehow conjured up by a word in the minds of people who interact with it, even when that word or sign bears no literal relationship to those ideas. For example, the word 'maiden' connotes modesty, but that is not part of the word's definition. Red roses conjure up ideas about romance, despite there being nothing in the definition of a red rose that automatically makes it 'romantic'. When you hear the word 'feminist', what comes to mind? It is rather strange that the word 'feminism' has become loaded with negative connotations.
