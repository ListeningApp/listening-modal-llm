Assume that f satisfies Assumptions three point one and three point seven. Suppose that a Type I step is taken on iteration k of Algorithm Two so that A of x of k, delta of k is not empty and either seven a or seven b is unsatisfied. Let alpha of k be the largest step size satisfying the line search condition eleven so that x of k plus one equals P of x of k plus alpha of k p of k. If A of x of k, delta of k is not empty and norm g of k to the power of I norm is less than or equal to epsilon of k to the power of three-halves, then k,\nl47i | f of x of k plus one minus f of x of k less than negative rho minimum of one-half, minimum of one, sigma minimum of two times one minus rho divided by L of g, delta of k divided by epsilon of k to the power of three-halves minimum of one, epsilon of k squared divided by two delta of k squared epsilon of k squared.

Since alpha of k satisfies the line search sufficient decrease condition, the negativity of inner product g of k to the power of I, p of k to the power of I, implied by nineteen and twenty-one, gives\n0ml0 | The analysis proceeds depending on which optimality condition is unsatisfied.",
