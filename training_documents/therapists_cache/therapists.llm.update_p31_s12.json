Normalize the client's experience or connect him with social or physical resources that will enable him to have equal access and opportunities (e.g., inform the client that the desired chair represents a reasonable accommodation and connect him with a well-known disability rights organization for assistance).\n0a03 | d. Ask questions or engage in a discussion that leads the client to think about alternative ways of approaching the situation (e.g., create a list of options for actions that might be taken to address this situation and analyze the viability of each option with the client).\nauae | Three. You are working with a seventy-four-year-old homemaker and accountant from a rural community. She has invested her entire life in raising a family while simultaneously operating a successful part-time tax-assistance business from home. Until now, she has been in perfect health and has never experienced any injuries or impairments. Newly referred for rehabilitation and having successfully accomplished all of the activities thus far, she is clearly frustrated and demoralized over the difficulty that she is having making a toilet transfer. After two transfer attempts, she tells you that she knows she cannot do it, and that she is going to end up in a nursing home. She is concerned that she won't be able to return to her home, where she has lived for thirty years. Most individuals with her level of impairment are eventually able to return to independent living and are able to make the transfer. Please rank-order each response according to the following scale:\n5b6y | a. Assume a clear leadership role by providing the client with information, structure, guidance, or constructive feedback (e.g., tell her that learning a transfer requires practice and review the steps that you have already taught her thus far).\n1y10 | b. Normalize the client's experience or connect her with social or physical resources that will enable her to have equal access and opportunities (e.g., tell the client that her frustration is normal and that most clients on the unit feel this way when they are first learning the transfer).\n6mnx | c. Witness, listen to, and show full acceptance of the client's thoughts, feelings, or behavior (e.g., ask the client to tell you more about her frustration to get a better understanding of her concerns).\ntynp | d. Provide the client with hope or positive feedback and generally show a positive attitude or emotions (e.g., tell her that you know that she will eventually learn to make the transfer because you have noticed her strength and success with equally difficult tasks).\nob0u | Four. You are working with a studious and well-liked thirteen-year-old client with cerebral palsy you have worked with for the past two years. She tells you she is feeling hurt and betrayed by something she overheard one of her friends say to another peer at school today in reference to her disability. Because of the presence of many bullies and a lack of appropriate disciplinary oversight, her school is a socially tough environment for many students. Though she is quite gregarious and popular with most of her peers, this is not the first time that she has been hurt by jokes and disparaging comments by peers and\n50o1 | others in public through the years. Please rank-order each response according to the following scale:\ncw76 | a. Normalize the client's experience or connect her with social or physical resources that will enable her to have equal access and opportunities (e.g., tell the client about a peer network of other students with disabilities who have also endured bullying and are proud of their identities and of what they have achieved; offer to connect her to other students living in her area).\nlkk5 | b. Give the client total and complete control over the situation (e.g., ask the client what she thinks would be most helpful to her at this time).\nmolj | c. Provide the client with hope or positive feedback and generally show a positive attitude or emotions (e.g., remind the client that she is one of the more popular students in her class; also remind her of all the positive things you know that her other friends say about her on a regular basis).\n5pto | d. Witness, listen to, and show full acceptance of the client's thoughts, feelings, or behavior (e.g., tell her that she has a right to feel betrayed and ask her to tell you more about the people and circumstances involved).\nmo6k | Five. You are working with a twenty-six-year-old, recently divorced truck driver who is recovering from internal injuries and multiple abrasions and fractures to his left hand, arm, and leg. His injuries occurred during a post-divorce party with friends that involved drinking and riding jet skis. In the middle of an uncomfortable icing treatment on his hand, he tells you that none of his friends have visited him in the hospital and that he feels very anxious about how dependent he has become on the hospital staff. He is worried about losing his job, being alone, and how he will get by once he returns to his home. Please rank-order each response according to the following scale:\nzh6q | a. Provide the client with hope, positive feedback, and generally show a positive attitude or emotions (e.g., point out the client's strengths, highlighting all of his good progress thus far; remind him that as his functioning improves, he will begin to build increasing confidence about returning home and eventually getting back to work).\nkp04 | b. Assume a clear leadership role by providing the client with information, structure, guidance, or constructive feedback (e.g., educate the client about the course of rehabilitation, emphasizing that he will not be discharged from the hospital to outpatient and work rehabilitation until he feels confident about his abilities and is assessed by the treatment team to be ready and safe for such).",
