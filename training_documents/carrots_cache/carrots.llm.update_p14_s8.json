        "content": "l52l | As we explained in Part I.B.2, common-shareholder approval may be necessary to conduct a trade sale. In particular, such approval will be necessary if one, corporate law or the acquirer requires common-shareholder approval, and two, the VCs fail to negotiate effective drag-along rights enabling them to force the common shareholders to vote for a VC-favored sale. If neither corporate law nor the acquirer demands common-shareholder approval (or the VCs have effective drag-along rights), then common shareholders cannot threaten to hold up the deal through their voting rights.\nda2f | B. Fiduciary-Duty and Other Litigation\njht5 | To try to block a deal, common shareholders can also threaten to sue the board or the VCs directly for, among other things, breach of fiduciary duties under corporate law. Common shareholders' litigation leverage will depend in part on the corporate laws of the state in which the firm is domiciled. The\nds3e | CARROTS AND STICKS\nvqlk | easier it is to demonstrate a breach of fiduciary duty under that state's corporate law, the more leverage common shareholders will have.\nwyka | But there are two limitations to common shareholders' ability to credibly threaten litigation. First, aggrieved common shareholders will often lack the financial ability to sue VCs. Second, there may well be large reputational costs to litigating against VCs. All in all, the actual likelihood of litigation will probably be low.\na4c9 | Board Influence\nl9xk | A third mechanism by which common shareholders can impede a trade sale is by asking their representatives on the board (if there are any) and any independent directors (if there are any) to vote against the transaction. Common shareholders will have considerable influence on how the board votes if a majority of the board's seats are held by a combination of common-shareholder representatives and independent directors. Indeed, given directors' preference for unanimous board votes, even a stubborn minority of directors who care about the interests of common shareholders might be able to block a sale that is unfavorable to common shareholders.\n2i5s | Three VCs' Potential Carrots and Sticks\njcnk | In Part Two, we saw that founders, other executives, and common shareholders of VC-backed startups may have the incentive and ability to resist a trade sale. In this Part, we describe the carrots and sticks that VCs can use to induce founders and other executives (subpart A) and common shareholders (subpart B) to go along with trade sales. Subpart C explains that, from the VCs' perspective, both carrots and sticks entail costs.\ni86t | CARROTS AND STICKS\n6zpg | A. Founders and Executives\nbzrb | To induce founders and other executives to facilitate rather than impede a trade sale, VCs may either offer carrots or deploy various sticks.\ncdge | For founders and other executives, the VCs can use direct carrots (management bonuses) or indirect carrots (carve-outs to common shareholders).\np6no | a. Management Bonus\nsrjp | The direct carrot is a \"management bonus\" triggered by the sale and generally tied to the sale price. The bonus may be structured in a variety of ways. To begin, executives can be promised ex ante, even before an acquirer is identified, a portion of the sale proceeds. Alternatively, executives can be given a contemporaneously negotiated payment. This ex post payment might be labeled as a \"bonus\" or, alternatively, characterized as consideration for a noncompete or consulting agreement.\nz7f5 | The cost to VCs of using a management-bonus carrot will depend on the sale price relative to the aggregate liquidation preferences at the time of sale. If the sale price exceeds the aggregate liquidation preferences, the original common shareholders will pay for much (or all) of the management-bonus carrot. If the sale price is less than the aggregate liquidation preferences, the VCs will shoulder all of the cost of the carrot.\nshf2 | b. Carve-Out to Common\n2g9t | The indirect carrot is a carve-out to the common shareholders as a class. A carve-out entitles common shareholders to a portion of the proceeds from the trade sale even if the firm is sold for less than the VCs' liquidation preferences. To the extent that the founders and executives own shares of common stock, they will share pro rata in the carve-out. For example, if founders and executives own fifty percent of the common stock, a carve-out to common of ten million dollars will yield founders and executives five million dollars.\ng5z7 | Two. Sticks\nzf1e | VCs facing recalcitrant founders and other executives have two potential sticks at their disposal.\n3y0s | First, VCs could threaten to fire the founder and other executives if they refuse to cooperate in a trade sale. Termination would cut off future compensation and perhaps cause the forfeiture of unvested equity. Such a\n124z | CARROTS AND STICKS\naq6h | step would be quite painful for the executives.\nonnn | But such a tactic would also be quite costly for the VCs. The startup would lose its management team, which may be crucial to a potential buyer; the VCs would be forced to spend time and energy finding a replacement; and the new team would then need to be brought up to speed and adequately incentivized to assist in selling the firm. As a result, we would expect VCs to wield this stick rarely, if at all.\nsd4t | b. Blacklisting\n66a0 | Second, VCs could threaten to blacklist founders and other executives who refuse to cooperate in a trade sale. VCs are repeat players in both funding entrepreneurs and hiring professional executives for startups. Neither entrepreneurs nor professional managers will want to displease the VCs, all else being equal.\nioy9 | B. Common Shareholders\n9xjc | To induce common shareholders to support a trade sale, the VCs have one carrot at their disposal and a number of sticks.\n1v04 | One. Carrot: Carve-Out to Common\n1b3y | The carrot VCs can offer common shareholders is a carve-out from their liquidation preferences (or other cash-flow rights) so that common shareholders receive more than they are contractually entitled to receive. Such a carve-out to common can both induce common shareholders to vote for the sale and cause them to refrain from suing.\niz6x | Two. Sticks\nv5kv | VCs can wield a number of sticks to compel the class of common shareholders to vote for the trade sale. However, these sticks cannot prevent a lawsuit and may in fact increase the likelihood of one.\nmm3k | a. Cross-Voting\nxja3 | To eliminate common shareholders' ability to block a trade sale, VCs can either partially convert their shares into common stock or exercise warrants to buy common stock so as to acquire a sufficient amount of common stock to achieve the necessary approval threshold. Consider the transactions in Orban versus Field, a Delaware case involving a common-shareholder lawsuit against a VC-controlled board. Office Mart, a Delaware corporation, arranged to be acquired by Staples in a merger that provided no payout to its common shareholders. The charter allowed preferred shareholders to vote alongside common shareholders on an as-converted basis (as if their stock had been\n74vm | CARROTS AND STICKS\nkf37 | converted into common shares), and the preferred shareholders had enough votes to ensure shareholder approval of the transaction as required by corporate law. However, for accounting reasons, Staples insisted that at least ninety percent of Office Mart's common shares be voted in favor of the transaction. Common shareholders, led by Office Mart's founder and former CEO George Orban, refused to back the deal, demanding four million dollars in exchange for their votes.",
