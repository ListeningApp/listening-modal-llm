Disturbed flow induced the expression of genes in the E eight cluster of endothelial cells that were also found to be highly expressed in VSMCs, fibroblasts, and immune cells, indicating potential EndMT and acquisition of immune cell-like features by endothelial cells under the disturbed flow condition. Comparison of the differentially expressed genes between the stable flow-exposed E two and disturbed flow-exposed E eight clusters by Panther gene ontology analysis showed that disturbed flow induces many well-known biological processes associated with pro-atherogenic pathways, including inflammation, EndMT, apoptosis, angiogenesis and endothelial permeability. A pseudotime trajectory analysis and additional differential gene expression and chromatin accessibility analyses confirmed that E eight cells express higher levels of marker genes for EndMT and EndIT than E two cells. The evidence for EndMT and EndIT was further validated by immunofluorescence\nnhsg | Review article\nhy0l | staining of the key immune cell marker proteins C one QA and LYZ in CDH five positive endothelial cells in mice. In addition, chronic exposure of human aortic endothelial cells to disturbed flow in vitro induced the expression of EndMT markers and EndIT markers, demonstrating that disturbed flow can induce endothelial cell reprogramming in cultured aortic endothelial cells in the absence of any other cell type, such as immune cells. These results demonstrate that disturbed flow induces the transition of endothelial cells to proatherogenic phenotypes, characterized by inflammation, EndMT and EndIT (that is, FIRE).\n4jmz | EndMT has a crucial role in endothelial cell dysfunction and atherosclerosis, whereas the role of EndIT has not been defined. Endothelial cells undergoing EndMT exhibit traits of mesenchymal cells, such as fibroblasts and VSMCs, while losing typical endothelial cell characteristics, including the elongated cell morphology and cell-cell junctional integrity. Mechanistically, the flow-sensitive transforming growth factor beta one is a well-known regulator of the expression of EndMT-related genes. Furthermore, endothelial cells without primary cilia have been shown to prime flow-induced EndMT via the TGFB-ALK five SMAD two SMAD three axis. By contrast, AMP-activated protein kinase is activated by stable flow and suppresses inflammation via nitric oxide-mediated inhibition of NF-KB signalling. Cells undergoing EndMT have an important role in atherogenesis by contributing to neointimal thickening, vascular remodelling, and plaque progression and stability. A meta-analysis using twenty-eight microarray datasets obtained from endothelial cells exposed to various stimuli (including shear stress, different coronaviruses, hyperlipidaemia and lipopolysaccharide) supports the EndIT concept. Nevertheless, the EndIT concept requires further validation by endothelial cell lineage-tracing studies. Although the pathophysiological importance of EndIT in atherogenesis remains to be tested, the role of disturbed flow-induced endothelial inflammation in atherogenesis is clearly defined.\nb7cq | Therapeutic implications in atherosclerosis\n0b39 | As discussed in the Introduction, the CANTOS trial demonstrated that targeting a non-lipid pathway, such as an inflammatory pathway, could be an effective anti-atherogenic therapy. We propose that flow-sensitive genes, proteins and pathways in endothelial cells that regulate FIRE, such as endothelial inflammation, EndMT and EndIT, could be promising novel anti-atherogenic targets. In support of this notion, our transcriptomics study conducted in the mouse PCL model of atherosclerosis showed that both statins and blood flow regulate the expression of hundreds of genes, and the transcriptional profile changes are remarkably distinct from each other. This result suggests that flow-dependent and cholesterol pathways have different roles in atherosclerosis, highlighting the rationale for targeting flow-sensitive molecules (genes, proteins and signalling molecules) as a complementary therapeutic approach. Two therapeutic strategies are conceivable: stimulating or increasing stable-flow-induced atheroprotective molecules, or inhibiting disturbed flow-induced pro-atherogenic molecules with the use of small molecules, recombinant proteins or gene therapies delivered in a systemic or targeted manner.\nqecd | Several stable-flow-induced molecules are promising antiatherosclerotic targets. KLF two and KLF four account for more than fifty percent of all stable-flow-induced gene transcription and the encoded proteins affect nearly all facets of atheroprotective responses in endothelial cells. Given their dominant importance, numerous strategies to stimulate KLF two and KLF four expression have been proposed. Statins are a well-known inducer of KLF two expression in cultured endothelial cells. However, whether statins also induce KLF two and KLF four expression in vivo under flow-conditions has been disputed given the potent effect of flow on the expression of these genes. Betulinic acid has also been shown to induce KLF two expression, as well as expression of its target gene NOS three (which encodes eNOS), via the upstream ERK five-MEF two C pathway. PIEZO one agonists (Yoda one, Jedi one or Jedi two) or antagonists (salvianolic acid B) have been shown to modify KLF two and KLF four expression. However,\n1o7p | Review article\ncp13 | given the dual atheroprotective and pro-atherogenic roles of PIEZO one, drugs targeting this receptor would require safety and specificity studies in order to be used as atherosclerosis therapies. The use of recombinant KLK ten or targeted overexpression of KLK ten as an anti-atherogenic therapy is discussed above.\nbgre | Inhibition of disturbed-flow-induced molecules is a promising anti-atherosclerosis strategy. Pharmacological inhibition of disturbed-flow-induced HIF 1A using the small-molecule inhibitor PX-478 was shown to reduce atherosclerosis in mice. Inhibition of disturbed-flow-induced miRNAs, including the antagomiRs of miR-92a, miR-205 or miR-712, effectively reduced atherosclerosis development in mice. The agent 5-aza-2' deoxycytidine inhibits the disturbed-flow-induced DNMT activity and prevented atherosclerosis in a mouse model. Numerous flow-sensitive genes, proteins and pathways, including NF-KB, YAP, TAZ and BMP four, as well as specific inhibitors, drugs and RNA therapeutics, are suitable for further investigation, but research on therapeutic strategies targeting disturbed-flow-induced atherogenesis is scarce. Developing approaches to overcome this limitation is a major research area to be developed.\n57lp | Conclusions\n```",
