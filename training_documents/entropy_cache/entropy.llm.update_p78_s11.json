A more precise statement is that the partition function counts states weighted by their accessibility exp(negative beta E;). States whose energy is low compared to k T are highly accessible, or probable, because exp(negative beta E;) is close to one if E; is less than k T. States of high energy are more inaccessible, or improbable, since exp(negative beta E;) is close to zero if E; is much greater than k T.",
