You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ym66 | Although hydrogen storage has been extensively researched, to the authors' knowledge, there is currently no recommendation as to which rock type, porosity, and permeability is best suited for UHS. Therefore, requirements for the effective porosity (i.e., connected porosity), intrinsic permeability and reservoir thickness for UHS operations are derived from the experience of the hydrocarbon and geothermal industry (Sedlacek, 1999b; May et al., 2004; Chadwick et al., 2008; Heidug, 2013; Stober and Bucher, 2021) as well as conceptual studies on potential international hydrogen storage in depleted reservoir settings: Chadwick et al. (2008) summarized that porosities and permeabilities of at least 0.20 and 500 mD (approx. <LATEX>5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 3 } m ^ { 2 }</LATEX> are considered ideal geologic storage conditions. Porosities of less than 0.1 and permeabilities of less than 200 mD (approx. <LATEX>2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 3 } m ^ { 2 }</LATEX> are considered cautionary indicators by these authors. Sedlacek (1999b) propounds that -from a geological and
l0a3 | reservoir perspective-porosities and permeabilities within the range of 18 to 15% and greater than 100 mD are suitable for gas reservoirs, respectively. All these indicative limits are consistent with the study by Pfeiffer and Bauer (2015) for subsurface porous media hydrogen storage, which used on-site and off-site porosities and permeabilities of the Middle Rhaetian (main sandstone) of Northern Germany of 0.33 and 572 mD, respectively. Similar porosities (0.1-0.3) and permeabilities in the range of 20-2,500 mD are also used by other studies on UHS (Amid et al., 2016; Heinemann et al., 2018; Hemme and Berk, 2018; Zivar et al., 2021; Lysyy et al., 2021). On the basis of these literature values, we suggest permeabilities and porosities greater than 500 mD and 0.2, respectively, for optimal and safe operation of UHS systems (Table 1). However, the range of porosity and permeability depends on the specific properties of the rock formation, so a thorough petrophysical characterization of the rock is required in advance to determine its suitability for hydrogen storage. In addition to the consideration of intrinsic permeability, the characterization of relative permeability in wet porous rocks is crucial for optimizing storage capacity and recovery efficiency. The determination of the relative permeability of hydrogen- brine rock systems is very complex as it depends on the number of hydrogen injection and reproduction cycles as well as the capillary forces responsible for residual hydrogen trapping. Accordingly, these parameters should be determined based on experimental measurements to determine the intrinsic permeability.
u8nw | 3.3 Storage depth, sealing capacity, and integrity of caprock
l2v9 | The seal capacity of a reservoir refers to the ability of the rock layers above the reservoir (seals) to prevent the upward migration of fluids or gases out of the reservoir. The seal capacity is therefore critical for the effective trapping and storage of hydrogen in a reservoir, allowing for the efficient extraction and utilization of the resource. The dominant trapping mechanism is the capillary properties of the cap rock that will trap a hydrogen column until the net buoyancy (i.e., difference between hydrogen and brine) exceeds the capillary displacement pressure of the seal (Watts, 1987). The properties that define the capillary entry pressure are the size of the largest interconnected pore throat of the cap rock, the hydrogen- brine interfacial tension (IFT) and wetting behavior of the cap rock with respect to hydrogen and brine, expressed by the brine-rock- hydrogen contact angle <LATEX>\theta</LATEX> (see detailed review by Aslannezhad et al., 2023). The height of the trapped hydrogen column can thus be expressed by balancing the buoyancy and capillary entry pressure:
afbe | <LATEX>h = \frac { 2 \times I F T \times \cos \theta } { r \times g \times \Delta \rho }</LATEX> (1)
78r8 | The hydrogen-water and hydrogen-brine interfacial tension was measured experimentally by Chow et al. (2018) and Hosseini et al. (2022) and was shown to decline with depth, but increase with salinity. However, under storage conditions (1,000 m and 50℃), the <LATEX>I F T</LATEX> remains relatively high <LATEX>\left( \sim 7 0 m N / m ^ { 2 } \right)</LATEX> and hydrogen and brine remain immiscible (Chow et al., 2018; Hosseini et al., 2022; Iglauer, 2022). Hydrogen wettability of selected minerals were also measured and calculated in a few studies. Hydrogen wettability of quartz (pure and aged with stearic acid) were reported to increase with organic acid surface concentration, pressure and temperature (Iglauer et al.,
