        "content": "89ub | Glutamate receptors, which bind glutamate as their ligand, have primarily been studied for their roles in the central nervous system but are becoming increasingly implicated in cancer. A pan-cancer analysis of somatic mutation patterns revealed a number of significantly mutated GPCRs, including GRM eight. In another case, a GPCR-targeted mutation analysis of melanomas revealed that GPR ninety-eight (mentioned above) and GRM three, a metabotropic glutamate receptor, were the most frequently mutated genes. Expression of patient-derived GRM three mutants in melanoma cell lines significantly increased anchorage-independent cell proliferation, as well as cell migration in vitro and in vivo metastatic rate. Similarly, ectopic expression of GRM one and GRM five have been found to induce spontaneous formation of melanoma in transgenic mouse models suggesting a role for GRMs in driving melanoma initiation. Glutamate and other amino acid-binding GPCRs, such as the taste receptors TAS one R one, and TAS one R three, can also act as nutrient sensors that survey the tumor microenvironment and extracellular milieu to assess nutrient availability. Under times of nutrient stress or deprivation, these GPCRs can regulate the activation of autophagic programs that enable cancer cells to persist.\n\ndhle | One of the most prominent GPCRs implicated in neoplastic growth is the Thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor. TSHR is coupled primarily to Gas and to a lesser extent Gaq, and is a key regulator of thyroid cell function, growth and hormone metabolism. Mutations in TSHR have been found to lead to numerous thyroid diseases, including hyper- and hypothyroidism and hyperfunctioning thyroid adenomas. Strikingly, activating mutations in TSHR are the predominant cause of solitary toxic thyroid adenomas, accounting for roughly sixty to eighty percent of all cases, and are found in roughly thirty percent of thyroid adenomas among other cancers. Aligned with this, activating mutations in GNAS and TSHR are commonly found in differentiated thyroid carcinomas.\n\n2nib | TSHR and other hormone GPCRs, such as G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (also known as GPR thirty), luteinizing hormone receptor, follicle-stimulating hormone receptor, gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor, and their cognate hormone ligands, are known to play multiple roles in modulating the tumor microenvironment and promoting tumor proliferation particularly for cancers with hormonal involvement such as thyroid, breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. Indeed, prostate cancer induced by injection of testosterone was one of the earliest indications that hormone dynamics could control the initiation of cancer.\n\nnaev | Estrogen for example, is a hormone involved in many aspects of normal physiology and has been well-studied in the context of breast and ovarian cancers. Concomitant to the transcriptional\n\n7h0h | actions of classical estrogen receptors, GPER has been shown to mediate both transcriptional and rapid signal transduction events upon estrogen binding, activating the EGFR and MAPK pathways and resulting in the activation of c-fos regulated transcriptional networks in multiple tissue types. Interestingly, GPER has been shown to cooperate with ERa to promote mitogenic effects in a cell-context dependent manner, highlighting the multifaceted nature of estrogen signalling in cancer. Evista, which is FDA approved for the prevention of breast cancer in post-menopausal women, targets ERs, while also modulating GPER activity. Other hormone-binding GPCRs have been successfully targeted in oncology, including the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor. Degarelix, a well-tolerated GnRH antagonist, has been used for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer by rapidly suppressing levels of gonadotropins, testosterone, and prostate-specific antigen in patients. The profound efficacy of degarelix as a first-line monotherapy for the management of prostate cancer is a remarkable testament to the druggability of GPCRs and their use in oncotherapy.\n\na64c | Another seven-transmembrane receptor frequently mutated in cancer is Smoothened, which drives activation of the transcription factor GLI. SMO is negatively regulated by the twelve-transmembrane receptor patched; however, this inhibition is relieved upon binding of PTCH to hedgehog family members, including sonic hedgehog. Mutations that result in the activation of the PTCH-SMO-SHH signalling axis have been found to drive sporadic basal cell carcinomas. As of yet, the potential role of heterotrimeric G proteins in the signalling capacity of SMO have not been fully clarified. Studies have found that in some cell contexts, Gai and Ga twelve are involved in activation of the pathway; however, the dependency of SMO on G protein coupling for its roles in cancer initiation and progression is not well understood and requires further investigation.\n\ngi7n | The Frizzled family of seven-transmembrane receptors are also heavily involved in cancer, as transducers of the Wnt signalling cascade. Wnt signalling can drive the activation of several transcriptional networks, primarily beta-catenin and has been described to play a role in numerous cancer types, with emphasis in colorectal cancer. Indeed, the Frizzled family of GPCRs is collectively mutated in greater than fifteen percent of colon adenocarcinomas in TCGA. FZD six in particular is significantly mutated in colon adenocarcinoma (MutSig two CV q-value equals zero point zero five). There is mounting evidence supporting the G protein coupling of Frizzleds as a critical component of the Wnt signalling pathway. For example, inhibition of Goo and Gaq has been found to disrupt Wnt-mediated stabilization of beta-catenin and teratocarcinoma stem-cell\n\n3pn1 | A\n\nwjuz | differentiation. Future work will likely expand the current view of G protein regulated Wnt signalling in cancer initiation and progression.",
