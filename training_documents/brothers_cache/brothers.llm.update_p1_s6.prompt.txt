You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

ukth | 'Brothers at Peace': People-to-People Reconciliation in the Ethiopian-Eritrean Borderlands
kpvt | 'Brothers at Peace': People-to-People Reconciliation in the Ethiopian-Eritrean Borderlands
jie2 | The coming to power of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in Ethiopia in 2018 opened up a renewed peace engagement with Eritrea and diplomatic rela- tions were restored. Before the political rapprochement, grassroots proc- esses of people-to-people reconciliation in the borderlands between the two countries had been underway for years, gradually eroding officially- produced enemy stereotypes. This article explores how physical borders and boundaries of identity at a local level may be conceived differently from that at state borders or expressions of formal nationalism at an inter-state level. The local level border between the northern regional state of Tigray in Ethiopia and Eritrea has become increasingly porous over the last years, whilst the inter-state border was rigidly defended. The political rapprochement is however disconnected from the people-to-people recon- ciliation, as the local government in Tigray is at odds with both Ethiopia's federal government in Addis Ababa and the Eritrean government. The formalised peace processes are elite driven, leaving no voice for the peo- ple affected in the borderlands.
d0ik | Introduction1
0x0s | 'Finally, we are once again united, as brothers should be', declared an elderly per- son on the streets of Mekelle, the capital of the northern region of Tigray in Ethiopia.2 The 1998-2000 Eritrean-Ethiopian war had pitted brothers against
4exe | brothers, in a social, cultural, and political sense, and dismembered families and kin- folk.3 After the peace rapprochement and the opening of the Eritrean-Ethiopian bor- der in mid-September 2018, Mekelle was flooded with Eritreans who for the first time in twenty years were free to cross the heavily militarised border to Ethiopia. Tales of reunions of long lost family members and relatives spread like wildfire, and cross-border trade and business were booming. Peace rapprochement and the border opening seemed too good to be true, however, so people from both sides of the bor- der hastily visited each other to reconnect, in case the tides of peace turned.
0myz | Since the 1998-2000 war, Eritrea and Ethiopia had been locked in a 'no war, no peace' impasse. This ceased in June 2018, when Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki agreed to enter into dialogue after a peace offer by Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed. 'Our desire is to love rather than hate', stated Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. 'What we miss is to hug our brothers in Asmara. If we are in love then the other things are minor. And if we do that, we might not need a border'.4 Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's emphasis on 'peace and love' in his new international rela- tions policies led to the coining of the term 'hug-and-love' diplomacy. For his 'decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighbouring Eritrea' he was awarded the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize.5
xh3i | In July 2018, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed visited the Eritrean capital of Asmara. He was the first Ethiopian Prime Minister to do so in over twenty years. He was received by an ecstatic Eritrean crowd waving Ethiopian flags. On the occasion, Yemane Gebremeskel, Eritrea's Minister of Information and a key advisor to President Isaias Afwerki, tweeted: 'A truly historic moment with memorable water- shed events: brotherly embrace of the leaders'.6 The visit was soon reciprocated by President Isaias Afwerki who travelled to Addis Ababa to sign a five-point declar- ation of peace and friendship between the two countries. The agreement led to res- toration of diplomatic relations and opened up communications between the two states and peoples.7 During the visit, President Isaias Afwerki declared: 'Words can- not express the joy we are feeling now. We are one people. Whoever forgets that does not understand our situation'.8
syiw | Although the two leaders declared that the border between their two countries was redundant and that they were actually 'one people', those straddling the con- tested border were not immediately reassured about their leaders' genuine intentions and interests for peace. Wars and conflicts have ravaged the Eritrean-Ethiopian highlands throughout centuries, infusing ethnic boundaries and territorial borders with various sentiments of identity and expressions of power.9
kg3t | Territorial boundaries and manifestations of economic, cultural, and political realms are perceived differently according to context. For instance, the Eritrean-Ethiopian highlands with its ancient indigenous plough-based agricultural system has throughout history placed great emphasis on the control of land and hence on the demarcation of land between that which is controlled by one person, kin group, or village, and that controlled by another.1º Frequent border disputes over agricultural land between neighbours, kinsmen, lineages, and villages have been common for centuries, and these have infused the twin concepts of physical border and identity boundary with concrete and metaphorical significance. The lowland pastoralist communities of the Horn of Africa, on the other hand, tend to approach the concepts of border/boundaries in a different manner. Although territorial units are broadly defined, there are no clear-cut borders demarcating one person's or group's land from that of a neighbouring person or group. There are overlapping zones of interest, with porous borders.11
lvae | The highlanders' rigid understanding of borders is also connected to layers - or scales - of identity (family - kin - neighbouring community - ethnic group - nation), successively embracing larger units of territory.12 Territorial identity formations were ascribed a socio-political hierarchy, where 'orders from above' were to be executed without question.13 This was of particular importance in feuds and conflicts over ter- ritorial domains, where latent identity categories have been exploited by elites to rally the masses behind their political project, be that for domination at local level or hege- monic control at the centre. Which layer of identity or identity alliance that was made relevant, depended upon the territorial unit, or border, that was contested. When I was doing research in Tigray after the outbreak of the 1998-2000 war, an elderly Tigrayan farmer eloquently explained this context to me:
o9sc | When the Eritreans attacked us, we did not know what to believe. We used to think of them as our brothers - we have bonds of marriage, trade, and friendship that
121u | link us together. We were also fighting together as one against the military junta. Now, suddenly they have become our mortal enemies; and our old foes, the Amhara, are coming to our rescue! But, although we are fighting the Eritreans today with the help of the Amhara, this may change again tomorrow; as different kings [governments] come and go, so also will our enemies and friends change.14
zh03 | Similar sentiments were also heard among the Eritrean border population and frontline soldiers during the war. As expressed by an Eritrean soldier witnessing the carnage of Ethiopian brethren at the Tsorona frontline in 1999: 'This is so sad. These are our brothers and now we fight them here. We are really one people'.15
1mvw | The mass killings and destructions carried out during the 1998-2000 war created deep-rooted animosity between the two peoples, which also affected and reconfig- ured borderland identities, at least temporarily. Moreover, the political impasse and twenty year 'no war, no peace' situation has furthered an identity schism between the borderland peoples. Are the wounds created by the 1998-2000 war still affect- ing relations in the borderlands? Or has time, cultural, and religious commonality and joint socio-economic grievances healed the wounds of war among the border- lands populations?
