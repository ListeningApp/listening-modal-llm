You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

j79f | Various mycobacterial species infections are common in SLE and may disseminate leading to serious and lethal disease.22 The prevalence of Mycobacteria tuberculosis ranges from 5% to 30% depending on the specific geographic region which is higher in SLE subjects than the general population.23 Clinical presentations of mycobacteria may mimic lupus clinical syndrome, with features that involve severe extrapulmonary disease, extensive pulmonary syndromes, and high relapse rates.24 non-tuberculosis mycobacterial infections cause skin and soft tissue infections with skin nodules and skin abscesses. Higher cumulative doses of glucocorticoids and renal disease are associated with increased risk of mycobacterial species in SLE.25
6tbv | Viral Infections
xb13 | Herpes zoster (HZ) represents the most common viral infection in SLE patients, followed by cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human papilloma virus (HPV).26,27 Other viruses with high frequency in SLE include, parvovirus B19, hepatitis B and C, influenza, and SARS-COV-2.28,29
cxqi | HZ infections occur at the age of 30 to 40 years in SLE with higher prevalence in the Asian population than in the US population.30 Risk factors include increasing age, lymphopenia, major organ disease, multi morbidities, glomerulonephri- tis, high dose glucocorticoids and non-glucocorticoid therapy such as mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide.31 HZ infection and reactivation occurring even during a low disease activity state is associated with serious morbidity, inferior quality of life and death. The use of high-dose glucocorticoids is associated with bacterial superinfection.
qfmx | CMV infection in SLE may present as gastrointestinal bleed, colitis, hepatitis, retinitis, or encephalitis, with a high incidence of pneumonitis.32 High dose of glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, plasma exchange, pancytopenia and concurrent infections have been associated with serious CMV clinical syndrome. High CMV viral loads are associated with the development of CMV infection in patients with SLE.33
rut3 | The rate of cervical HPV infections is higher in SLE patients than in the general population, with an increased risk for high grade squamous interepithelial lesions.34 This may be due to delayed clearance of infections or greater reactivation of latent infections, in addition to higher rates of HPV coinfection. The association between immunosuppressive medications and risk of HPV infection needs additional evaluation.
m3cp | A higher proportion of hepatitis C infection is frequent in patients with SLE compared to healthy controls.35 However, there appears to be a lower risk of hepatitis B infection in patients with SLE (possible protective role of overexpressed cytokines in these patients). Nonetheless, the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus is higher in SLE patients receiving a daily steroid dose of >10 mg/day and patients over the age of 40. Rituximab, to treat SLE, is associated with a higher risk of reactivation of hepatitis B and patients should be screened prior to therapy.
mq4s | Parvovirus B19 and SLE share certain similarities in terms of presentation, including fevers, malaise, lymphadeno- pathy, anemia, and rash.36 This viral infection is also able to induce the production of autoantibodies specific to SLE, like anti-dsDNA and soluble nuclear antigens. It has been proposed that parvovirus B19 can induce pathogenic autoimmunity through a variety of mechanisms, including molecular mimicry.37 However, it is difficult to estimate the prevalence of this parvovirus infection in SLE patients as immune therapy inhibits immunoglobulin (IgM and IgG) seroconversion.
95el | The COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance and OpenSAFELY databases provide data that suggest that patients with SLE are at a higher risk of severe disease, hospitalization and death from COVID-19 compared to the general population.38 The risk is highest in patients on prednisone dose >10 mg/day, and those on rituximab, as compared to those patients maintained on belimumab, hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil.39
a0a5 | Opportunistic Infections
gocl | Opportunistic infections like Listeria monocytogenes, Nocardia species, Aspergillus fumigatus, and others may present as neurologic syndromes that mimic neuropsychiatric lupus and behave more aggressively to cause severe disease leading to death.4º Cryptococcus neoformans presents in SLE as meningitis, meningoencephalitis, lung nodules and pneumonia/ bronchiolitis driven by long term use of glucocorticoids and cytotoxic drugs and is associated with higher mortality rates.41
ob1z | Candida albicans is a usual form of candidemia in SLE and usually involves the gastrointestinal and genitourinary system and may become invasive at times. 42
m4cb | Why are Lupus Patients at Substantial Risk for Infections? Aberrant Immune Functions in SLE
m61y | The aberrant immune response in SLE, low serum complement levels, functional asplenia, and abnormal host response of neutrophils and macrophages to pathogens have contributed to the rise in infectious rates in SLE (Table 1). The impaired inflammatory response with decreased chemotaxis, membrane recognition and attachment to microorganisms, phagocy- tosis, oxidative metabolism could also predispose to infection.
u2ob | Lymphopenia and neutropenia are common hematologic manifestations in SLE and can have poor clinical outcomes with predisposition to infection given decreased T-cell activity and dysfunctional macrophages and monocyte systems.43 Prior studies have shown that a decrease in phagocytic function and the impaired handling of immune complexes due to the presence of autoantibodies against Fc gamma receptors (FcgR) which belong to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha superfamily contribute to the risk of infections.44
2gnm | Complement dysfunction is frequent in SLE, reflected by inherited complement deficiency, and hypocomplementemia during SLE disease activity. SLE patients with complement dysfunctions show an increase in risk to capsulated organisms such as Streptococcal pneumonia, Neisseria meningitis and Neisseria gonorrhea. Hypogammaglobulinemia encountered in SLE contributes to an increased risk of recurrent and severe bacterial infections, although polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia is common in SLE. Whether immunoglobulin replacement therapy decreases the risk of infection in those patients requires further investigation. 45
emgw | In addition, the risk of infection in SLE is higher in the presence of comorbidities and when using glucocorticoids, immunosuppressive and immune modulatory therapy. The incidence of kidney involvement, diabetes, and higher lupus damage index (SDI/SLE international collaborating clinic) scores were dramatically higher in SLE patients with an infection compared to SLE patients without an infection. In fact, the use of aggressive immunosuppressive therapy is a serious risk factor for the development of infections in SLE.46
xaqt | Impact of Immune Therapy and Risk of Infections
5rcb | The use of immunosuppressive therapy will induce difficulty in mounting an immune response to viral and bacterial infections in SLE, including the exposure to immunosuppressive agents including high-dose glucocorticoids, alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide, in addition to mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, cyclosporin, and hydroxychloroquine.4,6
