As the landscape of romantic love continues to expand and monogamy is no longer the only possible course of action that a relationship can take, our societal notions, as well as our psychological models of love and partnership, also need to grow and include relationship structures beyond the monogamous norm.\na3t5 | Attachment theory offers an important-even revolutionary-framework for understanding the biological and psychological necessity of being securely bonded to others. The psychological model also allows insight into how disruptions in\njlbs | attachment can create significant challenges in the giving and receiving of the love and affection we so desire with our partners. Research has consistently demonstrated that understanding our different attachment styles and using this knowledge to move into more secure functioning with a partner is an important component in creating fulfilling and sustaining relationships. Attachment theory was developed in the nineteen sixties by British psychologist John Bowlby, but in the past several years, it has expanded its reach outside of the academic and therapeutic spheres, becoming more popularized in general public discourse regarding personal healing, parenting, dating, marriages and relationships.\n6aui | Many people who practice ethical nonmonogamy (who often proudly describe themselves as relationship geeks) have been drawn to attachment theory as a way to further enhance their general knowledge about relationships. The theory is also more specifically used to support nonmonogamous people in comprehending and working with the distinct challenges and patterns that arise when someone has multiple partners. While therapeutic practices based on attachment theory have become some of the most effective and well-researched modalities for couples therapy, how it applies to nonmonogamous relationships can be unclear. To no surprise, the majority of resources and advice available on how to create securely attached romantic relationships assume monogamy. Whether intentionally or not, these resources encourage highly mononormative practices, often leaving people who are nonmonogamous at a loss in how to create secure bonds with their multiple partners.\ny7r5 | Several years ago, I was in a polyamorous relationship with a partner named Corey. At that time, I lived with my husband and our child, and Corey lived in a nearby town with his primary partner. One day Corey admitted to having an anxious attachment style. We both wanted our relationship to be a close and connected one, but we also knew that living together and blending our families was not in the cards for us, so we began to wonder how we could establish more secure functioning together without the boost in security that comes from either living with a partner, being primaries, sharing finances or having a child together.\nnhpx | We began to listen to an audio version of one of the better books on attachment, eagerly jumping ahead to the section instructing us on the specific things we could do to build secure attachment in our romantic relationship. Being someone who is a minority in several areas of my life, I was already habitually accustomed to having to reinterpret information and advice, automatically translating the typical normative discourses in whatever I was reading to garner any and all kernels of wisdom that I could actually apply to my own life. Corey, however, was not used to having to code switch like this. Taking a more literal read on the chapter, he was left discouraged and concluded that he and I would never achieve secure attachment since we were unable to do over half of the suggested attachment behaviors. I was initially surprised by this because when I read the very same section I had been hopeful. When I paused to consider why I had such a different take on the very same chapter, I realized that my optimism didn't actually come from the author's encouragement, but because I was quick to sift the useful from the useless and the relevant from the irrelevant to our nonmonogamous context. But Corey's perspective was illuminating for me because he was right-if we couldn't do the majority of the advised activities, what were we really left with?\n2yc2 | Around the same time, several of my nonmonogamous clients also began expressing similar grievances. Like me and Corey, they wanted secure attachment with all of their partners, but they felt demoralized and even pathologized when they read about attachment. They were unable to find themselves or fit themselves into the mononormativity of the literature on attachment, since they were unable to partake in many of the behaviors that experts recommend as required for secure relationships. Even though I was able to translate, sift through and reframe what I was reading from the mainstream books and audio programs in order to apply it to my polyamorous relationships and nonmonogamous clients, I realized that this didn't mean that others-even highly intelligent others like Corey or my clients- could or would do the same. And they shouldn't have to, because secure attachment is not just for the monogamous. So, I took on Corey's and my clients' understandable discouragement as a personal and professional challenge. I promised\neehg | Corey that I would at least come up with a list of things that we could do to cultivate a secure attachment that didn't require us to live together, be exclusive or even be each other's primary partner. That list led into a talk, which has since led to this book. Thank you, Corey! Thank you, clients!\nght4 | Many nonmonogamous people have secure, loving, healthy relationships with multiple partners, and this book is my attempt at lifting the lens of monogamy from attachment research so that we can apply all this wonderful knowledge about human connection and bonding to a nonmonogamous context. As far as my editors and I know, this is the first book to explicitly translate the principles of attachment theory to nonmonogamous relationships.\n```",
