You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

uxhs | Gas, and Gas-driven signalling also plays a critical role in stem cell populations, where it has been found to suppress self-renewal. In contrast to the pro-oncogenic effects of GOF mutations in Gas, in some stem-like cell states, Gas has a tumor suppressive role where LOF mutations, or Gas deletion has been found to drive tumor initiation and progression by de-repression of the Sonic Hedgehog and Hippo pathways142,143. In particular, the loss of GNAS, or low Gas expression is tightly linked to poor overall survival in a subset of aggressive medulloblastomas (MBs) with alterations and activation of SHH signalling, and in neuroblastoma144. Strikingly, deletion of GNAS in neural stem/progenitor cells consistently leads to MB-like tumors in mice by derepressing SHH signalling thus contributing to the development and malignancy of SHH- associated MB tumors144. In epidermal and hair follicle progenitor cell populations, conditional deletion of Gas leads to rapid formation of BCC by repressing PKA-mediated inhibition of SHH and YAP signalling78. Of note, activation of Gas in epithelial stem cells leads to exhaustion of hair follicle stem cells and subsequent hair loss, demonstrating the cell-context specific impact of Gas signalling78.
ed6e | Mutations in genes encoding Gai/o proteins in cancer
6qqm | Pente
onum | The Gai/o subfamily of G proteins elicit signalling through a broad range of effectors, including activation of MAPK and PI3K signalling. In opposition to Gas signalling, Gai inhibits adenylyl cyclase, leading to a decrease in cAMP145. This was originally discovered through studies examining the mechanism of action of Islet Activating protein (IAP), also known as pertussis toxin, as it was isolated from Bordetella pertussis. IAP was found to release inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and enhance receptor mediated cAMP generation. Multiple groups studying the substrate of IAP found that IAP ADP-ribosylated Gai, thereby inactivating it, and enhancing adenylyl cyclase activity146-148. Similar to other G proteins, constitutively active mutants of Gai have been shown to possess the ability to transform cells and are known proto-oncogenes 149,150. Cancer derived activated mutants of GNAO1, encoding Gao, have also been found to promote oncogenic transformation and anchorage-dependent growth when expressed in cells151.
3iir | In particular, hotspot activating mutations in GNAI2, which has been termed as the gip2 oncogene, has been found in several tumor types, including ovarian and adrenal tumors, and has been shown to underlie a dysfunctional state in a subset of growth hormone-secreting pituitary
7a0a | adenomas; however the small number of patients with this particular disorder have limited efforts to study the effect of germline GNAI variants and warrant further investigation 152-154. Strikingly, GNAI2 is in the top 1% of copy number gains in brain, central nervous system, and kidney cancers suggesting there could be a larger role for Gai-driven signalling39. In particular, many GPCRs that are well established as drivers of metastasis, such as CXCR4 (see below) couple to Gai. Aligned with this, GNAI2 (encoding Gai2) has been found to be highly amplified in breast invasive carcinoma52.
o1qp | rtic Remarkably, Gai/o-coupled receptors are the most commonly deleteriously mutated class of GPCRs across cancers47. Coupled with this, inactivating mutations in Gai/o coupled receptors have been found to be mutually exclusive with activating mutations in Gas, suggesting that they lead to the same functional outcomes, converging on increased cAMP activity47. Indeed, a large subset of GPCRs mutated in GI-tract cancers are Gai coupled, and the Gai/o subfamily of G proteins are altered at similar frequencies in GI cancers to the Gas subfamily; however, the functional significance of their mutations have not yet been comprehensively tested52 (Table 1, Table S5). Aligned with the recurrent incidence of Gas-pathway activation in GI cancers, upregulated cAMP/PKA activity may be a common mechanism of tumorigenesis in these tissue types, and warrants further investigation, both from a signalling and clinical perspective.
jrik | Mutations in genes encoding Ga12 proteins in cancer
xv78 | The Ga12 subfamily of G proteins is comprised of two a subunits, encoded by GNA12 and GNA13. Expressed in almost every tissue type, Ga12 and Ga13 play critical roles in cell proliferation and cytoskeletal remodelling, including cell polarity, cell adhesion, migration, and invasion 155,156. The Ga12/13 subunits were originally discovered based on their amino acid sequence similarity to other Ga subunits and determined to be unique based on their insensitivity to pertussis toxin157. Wild-type (WT) Ga12 was identified from a sarcoma-derived cDNA library screen to cause transformation of NIH3T3 cells, representing the only G protein subfamily whose overexpression is sufficient to be transformative without mutation158. The transforming ability of WT Ga12 was found to be dependent on the presence of serum; however, mutation of GNA12 leading to expression of an activated, GTPase deficient Ga12 was found to be potently transforming, and eliminated serum-dependence for transformation159-161. Similar work demonstrating the potent transforming activity of Ga13 led to the designation of GNA12 and GNA13 active mutants collectively referred to as the gep oncogene 160,162.
sdks | Ga12/13 have since been widely explored as drivers of cellular transformation, cancer progression and metastatic potential in a variety of cell types 163-166. Signalling driven by Ga12/13 is largely mediated via the RhoGEF family, including p115RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF and Leukemia- associated RhoGEF (LARG) to mediate signalling to Rho167-172. Initial studies on the mechanism by which active mutant of Go12 was fully transforming in fibroblasts demonstrated that Ga12 strongly stimulated transcriptional activity through the c-fos promoter element and the serum response element (SRE), which was dependent on Rho173. Further work has revealed that Ga12/13 can signal through multiple effectors including ß-catenin, Radixin, and MAPK among others155,174-176. All together, these signalling pathways regulate a diversity of cancer-related transcriptional networks and cellular functions, including the activation of AP-1, STAT3, and YAP155,177-180

521q | Induction of aberrant Ga 12/13 driven signalling by overexpression or mutation of Ga12/13 or of Ga12/13 coupled GPCRs such as protease activated receptor 1 PAR-1 (F2R), or thromboxane A2 receptor TA2R (TBXA2R), have been shown to be transforming, and significantly increase the invasive ability of different cancer types163,164,181-184. Of interest, Ga12/13, Ga12/13-coupled GPCRs and their effectors including Rho, are overexpressed in several cancer types including breast, prostate, and hepatocellular carcinomas185-187. In particular, GNA13 is upregulated in several solid tumors and its expression levels have been found to modulate drug resistance in squamous cell cancers, such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)188-190. GNA12 also exhibits significant copy number gain in ovarian cancer, which is a cancer type characterized by generally few driver mutations52.
