You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

06yq | ABSTRACT
dpv6 | In this paper, we show that the expansion history of the Universe in power-law cos- mology essentially depends on two crucial parameters, namely the Hubble constant H0 and deceleration parameter q. We find the constraints on these parameters from the latest H (z) and SNe Ia data. At lo level the constraints from H (z) data are ob- tained as q = - 0.18+0.12 -0.12 and Ho = 68.43+2.84 -2.80 km s-1 Mpc-1 while the constraints from the SNe Ia data read as q = - 0.38+0.05 3-0.05 and Ho = 69.18+0.55 -0.54 km s-1 Mpc-1. We also perform the joint test using H (z) and SNe Ia data, which yields the constraints q = - 0.34-0.05 and Ho = 68.93+0.531 -0.52 km s-1 Mpc-1. The estimates of Ho are found to be in close agreement with some recent probes carried out in the literature. The anal- ysis reveals that the observational data successfully describe the cosmic acceleration within the framework of power-law cosmology. We find that the power-law cosmology accommodates well the H(z) and SNe Ia data. We also test the power-law cosmol- ogy using the primordial nucleosynthesis, which yields the constraints q > 0.72 and Ho ≤ 41.49 km s-1 Mpc-1. These constraints are found to be inconsistent with the ones derived from the H(z) and SNe Ia data. We carry out the statefinder analysis, and find that the power-law cosmological models approach the standard ACDM model as q -> -1. Finally, we conclude that despite having several good features power-law cosmology is not a complete package for the cosmological purposes.

2taz | 1 INTRODUCTION
o3ya | Power-law cosmology finds a reasonable place in the litera- ture to address some common problems (e.g., age problem, flatness problem, horizon problem etc.) associated with the Standard Cold Dark Matter (SCDM) model based on Big Bang theory. In such a cosmology, the cosmological evolu- tion is described by the scale factor a(t) o to, where a is a constant. The viability of the model with a > 1 has been explored in a series of articles in different contexts (Lohiya & Sethi 1999; Batra et al. 1999, 2000; Gehlaut et al. 2002, 2003; Dev et al. 2002, 2008; Sethi et al. 2005a, 2005b; Zhu et al. 2008). Observational constraints on phantom power- law cosmology are discussed by Kaeonikhom, Gumjudpai & Saridakis (2011). The motivation for such an endeavor is followed by a number of considerations. For instance, power- law cosmological models with a > 1 do not encounter the horizon problem at all (Sethi, Dev & Jain 2005). These mod-
r5il | els do not witness the flatness problem since the matter den- sity is not constrained by the scale factor. In these models, age of the Universe turns out at least fifty percent greater than the age predicted by the SCDM model. This bridges the gap between the age of the Universe and the age esti- mates of globular clusters and high-z redshift galaxies, and thus the age problem is alleviated. Sethi, Dev & Jain (2005) showed that an open linear coasting cosmological model con- strained with type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) gold sample and ages of old quasars accommodates a very old high-redshift quasar, which the SCDM model fails to do. The linear coast- ing cosmology is found to be consistent with the gravita- tional lensing statistics (Dev et al. 2002) and the primordial nucleosynthesis (Batra et al. 1999, 2000). Kaplinghat et al. (1999) found that the power-law cosmological models which succeed in primordial nucleosythesis are in conflict with the constraints from Hubble expansion rates and SNe Ia magni- tude redshift relations.

The former one tells us the expansion rate of the Universe today while the latter one characterizes the accelerating <LATEX>\left( q < 0 \right)</LATEX> or decel- erating <LATEX>\left( q > 0 \right)</LATEX> nature of the Universe. In the recent past, there have been numerous attempts to estimate the value of <LATEX>H _ { 0 } .</LATEX> Freedman et al.

(2010) based upon measurements of gravitational lens- ing by using the HST yielded a value of <LATEX>H _ { 0 } = 6 9 . 7 _ { - 5 . 0 } ^ { + 4 . 9 }</LATEX> ] <LATEX>\mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { M p c } ^ { - 1 } .</LATEX> WMAP seven-year results gave an estimate of <LATEX>H _ { 0 } = 7 1 . 0 \pm 2 . 5 \mathrm { k m } \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { M p c } ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> based on WMAP data alone, and an estimate of <LATEX>H _ { 0 } = 7 0 . 4 _ { - 1 . 4 } ^ { + 1 . 3 }</LATEX> km <LATEX>\mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { M p c } ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> based on WMAP data with Gaussian priors corresponding to earlier estimates from other studies (Jarosik et al. 2011). A recent estimate of the Hubble constant, which used a new infrared camera on the HST to measure the distance and redshift for a collection of astronomical objects, gives a value of <LATEX>H _ { 0 } = 7 3 . 8 \pm 2 . 4 \mathrm { k m } \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { M p c } ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> (Riess et al. 2011). An alter- native probe using data from galactic clusters gave a value of <LATEX>H _ { 0 } = 6 7 . 0 \pm 3 . 2 \mathrm { k m } \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { M p c } ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> (Beutler et al. 2011).
tzt3 | In this paper, we show that the power-law cosmology essentially depends on the parameters <LATEX>q</LATEX> and <LATEX>H _ { \mathrm { C } } .</LATEX> We intend to find the observational constraints on the power-law cos- mology parameters using the recent observational data from <LATEX>H \left( z \right)</LATEX> and supernova observations. We also intend to test the power-law cosmology with primordial nucleosynthesis. The paper is organized as follows: The basic equations of power- law cosmology are introduced in Section 2. Section 3 deals with the constraints on the parameters <LATEX>q</LATEX> and <LATEX>H _ { 0 }</LATEX> from the latest <LATEX>H \left( z \right)</LATEX> data while Section 4 is devoted to find the con- straints using Union2 compilation of 557 SNe Ia data points. In Section 5, we perform the joint test using <LATEX>H \left( z \right)</LATEX> and SNe Ia data. Section 6 deals with the constraints on power-law cosmology from primordial nucleosynthesis while Section 7 is devoted to study the statefinders in power-law cosmology. In the last Section, we summarize the main results of the paper.

xmgs | 3 CONSTRAINTS FROM OBSERVATIONAL <LATEX>H \left( Z \right)</LATEX> DATA
bd9h | Simon, Verde & Jimenez (2005) determined nine <LATEX>H \left( z \right)</LATEX> data points in the range <LATEX>0 \leqslant z \leqslant 1 . 8</LATEX> by using the differential ages of passively evolving galaxies determined from the Gemini Deep Deep Survey and archival data. Recently, <LATEX>H \left( z \right)</LATEX> data at 11 different redshifts based on the differential ages of red- envelope galaxies were reported by Stern et al. (2010) while 3 more <LATEX>H \left( z \right)</LATEX> data points were obtained by Gaztanaga, Cabre & Hui (2009). The newly <LATEX>H \left( z \right)</LATEX> data points have been used to constrain parameters of various cosmological models (Yang & Zhang 2010; Cao, Zhu & Liang 2011; Chen & Ratra 2011; Paul, Thakur & Ghose 2010, 2011). Here, we use 13 obser- vational <LATEX>H \left( z \right)</LATEX> data points given in Table 1 of the paper by Chen & Ratra (2011) and <LATEX>t h e \quad o n e \quad a t \quad z = 0</LATEX> estimated in the work by Riess et al. (2011). For this sake, we define the <LATEX>\chi ^ { 2 }</LATEX> as
