You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

wzno | One may well ask whether works of this sort, which stand at the limits of some internal strife, are not at the same time a point of departure. Such minds require landmarks. To interpret the con- figuration of the future, a fortune-teller must seek its first linea- ments in dim stains and meanders deposited by dregs in the bottom of a cup. As accident defines its own shape in the chances of matter, and as the hand exploits this disaster, the mind in its own turn awakens. This reordering of a chaotic world achieves its most surprising effects in media apparently unsuited to art, in improvised implements, debris and rubbish whose deteriora-
xagm | tion and breakage offer curious possibilities. The broken pen that spits out ink, the shredded stick, the rumpled paintbrush, are all struggling in troubled worlds; the sponge sets free moist pas- sages of light, and granulations of the wash sparkle where it is spread. Such an alchemy does not, as is commonly supposed, merely develop the stereotyped form of an inner vision; it con- structs the vision itself, gives it body and enlarges its perspectives. The hand is not the mind's docile slave. It searches and experi- ments for its master's benefit; it has all sorts of adventures; it tries its chance.
iwn5 | At this very point, a visionary like Hugo parts company from a visionary like Blake. Yet, the latter is also a great poet and a man who could use his hands. His very energy is like a laborer's. Blake is a painstaking worker, a craftsman or, rather, he is an artist of the Middle Ages whom a sudden mutation brought forth in England at the threshold of the Machine Age. He does not entrust his poems to the printer, but he writes them out and etches them, ornamenting them with floral motifs, like a master illuminator of long ago. He retraces the blinding visions that haunt him, his Stone Age Bible, his age-old spiritual antiquities of man, for the most part in a ready-made form, in the debased style of his own day - sad athletes with kneecaps and pectorals carefully drawn, heavy devices, Hell as found in Gavin Hamilton and in the studio of David. A vulgar respect for Ideal Form and for the aristocratic manner neutralizes his own profound idealism. Thus, we find spir- itualists and amateur Sunday-painters both full of deference for the most worn-out academicism. All this is what we should expect: in them the soul kills the mind and paralyzes the hand.
uooz | We take refuge in Rembrandt. Is not his story one of a pro- gressive liberation? His hand was first a slave to pleasing baroque festoons and mordents, then to a finely lacquered execution, but at length, toward the end of his life, his hand became master not
pxbq | of an unconditioned freedom, nor of a greater virtuosity, but of the necessary daring to take new risks. Simultaneously it takes hold of form, tone and light. It brings the eternal hosts of shadow into the daylight of living men. It piles up centuries in the pass- ing of an instant. It evokes the grandeur of the unique in ordi- nary men. To familiar things and to everyday dress it imparts the poetry of the exceptional. It extracts fabulous riches from the filth and weariness of poverty. How? Rembrandt's hand plunges to the heart of matter to force it to undergo metamorphosis; one might say that he submits it to the smelting action of a furnace, and that the flame, lapping at these rocky plains, now calcines them, now gilds them. It is not that the painter multiplies caprice and exper- iment. He rejects curious procedures in order to travel boldly along his way. But the hand is present. It does not indulge in mes- merism. What it creates is not a flat apparition in empty space, but a substance, a body and an organized structure.
jfsr | By contrast, what an extraordinary proof of all this I once dis- covered in some marvellous photographs which a friend brought me from Suez! A clever and sensitive man in those parts had posed some local rabbis before his camera. He cast about them effects of light worthy of an old master. One would think that light ema- nates from them, from their secular meditation in a shadowed ghetto of Egypt. The foreheads bent over the wide-opened Tal- mud, the noses of noble oriental curvature, the patriarchal beards, the priestly cloaks with their fine folds - everything about them suggests and affirms Rembrandt. Here indeed are his prophetic old men, enthroned beyond time in the misery and splendor of Israel. What discomfort, however, seized me in looking at these incredibly perfect images! Here is Rembrandt minus Rembrandt. Here is pure perception robbed of substance and density, or rather, here is a dazzling optical souvenir, fixed in that crystal- line memory which retains everything, the darkroom. Matter,
u15r | hand, man himself, are all absent. Such an absolute void in the totality of presence is a very strange thing. Perhaps I have before my very eyes an example of a future poetic expression; but as yet I cannot people this silence and this waste land.
lq35 | In considering masters who are full of warmth and freedom, do we not, however, limit ourselves to a type, a group? Have we banished from our reflections, as we might banish artisans with a purely mechanical skill, those masters who with exquisite and faultless patience have evoked more concentrated dreams from choice materials and in refined forms? Is the hand of the engraver, the goldsmith, the illuminator and the lacquerer merely an adroit and complacent servant broken into the practice of fine work? Is what we call perfection, then, the virtue of a slave? Working in the smallest scope, sure of itself and of its direction, such a hand has already become a prodigy, because it subjects the enor- mous scale of man and of the world to the dimensions of the microcosm. It is no mere device for reducing something. The discipline of restricted size is less important to it than its own capacity for action and truth. At first sight, the festivals and bat- tles of Callot appear to be plates from a book on entomology, migrations of insects in a landscape of molehills. In the Siege of La Rochelle, are not the forts and the ships like toys? Numerous, packed together, precise, complete in every detail, do they not appear as if seen from the large end of an opera glass? Is it not the marvel of this handmade thing that everything is understood and ordered within the limits of a stage that is not only diminu- tive but immense? Isolate any figure or any ship, examine it under a magnifying glass and it appears not only in its simple grandeur, its viability - while having lost nothing if brought up to normal scale - but it is authentic. By this I mean that it resembles noth- ing else, that it has the accent of Callot's own handwriting, the inimitable line of his nervous elasticity, of that art of his which
3g9w | 182
d09o | is so attentive to the suppleness of clowns and tightrope walk- ers, so like elegant fencing, so like the greatest violin playing. Callot writes "with a clerk's hand," as was once said of calligra- phers; he writes with the hand of a master - but this hand, so proudly clever, never loses its sympathy for life or its ability to evoke movement. In the ritual of perfection it preserves the sense and practice of freedom.
ylhz | Let us bend down over another enchanted world. Let us examine at length, holding our breath, Fouquet's Hours of Etienne Chevalier (Figure 24). Do we find here, caught beneath the frost of a miraculous execution, absurdly perfect figurines rendered with minute strokes according to workshop rules by an exceptionally acute observer? Far from it. Here is one of the highest expres- sions of that sense of monumental form which is the characteristic trait of the French Middle Ages. One can enlarge these figurines a hundredfold without their losing in power of projection or in fundamental unity. They are like church statues, whose sisters or descendants they might well be called. The hand that drew them belongs to a dynasty formed by centuries of sculpture. It retains, if one may say so, the bent and the force of sculpture even in the tiniest bas-reliefs, dark and gilded, and painted like optical illu- sions, which sometimes accompany the manuscript illumination and which are likewise treated with exquisite breadth. Thus do two worlds come together, as in the circular mirror that Van Eyck hung at the back of the Arnolfini portrait: the world of living giants, cathedral builders and image carvers, and the magical world of the infinitely small. In one world, the hand works with mallet and chisel on a block of stone propped up on a trestle; in the other, it works over a square of parchment in which fine instruments fashion the most precious rarities of the design. I do not know whether one senses it, or if everything is done to make us forget it; but the hand is there, making its presence known in
a3td | 183
ex5k | the joining of the limbs, in the energetic calligraphy of a face, in the profile of a walled city blue in the atmosphere, and even in the gold cross-hatchings that model the light.
9d4o | Nerval relates the story of a hand laid under a curse and which, severed from its body, journeys over the world to do a work of its own. As for me, I separate hands neither from the body nor from the mind. But the relationships between mind and hand are not, however, so simple as those between a chief accustomed to obedience and a docile slave. The mind rules over the hand; hand rules over mind. The gesture that makes nothing, the gesture with no tomorrow, provokes and defines only the state of conscious- ness. The creative gesture exercises a continuous influence over the inner life. The hand wrenches the sense of touch away from its merely receptive passivity and organizes it for experiment and action. It teaches man to conquer space, weight, density and quantity. Because it fashions a new world, it leaves its imprint everywhere upon it. It struggles with the very substance it meta- morphoses and with the very form it transfigures.
cjq2 | Trainer of man, the hand multiplies him in space and in time.
