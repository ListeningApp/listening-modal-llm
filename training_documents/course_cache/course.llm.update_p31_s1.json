        "content": "s8b5 | Ecological Release/Niche Shift - Natural Experiment Four\np450 | Onils-Arvid Nilsson's Salmonids in Swedish Lakes (Asymmetric Niche Shift)\nrsvo | Assessment of diets (Six food types) of two Salmonids\nz4m8 | Great overlap in food utilization in allopatry\nukf0 | Large crustaceans, insect larvae, and terrestrial insects preferred by both species in allopatry\nk38m | In sympatry;\nnkj9 | Char specializes greatly, sixty percent, on small crustaceans, greatly reducing consumption of insect larvae and terrestrial insects\n35a8 | Trout largely remains a generalist in sympatry. Large crustaceans and mollusks are shared in sympatry\n337o | Char's dietary composition greatly changed in sympatry; Trout's not\ncuth | Limiting Similarity - Character Displacement One\n09z2 | Tom Fenchel's Character Displacement in Marine Mud Snails, Denmark\n13fv | Measurement of lengths of two species of snails; Hydrobia ulvae and H. ventrosa\nv5pj | Shell length correlated with food size\ntrab | Allopatry: Snail length almost identical, mode equals three point zero millimeters\ngrxs | Sympatry: Snail length distinctively smaller for H. ventrosa, mode approximately one point eight millimeters, but bigger for H. ulvae, mode approximately three point seven millimeters\nu9dn | Tom Fenchel's Character Displacement in Marine Mud Snails, Denmark\nt25w | Food size of the two species in allopatry very similar\nx62u | Allopatry: Both species - mode equals approximately sixty micrometers in diameter\naoc8 | Sympatry: H. ulvae equals approximately one hundred micrometers; H. ventrosa equals approximately sixty micrometers\n3mdu | Conclusion: The snails compete for the same limiting food resource and H. ulvae diverge towards the large-sized food, hence reducing niche-overlap\nm04v | Limiting Similarity - Character Displacement Two\n3aip | Community-wide Character Displacement and Hutchinson's Size Ratio Rule. Niche partitioning among fruit pigeons - four key niche dimensions: Diamond\nq3gu | One. Fruit Size: Larger species feed mostly on larger fruits (large beaks can handle these)\ntxab | Two. Bird Size and Weight: Body size positively correlated to preferred fruit sizes eaten\ndov0 | Three. Thickness of Branches: Body size positively correlated with branch thickness\nxd5o | Four. Position on Branches: Small species foraging on outer branches and twigs due to lower weight.\n3gny | Summary - Animal Ecology Experimental Methods\nws73 | One. Three Animal Ecology Experimental Methods\nvyos | Laboratory: small animals, simple principles, strong controls\nw4hq | Field Experiments: small-medium sized, advanced set-up, limited control\nghbe | Natural Experiments: any size of animal, large sample size, poor controls\n1lkf | Two. Seven Major Ways to demonstrate competitive interactions\nuobn | Competitive Exclusion: Yeast and grain beetle competition for space\n3194 | Niche shift: Dietary shift between two salmonids (allopatry-sympatry)\nr22o | Ecological release: Barnacle competition for space (Displacement)\nnupw | Density compensation: Rodent-ant competition for seed (Displacement) Contiguous allopatry: Chipmunk habitat occupation (allopatry-sympatry)\n37xs | Character displacement: Food partitioning - Fruit pigeons, mud snails\nhoi0 | Predator-mediated co-existence: Starfish predation (Displacement)\ntffb | Three. Three Manipulation Methods to demonstrate competitive interactions\newwt | Displacement\n2tj1 | Occupational Comparative (allopatry-sympatry)\nnbhq | Four. The Explanatory Concept for competition: Fundamental versus Realised Niche\nw251 | Lecture Three: The Basis of the Ecological Niche Concept\n1vgx | One. Definitions of important terminologies in Ecological Niche Concept\nyjnk | Habitat component: Grinnell\n9zmh | Trophic component: Elton\nmi3g | Multi-dimensional: Hutchinson\nntjg | Abiotic-biotic multidimensional: Begon-Krebs-Ricklefs\n86at | Two. Overview of perception of niche dimensionality\nbpd2 | Niche dimensions: Biotic and abiotic components interacting\nhkd8 | Graphical depiction: One-, two-, three-, multi-dimensional visualization\nsptg | Dimensional interaction: Dimensions can be unrelated or inter-dependent\n2k40 | Lecture Three: The Basis of the Ecological Niche Concept\nkrk7 | Three. Comparison of two niches types and the eco-potential of a species\n4tyc | Eco-potential: Genotype determined/limited maximum potential\n2mjl | Fundamental: Optimum niche, phenotype limited by environmental factors\n6d9q | Realised: Limited by biotic interactions: competition, predation, parasitism\nwsc1 | Four. Foraging Niche concept and fitness of animals\nor3l | Fitness: Population size, reproductive and survivorship rates\nfbyc | Utilization and Response Curves: Bell-shaped, normal distribution, idealized\nvceo | Three Levels: Trophic, what-, Spatial, where-, Temporal, when to eat\nkd78 | According to Joseph Grinnel, an American ecologist, ecological niche is defined it as \"The ultimate distributional unit of a species\"\n896u | Grinnel implied that niches do not overlap, but are disjunct. Species display their fundamental niches; hence there is no apparent competition among them.\no0si | Charles S. Elton, a British ecologist, went further by using a more functional view concept, and defined ecological niche as, \"The trophic position of a species in the biotic environment\".\n1fx8 | Elton viewed the niche as a simplistic subdivision within the traditional trophic grouping as herbivores, carnivores, et cetera, i.e. the mere feeding habits or dietary trait of a species.\ntfms | George Evelyn Hutchinson, after thirty years, proposed the most comprehensive concept to date\npfv5 | \"The n-dimensional hypervolume or hyperspace of a species.\"\n8gxa | The Hutchinsonian concept implies the total range of environmental variables to which a species must be adapted, and under which a species population lives and reproduces indefinitely.\nfsvi | The Hutchinsonian concept therefore involves both habitat and functional aspects\n068d | The environmental variables include physical, chemical and biotic parameters\nysz7 | These variables can be viewed as a gradient along which species utilize with different intensities, and each gradient is considered as an n-dimensional space. Adding up all these forms the niche hyperspace\nk5db | The niche can be viewed as an n-sided flexible ball that can take any form in an n-dimensional coordinate system and represents the responses of the species population to all environmental variables.\n7jzh | In multidimensional geometry with n-number of axes, the niche of an organism is graphically depicted, when all relevant environmental variables are included and these are independent of each other\nvm00 | Begon et al.: \"The limits, for all important environmental features, within which all individuals of a species can survive, grow and reproduce\"\n62qe | Krebs: \"The role or profession of an organism in the environment; its activities and relationships in the community\"\nypz9 | A very broad definition comprising all biotic interactions; competition, mutualism, et cetera\nmpml | Ricklefs: Formal Definition - \"The ranges of many conditions and resource qualities within which the organism or species persists\"; perceived as the multi-dimensional space\nimnm | Informal Definition - \"The ecological role of a species in the community\"\n8na8 | Polechov√° and Storch: \"Ecological niche indicates the position of a species within an ecosystem, describing both the range of conditions necessary for persistence of species, and its ecological role in the ecosystem.\"\nul2a | The diversity of definitions illustrates to what extent the niche is perceived as a species or community property: Is the niche created by the species itself, or by its surroundings?\n4eaf | Or as a dynamic mutual interaction? Let us examine an example - The Beaver\n4b6k | The Niche Concept - Dynamics\nhxiu | The Beaver, Castor Canadensis, C. fiber, creates dams by felling trees across fast-flowing rivers, hence creating a new environment of stagnant water in which they build their nests.\n1ylw | Hence beavers create their own habitat which is conducive both for itself and for many other organisms - i.e. beavers impact their habitat by virtue of a specialized niche of dam building.",
