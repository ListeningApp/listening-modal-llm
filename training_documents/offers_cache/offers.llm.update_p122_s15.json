        "content": "osru | Anti-guarantees can also work very well with high ticket products and services that require a lot of work or customization. \"If you're the type of customer who needs a guarantee before taking a jump, then you are not the type of person we want to work with. We want motivated self-starters who can follow instructions and are not looking for a way out before they even begin. If you are not serious, don't buy it. But if you are, boy are you going to make a killing.\" From these examples, you should get the idea.\n7cej | Implied Guarantees: Performance Models, Revshares, and Profit-Sharing\n9v21 | What The Client Gets: If you do not perform, they do not have to pay. If you perform, your compensation has been determined based on an agreement decided upon before you begin working.\nt3ut | My Take: Performance, Revshare, and Profit-shares aren't guarantees per se, but for all intents and purposes, they are. There is an implied guarantee whenever you enter into a revshare or performance partnership: if you don't make money, you don't have to pay me. In my opinion, this is one of, if not the most desirable setup. First because it makes you accountable to your clients' results. Second it weeds out low performers. Perfect alignment between client and service provider fosters collaboration and a long-term relationship. I'm a big fan. The drawbacks are tracking and collection. So if you can find a way around that ... you've hit a gold mine. This is a part of the offer we teach our agencies who use our software. We help them switch from a retainer model to a performance model and wrap that into the Grand Slam Offer I walked through earlier. I've seen countless agencies go from twenty thousand a month to two hundred thousand or more a month in a matter of a few months.\nblsg | You can also pair a revshare or performance setup with a minimum. It would be like saying we get the greater of one thousand dollars or ten percent of revenue generated. So if the client doesn't generate money because of whatever reason this at least covers your costs of services etc.\nc9it | Or saying we get one thousand dollars a month for the first three months, then after that, it switches to one hundred percent performance. This would be ideal for a setup that takes a lot of time to get going.\nt29r | These types of offers work well when you have quantifiable outcomes. The stronger, of course, is no guaranteed payment without performance.\nddhd | Create Your Own Winning Guarantee\ne69f | Reversing risk is the number one way to increase the conversion of an offer. Experienced marketers spend as much time crafting their guarantees as the deliverables themselves. It's that important.\nq12e | I have personally used all the guarantees listed above except for the hotel and phone call one, which I just saw and liked. But you can come up with your own! The key is to identify a client's biggest fears, pain, and perceived obstacles. \"What do they not want to have happen if they pay you? What are they most afraid of?\" Reverse their fears into a guarantee. Think of the time, emotion, and outside costs associated with any program or service. The more specific and creative the guarantee is, the better.\nvj9y | That being said, guarantees are enhancers. They can enhance the magnetism or attraction of any offer, but they cannot make a business. If a guarantee is used to cover up a poor sales team or a poor product, it will backfire into lots of refunds. No bueno.\ng0bb | My advice: Start selling service-based guarantees or setting up performance partnerships. This will make all sales final so no fear from refunds. Most importantly, it will commit you to your customers' results and keep you honest. From there, either keep that guarantee and scale perfectly fine, or move up the food chain to less restrictive guarantees to increase volume.\nk09q | We now have a core offer built and guarantees chosen.\nw30h | Next Up ...\n4vcv | Now all we have to do is put a bow on this puppy and actually name it. Naming an offer correctly determines how well your advertising converts, how big of a response you get from outbound emails, cold calls, texts, and how many inbound responses you get from organic comments.\niphf | It matters.\njdf8 | That being said, I will show you how to generate unlimited names or wrapping paper for your offer. That way it never fatigues, no matter how small your market may be. This is the key to evergreen lead generation.\n59yt | Guarantees can make or break businesses. They are like dynamite, they can be incredibly powerful if in the hands of an expert. Go to Acquisition dot com slash training slash offers and select Creating Guarantees to watch a short video tutorial so you can start using this in your business to make more sales as soon as possible. I also made a Free Guarantee Checklist for you to use when thinking through all the variables. As always, it's absolutely free. Enjoy.\ne2hn | ENHANCING THE OFFER: NAMING\ngojw | Implicit-egotism effect: we are generally drawn to the things and people that most resemble us.\nf57y | M-A-G-I-C HEADLINE FORMULA\njlv5 | Like the tree that falls in the forest that no one hears, having a Grand Slam Offer will not make you money if no one finds out about it. The goal must be that upon hearing about your offer, your ideal prospects are interested enough to take action. Naming it properly is an integral part of this process.\nzw42 | Here's an example. Say you see a Free Six-Week Stress Release Challenge and a Float Tank Center Session. While they may be the same thing, just named differently, you're much more likely to respond to the first.\nzgr4 | Now here's the rub: over time, offers fatigue. And in local markets, they fatigue even faster. Why? In a local market, it costs relatively little to reach an entire population. On most platforms you can reach one thousand people for about twenty dollars. So, if there are two hundred thousand people in your addressable area, then it would only cost you ten thousand dollars to reach all of them one time.\nocdz | Important disclaimer: reaching an audience one time in no way means an offer is fatigued. Most people don't even notice an offer on the first mention. That's why you need to create new creative videos, images, and new hooks, stories, and copy around the same offers. You can still use offers for a long time. But when we're talking about years of use, not months, offers can eventually fatigue.\n0ii3 | Over time you can rename the offer to refresh it. This one concept will get you leads forever. I mean it. So pay attention. We are not changing the actual offer. We are only changing the wrapping paper.\n2gqg | ORIGINAL OFFER THREE VALUE BUNDLE\ni4a8 | SAME BUNDLE, DIFFERENT WRAPPER\nfupn | If you've put together a bundled offering, you're still ultimately going to be doing the same things. The work you do, services you provide, and products you offer will remain unchanged as the name shifts. Again, we're simply changing the wrapper.\n8yo3 | Here's the simplest formula I've come up with for this process:\nlm4p | M-A-G-I-C HEADLINE FORMULA\nmpm5 | MAGNET MAKE A MAGNETIC REASON AVATAR ANNOUNCE THE AVATAR GOAL GIVE THEM A GOAL\nstwt | INTERVAL INDICATE A TIME INTERVAL\npcec | CONTAINER COMPLETE WITH A CONTAINER WORD\njqe8 | Important Note: Not all these components are mandatory. You will typically use three to five of them in naming a program or service. If you can fit them all in, great, but it's likely the name will become too long.\nurkt | The shorter and punchier the better. So it's a balance between brevity and specificity. The only way to really know what works is to write the names out and test them. Let's run through the components now.\n0dx9 | Author Note: Marketing Theory\ngilw | If you like understanding the concepts behind my chosen M-A-G-I-C formula. Each roughly translates to Attention, Magnet, Discrimination, Avatar, Purpose, Goal, Timeline, Interval, and Method, Container.\nx96u | Make a Magnetic Reason Why",
