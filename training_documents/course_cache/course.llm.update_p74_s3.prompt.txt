You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ljmz | · As habitat heterogeneity increases and more bird species are added, these have to separate on an increasing number of niche dimensions, particularly:
en1l | > Food type, Foraging techniques, Foraging height, Micro-habitat type
45gx | Biogeography - The Species-Area Model (1)
xgur | · When increasing the area (A) from which one samples various species populations, the total species number (S) increase in a positive way according to the following logarithmic deterministic model: S = C.AZ (Areas = Oceanic islands or Habitat islands on mainlands)
iz66 | . Factors that specifically contribute to the S-Area relationship are:
dndq | 1. Large islands are also subject to larger sampling sizes of individuals (N) from species populations thereby increasing the probability of encountering new species; hence a mere sampling phenomenon or artefact of more effective species sampling as N increases
xzce | 2. As the island size increases, the probability of encountering different habitat types also increases: High landscape heterogeneity: Lakes, mountains, valleys, swamps, oases etc., and such features contain more potential niches that can be filled by species
w4vd | Biogeography - The Species-Area Model (2)
cuh0 | 3. Large islands inevitably also contain large populations, and large populations are less vulnerable to local extinction phenomena (e.g. predation, parasites, pathogens)
k36t | 4. Large island populations also have higher speciation potentials due to higher population variability contained herein (high polymorphism and resource use diversity
z1wx | 5. Large islands inevitably represent larger targets for colonizing species (immigration) as the probability of encountering the area increases with size
o6gf | Biogeography - The Species-Area Model (3)
0hs6 | · The normal range of Z is 0.20 - 0.40 for true (oceanic) islands and often around 0.25.
m05x | · Z is only 0.1 - 0.25 for recently isolated habitat islands (e.g. forest surrounded by farms, a lake, a gap in the forest, or an oasis).
ds29 | · Z > 0.26 for long-term isolated habitats on the mainland or very large islands such as Australia.
qcmr | · As habitat connectivity increases, the S-Area relationship is reduced => Low z-value
7c6p | · Habitat connectivity is related to habitat diversity and as oceanic islands are more isolated than mainland habitat islands, they display stronger S-Area relationship (high z-value)
d1ee | Biogeography - The Species-Area Model (4)
itx4 | · Logging both sides of the S-Area power function:
vwrs | log S = log C + z log A
xjkw | · C and Z are constants depending on both habitat type, animal community and is specific to variability in dispersability and mobility of the species herein.
wght | . In a x-y logarithmic plot, log C is the intercept on the y-axis, and z denotes the graph slope.
3lgb | . The z-value denotes how strong the S and A relationship is (= positive correlation).
ttwt | MacArthur-Wilson's Equilibrium Theory (1)
x5l2 | · Modelling species number (S) on true islands: S depends on two independent variables: 1. Immigration rate (I) 2. Extinction rate (E)
ilrs | · S is determined when an equilibrium between I and E rates is obtained
0a03 | · As S 1, I rate is lowered (1) as potential niche space is occupied (saturation 1)
auae | . In contrast when S î then E rate 1 due to increased interspecific competition
5b6y | . Small islands have high E and low I rates: They are small targets and have small vulnerable populations; the opposite is the case for large islands; high I and low E
1y10 | Immigration rate (I)
6mnx | · Distance to mainland also a factor for I rate: Distance islands have low I and close islands have higher I.
tynp | . Thus, S is highest on large islands nearby mainland (D), and smallest on small islands far from the mainland (A)
ob0u | MacArthur-Wilson's Equilibrium Theory (2)
50o1 | . Extinction Rate: Depends on 1) Island Size, 2) Distance to mainland (isolation degree)
cw76 | · Island Size: Large islands have larger populations, hence genetic population variability is high and populations therefore more resilient towards predators, diseases, and stochastic detrimental events: e.g. storms, tsunamis, floods, drought etc.)
lkk5 | · Distance to mainland: If close to mainland, extinctions may be delayed by regular immigration, thus compensating for the species loss over time
molj | MacArthur-Wilson's Equilibrium Theory (3)
5pto | · Immigration Rate: Depends on 1) Island Size, 2) Distance to mainland
mo6k | · Island Size: A large island represents a greater target for colonisers => higher probability of colonization.
zh6q | · Distance to mainland: If the distance is short, the likeliness of species colonizing from the mainland is higher than for more remote islands, to which many species may have difficulties in reaching successfully (depends on mobility and dispersability of animals).
kp04 | · In effect species number is highest on large islands close to the mainland (CL) and smallest on small islands far away (remote/ isolated) from the mainland (DS)
3e8r | Modelling Species Number on Habitat Islands
8g7g | . On habitat islands, species numbers depend on: 1) Speciation rate and 2) Extinction rate
5j4f | · Immigration plays a minor role on the large scale and is replaced by speciation processes.
4xe7 | . However, if habitat connectivity is high between islands, immigration from species rich areas is important in ecological time frame; speciation only evolutionary time frame
pg4b | Speciation Rate
b0d0 | · Fewer empty niches reduce the chances of adaptive radiation by virtue of reducing character displacement processes
d7eu | Extinction Rate
xndr | As species saturation increases interspecific competition • increases extinction rate through the competitive exclusion principle (similarly to true islands)
