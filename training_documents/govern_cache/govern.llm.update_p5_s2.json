        "content": "1k9e | regime set forth in the nineteen eleven convention produced a striking rebound in the seal population by prohibiting pelagic sealing and regulating harvests on land. The Antarctic Treaty regime has proven remarkably effective in allowing scientific research and other cooperative activities to go forward, despite the inability of the parties to arrive at any final resolution of their jurisdictional differences. It is harder, though not impossible, to make a convincing case for the effectiveness of the regime set forth in the nineteen seventy-three Convention on Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora as a means of solving the problem of maintaining healthy stocks of rhinoceros or elephants. For its part, the pollution-control regime developed under the Mediterranean Action Plan has not put an end to the problem of pollution in the Mediterranean Basin.\n5bjs | Effectiveness as Goal Attainment\nuodj | Goal-oriented effectiveness, by contrast, is a measure of the extent to which a regime's stated or unstated goals are attained over time. Of course, there is frequently a straightforward and easily identifiable relationship between goal attainment and the search for solutions to motivating problems. The management of stocks of wild animals for maximum sustainable yield or optimal sustainable population, to take a simple example, requires that solutions be found to the problem of severe depletions resulting from excessive harvests or the destruction of critical habitat. But goal attainment and problem solving need not go together. Putting in place an equitable process of allocating harvest quotas for wild animals, a specific goal of the fur seal regime, offers no assurance that a solution to the problem of stock depletions will be found. Controlling the trade in endangered species, a prime goal of the CITES regime, is not sufficient to protect the species in question from going extinct. Reducing sulfur dioxide emissions by thirty percent, the stated goal of the nineteen eighty-five protocol to the Geneva Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, does not guarantee the biological recovery of German forests or Swedish lakes.\nk16v | This distinction between effectiveness as problem solving and goal-oriented effectiveness becomes sharper when we broaden our perspective to consider unstated goals. More often than not, those engaged in regime formation are motivated by goals they do not feel comfortable articulating in public as well as by goals they deem appro-\nb2lm | priate for inclusion in public statements. Typically, these unstated goals deal with distributive concerns in contrast to the pursuit of some common good. To take a classic example, it is standard practice for those advocating expanded coastal state jurisdiction over fisheries to emphasize conservation in presenting their case in public. But it is common knowledge that they are motivated as well by a desire to protect their own fishers from competition on the part of foreign fishers. Similarly, the provisions of pollution-control regimes often owe as much to the efforts of the parties to protect certain industries as to a desire to promote the common good by avoiding or reducing environmental impacts. In such cases, the link between problem-solving effectiveness and goal-oriented effectiveness is apt to be particularly tenuous. As recent experience with the marine fisheries makes crystal clear, institutional arrangements may prove extremely effective in fulfilling the goal of protecting domestic fishers but contribute little toward solving the underlying problem of stock depletions caused by excessive harvests.\nti7f | Behavioral Effectiveness\noksu | Yet another way of thinking about effectiveness is to ask whether the operation of a regime causes one or more of its members, or individuals, corporations, and organizations operating under the jurisdiction of the members, to alter their behavior, either by doing things they would not otherwise have done or by terminating or redirecting prior patterns of behavior. The reduction of Japanese and Soviet investments in commercial whaling, by retiring existing whaling fleets without replacement, constitutes a behavioral change that is clearly related to the operation of the whaling regime, though some would argue that the causal connection is hard to demonstrate. The dramatic growth of American investment in capacity to harvest groundfish is unquestionably an outgrowth of the introduction of a regime featuring extended coastal state jurisdiction during the nineteen seventies. Similarly, the striking increase in corporate research and development aimed at developing substitutes for CFCs occurred in the wake of the formation of the ozone regime under the provisions of the nineteen eighty-five Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and, especially, the nineteen eighty-seven Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer.\nwtow | Although behavioral effectiveness may be correlated with problem-solving effectiveness or goal-oriented effectiveness, there is no basis for assuming that this will always be the case. As is now becoming clear, for example, the growth of American investment in the ground fisheries of the Bering Sea region has simply substituted a new threat to the health of the fish stocks for the old threat posed by foreign fishers. The introduction of systems of transferable or tradable permits in marine fisheries typically has the effect of stimulating fishers to increase investments in sophisticated technologies, a behavioral response that can easily run counter to the requirements of both problem-solving and goal-oriented effectiveness. Similarly, there are reasons to doubt whether some of the chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs will turn out to be environmentally benign in the long run. Equally troubling, the behavioral effects attributable to the establishment of an international regime may amount to a form of displacement in the sense that they create a new problem in the process of solving an old one. Banning the consumptive use of various species of great whales, for instance, has had the effect of increasing pressure on whale stocks not included in the ban. All told, therefore, it seems clear that the behavioral effects arising from the operation of a regime must be assessed on their own terms; they cannot be subsumed under the rubrics of effectiveness as problem-solving and goal-oriented effectiveness.\no22k | Process Effectiveness\nnwfz | A way of thinking that appeals to many administrators, lawyers, and political scientists treats effectiveness as a matter of the extent to which the provisions of an international regime are implemented in the domestic legal and political systems of the member states as well as the extent to which those subject to a regime's prescriptions actually comply with their requirements. This approach has the virtue of suggesting relatively straightforward procedures for measurement. It is easy enough to determine whether individual states have ratified conventions or treaties setting forth the provisions of regimes and\nnvfy | passed implementing legislation to put these provisions into practice within their own jurisdictions. An account of the extent to which such actions have led, in turn, to the promulgation of more detailed regulations designed to transform the provisions of a regime into a day-to-day routine is ordinarily feasible as well. Though monitoring compliance is apt to be a more complex process, there is little ambiguity at the conceptual level about what is at stake in such an approach to the assessment of effectiveness.",
