        "content": "gyzb | Five hundred sixty-one isoforms regulate neuroproteasome localization (ApoE4 less than E3 less than E2), we predicted that neurons\nrrp1 | Five hundred sixty-two from ApoE4-KI mice would be more susceptible accumulating sarkosyl-insoluble Tau relative to\n8b70 | Five hundred sixty-three neurons from ApoE3-KI or ApoE2-KI mice. To test this prediction, we crossed each of the\nnivt | Five hundred sixty-four ApoE-KI lines to the hTau-KI lines, generating mice which endogenously express ApoE2, E3, or\n8925 | Five hundred sixty-five E4 as well as hTau. DIV fourteen primary neurons from each line (hTau/ApoE2 double KI,\ny2tz | Five hundred sixty-six hTau/ApoE3 double KI, and hTau/ApoE4 double KI) were then treated with a range of iBEp\np769 | Five hundred sixty-seven doses spanning four log units. Neurons were then separated into sarkosyl-soluble and insoluble\njhwn | Five hundred sixty-eight fractions and immunoblotted. We found no sarkosyl-insoluble Tau aggregates at baseline in any line, which suggests that the ApoE4-induced reduction of neuroproteasomes levels alone is not\no1y4 |  \n3rdp | Five hundred seventy-one sufficient to drive Tau aggregation. However, after treatment with even the lowest\n2n4o | Five hundred seventy-two dose of iBEp, we found accumulation of sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in hTau/E4-dKI neurons,\n31ya | Five hundred seventy-three rendering E4 neurons over twenty-five-fold more susceptible to Tau aggregation than E3 neurons. Conversely, neurons from hTau/E2-dKI mice were over ten-fold less susceptible to\n7nda | Five hundred seventy-four neuroproteasome-inhibition induced Tau aggregation than neurons from hTau/E3-dKI mice. Overall, these data demonstrate that ApoE isoforms differentially shift the threshold for the neuroproteasome-dependent formation of endogenous sarkosyl-insoluble Tau inclusions.\n4pv9 |  \n7w0x |  \npehk | Five hundred seventy-eight Neuroproteasome inhibition induces endogenous phosphorylated, sarkosyl-insoluble,\nh7hi | Five hundred seventy-nine Thioflavin S-positive Tau aggregates\nz8wk | \n3fxr | Five hundred eighty-one We noticed that neuroproteasome inhibition induces the shift of sarkosyl-insoluble Tau into a\n582 species which migrates at a higher molecular weight on an S D S-PAGE gel, at approximately sixty-four kiloDaltons. Similar shifts in molecular weight of Tau are observed\n1rwa | Five hundred eighty-four in the Alzheimerâ€™s disease brain and is a hallmark phenotype of multiple neurodegenerative disorders.\n40h8 | Five hundred eighty-five This molecular weight shift can in part be due to Tau phosphorylation at many residues.\n9w49 | Five hundred eighty-six Therefore, we wanted to address whether iBEp-induced Tau aggregates are phosphorylated.\nkgl8 | Five hundred eighty-seven Rather than profiling by a panel of phospho-specific antibodies against Tau, we took a more\nkq4g | Five hundred eighty-eight unbiased approach and measured Tau phosphorylation by quantitative phosphoproteomics. We\nqjp8 | Five hundred eighty-nine treated primary wild type neurons with iBEp for either one, six, or twenty-four hours and then performed sarkosyl\npc64 | Five hundred ninety fractionations. Soluble and insoluble fractions were processed for TMT labeling in preparation\nmbrx | Five hundred ninety-one for quantitative mass spectrometry and then peptides were run over an Iron-N T A column to enrich\npcd0 | Five hundred ninety-two for phospho-peptides. We then used this enriched population for quantitative phospho-\ntxkp | Five hundred ninety-three proteomics analysis at the single peptide level. Here, we find a time-dependent\nmxqe | Five hundred ninety-four increase in Tau phosphorylation at only four of twenty-six identified sites which correspond to human S two zero two,\ny9ob | Five hundred ninety-six T two zero five, T two seventeen, and S four zero four. This is a specific signature of phosphorylation which\ntwm6 | \n8qsp | Five hundred ninety-seven corresponds to sites at which Tau is phosphorylated in the AD brain and detected by established antibodies (S two zero two - C P thirteen, T two zero five - A T eight, and S four zero four - P H F one) as well as CSF\n598 biomarkers for AD progression (T two seventeen).\nyck2 | \nhthe | Six hundred To validate these data, we treated hTau-KI neurons with iBEp and then fixed and stained these\notjm | Six hundred one neurons. We observed no staining in neurons cultured from Tau-KO mice using the R two two nine five\nq0fv | Six hundred two antibody to detect total Tau or the CP thirteen antibody to detect phosphorylated S two zero two.\nv9vo | Six hundred three Incubating neurons with secondary antibodies alone showed no signal. We therefore\nrwty | Six hundred four exclusively used CP thirteen for our ICC experiments to detect phosphorylated Tau. We find a\nki97 | Six hundred five significant elevation of CP thirteen signal in iBEp-treated primary hippocampal hTau-KI neurons\n606 compared to controls. This iBEP-induced signal appears punctate and distributed in\n099j | Six hundred seven both axons and MAP two positive dendrites. To validate these data, we conducted\nm7zf | Six hundred eight immunohistochemical analysis of sections from hTau-KI mice stereotactically injected with iBEp and contralaterally injected with vehicle control (zero point zero seven percent DMSO). After stereotactic\n2ghw | Six hundred nine injections, animals were allowed to recover for seventy-two hours and then were perfused and sectioned\nhnfy | \n Six hundred twelve for IHC. We observed no staining in the Tau-KO mice using the A T eight antibody or with secondary antibodies alone. We observe a threefold induction of phosphorylated Tau signal\nw6d9 | \nlbm8 | Six hundred fourteen in hippocampi injected with iBEp compared to the contralateral P B S controls. We see a strong increase in A T eight positive inclusions mislocalized to somatodendritic compartments in iBEp-injected\nkrjy | Six hundred fifteen hippocampi, which extend into the stratum radiatum and stratum moleculare.\nn7dw | While sarkosyl-insoluble Tau reflects aggregated Tau species, there are\n9nt1 | Six hundred eighteen varying definitions of a protein aggregate: misfolded proteins which cluster together, proteins\nfr45 | Six hundred nineteen which form stable inclusions, inclusions which are resistant to varying detergents, and then in\ns2ty | Six hundred twenty some cases, proteins which form very stable aggregates and even amyloids. Thioflavin\n3cdb | Six hundred twenty-one S (ThioS) is a dye that stains the beta-sheet structures of amyloid aggregates, including both\n6hsm | Six hundred twenty-two aggregated Tau tangles and amyloid plaques. Therefore, ThioS is used for the neuropathological\nom5d | Six hundred twenty-three diagnosis of a wide variety of neurodegenerative disorders. We conducted ThioS\n0svq | Six hundred twenty-four staining of sections from hTau-KI mice stereotactically injected with iBEp and contralaterally\n1too | Six hundred twenty-five injected with vehicle control. After stereotactic injections, animals were allowed to recover for\npti9 | Seventy-two hours and then brains were perfused, sectioned, and stained for ThioS. We find a strong\n627 increase in ThioS staining from the CA one region of hippocampi exposed to iBEp relative to\n4mtx | Six hundred twenty-eight vehicle controls. ThioS positive inclusions appear as flame-like inclusions in both the CA one\nrgxy | Six hundred twenty-nine pyramidal layer and the granule cell layer of the Dentate Gyrus.\nvsq9 | Six hundred thirty Neuroproteasome inhibition-induced flame-like ThioS positive aggregates co-localize with both\nd5a1 | Six hundred thirty-one phosphorylated Tau (A T eight) and total Tau (D A nine) in single Z-plane images from\nqtb8 | Six hundred thirty-two neurons in the CA one and DG of hippocampus. We conclude that some neuroproteasome-induced\ng395 | Six hundred thirty-three aggregates we observe are indeed composed of Tau. In addition to these large ThioS positive inclusions,\n634 we also observe some thread-like ThioS positive inclusions in the hippocampal neuropil as well as\nwfvy | Six hundred thirty-five widely distributed thin ThioS positive inclusions that appear dispersely throughout the iBEp-injected\n7yfb | hippocampus. The ThioS positive inclusions formed following neuroproteasome",
