## Too Close to Integrable: Crossover from Normal to Anomalous Heat Diffusion

Energy transport in one-dimensional chains of particles with three conservation laws is generically anomalous and belongs to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang dynamical universality class. Surprisingly, some examples where an apparent normal heat diffusion is found over a large range of length scales were reported. We propose a novel physical explanation of these intriguing observations. We develop a scaling analysis which explains how this may happen in the vicinity of an integrable limit, such as, but not only, the famous Toda model. In this limit, heat transport is mostly supplied by quasi-particles with a very large mean free path L. Upon increasing the system size L, three different regimes can be observed: a ballistic one, an intermediate diffusive range, and, eventually, the crossover to the anomalous hydrodynamic regime. Our theoretical considerations are supported by numerical simulations of a gas of diatomic hard-point particles for almost equal masses and of a weakly perturbed Toda chain. Finally, we discuss the case of the perturbed harmonic chain, which exhibits a yet different scenario.

After more than twenty years of theoretical research there is a general consensus that energy transport in one and two-dimensional systems is anomalous, meaning that Fourier's law is invalid. Numerics as well as hydrodynamic and kinetic theories consistently indicate that the nonlinear interactions of fluctuations of conserved quantities yield, in reduced space-dimension, non-standard relaxation and transport properties, even in the linear response regime. The main signature of the anomaly is the divergence of the thermal conductivity k with the system size L, i.e. a superdiffusive heat transport. In one-dimension, although this is a genuine many-body problem, it can be described effectively as an ensemble of LÃ©vy particles, namely random walkers performing free ballistic steps with finite velocity for times that are power-law distributed. This description accounts quantitatively for several non-equilibrium properties, both transient and stationary. Remarkably, the phenomenon was shown to belong to the class of the famous Kardar-Parisi-Zhang KPZ equation, suggesting a universal behavior with implications for the theory of transport in nano-sized objects like individual nanowires, nanotubes, or polymers. In this general context, nanowires and single-walled nanotubes have been analyzed to look for deviations from the standard Fourier's law. Experimental evidence of such deviations has been reported for single-walled carbon nanotubes. Non-trivial length dependence of thermal conductance has been also observed in molecular chains. Transport anomalies can be even exploited to achieve optimal efficiency of thermal to electric energy conversion.

Although the general framework is pretty well understood, there are still open issues that escaped so far a convincing explanation. For definiteness, we focus on anharmonic chains, represented by a Hamiltonian of the form

H :

n plus U qn plus one minus qn , (one)

where mn, qn and pn are respectively the mass, displacement and momentum of the nth particle. For a generic potential U, this family of models should show superdiffusive heat transport in the KPZ universality class, as confirmed by several studies. However, there is evidence of significant deviations of the dynamical exponents in some models with hard-core potential. Moreover, chains allowing for bond dissociation like e.g Lennard-Jones, Morse, and Coulomb potentials unexpectedly display finite thermal conductivity, while other similar potentials closely follow the prediction of anomalous scaling. For the double-well potential, an intermediate-energy regime with almost diffusive transport has been reported.

Another, more surprising feature is the apparent normal diffusive heat transport observed at low energies in asymmetric potentials like the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou-alpha-beta chain, where mn equals m and U alpha beta y equals y squared over two plus alpha y cubed over three plus beta y fourth over four. Yet, more compelling evidence of a seemingly normal transport has been found in a Toda lattice under the action of an additional conservative noise and in the diatomic Hard Point Gas HPG. In the first context, successive studies demonstrated that the diffusive regime is a finite-size effect, whereby anomalous behavior is recovered for L large enough (see also the discussion based on mode-coupling arguments).

In this Letter we present a general explanation of the counter-intuitive normal transport, by tracing it back to the vicinity to an integrable limit. In this context, the kinetics is dominated by quasi-particles those associated to the integrals of motion of the integrable regime, e.g., solitons over a broad range of scales. In fact, this range extends beyond the very large quasi-particle mean free path, where a purely ballistic behavior is expected. More specifically, we proceed by first devising a finite-size scaling approach and then validating the theoretical arguments with the numerical analysis of a few test models.

Let the parameter epsilon denote the distance from the integrable limit left parenthesis epsilon equals zero right parenthesis corresponding to the perfectly integrable regime. Building upon the intuition contained in Ref., we propose that for small &, the heat flux J left parenthesis L , epsilon right parenthesis can be written as the sum of two terms,

J left parenthesis L , epsilon right parenthesis equals J sub N left parenthesis L , epsilon right parenthesis plus J sub A left parenthesis L , epsilon right parenthesis, (two)

J sub A is the hydrodynamic contribution, arising from the mutual interaction among density, energy, and momentum fluctuations, and responsible for the asymptotic superdiffusion. For L approaches infinity, J sub A approximately equals L to the power of eta minus one with eta equals one third in systems belonging to the KPZ class, while eta equals one half in some special cases, like models with symmetric interaction potentials e.g., Fermi Pasta Ulam Tsingou beta chain with potential left parenthesis U sub beta left parenthesis y right parenthesis equals y squared over two plus y fourth over four right parenthesis and models subject to conservative noise e.g., the noisy harmonic or nonlinear chains. J sub N is a kinetic contribution, accounting for the energy transported by weakly interacting quasi-particles.

On the basis of standard kinetic arguments, J sub N is expected to be a function of a single compound variable, the effective length xi equals L over ell expressed in units of the mean free path ell of the quasi particles,

J sub N of L comma epsilon equals j sub N of L over ell. (Three)

For xi much greater than one, we expect j sub N of xi proportional to one over xi, meaning that the flux is the result of a standard diffusive process, while j sub N of zero is a finite value, meaning that the process is ballistic for system sizes smaller than the mean free path left parenthesis xi much less than one right parenthesis. j sub N of xi dependence is captured by the simple effective formula j sub N of xi equals fraction j sub zero over r plus xi. (Four)

where r is a constant accounting for the boundary resistance and j sub zero is a suitable additional constant.

The vicinity to the integrable limit manifests itself as a divergence of the mean free path, which we account for by assuming ell approximately equals epsilon to the power of negative theta, where theta greater than zero is a system-dependent exponent. As long as J sub A of L comma epsilon does not display any singularity for epsilon approaching zero, we can neglect its dependence on epsilon for epsilon much less than one. Therefore, for large L, Eq. (Two) can be rewritten as

J of L comma epsilon approximately equals fraction c sub N over L epsilon to the power of theta plus fraction c sub A over L to the power of one minus eta. (Five)

where C sub N and c sub A are two suitable parameters. Accordingly, the anomalous contribution prevails only above the crossover length ell sub c approximately equals epsilon to the power of negative theta over eta. For L less than or equal to ell sub c, heat conduction is dominated by the j sub N. In particular, within the range left bracket ell equals epsilon to the power of negative theta, ell sub c right bracket an apparent normal conductivity is expected, which is nothing but a finite size effect.

Now, we start the numerical analysis, focusing on models of the class (One). More specifically, we shall consider the chain with inter-

U sub T of y equals left parenthesis e to the power of negative y plus y minus one right parenthesis. The HPG dynamics consists of successive tween neighboring particles according to the kinematic rules u sub i prime equals fraction m sub i minus m sub i plus one over m sub i plus m sub i plus one u sub i plus fraction two m sub i plus one over m sub i plus m sub i plus one u sub i plus one quad comma u sub i plus one prime equals fraction two m sub i over m sub i plus m sub i plus one u sub i minus fraction m sub i minus m sub i plus one over m sub i plus m sub i plus one u sub i plus one comma (Six)

where u sub n equals dot q sub n and the primed variables denote the values after the collision. Simulations are very efficient since they only require keeping track of the collisions.

For equal masses left parenthesis m sub n equals m right parenthesis, both models are completely integrable: in the HPG, the constants of motion are the initial velocities, while in the Toda model the conserved actions are given functions of positions and momenta. Both models can be seen as gases of quasi-particles: velocitons for HPG and solitons for Toda. Transport is ballistic: kappa of L is proportional to L and the energy-current correlation function does not decay to zero at large times. Note that, according to the classification of the reference, the two models are noninteracting and interacting, respectively.

Here below, we consider two different ways of breaking integrability (i.e. to induce interactions among the quasi-particles): (i) different masses, such as a diatomic arrangement whereby M sub n equals m sub one equals M over two times one minus delta, M sub n equals m sub two equals M over two times one plus delta for odd (even) n; (ii) a conservative noise through random collisions exchanging the momenta of neighboring particles at a given rate gamma. In the former (latter) case delta (gamma) plays the role of the above mentioned closeness parameter. In either case, only three conservation laws survive, momentum, energy and stretch, yielding anomalous transport and dynamical scaling. For large enough delta-values, there is overwhelming evidence that both the diatomic HPG and Toda belong to the KPZ universality class. For the randomly perturbed Toda evidence of a diverging conductivity is solid, yielding eta approximately zero point four four for a large collision rate gamma equals one.

Here, we are interested in the quasi-integrable regime, delta much less than one. The first issue is the determination of the mean free path ell. In the HPG with a diatomic mass arrangement, ell corresponds to the average space traveled by a single velociton before the collisions induce a sizeable change of its original velocity. Given the mass arrangement, the collision types left parenthesis M one, M two right parenthesis and left parenthesis M two, M one right parenthesis alternate and it is thereby appropriate to look at velocity changes every second iterate left parenthesis U goes to U prime goes to U double prime right parenthesis. From equation six.

U double prime equals left parenthesis one minus delta right parenthesis U prime plus delta chi two equals left parenthesis one minus delta squared right parenthesis U plus delta left parenthesis chi two minus chi one right parenthesis plus delta squared chi one where chi one and two denote the velocities of the quasi-particles encountered by the velociton U, hereby assumed to be uncorrelated Gaussian variables with zero average and variance the average of chi one and two squared equals V squared (neglecting the mass difference between the two particles). To leading order in delta, the map can be turned into the stochastic differential equation

U dot equals negative delta squared U plus the square root of two delta V zeta, where zeta is a unit-variance white noise, while time is measured in two tau units, tau being the average collision time. As a result, the distribution of U values diffuses, its variance growing initially as D sub U equals two delta squared V squared T, so that the time needed for D sub U to be approximately equal to V squared is T approximately equal to tau over delta squared (in physical time units) and the corresponding mean free path is ell approximately equal to V tau over delta squared. In other words, we expect theta equals two. Numerical results have been obtained by implementing the standard non-equilibrium procedure. Left and right edges are attached to Maxwellian heat baths at temperatures T sub L equals six and T sub R equals four with delta T equals T sub L minus T sub R and the flux J determined from the average energy exchanged in the steady state. For the HPG we employ the thermal-wall method.

In Figure one A we plot the rescaled thermal conductivity delta squared kappa of the diatomic HPG, referred to the effective length xi equals L delta squared. The various curves correspond to different delta values - delta decreases from top to bottom. There is clear evidence of a ballistic regime followed by a diffusive one, as accounted for by equation three. For the smaller values of delta, Fourier-like transport persists up to the maximal available L, while a crossover to the anomalous regime is seen upon increasing delta. Upon decreasing delta, the curves converge from above towards an asymptotic shape, kappa sub N equals J sub N left parenthesis xi right parenthesis xi over delta T. In fact, for delta approaching zero and fixed xi, L increases left parenthesis L equals xi over delta squared right parenthesis, so that the corresponding J sub A left parenthesis L right parenthesis contribution becomes increasingly negligible.

Then, J sub Lambda is estimated from the data for the smallest perturbation amplitude (since J sub A is practically negligible over the explored length range). The simple formula four proves remarkably accurate: see the solid upper curve in figure two, to be compared with the circles, which represent the numerical HPG results.

As a second test, we consider the diatomic Toda model. For large energy densities, most of its dynamical properties are basically equal to the HPG and we thus expect again ell approximately equal to delta to the power of negative two, i.e. theta equals two. At lower energies, one should estimate the soliton scattering rates due to mass inhomogeneities; however, there are no reasons to expect a different scaling behavior. Indeed, the typical thermalization time is of order delta to the power of negative two in a wide energy range. The conductivities taken from the reference are reported in Figure one B after a proper rescaling. The data collapse confirms the validity of our arguments.

Finally, we have considered the Toda model with conservative noise. In this case, it is natural to argue that the mean free path scales as the inverse of the collision rate, ell is proportional to gamma to the power of negative one. This intuition is confirmed by the data reported in Fig. one c, where we observe the same scenario as for the previous models, after setting theta equals one. For small gamma, j sub N converges again towards a function which asymptotically decays as one over xi. However, the heuristic formula four is not comparably accurate: it is necessary to add a correction term to reproduce the observed data as shown in Fig. two (see triangles V S the corresponding solid curve).

So far we have tested the structure of the first addendum in Eq. two, by studying a regime where the second contribution is negligible. What about the second addendum? Once j sub N has been determined, one can proceed by estimating the anomalous component as J sub A of L equals J of L, epsilon minus j sub N of L epsilon to the power of theta. The data in Fig. three indicates that J sub A exhibits the expected anomalous scaling already for system sizes where the direct estimates are strongly affected by the diffusive component. For the H P G the fitted slope, about negative zero point six six, corresponds to eta equals zero point three three, in excellent agreement with the K P Z prediction eta equals one third. For Toda we obtain eta equals zero point five two, consistent with Ref. and even closer to eta equals one half, the value rigorously proven for harmonic models with momentum-conserving noise. We thus conclude that the measurements are in full agreement with the crossover scenario from diffusive to hydrodynamic behavior proposed above.

The same scenario is expected to emerge in the presence of generic momentum-conserving perturbations of the Toda chain, such as a potential of the form epsilon W of q. In fact, in this case, it has been already noticed that the energy-flux correlation decays over a time scale inversely proportional to a power of epsilon. A preliminary evidence of a diffusive regime for small epsilon was also given in Ref.

More in general, we argue that the crossover from normal to anomalous regimes of the F P U T alpha beta model is fully accounted for by the above described scenario. Indeed, the F P U T alpha beta (at low enough energies) can be regarded as a perturbed Toda chain over very long time scales, on which the Toda actions are only weakly perturbed. We surmise that other model potentials should display the same phenomenology, if their form is "close enough" to

U sub T. What can we say about the simplest model of a perturbed harmonic chain? This textbook case deserves a special consideration. Numerical analysis of the F P U T three model at very low energy, i.e. below the strong stochasticity threshold, does not reveal any signature of an intermediate diffusive regime, but rather a direct crossover from ballistic to anomalous regimes. More compelling evidence of the absence of a diffusive regime comes from the study of the harmonic chain with conservative noise in the limit of vanishing noise, i.e. gamma approaches zero. It has been found analytically and confirmed numerically that J sub A of L, epsilon, exhibits a singular dependence for epsilon approaches zero (here gamma approaches zero in the form of a divergence of the coefficient c sub A in Eq. five, c sub A is approximately gamma to the power of negative one half, which implies that J sub A prevails over J sub N across the entire range of system sizes.

Hence, the different behavior displayed by weakly perturbed harmonic oscillators can be traced back to a divergence of the anomalous component, which is itself a consequence of the nonlinearity of the dynamical equations. While this counter-intuitive phenomenon requires further clarifications, it does not however jeopardize the general scaling theory developed in this Letter, which provides a convincing explanation of the seemingly normal diffusion observed in several models of nonlinear chains.
