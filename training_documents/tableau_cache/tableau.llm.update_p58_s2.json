        "content": "a82u | Both a single text file of data and a worksheet in an Excel workbook are tables, though this may not be apparent. When grouped together in a method that has been designed to enable a user to retrieve data from them, they constitute a database. Typically, when we think of databases, we think of the Database Management Systems and languages that we use to make sense of the data in tables, such as Oracle, Teradata, or Microsoft's SQL Server. Currently, the Hadoop and NoSQL platforms are very popular because they are comparatively low-cost and can store very large sets of data, but Tableau Public does not enable a connection to these platforms. They are considered enterprise tools that should be used with Tableau Desktop Professional. Therefore, our discussion about these tools is limited.\ntx0t | Tableau Public is designed in such a way that it allows users in a single data connection to join tables of data, which may or may not have been previously related to each other, as long as they are in the same format. In other words, multiple CSV files or worksheets can be joined in the same Excel workbook. Then, users can specify the conditions under which they need to retrieve data from the tables and how to aggregate it. Thus, that data connection becomes a de-facto database.\n2zty | The most common format of publicly available data is in a text file or a Character-Separated Values file. CSV files are useful because they are simple. The rows of data, which may or may not contain a header row, are separated by line breaks. The fields within each row can be separated by a character. Typically, this character is a comma, pipe, or tab. Commas present difficulties because the content of the fields can contain them, which causes the text to shift into a new column.\n63ho | Many public data sources do allow data to be downloaded as Excel documents. The World Bank has a comprehensive collection, and we will demonstrate the connective capabilities of Tableau Public using one of its data products. Tables can be joined in Tableau Public by manually identifying the common field among the tables.\n32zi | The data sources that Tableau Public connects to\n59si | Tableau Public connects to four different data sources, namely Access, Excel, text file, and OData; the first two data sources are bundled with Microsoft Office, and the second two are freely available to everyone, regardless of the operating system that they are using. Text files are the default source of origin for most of the data that we will discuss, and anyone can create and distribute them.\ni30e | Connecting to Data\ntvst | Tableau Public does not connect to enterprise tools such as Teradata, Oracle, or Hadoop, and it does not connect to SQL Server Management Studio, though it does connect to flat files' output from these tools and other Online Analytical Processing systems. SQL Server Management Studio is free for noncommercial use, and it's common to use it to design basic star schemas and clean noncommercial data. Tableau Public is free because it's assumed that people use it only for their personal endeavors and not projects that generate revenue for their employers. If this is not the case, they should upgrade to the Tableau Desktop Professional edition.\nwrky | The databases, tables, dimensions, facts, field formats and conventions\n2my1 | Data that is retrieved from different sources will invariably have different structures. Some of these data resources need more formatting than others in order to turn them into clean, usable tables.\n8ql6 | As previously mentioned, a table might be as simple as having a single digit in a text file. As long as users know what that digit represents, they can assign a qualitative or quantitative value to it. Imagine a situation where you are collecting rainfall measurements. Entering the amount of rainfall as subsequent rows of text into a new file constitutes a table.\n07fv | The amount of rainfall is a measure; it is a quantitative fact. A dimension is a field that contains qualitative data. In this case, both the time of the day and the location of the measurement will be dimensions. Dimensions are typically formatted as date, string, or character fields, while measures are formatted as numbers. Text files do not have field formats, which are considered metadata, but Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Access do contain this information.\nkg0h | It's important to make sure that the formats for fields of the same type (the date or the primary/ foreign key) are consistent between worksheets in a workbook or tables in a Microsoft Access database, because Tableau Public automatically joins only the fields with the same format and the exact same name (including capitalization). If your field names are not the same but they should be joined using join conditions, you can join them manually.\npl1f | Chapter Three\nwavb | Another common dimension is a unique identifier, which assigns a non-repetitive value to each object in a set. A phone number is a unique identifier as it is related to only one phone at a time. The same is the case with a social security number. Within a data set, a person's name will be considered a unique identifier if it is not repeated; if it were, then a different unique identifier would be used to identify individual people. Thus, it's common to use numerical fields as primary keys for individuals, and these numerical fields can be used across multiple tables and across different dimensions.\nat1i | Tables need to be structured so that the field names (dimensions and facts) go across and the rows of data (the dimension values and measure facts), go down the table. There are some databases that transpose data because their querying engines are optimized to search across columns rather than down the rows, but most Database Management Systems are not columnar, and Tableau is not built to search rows.\n4dbf | The following table is a great example of a table that is structured properly. This is the two thousand twelve NFL performance data that is freely available:\nnsky | Each column is a field; the dimensions are Player and Team, and the measures are Receptions, Yards, and Average. The primary key is Player. There is only one row for each player. Team is the foreign key, as it may be the primary key in other tables, such as the aggregations by team.\npa2d | Connecting to Data\nlf13 | Conversely, knowing what not to do is as instructive as knowing what to do. The following table, which shows the population (in millions) by country, is a good example of what not to do:\n28e7 | The problem with this table is that the years, which actually are qualitative descriptions of when each population measurement was made, are used as separate columns even though the year is a dimension and should run down the page. Dates are dimensions too and not facts, because they describe something qualitative. If we loaded this table in Tableau Public, we would see a separate measure field for each year because Tableau Public recognizes each column as a distinct field.\nye9e | The correct structure for this table will have three columns, namely Country, Year, and Population, with a separate row for each combination of country and year.\ndyie | Connecting to the data in Tableau Public\n75gl | Tableau Public has a graphical user interface that was designed to enable users to load data sources without having to write code. Since the only place to save Tableau Public documents is in Tableau's Cloud, data sources are automatically extracted and packaged with the workbook. The ability to save extracts as separate documents or open extracts and share them with different users is a feature of Tableau Desktop Professional.\nwu5u | Chapter Three\nw7ga | Connecting to data from a local file, that is, an access, excel, or text file saved on your computer, takes several steps that have little variability by data source, which will be illustrated as follows with detailed screenshots:\nl7xq | One. Click on the Connect to Data Link option from the Data menu.\ncqbg | Two. Select the data source type.\nhr2e | Three. Select the file or website to which you want to connect.",
