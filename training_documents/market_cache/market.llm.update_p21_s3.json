        "content": "l2v9 | thirty thousand dollars (varying between forty thousand dollars for B and E and twenty thousand dollars for Mike's; see Table three). Not surprisingly, these higher values are generated among those who bought their lots a longer time ago: those buying their lots before nineteen eighty-nine valued their property at thirty-five thousand dollars, whilst those purchasing since nineteen ninety-five valued at less than half that amount-at fourteen thousand five hundred dollars. Although these data are hypothetical self-assessments and are, perhaps, somewhat inflated coming out as they do at an overall average of thirty thousand dollars, we believe that they are probably quite close to reflecting the cumulative costs of land purchase and housing improvements that many people have made, in particular those related to building or placing a dwelling on the lot.\nafbe | However, as we have underscored, estimating the current value or worth of one's property and actually getting that on the open market are very different matters. In Starr County colonias today, it is even more difficult to sell a lot with a dwelling on it than it is to traspasar a vacant lot. The reasons for this are actually quite obvious: there are very few potential buyers who would be willing or able to pay such a relatively high price on the open market. Thus, there is no effective demand, but assuming that such a sale could be realised-either now or in the future-then colonia populations would be moving from being equity-poor, to a position of being able to make a relatively sizeable net gain. Currently, however, given the real difficulty in realising those gains, and as long as the land market is 'stunted' with little or no effective demand for purchase at the thirty to forty thousand dollar level, we are obliged to conclude that for colonia residents today it is the use value rather than exchange value that remains paramount. For many colonia residents this is not a problem, unless they are motivated or obliged to sell. But theoretically it is important insofar as low-income minority populations (in this case Hispanics) are less likely to be successful in building real wealth than better-off Whites, accentuating social stratification and segmentation akin to the arguments of William Julius Wilson. Investing in\n78r8 | low-income real estate is not a particularly good investment deal for the very low-income segment of the market-a point that confirms the finding of a broader colonias study in Texas. Nevertheless, one must also recognise that it is probably the only arena in which low-income people in Starr County can invest and hope to gain from their 'sweat' equity.\n320g | Conclusions: Comparing Informal Housing Market Operations in the US and Elsewhere\ntp8g | This paper has argued that, for Texas colonias and low-income sub-divisions, the rate at which land is valorised is relatively modest and that the provision of formal property titles as part of a policy to 'regularise' clouded land titles appears to have little or no direct influence upon market performance or upon land prices. Instead, it is sweat equity by the people themselves, along with housing improvement, that raises the property value and which gives rise to some equity creation and to rather modest potential wealth creation. But in Texas and elsewhere in the US, an overarching problem remains: namely, the low viability of the property (sales) market, such that unless the market is 'primed' to allow for greater mobility and sales, then there is little prospect that low-income colonia residents will be able to benefit financially from home-ownership, and certainly not to anything like the same extent experienced by middle- and upper-income groups. Despite these modest gains and equity growth through land acquisition and participation in colonia housing markets, the higher gains accruing to the formal middle and higher ends of the property market are leading to greater, not lesser, social segmentation between those income-groups and the poor. We recognise that the 'bootstraps' approach and the self-managed opportunities for home-ownership in colonias and similar sub-divisions in the US do offer important positive outcomes as place of residence as well as providing a mechanism for saving and for creating equity. This is particularly\ngxfd | true if one compares peri-urban colonia owners with their equity-poor renter and inner-city peers. But there also seems little doubt that the formal land and property markets are much more favourable to middle-income America, for whom homesteading generates better medium- and long-term growth in equity.\ns2v1 | In this article, we have observed that informal colonia land markets function poorly and that there is evidence for only very modest increases in real land values from one decade to the next. In essence, real land values appear to be 'flat' over time. Nor does intervention to provide clear title to lot owners appear to make much difference, although it is arguably still too soon to use the data to hand to gauge accurately the impact of CRG's intervention in the colonias outside Rio Grande City. When it comes to informal colonia property markets, the level of servicing provision and relative location are not good explanatory variables of land price differentials either. Instead, our data suggest that it is the price-setting behaviour by land developers and supply-side variables that best explain land prices and land price changes over time. This is an important finding and suggests that more orthodox explanations and theory about land pricing do not work well at the lower and informal end of the market, raising caveats about the veracity of de Soto-type arguments of land market behaviour and regularisation. 'Social' explanations of price setting such as those outlined here corroborate findings elsewhere and further emphasise the functionality of informality in providing access to land for low-income self-build or self-managed housing. In addition to these 'social' variables, lot affordability to the very poor is achieved through the nature of supply by three principal mechanisms: first, by offering poor-quality land without services; secondly, by lowering front-end transaction costs through informal vendor financing and through informal contractual arrangements; and, thirdly, by reducing the size of lots to a bare minimum such that the overall lot price is just within the reach of\njkp9 | very low-income buyers. Average colonia lot prices in Rio Grande City and Starr County are generally lower than in many other border counties, but the unit price per square foot is about the same, the lower prices in Rio Grande City coming through smaller lot size.",
