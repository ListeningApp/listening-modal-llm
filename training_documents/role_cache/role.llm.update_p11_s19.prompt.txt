You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

awri | RNA-seq was performed to explore DEGs between phenotype types of flesh firmness and crispness retainability during cold storage. Apples of three hybrids (as three biological replicates) from each phenotype type, III, II, and I of flesh firmness or crispness retainability were respectively sampled at 0, 6, 12 and 18 weeks of cold storage. Totally, 72 samples were collected. The Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform was used to generate 100-bp paired-end reads. Bioinformatic analysis of RNA-seq data was performed as previously described (Sun et al., 2016). DEGs were determined by using the false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 and the fold change threshold >2.0.
bl28 | Candidate gene prediction
d5bz | To develop potential diagnostic markers, candidate genes associ- ated with flesh firmness and crispness retainability were predicted by using multi-omics data (Shen et al., 2019). Genes were downloaded from the intervals of the QTLs for flesh firmness or crispness retainability, respectively. SNPs and insertion/deletion variations (InDels) in these genes were called using parental re- sequencing data. Of these genes, those with SNPs or InDels that did not affect the cis-element on the upstream sequence or the functional domain on the coding region were excluded. The genes which expression was not detectable, in addition to the genes with SNPs or InDels only in the promoter but that were not included in the DEGs, were excluded from further analysis.
ap5o | Genomic DNA extraction, RNA extraction and qRT-PCR assay
7zvf | Genomic DNA of young leaves and total RNA of apple flesh or apple calli samples were extracted using the modified CTAB method as previously described (Gasic et al., 2004; Muhammad et al., 1994). cDNA was synthesized using a cDNA synthesis kit (Takara, Japan). The primers were designed according to the sequence on apple genome (GDDH13 v1.1) with premier software (version 5.0) (Premier Biosoft Interpairs, Palo Alto, CA) (Daccord et al., 2017). The qRT-PCR analysis was performed using the ABI PRISM 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The gene encoding apple actin was used as the internal control. Three biological and three technical replicates <LATEX>\left( 3 \times 3 \right)</LATEX> were performed. The primer sequences are listed in Table S16.
mov9 | Functional validation of candidate genes
ks7m | GUS analysis
w1w1 | To test whether the allelic variations upstream of MdERF3 and MdERF118 coding sequences (CDS) may affect its promoter activity, 2000-bp promoter fragments were amplified using PCR from the genomic DNA of 'Zisai Pearl' and 'Red Fuji'. After Sanger sequencing, the reporter constructs containing the promoter sequences of MdERF3 and MdERF118 (2000 bp upstream of the start ATG codon, using restriction enzyme sites SalI and EcoRI) were prepared as previously described (Jia et al., 2018). The CDS of MdDof5.3 or MdRAVL1 was introduced into the pRI101 vector using restriction enzyme sites (SalI and BamHI for MdDof5.3; BamHI and XholI for MdRAVL1) to generate the effector constructs. The reporter and effector vectors were constructed and injected into tobacco leaves. After three days infection, the transgenic leaves were dyed using the GUS reporter gene staining kit (Solarbio, China) in three biological replicates and four technical replicates, as described by Zhang et al. (2016). All primer sequences for vector construction are listed in Table S16.
h8gv | Transient overexpression and VIGS
kwkp | A 690 bp MdERF3 and a 1032 bp MdERF118 CDS fragments were cloned from 'Golden Delicious' into the EcoRI/Xholl and EcoRI/KpnI sites of the pTRV2 virus vector as previously described (Li et al., 2017). A. tumefaciens cells harbouring the resultant plasmids were suspended in infiltration buffer supplemented with 150 mm acetosyringone. The inoculum preparations were adjusted to <LATEX>O D _ { 6 0 0 } = 1 . 0 .</LATEX> A mixture of <LATEX>A .</LATEX> tumefaciens cells harbouring pTRV1 and pTRV2 derivatives (1: 1 ratio) was infiltrated into 'Golden Delicious' apple fruit (140 days after anthesis) (Li et al., 2016). The complete MdERF3 and MdERF118 CDS cDNA sequences were amplified and individually cloned into the NdeI/EcoRI and SalI/BamHI sites of the PRI101 vector, followed by infiltration into 'Golden Delicious' apple fruit. The assays were performed with at least six fruit for each vector, and the experiments were repeated at least three times. The primer pairs used are listed in Table S16.
yj0m | Apple calli transformation
ewfp | To determine the impact of the allelic variations in the upstream regions of MdERF3 and MdERF118 on promoter activity, genetic constructs with the promoters of MdERF3 and MdERF118, and also their CDS, respectively, plus a GUS reporter, were prepared using the one-step seamless cloning kit (Aidlab Biotechnologies, Beijing, China). These included MdERF3 pro-F:GUS (Del323),
oczy | MdERF3 pro-F:GUS (del323), MdERF118pro-Z:GUS (Del229), and MdERF118pro-Z:GUS (del229). All constructs were transiently transformed into apple calli (from hypanthium of 'Orin' cultivar) using the method described by Jia et al. (2018). The complete MdERF3 and MdERF118 CDS cDNA sequences were also ampli- fied and cloned into the NdeI/EcoRI and SalI/BamHI sites of the PRI101 vector, respectively. Partial MdERF3 and MdERF118 CDS sequences were cloned using the restriction enzyme sites XbaI/ SalI, EcoRI/SalI, and XbaI/SalI, KpnI/EcoRI of the RNAi vector. The primer pairs used are listed in Table S16.
2ttg | Y1H assay
his3 | The CDS of MdERF3 and MdERF118 were ligated into the PJG4-5 vector in restriction enzyme sites EcoRI/XholI. MdPME2, MdPGLR3 and MdACO4 were ligated into the Placzi vector in restriction enzyme sites EcoRI/XholI, KpnI/XholI, and KpnI/XholI, respectively. The CDS of MdDof5.3 and MdRAVL1 were ligated into the PJG4- 5 vector using restriction enzyme sites EcoRI/XholI. MdERF3 and MdERF118 were ligated into the Placzi vector, using restriction enzyme sites EcoRI/XholI. All primers used are listed in Table S16.
