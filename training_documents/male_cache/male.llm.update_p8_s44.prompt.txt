You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

jdfw | (2) The müllerian ducts are derived from the coelomic epithelium and will later form to develop the Fallopian tubes, the ducts in the pelvic region fuse to give rise to the uterovaginal canal. In the female, the wolffian duct begins to regress at about 2 months of gestation.
uc9r | (3) Regression of müllerian ducts and differentiation of the wolffian duct into the male accessory organs is a key element of male differentiation of the internal reproductive tract organs: The initial indication of male differentiation of the genital tract occurs in about 55-60 day old embryos. The müllerian duct first undergoes epithelial to Bipotential Gonad mesenchymal transformation and a wave of Genads apoptosis spreads along the müllerian duct. The connections between the mesonephric Müllerian Duct tubules and gonadal primordium are Male Hormones: Wolffian MIS Duct No Male established by week 6 of gestation and give Testosterone Hormones Ins13 rise to the rete testis. The wolffian duct survives and the upper part gives rise to the epididymis and, below that, the vas deferens.

l0ap | iii) Testicular Descent (Figure 5): The upper pole of the testis is
x815 | connected to the posterior abdominal wall by the cranial suspensory ligament. A primitive gubernaculum extends from the caudal pole to the inner inguinal ring, so essentially the testis, epididymis, and vas deferens are supported by the cranial suspensory ligament above and the gubernaculum below. At three months of gestation, the cranial suspensory ligament dissolves and then swells. This process begins to move the testis down towards the inguinal ring. At 25 weeks, the first phase (transabdominal) of testicular descent is completed when the gubernaculum bulges beyond the inguinal ring and the process vaginalis allows the external inguinal ring to open. The second phase of testicular descent from the inguinal ring into the scrotum is largely androgen controlled and occurs between 27-35 weeks of gestation.
epbj | iv) Prostate Development and the Urogenital Sinus: Prostatic buds develop at about 10 weeks at the site of the müllerian tubercle, and solid branching cords form. A prostatic utricle accompanies the development of the prostate. Sinoutricular bulbs then develop from the urogenital sinus. This serves to close the opening of the wolffian ducts and fuse with the medial Müllerian tubercle to form the sinoutricular cord within the prostate gland. This structure canalizes at 18 weeks to form the prostatic utricle. This male structure is considered to be analogous to the female vagina. The urogenital sinus also develops into the urethra of both sexes and the urinary bladder.
nmn2 | v) External genitalia (Figure 6): The genital tubercle develops from the mesoderm and ectoderm surrounding the cloaca which also gives rise to the genital swellings and genital folds. The tubercle becomes the body and glans of the penis in males and the body and glans of the clitoris in females. The swellings become scrotal tissue in males and labia majora in females. The genital folds become the ventral aspect of the penis in males and the labia minora in females. The urethral plate gives rise to the male urethra after the urethral folds fuse ventrally and tubularization occurs. Urethral organogenesis is completed by 14 weeks of gestation. Penile and clitoral size is the same in fetuses until 14 weeks of gestation. Maximal phallic growth occurs during the third trimester of pregnancy and testosterone levels are declining.
g3tm | 1) THE TESTIS AND SPERMATOGENESIS IN THE ADULT
tfra | a) Testicular Function
5lm9 | i) The testis serves three distinct but related roles in the male: an exocrine and an endocrine function, as well as a paracrine function.
wp2c | (1) The exocrine function of the testis is involved in the production of mature sperm. The site of this function is localized in the seminiferous epithelium of the seminiferous tubules. The exocrine function of the testis involves the Sertoli cells, which serve as nurse cells and maintain the blood-testis barrier.
us5v | (2) The endocrine function of the testis involves the production and secretion of androgens from the Leydig cells in the interstitial compartment of the testis. The exocrine function of the testis is dependent upon the endocrine function.
rs2m | (3) The paracrine function of the testis involves the local controls of spermatogenesis and intercompartmental signaling between the seminiferous tubules, the interstitial cells (Leydig cells, macrophages, and other cells), and the peritubular myoid cells. These paracrine factors include growth factors, cytokines, and factors affecting the spermatogonial stem cell niche.
uz9y | ii) Organization of the Cells of the Seminiferous Epithelium (Figure 8): The wall of the seminiferous tubule is surrounded by fibroblasts and peritubular myoid cells. The myoid cells are flattened and have the characteristics of smooth muscle. These cells are separated from the seminiferous tubule by the basement membrane.
8ov0 | b) Function of the Seminiferous Tubules: The seminiferous tubules provide a unique environment for the production of germ cells. Production of germ cells involve the germinal elements-the spermatogonia-and supporting cells, the Sertoli cells, and peritubular cells of the basement membrane. Each cell type is described below. The process of meiosis is described afterwards.
mj9m | (1) The Sertoli cells (Figure 9) are the only non-germinal cell within the seminiferous epithelium. A large voluminous cytoplasm envelops the developing germ cells while the base of the cell adheres to the basal lamina. It is usually difficult to distinguish the outlines of the Sertoli cell by bright light microscopy. The cells have abundant smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and some rough ER, a well-developed Golgi complex, mitochondria, and lysosomes. The nucleus is elongated and has numerous invaginations of the membrane, a prominent nucleolus and little heterochromatin. The spermatogonia are located in the basal compartment (outside of the blood-testis barrier) surrounded by the Sertoli cell with the basal lamina below. The spermatocytes and early spermatids are found in adluminal niches between adjacent Sertoli cells (protected by the blood-testis barrier-formed by tight or occluding junctions). The elongating spermatids are in crypts at the luminal side of the Sertoli cell. The tight junctions serve to prevent proteins and antibodies from reaching the spermatogenic cells and eliciting an immune response. The Sertoli cells do not divide after puberty. The Sertoli cells form niches between adjacent cells for the spermatocytes and spermatids. The late spermatids are in crypts at the luminal surface of the Sertoli cells. After puberty the Sertoli cells are terminally differentiated and no longer undergo mitosis. The seminiferous tubules also produce an
94h3 | environment known as the blood-testis barrier. Since the differentiating germ cells (with 1N haploid DNA) are potentially antigenic, and recognizable as foreign, the barrier sequesters these cells from the blood environment. The blood-testis barrier is maintained by the Sertoli cells.
