        "content": "b8hf | Catalytic Mechanism. According to DFT calculations, methane oxidation by the mononuclear copper four plus oxo species discussed above begins with methane weakly bound to\nhntf | the monocopper center followed by C-H bond cleavage, formation of a nonradical intermediate, and recombination of OH and CH3. A similar mechanism was computed for the bis-mu-oxo copper two plus copper three plus complex. Chan and co-workers have investigated the pMMO mechanism using M. capsulatus Bath membrane preparations. Hydroxylation of both chiral ethane and chiral butane proceeds with the retention of the configuration. These data combined with hydrogen deuterium kinetic isotope effects are consistent with a concerted, nonradical mechanism. In other studies, the absence of a carbon kinetic isotope effect for propane oxidation was interpreted as evidence of minimal structural change at the carbon center during transition-state formation in the rate-limiting step.\n99fo | Conclusions\ny5r7 | Recent structural, biochemical, and spectroscopic data have provided the first steps toward understanding O2 activation by pMMO. Although the active site has not yet been identified, the dinuclear copper site in the P-M-O-B subunit or an uncharacterized hydrophilic site within the membrane region is the most likely candidate. Further structural and spectroscopic studies are necessary to elucidate the detailed coordination environments of the metal centers, including the possible presence of exogenous ligands. Parallel investigations of pMMOs from different organisms may also help pinpoint which metal center activates O2. If possible, mutagenesis approaches would be extremely informative. Once the active site is identified, the real quest for understanding the methane hydroxylation mechanism can be initiated.",
