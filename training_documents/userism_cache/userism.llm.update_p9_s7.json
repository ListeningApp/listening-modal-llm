However, relatively little work connects limitations arising from our conceptualization of the user with design work that addresses those limitations.\nybik | This situation stems in part from HCI's pragmatic tendency to focus on specific domains. For example, while doctors acting on behalf of their patients when managing medical records is certainly a form of indirection, design interventions based on such an observation will likely be limited to medical informatics as a domain. However, there are certainly connections between this case and others, such as intermediary users observed in an ICTD context. This similarity offers but one example. More generally, relationships within ecologies of subject positions have commonalities, but those commonalities are difficult to connect across different domains within HCI. It is for this reason that we intentionally drew on examples from multiple domains to demonstrate how the structure of the user causes problems across many different application areas.\ngii5 | Scholarship that makes use of the practical strategies we have enumerated would benefit the community by explicitly sharing:\nq5eu | · How did we, as researchers or as designers, realize we were facing a post-user scenario?\na7ao | · What were the relevant subject positions in our scenario?\n29a3 | · What were the relationships among them?\nsb1e | · How did we represent that ecology of subject positions and their relationships across different levels in our design?\nw2yn | · What were the repercussions of the representations we used?\nap6l | While much of the work in HCI implicitly does the above, it does so while presuming the centrality of the user. Rather\niest | than suggest that we start ignoring the user, post-userism encourages HCI researchers and practitioners to look beyond the user for the additional subjects and relationships to which the primacy of the user can blind us. Explicitly addressing the above questions will help scholars and practitioners make use of a post-userist lens beyond the ideological level and engage levels of representation more directly pertinent to design, problem setting, and technical implementation.\ncox8 | In Absence of the User\nppqi | The second path forward asks that we explore what HCI might look like in the absence of the traditional user. User as a construct runs into trouble because it both feeds into and is a product of the idea that we are designing with the human at the center. Post-userism serves to question what our field places at the center of its practices. What are the types of actors, entities, and concepts around which we can center?\noxou | We have seen efforts to broaden HCI's scope. Terms like \"human-centered computing\" and \"human centered design,\" however, are often clever slights of hand. They acknowledge the limitations of the user (particularly as conceptualized in first wave), and adopt a more holistic alternative: \"human.\" Yet in practice, we very quickly revert to making the human a user. This is particularly true in how we represent people at the systems and interface levels, where the human must be represented as a computational entity.\n495n | An alternative can be reached when we start to acknowledge HCI's user as a modernist and structuralist project. The user gives HCI a common foundation-a \"person\" to design for-but one that limits us as well. As others have suggested, we might instead think of design-and especially \"interaction\"-as a set of relational practices. The \"user\" captures a set of relationships and provides a framework through which practices are constructed. However, this framework, we have argued, by no means captures all relationships.\nawri | CONCLUSION\nbl28 | In this paper we introduced post-userism, a critique of HCI's focus on the \"user.\" We have argued that HCI conceptualizes humans as users in how it designs and researches interactions. \"User-ifying\" people presents two challenges: first, it reduces the person into a construct that is not able to handle the complexity of human experience, and second, places a burden on this construct to account for the entirety of what is \"human\" in human-computer interaction.\nd5bz | A post-userist approach, then, accomplishes two things: First, by highlighting the limitations of \"user,\" post-userism provides a means to identify and address types of interactions for which the construct of user cannot account and, as a result, ways the user limits us in our design and research practices. Second, by challenging the construct of\nap5o | Interactive Design Methodologies\n7zvf | the user itself, post-userism encourages us to explore what HCI might look like in the absence of a traditional user. Put differently, does the field needs better ways to engage and design for the \"human\" in HCI, or do the blurred lines between human and computer suggest that other actors might be legitimate sites on which to focus our research and design practices? Ultimately, this paper aims to support such conversations about the center around which our discipline is organized.\nmov9 | We would like to thank Ellie Harmon, Brian Keegan, William Aspray, Ethan Hanner, Alex Taylor, and our anonymous reviewers for their generous feedback.
