Assume a clear leadership role by providing the client with information, structure, guidance, or constructive feedback (e.g., give the client feedback that you have noticed that she completes more challenging assignments that she gives herself, but when given assignments by others, she says she does not understand it before she even reads the directions and considers how she might complete it).\ne3lv | b. Normalize the client's experience or connect her with social or physical resources that will enable her to have equal access and opportunities (e.g., tell the client that it is normal for people to say that they can't do something when they are feeling challenged; provide her with self-advocacy language so that she can tell others what she needs when she is given more challenging assignments).\nrqv6 | c. Provide the client with hope or positive feedback and generally show a positive attitude or emotions (e.g., remind the client how well she did on a similar assignment the previous week; tell her you know she can do it).\noa48 | d. Give the client total and complete control over the situation (e.g., invite the client to share what she thinks would be most helpful the next time she is given something new to work on).\n3fp1 | A scoring key and interpretation map for this assessment are presented on the following pages. So that you will have a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of each mode, it is recommended that you read this chapter before scoring your self-assessment.\n557x | Scoring for Exercise Four point one: Determining Your Therapeutic Style\nep8e | To determine your therapeutic style (i.e., the modes you are more or less inclined to use), you should first record your responses to the Self-Assessment of Modes Questionnaire, Version three, on the Modes Scoring Key by circling the response you chose for each question. Then, add up the number of times you chose responses corresponding to each mode and record them at the bottom of each column. The total possible number of responses for each mode is six. You may calculate your percentage score for each mode by dividing the total number of actual responses for each mode by the total number of response possibilities, six, and then multiplying by one hundred. The higher your score for each mode, the more comfortable you may feel with using the mode.\n7mv3 | You may plot your profile on the Therapeutic Style Form by darkening each area in the arrows that fall inside the concentric circle that corresponds to your mode scores. This will provide a visual representation of the therapeutic style you are most likely to use during therapy.\nder6 | Visual Map: My Therapeutic Style\n8xg2 | Advocating\nnjvp | Instructing Total: out of six\ns8b5 | Problem-Solving Total: out of six\np450 | Exercise Four point two\nrsvo | Examining Your Therapeutic Style\nz4m8 | The Therapeutic Style Form indicates the relative amount of comfort you have with each mode. In the end, however, you should reflect on and plan your own therapeutic style. A good beginning is to think about:\nukf0 | Your natural modes and their strengths and cautions\nk38m | The modes you want to incorporate into your therapeutic style (including the modes with which you may wish to become more comfortable and proficient)\nnkj9 | Your Natural Modes and Their Strengths and Cautions\n35a8 | By examining your Therapeutic Style Form and reflecting on the descriptions of the modes provided in this chapter, you should first decide for yourself the extent to which you are comfortable with each mode. To facilitate this process, you can use the following table to think carefully about the six modes and decide your degree of comfort with each of them.\n337o | I need to\ncuth | Next, go back and review Table Four point one, looking at the potential strengths of your preferred mode(s). Each person uses a given mode in different ways, so the actual strengths of your use of a mode depend on how you typically use it. So, reflecting on the particular way that you use your preferred mode(s), list five key strengths of your therapeutic style.\n09z2 | Exercise Four point three\n13fv | Modes You Want to Incorporate Into Your Therapeutic Style\nv5pj | Now, examine the strengths of the modes that are not your preferred modes (either those you listed as \"Mode(s) I can use when I need to\" or \"Mode(s) with which I am less comfortable/less able to use\"). Consider whether the strengths of these modes are a good counterbalance to the liabilities of your preferred modes. Based on this consideration, identify the mode(s) you wish to use more naturally and regularly. Record them here.\ntrab | If the mode(s) you wish to incorporate into your therapeutic style fall in the category of \"Mode(s) I can use when I need to,\" you may wish to make plans for the situations in which you want to practice these modes and monitor your use of them. Record your thoughts here.\ngrxs | If the mode(s) you wish to incorporate into your therapeutic style fall in the category of \"Mode(s) with which I am less comfortable/less able to use,\" you may wish to seek supervision, training, or other kinds of support that would help you develop the ability and comfort with using that mode.",
