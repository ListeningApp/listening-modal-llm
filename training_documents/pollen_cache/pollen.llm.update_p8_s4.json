We are in need of many and better quantitative studies of the effectiveness of visitors (for example, the average number of conspecific outcrossing pollen grains deposited on a stigma at an appropriate time by a given visitor in a single visit). Then we can properly understand plant and pollinator communities and pollination networks, and the effects of potential extinctions of flower visitors/pollinators on the communities of which they are a part. This book therefore hopes to provide in a single source a useful reference for all the aspects of floral biology and pollination interactions that need to be considered to give a real appreciation of these fascinating mutualisms.\n```",
