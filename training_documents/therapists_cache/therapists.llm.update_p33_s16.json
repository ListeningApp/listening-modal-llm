You are working with a seventy-two-year-old farmer who has been working on his family's large acreage since he was very young. He is currently in the middle of a severe gout flare-up. You can see that he is becoming increasingly upset about the situation. The harvest is approaching, and if he misses it, his business will lose a significant amount of money. He is particularly worried about whether he will be able to drive the tractor for as long as the harvest requires. His son and daughter, who would normally be available to help him, are both out of town.
