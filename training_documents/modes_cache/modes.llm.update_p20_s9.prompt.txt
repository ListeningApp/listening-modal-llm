You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

677t | They provide their clients with information, direction, recommendations, and, in some circumstances, advice. When functioning in the instructing mode, therapists uti- lize instructional statements and mini-lectures, role-model- ing and demonstrations, statements that convey feedback to the client, and rhetorical questions as the primary form of therapy communication. Therapists functioning in the in- structing mode are unafraid to state their professional opin- ions, set limits, provide feedback, or disagree with clients. When certain clients or circumstances make it necessary, these therapists are skilled at gentle or finessed approaches to confrontation in order to introduce the need for change. Therapists functioning in this mode may approach dis- agreements with clients by reexplaining their own point of view, providing more of a rationale for their perspective, explaining consequences of a poor decision, or educating clients further about the value of their approach.
5hk6 | Strengths of the Instructing Mode
viei | The instructing mode is one of the fundamental modes re- quired for the competent conduct of occupational therapy. Without some degree of structure, transfer of knowledge, provision of feedback, and overall leadership, occupational therapy would be something other than what it is.
rk0j | Therapists who utilize this mode tend to be excellent teachers and clear communicators. They empower and in- spire their clients by sharing information, noting accom- plishments, providing constructive feedback, and training their clients to utilize the tools required for adaptation and participation. They convey caring and hope through their investment in a client's performance and in the pos- itive outcomes of therapy. Therapists who function in the instructing mode tend to be highly organized and sys- tematic in their approach to therapy. They inject a lot of intellectual energy and creativity into the therapy process.
c6x9 | Cautions of the Instructing Mode
g5at | As with any of the other modes, cautions emerge when therapists overutilize or inappropriately and indiscrimi- nately apply the instructing mode with clients. Because the instructing mode usually involves focusing on out- comes more than process, some therapists functioning in

6z45 | Kay is a 26-year-old woman who was severely in- jured in a skiing accident. She is paralyzed because of a spinal cord injury. Because she also had a hip fracture caused by the accident, her hospital stay was prolonged. I saw her as an inpatient for a period of 4 months. She is a naturally positive, strong, moti- vated, internally driven person. She had a creative outlook on occupational therapy and approached her goals in a systematic and self-disciplined manner.
20af | Because Kay was so self-motivated, most of the time I found myself functioning in the collaborating mode when we planned therapy goals and activi- ties. However, there were many times during Kay's therapy when I felt she was asking me to function in the instructing mode. These were times when Kay requested that I teach her specific skills related to ac- tivities of daily living. It was common that Kay would
huae | this mode may overinvest and thus react more negatively when they cannot get clients to do what they want them to do. Alternatively, they may tend to overinstruct their clients to prevent them from experiencing failure in ther- apy. These behaviors can undermine clients' confidence, choice, and autonomy.
rblh | Occasionally, clients who are sensitive to these issues may misunderstand or misinterpret therapists' behavior in the instructing mode as being parental, authoritarian, dom- inant, controlling, or demanding. Therapists who overuti- lize this mode may feel obligated to help all clients address their difficulties and may miss the point at which clients want them to simply listen and validate them. Therefore, they are occasionally at risk for getting locked into argu- ments and power struggles with sensitive or vulnerable clients or parents who require a more empathic approach.

htcn | Another responsibility included in my role as instructor was to bear witness to Kay's self-monitoring of her own performance. To do this, we put a piece of paper on the wall that listed her functional accomplishments for each day of therapy. Our systematic daily monitoring of her progress made it feel as if she was in school. I believe this was developmentally familiar to her and it gave her a sense of consistency and control. At first, her accomplishments were small. We would write, "I moved my little finger today" or "I rolled to the side by myself." Soon her accomplishments progressed to: "I ate today without Kim dropping any food." By the time Kay left the hospital the wall was covered with documentation of her accomplishments.

Therapists functioning in the problem-solving mode focus on clarify- ing and probing the client's beliefs about an issue for three central purposes: (1) to guide the client to think about and approach a problem or challenge in a more adaptive way, (2) to free the client from thoughts and beliefs that inhibit his or her ability to engage in the other aspects of occupational therapy, or (3) simply to help a client clarify their own thinking about an issue. Specifically, these types of questions are aimed at enabling a client to see a wider range of options, consequences, or dimensions of an issue. Therapists often pose these kinds of questions so clients may refine or expand their thinking about an issue or con- sider alternative perspectives. Therapists in this mode may also lead clients to list pros and cons, or strengths and weaknesses of a given decision or approach. They may,
