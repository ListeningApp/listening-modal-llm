        "content": "1ujy | One. Michel Foucault and Daniel Defert initiated the Group for Information on Prisons that included Deleuze and others; the group published a newsletter, Intolerable, instigating change in talk about prisons. \"Foucault... was in some fashion a seer. He saw things, and like all people who know how to see, who see something and see it deeply, he found what he saw to be intolerable. For him, to think meant to react to the intolerable, to something intolerable he had seen. And the intolerable never was the visible; it was something more... But the intolerable was not a matter of ethics. That is, his ethics were to apprehend or to see something as intolerable, but it was not in the name of morals that something was intolerable... If thinking did not reach the intolerable, it was not worthwhile to think. To think always meant to think about the limits of a situation. But it also meant to see.\"\nqzor | Two. I learned to work with Deleuze's words through attending John Rajchman's seminars at MIT from nineteen ninety-seven to two thousand and four. Rajchman's approach to the experimental and empirical practices of Deleuze and Foucault, in dialogue with my training in attention and writing from Haraway and Susan Harding, shaped the empirical methods and teaching forms I now employ.\na0by | Three. The full sentence reads: \"But the films and articles rigorously exclude the contextualizing politics of decolonization and exploitation of the emergent Third World, obligatory and normative heterosexuality, masculine dominance of a progressively war-based scientific enterprise in industrial civilization, and the racial symbolic and institutional organization of scientific research.\"\nu1ky | Four. \"The modern fact is that we no longer believe in this world. We do not even believe in the events which happen to us, love, death, as if they only half concerned us. It is not we who make cinema, it is the world which looks to us like a bad film.\" \nhtm9 | Five. Of course, science fiction is also a form of radical empiricism.\n8hul | Six. On \"strong objectivity,\" see Harding nineteen ninety-one.\n87vz | Seven.\n8. See the conference by the same name for other agnotologists. Steve Hilgartner has also been exploring non-knowledge.\nym66 | See Deleuze and Guattari nineteen eighty-six.\nl0a3 | Nine. See also Rajchman's discussion of Deleuze's humor, and Deleuze's discussion of the Stoic's humor versus Platonic irony.\nu8nw | Ten. Foucault described his relation to humor, writing, and struggle like this: \"The bourgeoisie is not at all what Baudelaire thought, a pack of stupid and sluggish fools. The bourgeoisie is intelligent, lucid, calculating. No other form of domination has ever been so efficient, and subsequently so dangerous, so deeply rooted. It won't suffice to call the bourgeoisie villainous; it won't simply disappear like the flame of a blown-out candle. This justifies a certain sadness; it is thus necessary to bring into the struggle as much gaiety, lucidity, and determination as possible. The only really sad thing is not to fight... Basically I don't like to write: it is a very difficult activity to master. Writing interests me only in the measure that it incorporates the reality of combat, as an instrument, a tactic, a spotlight. I would like my books to be like surgeon's knives, Molotov cocktails, or galleries in a mine, and, like fireworks, to be carbonized after use.\"",
