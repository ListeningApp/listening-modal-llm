        "content": "78r8 | If neuroimaging is the answer, what is the question?\n320g | It is unclear that we will come to a better understanding of mental processes simply by observing which neural loci are activated while subjects perform a task. Rather, I suggest here that it is better to come armed with a question that directs one to design tasks in ways that take advantage of the strengths of neuroimaging techniques (particularly positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging). Here I develop a taxonomy of types of questions that can be easily addressed by such techniques. The first class of questions focuses on how information processing is implemented in the brain; these questions can be posed at a very coarse scale, focusing on the entire system that confers a particular ability, or at increasingly more specific scales, ultimately focusing on individual structures or processes. The second class of questions focuses on specifying when particular processes and structures are invoked; these questions focus on how one can use patterns of activation to infer that specific processes and structures were invoked, and on how processing changes in different circumstances. The use of neuroimaging to address these questions is illustrated with results from experiments on visual cognition, and caveats regarding the logic of inference in each case are noted. Finally, the necessary interplay between neuroimaging and behavioural studies is stressed.\ntp8g | One. INTRODUCTION\ngxfd | Attending a poster session at a recent meeting, I was reminded of the old adage 'To the man who has only a hammer, the whole world looks like a nail'. In this case, however, instead of a hammer we had a magnetic resonance imaging machine and instead of nails we had a study. Many of the studies summarized in the posters did not seem to be designed to answer questions about the functioning of the brain; neither did they seem to bear on specific questions about the roles of particular brain regions. Rather, they could best be described as 'exploratory'. People were asked to engage in some task while the activity in their brains was monitored, and this activity was then interpreted post hoc.\ns2v1 | Sometimes, in the hands of a particularly talented investigator, this 'let's-try-it-and-see' approach can pay off. Usually, however, it does not; the result is a story made up after the fact, and many other stories could equally easily characterize the findings. In this article I wish to explore another approach to neuroimaging, one designed to answer specific questions. I wish to describe different types of questions that seem particularly well-suited to contemporary neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and magnetoencephalography. I shall illustrate approaches to most of the questions with examples from my laboratory, which is the research I happen to know best.\njkp9 | We shall consider two large classes of questions. The first class focuses on how information processing systems are organized in neural tissue. We ask which processes\nz8tt | and structures confer specific functions, such as the ability to recognize objects or to form visual mental images. For present purposes, I use the word 'process' to refer to an operation or set of operations that transforms an input to an output, and 'structure' to refer to two types of entities: a 'representation' is a physical state that serves as a repository of information, and a 'buffer' stores representations. A metaphor might help: a blackboard is a buffer, marks made with chalk can serve as representations, and the movement of chalk on the board, the movement of an eraser on the board, and the act of interpreting the patterns of marks are all examples of processes. However, the distinction between structure and process is not clear-cut, as neural network modelling has demonstrated well: some structures actively transform input to output. Nevertheless, for present purposes this simple-minded characterization will serve as a useful organizational device.\n9g22 | The second class of questions focuses on when, on the specific circumstances under which, specific types of information processing are used. In some sense, one can answer such questions only if one has provisional answers to at least some questions of the first type. Once one has identified activation in a brain area with the operation of a structure or process, one can then ask in what circumstances such activation occurs. (I shall use the term 'activation' to refer both to increases in regional cerebral blood flow observed in positron emission tomography and also to increases in signal strength observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging, which presumably reflect regional cerebral blood flow.) We look at two types of specific questions.\n41fx | The first addresses whether one can infer the use of a particular structure or process on the basis of specific brain activation; the second examines whether one can use neuroimaging to consider ways in which context and other factors alter the use of a given structure or process.\n7um8 | Before launching into this far-reaching overview, it is useful to make explicit a key assumption: I am trying to organize types of question that one can sensibly try to answer using neuroimaging, but this does not guarantee that each such question will necessarily be answered by using these techniques. As we progress, I shall briefly note major methodological and conceptual stumbling blocks that can obstruct even the most clear-headed and systematic attack on an issue.\nuow2 | Two. HOW ARE INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS IMPLEMENTED IN NEURAL TISSUE?\niat7 | Perhaps most of the current research with neuroimaging techniques is designed to reveal the functional architecture underlying a specific ability. By 'functional architecture' I mean the set of structures and processes that are used to perform a class of tasks. The areas activated while one uses the ability are taken to reflect the use of such structures and processes, and each area is characterized in terms of its role in implementing a particular structure or process. Sometimes researchers talk about a set of areas as a circuit, but this is usually misleading: in most studies all that is revealed are a set of activated (and/or deactivated) areas, with no information about the flow of information between the areas. Thus, what we see are the footprints of components of the functional architecture that are evoked during the task, but we do not see a specific circuit.\nywwr | The initial questions that we will consider focus on a 'big picture' overview of a system of processes (setting aside for now details of how structures are involved with the processes), and later questions focus more narrowly on specific aspects of the system. I personally prefer to start with 'big picture' questions, which lead to research that provides a road map guiding the formulation of more specific questions.\n0i6j | (a) Which areas implement systems that confer specific functions?\n87cq | Perhaps the most common type of neuroimaging study today is intended to reveal the neural events that confer a specific 'function' (i.e. ability), such as reading, object recognition or visualization. For any given function there are many different tasks that will engage some or all of the relevant structures and processes. I shall provide an example from our own work. We focused on the ability to identify objects, and examined the task of deciding whether a name is appropriate for a picture of an object. We began with a (coarse) theory of the functional architecture underlying such performance, and wanted to know whether it predicted the pattern of results. This theory is based in large part on research findings with nonhuman primates. Because I shall be using this work to illustrate my main points in what follows, I shall summarize the theory here. As illustrated in figure one, we posit a functional architecture with six major components, as follows.",
