You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

877u | These scenarios will surprise few re- searchers familiar with irregular settlement in Mexico (notwithstanding some important differences), but the extensive irregularity of lot titles is highly unusual in the US, so much so that an NGO-Community Resources Group (CRG)-was commissioned by the Texas Government to undertake the regulari- sation of the affected settlements. The CRG programme targeted 15 colonias outside Rio
rzhj | Grande City and served over 2000 house- holds and 2500 lots. Of these, some 1000 households and lots were the focus of land title regularisation, usually because claimants had defective papers, or where their lot own- ership was challenged in some way-mul- tiple claimants, living in the wrong lot, or in an arroyo floodplain. The CRG's portfolio included the colonias and land that had been sequestrated from the developers, and the agency's brief was to carry out the title and servicing regularisation of these settlements. (However, the servicing component was soon dropped since there were no funds to carry it through.) Thus, the aim was to pro- vide clear title to those with legitimate claims and to move some households to new lot sites particularly those living in dangerous locations, or where there were multiple claimants to the same piece of land.
bfax | Here is not the place to describe the details of the regularisation process or an evaluation of the agency's performance (see Ward et al., 2003). Suffice to note that the findings re- ported here were collected as part of a de- tailed analysis and evaluation of the CRG regularisation programme and its impacts for the period 1995-2002, with particular em- phasis on the five years between 1997 and 2002 which was when the clearing of 'clouded' lot titles began in earnest. Data- gathering over a single year (2002) com- prised a number of sources. It began with a systematic review of CRG files and docu- ments; and a major household survey was undertaken primarily between January and June of 2002. The study embraced a range of methods of data collection: archival analysis, CRG database analysis, key informant inter- views and focus groups, as well as the house- hold survey of a total of some 266 families from a randomly pre-selected 436 house- holds (i.e. 61 per cent were interviewed) living in 6 of the larger colonias that had been affected by the CRG intervention (of which there were 15 in all). The purpose-de- signed household survey was applied to 2 sample groups. First, those who had no titles or who had experienced major difficulties and challenges associated with their titles or
f2y8 | residence and who ultimately received titles as part of the CRG intervention. These were 195 of the 303 pre-selected cases and, in the following analysis, these households are re- ferred to as the "Study Group". Secondly, we interviewed a sample of resident households who had not experienced serious title prob- lems and who were therefore not affected by CRG intervention. Although they also lived in the same settlements (and especially in Las Lomas), they had received Contracts for Deeds or had completed the purchase of their lots such that they had been able to secure a warranty deed for their properties. Although they formed part of the CRG Receivership plan and hoped and expected to benefit equally from any later service provision, households in this group held secure title. We proposed to use them as a benchmark sample for comparative purposes and to help us assess the degree to which title provision made any significant differences to home improvement, land values, etc. Of the 133 households identified for pre-selection in this 'Control Group', 71 (i.e. 53 per cent) were eventually successfully interviewed. While open refusal rates were very low, notwith- standing multiple call-backs, it proved im- possible to interview everyone in the pre-selection group. While we cannot be ex- actly sure of the degree of bias this reduced sample may have introduced, we have no reason to suspect that it was important, or that it detracts significantly from some of the findings reported below.
o7qm | The detailed questionnaire was conducted in Spanish and covered information about housing trajectories, land market transac- tions, the 'meanings' attributed to titles by owners, property valuations in the area, the perceived impact of titles on colonia im- provements and upon home improvements, as well as standard socioeconomic indicators information. It took about 25-30 minutes to complete.3
d52l | Land Price Analysis and Land Market Performance
qlbb | The remainder of this article analyses land
nhsg | price trends for a number of the CRG-inter- vened colonias in Starr County and seeks to define the main trends of prices over time. Two principal sources are used: first, we drew upon the detailed data contained in a database that had been generated by CRG contact with residents as the agency sought to examine individual claims of ownership as a precursor to the actual clearing of property titles. Secondly, we cross-checked these data with information that we had collected from the questionnaire survey and, in so doing, were able to tie the analysis to responses from the deeper set of questions, and to the independent variable data that were col- lected. Although the data come from the same broad constituency, the advantage of this dual approach is that it allows us to triangulate the larger CRG database as well as undertake a deeper level of analysis in relation to a smaller 'panel' of respondents whom we interviewed in greater depth. We were also able to compare some of the so- cioeconomic data from these two sources with that of the 2000 Census in those cases where these colonias coincided with census- defined 'places' (CDPs)-as in the case of Las Lomas-for example. In such cases, the coincidence of findings between the census and the sample data were reassuringly close, providing greater veracity to our sample sur- vey findings.
hy0l | Methodology and the Database Samples
4jmz | The first database that we analyse below is the one generated by CRG employees who gathered specific data from colonia residents as part of the individual files created to verify that they were eligible to benefit from the titling scheme, and to create a paper trail about who owned what land, how much they had already paid and what papers they had to prove 'ownership'. Thus, households were asked: to document the types of papers that they had received originally from the vendor, and which established their claim of owner- ship; to state the price they had paid at that time; to provide the name of the previous owner(s), or more usually the developer, who
b7cq | sold them the lot; to describe the state of the lot at the time of purchase and whether or not there was any house or construction already on the lot at the time; and to outline what, if any, problems they had encountered when making their payments. This generated an overall database of some 1790 records, with data stretching over some 17 years from 1972 to 1999. However, although the infor- mation dates as far back as the earliest pur- chases in the 1970s and includes records up to the late 1990s, in fact most people bought lots during the 1980s (see Table 1). The database includes information for all 15 of the sub-divisions included in the CRG pro- gramme, from which data for the following variables were extracted: the sub-division name; the purchase date (year); the price paid; from whom it was bought; and, whether or not the lot was sold with or
