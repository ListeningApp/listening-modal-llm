You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

Figure 2 shows a plot of log <LATEX>\bar { k } ,</LATEX> as a function of the exergonicity of the reaction.
1k9e | Comparisons of standard bond dissociation energies (BDEs) can be used to estimate the exergonicity of the cyclopropylcarbinyl ring-opening reactions. The BDE for a benzylic hydrogen in toluene is 10-11 kcal/mol smaller than that of a primary C-H bond in ethane or propane.71,72 For the benzylic position in ethylbenzene, the BDE is reduced by approximately 2.5 kcal/mol from that of toluene.71,72 Thus, the ring opening of the radical derived from 1 is expected to be about 12.5-13.5 kcal/mol more exergonic than that of 5, giving a value of <LATEX>\Delta G ^ { \circ } = - 1 8 . 2 \mathrm { k c a l } / \mathrm { m o l } .</LATEX> If we assume that the full overlap of the x-system of the phenyl ring is available in the transition state for ring opening of the radical derived from 1, then the predicted rate constant for ring opening of this radical at 25 ℃ is <LATEX>1 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 1 } s ^ { - 1 } .</LATEX> Given the crude nature of the analysis, this value compares favorably with the observed rate constant of
5bjs | <LATEX>3 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 1 } s ^ { - 1 } .</LATEX> If the phenyl group in the radical derived from 1 is locked such that its <LATEX>\pi</LATEX> r-system cannot overlap fully with the breaking bond in the cyclopropyl ring, the resonance stabilization would be a function of <LATEX>\cos ^ { 2 } 6 ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>6</LATEX> is the dihedral angle of the breaking bond and the <LATEX>\pi</LATEX> T-system of the phenyl ring. When the latter is orthogonal to the breaking bond <LATEX>\left( \theta = 9 0 ^ { \circ } \right) ,</LATEX> the effect of the phenyl group would be reduced to approximately that of the inductive effect of an alkyl group. In this extreme case, the appropriate model reaction for the Marcus analysis would be one in which the exergonicity of the ring-opening reaction is only about 2.5-3 kcal/mol greater than that of 5 on the basis of the differences in BDE between primary and secondary alkane <LATEX>C</LATEX> <LATEX>C - H</LATEX> bonds.71 This <LATEX>s ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> value gives a predicted rate constant at 25 ℃ of about
uodj | <LATEX>4 \times 1 0 ^ { 8 }</LATEX> Using the two limiting cases discussed above, corresponding to phenyl stabilization of between 3 and 13 kcal/mol, the ster- eoelectronic effect of an enforced position <LATEX>\begin{array}{} { \text { of the phenyl group } } \\ { \text { plot in Figure } 2 \text { for } } \end{array}</LATEX> in the radical derived from 1 is shown on the selected dihedral angles. When <LATEX>\theta</LATEX> is for ring opening at 25 ℃ is reduced <LATEX>2 \times 1 0 ^ { 9 } s ^ { - 1 } ,</LATEX> 1 order of magnitude less than the oxygen rebound rate constants found in P-450 oxidations.22 Because it is possible that an oxygen rebound rate constant in the MMO hydroxylase is faster than that found in the P-450 studies, further reduction of the rate constant for ring opening of the radical derived from 1 could lead to undetectably small amounts of ring-opened alcohol product 1b. Thus the absence of 1b from oxidation of probe 1 could result from an extreme alteration in the rate constant for ring opening of the derived cyclopropylcarbinyl radical in the enzyme active site.73,74
k16v | Although the Marcus analysis demonstrates that a stereoe- lectronic reduction in the rate constant for ring opening of a radical derived from 1 is a possible explanation for the absence of ring- opened alcohol 1b, it should be recalled that no ring-opened product formed in the hydroxylation of the closely related substrate 2. A significant reduction in the rate constant for ring opening of the radical derived from this substrate probe due to steric effects in the active site is less likely. In this case, both phenyl groups must be held such that their <LATEX>\pi</LATEX> T-systems are virtually orthogonal to the breaking bond in order to reduce resonance stabilization in the transition state for opening, a much less probable situation. Moreover, such an arrangement would require that the phenyl groups approach coplanarity with one another, a geometry that would increase steric interactions between them. The results from probe 2 therefore suggest that a radical or carbocation is not formed and that the hydroxylation mechanism involves one of the alternative pathways A, <LATEX>B ,</LATEX> <LATEX>C \left( 1 \right) ,</LATEX> or <LATEX>F</LATEX> in Scheme IV.
b2lm | There is another factor to consider with regard to the results with probe 1. The discussion of steric effects on the rate constant for ring opening of substrate-derived radical ignored the fact that two enantiomers of this substrate were allowed to react with the chiral enzyme. If sterics-enforced stereoelectronic effects were operative, it is unlikely that both enantiomeric radicals derived from the enantiomers of the probe would suffer similar ring- opening rate retardations. The formation of aryl hydroxylated product in amounts comparable to the amount of alcohol la produced complicates the analysis, however. As indicated above, it is likely that the two different products are derived from the two different enantiomers of the probe substrate. Further studies with enantiomerically pure probes are planned to resolve this question.
