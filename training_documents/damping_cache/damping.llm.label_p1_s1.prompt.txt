You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

dpv6 | We consider a mathematical model describing nonlocal damping in magnetization dynamics. The model consists of a modified form of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation for the evolution of the magnetization vector in a rigid ferromagnet. We give a global existence result and characterize the long time behaviour of the obtained solutions. The sensitivity of the model with respect to large and small nonlocal damping parameters is also discussed.
8r5j | 1. Introduction and Preliminary Results
2taz | In this work, we are dealing with a mathematical model aris- ing in the theory of magnetization dynamics with nonlocal damping. We will consider the model proposed by Nembach et al. [1]. It is given by a modified LLG equation. The modifi- cation lies in the presence of a second-order space derivative of magnetization in the effective field. To describe the model equations, we consider §2 c R3 a bounded and regular open set of R3. The generic point of R3 is denoted by x. We assume that a ferromagnetic material occupies the domain .2.
o3ya | In what follows, S2 represents the unit sphere of R3. The magnetization field of the ferromagnetic material which belongs to S2 almost everywhere is denoted by M(t, x). Its evolution is governed by the following modified LLG equation (see [1, 2]):

kggw | where the symbol x denotes the vector cross product in R3. The positive constant « represents the damping parameter. The effective magnetic field I depends on M and is given by
xrd1 | H (M) = DAM + (A), M + + (M) + H dem (M) . (4)
5746 | The first term on the right-hand side of (4) is called the exchange magnetic field, where the positive constant D is the exchange coefficient and the term parameterized by the pos- itive constant { describes nonlocal damping in ferromagnets. The {-term was introduced in [2]; see also [1]. The third term is the bulk anisotropy field (which generally is taken as linear with respect to M), and I dem is the demagnetizing field, satisfying in (0, T) x R3 the stray field equation

v8uq | where M is the extension by 0 of M outside the magnetic domain Q2.
x972 | Notice that, for the sake of simplicity, the bulk uniaxial anisotropy field, generally taken as linear in M, and the magnetostatic field which satisfy the stray field equation are

4i0e | We define the energy
h2l3 | <LATEX>\mathscr{C} \left( t \right) = D \int _ { \Omega } | \nabla M | ^ { 2 } d x .</LATEX> (6)
dfzb | The following energy estimate holds.

on9b | Proof. The techniques to obtain (7) are analogous to those used, for example, in [3, 4]. We rewrite LLG equation (1) in the following form:
a8ge | <LATEX>\left( \alpha \partial _ { t } M - \left( 1 + \alpha ^ { 2 } \right) \mathscr{H} \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>= \alpha M \times \left( \alpha \partial _ { t } M - \left( 1 + \alpha ^ { 2 } \right) \mathscr{H} \right) - \left( 1 + \alpha ^ { 2 } \right) \mathscr{H} .</LATEX> (8)
h27a | Multiplying (8) by <LATEX>\left( \alpha \partial _ { t } M - \left( 1 + \alpha ^ { 2 } \right) \mathscr{H} \right)</LATEX> and using the saturation constraint <LATEX>| M | ^ { 2 } = 1</LATEX> almost everywhere yields to
pdjh | <LATEX>\frac { \alpha } { 1 + \alpha ^ { 2 } } | \partial _ { t } M | ^ { 2 } = \mathscr{X} \cdot \partial _ { t } M .</LATEX> (9)

Converting the two last terms of the right-hand side of (10) allows us to get

We limit ourselves to mentioning a handful of references concerning existence and we refer to the survey [5] for a more detailed bibliographical account. The general framework (although without nonlocal damping, i.e., the case <LATEX>\zeta = 0</LATEX> has been established in earlier papers (see, for instance, [6, 7]) using Faedo-Galerkin/Penalization (FGP) method. This method gives an approximated sequence of solutions converging to a global solution of the problem. Next results concern systems with further dissipation terms. For example, the modification considered in [8] consists in adding to the standard dissipation term in the LLG equation another higher-order term of the type <LATEX>\Delta ^ { 2 } M .</LATEX> The FGP method is also used to solve the problem. In [9], a model with dry-friction dissipation, which is accounted by adding a dry-friction-like term to the standard Gilbert damping,

vpgq | is studied. Let us mention that a model of ferromagnetic material with hysteresis effects is studied in [10]. In this model, the magnetic moment behaviour is described by the nonlinear Landau-Lifshitz equation with an additional term modeling the hysteresis. This term takes the form of a maximal monotone operator acting on the time derivative of the magnetic moment. For this relaxed model, local existence of regular solutions is proved. Note that in the framework of current-induced magnetization dynamics the work [11] addresses global existence of weak solutions to a LLG equation where a transport term is added to effective field taking into account the effect of the injected current. A model of magnetization switching with inertial effects modeled by means of a second-order time derivative term in the effective field is considered in [12] where existence of weak solutions and their long time behaviour were established. All these proofs are based on some penalization and using various kind of regularizations.
ousl | To state the existence result, we start with the definition of weak solutions to problem (1).

jfsr | Proof. The proof follows a standard scheme (Faedo-Galerkin method with a penalization of the saturation constraint) as usual in general Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation; see [6, 7, 13].
