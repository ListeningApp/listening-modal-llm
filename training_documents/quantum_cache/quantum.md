## Alternative k equals negative one loop quantum cosmology

An alternative quantization of the gravitational Hamiltonian constraint of the k equals negative one Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model is proposed by treating the Euclidean term and the Lorentzian term independently, mimicking the treatment of full loop quantum gravity. The resulting Hamiltonian constraint operator for the k equals negative one model with a massless scalar field is successfully constructed, and is shown to have the corrected classical limit. Compared to the former quantization schemes in the literature where only the Euclidean term is quantized, the new quantum dynamics of the k equals negative one model with a massless scalar field indicates that the classical big-bang singularity is replaced by an asymmetric quantum bounce.


## I. INTRODUCTION

How to quantize general relativity in a consistent manner is a great challenge to theoretical physics. One of the promising candidates is the so-called loop quantum gravity which is a nonperturbative approach to quantum general relativity. In the past three decades, loop quantum gravity has made remarkable progress, such as making the natural predictions of the discretized geometries and providing the microscopic interpretation of black hole entropy. The nonperturbative quantization procedure of loop quantum gravity has been successfully applied to the metric F of R theories, scalar-tensor theories, higher-dimensional gravity, and so on. Despite these achievements, the dynamics of full loop quantum gravity is still an unsolved issue. To gain a certain level of understanding of the dynamics, the quantization ideas and technologies developed in loop quantum gravity have also been applied to its symmetry-reduced models, such as the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models and the spherically symmetric black hole models, leading to loop quantum cosmology and loop quantum black hole models. The most successful feature of loop quantum cosmology is that it can resolve the classical big bang singularity by a quantum bounce due to the quantum geometry effects. We refer to more complete reviews on loop quantum cosmology.

In full loop quantum gravity, the gravitational Hamiltonian constraint is a combination of the so-called Euclidean term and the Lorentzian term. In the spatially flat, k equals zero Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model, the Lorentzian term and the Euclidean term are proportional to each other. Thus one often combines these two terms into one term proportional to the Euclidean term, and then quantizes the Euclidean term to obtain the well-defined gravitational Hamiltonian constraint operator. It turns out that in this quantization scheme the classical big-bang singularity is replaced by a symmetric quantum bounce for the k equals zero Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model with a massless scalar field in the framework of loop quantum cosmology. Note that in full loop quantum gravity, the Lorentzian term is quantized independently by employing the Thiemann's trick. Thus,

to mimic the full loop quantum gravity quantization procedure in the k equals zero model of loop quantum cosmology, the Euclidean term and the Lorentzian term were treated independently. This alternative quantization scheme leads to an asymmetric quantum bounce, which relates the spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model with an asymptotic de Sitter universe, and thus an effective cosmological constant and an effective Newtonian constant can be obtained.

As in the k equals zero model, the quantization technologies for the gravitational Hamiltonian constraint developed in loop quantum gravity have been extended to the k equals negative one and positive one models. Compared to the k equals zero model where the spin connection vanishes and hence the Ashtekar connection equals to the extrinsic curvature multiplied by the Immirzi parameter, the Lorentzian term is not proportional to the total Euclidean term, but is proportional to the part of the Euclidean term involving the extrinsic curvature due to the nonvanishing spin connection for both the k equals negative one model and the k equals positive one model. Hence in the literatures one often absorbs the Lorentzian term into a part of the Euclidean term, and then quantize the two parts of the Euclidean term, respectively. It turns out that, as the k equals zero model with the similar treatment, the resulting k equals negative one loop quantum cosmology model also predicts a vacuum repulsion in the high curvature regime that would lead to a symmetric bounce. Moreover, the k equals negative one model of loop quantum cosmology also possesses some new features that never appears in the k equals zero model, for example, due to a vacuum repulsion in the high curvature regime, the scale factor has the minimum value as a minimum equals yva. It is natural to ask whether the treatment of the Lorentzian term independently, mimicking the treatment in the full theory, can be directly carried to the k equals negative one model, and whether an asymmetric bounce can still be held for the k equals negative one model. This is the main motivation of the present paper. In this paper, we consider an alternative quantization of the gravitational Hamiltonian constraint in the k equals negative one model by treating the Lorentzian term independently.

This paper is organized as follows. The canonical formulation of the k equals negative one model is briefly recalled in Section two. Then we propose an alternative gravitational Hamiltonian constraint operator by treating the Lorentzian term independently, and provide a new quantum dynamics for the k equals negative one model in Section three. The effective theory of the new quantum dynamics and its asymptotic behavior are studied in Section four. Summary is included in the last section.


## II. CANONICAL FORMULATION OF THE k equals negative one MODEL

According to the cosmological principle, the line elements of the homogenous isotropic cosmological models take as

D s squared equals negative D t squared plus A squared of t left parenthesis one over one minus k r squared D r squared plus r squared left parenthesis D theta squared plus sine squared theta D phi squared right parenthesis right parenthesis,

where A of t is the scale factor, and k equals negative one, zero, one for the open, flat, and closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models, respectively.

In what follows, we present the canonical formulation of the K equals negative one model following Ref. For the spatially non-compact K equals zero, negative one models with topology homeomorphic to mathbb R cubed, one introduces an "elemental cell" mathcal V on the homogeneous spatial manifold mathbb R cubed and restrict all integrals to this elemental cell. Then one chooses a fiducial metric {} o q { a b } = {} circumflex omega { a } { i } omega { b } { j } delta { i j } on mathbb R cubed with {} circumflex omega { a } { i } being the left- and right-invariant fiducial one-forms in the K equals zero model, and only the left-invariant fiducial one-forms in the K equals negative one model. Here a, b, etc. denote the spatial indices while i, j, etc. equal one, two, three. Denote V { a } the volume of V measured by the fiducial metric {} o q { a b }. The left-invariant one-forms {} circumflex omega { a } { i } satisfy the Maurer-Cartan equation mathrm d ^ { q } omega ^ { i } plus one-half C { i } {} { j k } {} o omega { j } {} o omega { k } equals zero,

where for the K equals negative one model the structure constants read

C { j k } ^ { i } equals delta { j } ^ { i } delta { k one } minus delta { k } ^ { i } delta { j one },

while for the K equals zero model they take zero. The corresponding left-invariant vector fields {} o e { i } ^ { a } are dual to {} circumflex omega { a } ^ { i }, satisfying {} o e { i } ^ { a } {} o omega { a } ^ { j } equals delta { i } ^ { j }, and {} o e { i } ^ { a } {} a omega { b } ^ { i } equals delta { b } ^ { a }. The commutators between the left-invariant vector fields read left bracket {} o e { i }, {} o e { j } right bracket equals C { k } {} { i j } {} o e { k }.

Classically, the dynamical variables of LQC are obtained by symmetrically reducing those of full LQG. In the full theory, the dynamical variables consist of the S U two-valued connection A { a } ^ { i } and the densitized triad widetilde { E } { j } ^ { b } with the nontrivial Poisson bracket left brace A { a } ^ { i } left parenthesis x right parenthesis, widetilde { E } { j } ^ { b } left parenthesis y right parenthesis right brace equals kappa gamma delta { a } ^ { b } delta { j } ^ { i } delta left parenthesis x, y right parenthesis,

where kappa equals eight pi G with G being the Newtonian constant, and gamma is the Immirzi parameter. The connection A { a } ^ { \imath } is related to the spin connection Gamma { a } ^ { i } and the extrinsic curvature K { a } ^ { i } by A { a } ^ { i } equals Gamma { a } ^ { i } plus gamma K { a } ^ { i }. It turns out that the symmetry-reduced extrinsic curvature K { a } ^ { i } is diagonal in the basis of left-invariant one-forms for the K equals zero, negative one models. While, unlike the K equals zero model where Gamma { a } ^ { i } vanishes, the symmetry-reduced spin connection Gamma { a } ^ { i } in the K equals negative one model takes the form

Gamma { a } ^ { i } equals negative epsilon ^ { one i j } {} o omega { a } ^ { j },

and thus it is nondiagonal. Hence the symmetry-reduced connection and densitized triad for the K equals negative one model read

A { a } ^ { i } equals negative epsilon ^ { one i j } {} o omega { a } ^ { j } plus c V { o } ^ { negative one-third } {} o omega { a } ^ { i } equivalence A { j } ^ { i } V { o } ^ { negative one-third } {} o omega { a } ^ { j },

E tilde sub i superscript a equals p V sub o superscript negative two thirds square root of det open parenthesis superscript o q close parenthesis sub o e sub i superscript a ,

where

A sub j superscript i equals open parenthesis begin array c and zero and zero zero and c and negative V sub o superscript one third zero and V sub o superscript one third and c end array close parenthesis ,

the variables c and p are only functions of t, and det open parenthesis superscript o q close parenthesis denotes the determinant of superscript o q sub a b . Hence the gravitational phase space of the k equals negative one model consists of conjugate pairs open parenthesis c , p close parenthesis . The nontrivial Poisson bracket reads open curly bracket c , p close curly bracket equals kappa divided by three gamma .

Note that the variables c and p are related to the scale factor a by absolute p absolute equals a squared V sub o superscript two thirds and c equals gamma dot a V sub o superscript one third . The physical volume V of the elemental cell script V measured by the spatial physical metric q sub a b equals absolute p absolute V sub o superscript negative two thirds superscript o q sub a b is related to p via V equals absolute p absolute cubed divided by two . In the improved scheme, it is convenient to choose the following variables to simplify the dynamics b defined as bar mu c divided by two , v defined as the sign of absolute p absolute cubed divided by two pi gamma l sub p squared square root of Delta ,

l sub p defined as square root of G h bar denotes the Planck length , sign of p is the sign where nature of p , Delta defined as four square root of three pi gamma l sub p squared is the minimum nonzero eigenvalue of the area operator in full LQG , and bar mu equals square root of Delta divided by absolute p . The Poisson bracket between b and v is given by open curly bracket b , v close curly bracket equals one divided by h bar .

As in the k equals zero model, the Gauss and diffeomorphism constraints of the gravitational part are automatically satisfied for the symmetry-reduced variables in Equations (2.7) and (2.8) in the k equals negative one model , and thus the classical dynamics is encoded in the Hamiltonian constraint. The gravitational Hamiltonian constraint of the k equals negative one model reads
