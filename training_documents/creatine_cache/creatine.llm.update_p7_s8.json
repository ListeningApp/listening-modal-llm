However, lower daily creatine supplementation dosing strategies (i.e., three to five grams per day) are well established throughout the scientific literature for increasing intramuscular creatine stores leading to greater improvements in muscle mass, performance and recovery compared to placebo. While effective, these non-loading creatine supplementation dosing strategies delay maximum intramuscular creatine storage. For example, in the classic 'loading' versus daily 'maintenance' dose comparison study by Hultman et al., creatine accumulation in muscle was similar (approximately twenty percent increase) after participants consumed three grams per day for twenty-eight days or twenty grams per day for six days. Thus, it is currently recommended that individuals consume approximately three to five grams per day of creatine for a minimum of four weeks in order to experience similar skeletal muscle saturation levels. Determination of which creatine supplementation strategy is preferred may depend on the goal of the individual. For instance, if an athlete is hoping to maximize the ergogenic potential of creatine supplementation in a very short period of time (less than thirty days), adopting the creatine 'loading' strategy may be advised. However, if an athlete or exercising individual is planning to ingest creatine over an extended period of time (greater than thirty days), or if avoiding potential weight gain which can sometimes occur during creatine 'loading', the creatine 'maintenance' strategy would be a viable option. Athletes who are carrying out a creatine loading phase (i.e., twenty grams per day) should emphasize the smaller dosing strategies (e.g. less than or equal to ten gram servings) throughout the day, as dosages of greater than ten grams may potentially lead to gastrointestinal distress (i.e., diarrhea).\nerx1 | In summary, accumulating evidence indicates that you do not have to 'load' creatine. Lower, daily dosages of creatine supplementation (i.e.\nb3bt | three to five grams per day) are effective for increasing intramuscular creatine stores, muscle accretion and muscle performance/recovery.\n0w8m | Is creatine beneficial for older adults?\nvcu3 | There has been an increasing number of studies showing that creatine supplementation plays a therapeutic role in a variety of clinical conditions.\nhjzj | Perhaps one of the most promising conditions that could benefit from creatine supplementation is age-related sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is defined as a progressive and generalized skeletal muscle condition (i.e., decrease in muscle mass, strength, and functionality) that is associated with increased likelihood of adverse outcomes including falls, fractures, physical disability and mortality. While resistance training is considered cornerstone in the treatment of sarcopenia, accumulating evidence indicates that creatine supplementation may enhance the anabolic environment produced by resistance training, subsequently mitigating indices of sarcopenia.\nj79f | Creatine supplementation can increase functionality (e.g., strength, activities of daily living, delay fatigue) and muscle mass in older adults. However, the literature indicates that creatine alone (that is, without a concomitant resistance training program) is unlikely to result in substantial gains in muscle strength and functional performance, although it does improve some parameters of muscle fatigue. Likewise, most studies failed to show a beneficial effect of chronic creatine supplementation alone (greater than or equal to thirty days) on lean mass. For instance, we recently showed that creatine supplementation was not able to increase lean mass in postmenopausal women who supplemented with creatine (three grams per day) for two years, suggesting that creatine supplementation without exercise may be ineffective to prevent sarcopenia. It is likely that increases in lean mass occasionally attributed to creatine supplementation in short-term studies (e.g., seven days) are explained by increased body water, since creatine is osmotically active and it can sometimes induce water retention.\n6tbv | Conversely, substantial evidence indicates that creatine supplementation is capable of augmenting the hypertrophic response to resistance training in young adults, which is extended to older adults, as confirmed by three systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The fact that creatine is more effective when combined with a training stimulus suggests that the main mechanistic action of creatine is its ability to enhance training volume and/or intensity, which may influence muscle protein kinetics, growth factors, satellite cells,\nxb13 | inflammation and/or oxidative stress, ultimately resulting in greater skeletal muscle adaptations.\ncxqi | Regarding aging bone, emerging research over the past decade has shown some benefits from creatine supplementation. For example, healthy older males (greater than fifty years) who supplemented with creatine and performed whole-body resistance training for ten to twelve weeks experienced an increase in upper limb bone mineral content and a reduction in bone resorption compared to placebo. More recently, Chilibeck et al. showed that fifty-two weeks of creatine supplementation and supervised whole-body resistance training attenuated the rate of bone mineral loss in the hip region compared to placebo in postmenopausal females. However, a two-year creatine supplementation protocol was ineffective for improving bone mass or bone geometry in post-menopausal women, again suggesting that creatine should be combined with resistance-type exercise to produce beneficial bone adaptations.\nqfmx | From a clinical and healthy aging perspective, it is recommended that creatine supplementation be combined with resistance training to produce the greatest adaptations in older adults. Future clinical trials involving frail populations with long-term follow-ups and larger samples are needed. The therapeutic potential of creatine supplementation for cachexia, myopathies, post-surgery rehabilitation, bed rest, other muscle/bone wasting condition/diseases and brain health warrants further investigation.\nrut3 | In summary, there is a growing body of evidence showing that creatine supplementation, particularly when combined with exercise, provides musculoskeletal and performance benefits in older adults.\nm3cp | Is creatine only useful for resistance/power type activities?\nmq4s | Although creatine supplementation has been theorized to primarily benefit athletes involved in high-intensity intermittent resistance/power type activities, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that creatine supplementation may also provide beneficial effects for other activities. For example, creatine supplementation with carbohydrate or carbohydrate and protein has been reported to promote greater muscle glycogen storage than carbohydrate supplementation alone. Since glycogen replenishment is important for promoting recovery and preventing overtraining during intensified training periods, creatine supplementation may help athletes who deplete large amounts of glycogen during training and/or performance (i.e., sporting events) to maintain optimal glycogen levels. Second, there is evidence that creatine supplementation may reduce muscle damage and/or enhance recovery from intense exercise. For example, Cooke and colleagues",
