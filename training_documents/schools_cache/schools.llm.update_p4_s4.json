Rational and open systems theories tend to focus attention on the organizational unit and actors within them with open systems acknowledging a greater role for the external environment. While natural systems theorists such as Follett explicitly considered informal structures and power relationships, they did not integrate understandings of individuals' habitus and cultural capital into their explanations regarding the creation of informal structures.\nk78w | Four Empirical Studies in Culturally Diverse, High Needs Schools\ng9du | Over time, scholars have applied organizational theories and other social theories that emphasize the external environment, including students' socioeconomic and racial/ethnic backgrounds. Since the nineteen seventies, many scholars have examined effective schools in which students perform better than expected given the prerequisites. Classic school effectiveness studies of leaders in high-needs schools were conducted in the wake of the Coleman Report that identified students' socioeconomic background as more important to student success than the work of schools. Thus, Edmonds and Levine and Lezotte among many others studied those schools there were effective for all students regardless of socioeconomic status. More recently, the term \"turnaround school\" has emerged as a description of schools in which school principals led declining schools with high populations of children living in poverty and children of color to educational improvement in a short amount of time.\nf682 | Research on effective schools and turnaround schools (and leaders thereof) focuses on characteristics and practices of school organizations that contribute to student outcomes, including the development of a clear school mission, monitoring of student progress, protection of instructional time from interruptions, and maintenance of high standards for teachers and students. These studies demonstrated the quality of the school principal plays a central role in school management, facilitating effective teacher instructions, and improving student learning outcomes. Studies conducted in the US, Canada, and England concluded\nli1k | that student learning outcomes and school improvement cannot be achieved without effective school leaders; leadership has direct and indirect positive effects on student outcomes. While the above literature refers to the external environment, until recently, few scholars have specifically examined the ways in which school participants, including leaders, respond to student culture.\npbea | Johnson applied the notion of culturally responsive pedagogy to leadership in high needs schools, defining culturally responsive leaders as those who support high academic achievement, value and affirm the home cultures of their students, empower parents from all economically and culturally diverse settings, and actively seek societal change in an effort to make the surrounding communities better places for all. However, even in schools identified as highly successful, principals were inhibited in their abilities to provide a multicultural curriculum and involve parents in a meaningful way due to the high stakes policy environment focused solely on closing the achievement gap. Johnson contends, \"Culturally responsive leaders also need models of how they might challenge the status quo of inequitable assessment practices, incorporate students' cultural knowledge into the school curriculum, and work with parents and community activists for social change in the larger community.\" Since two thousand seven, leadership scholars such as Khalifa, Gooden, and Davis also posit the importance of culturally responsive leadership in schools. However, we see a continued need to theorize and apply explanations of culture from Bourdieu as part of leadership capacities needed in effective schools.\nccpt | As the International Schools Leadership Development Network researchers and others argue, the vast literature regarding school leadership frequently identifies the importance of context regardless of specific leadership approach (instructional, transformational, transformative, or culturally responsive), but the relationship between leadership and community/cultural context is not fully (theoretically) explained nor understood. As Gurr and Drysdale put it, \"The interplay between leadership and context to some extent remains a 'black box': a process whose inputs and outputs (and the relationships between them) are known, but whose internal structure or working is not known or well understood.\"\n0fpw | The International Schools Leadership Development Network was developed as a joint initiative of the British Educational Leadership, Management, and Administration Society and the University Council for Educational Administration. The aim of the International Schools Leadership Development Network is to contribute to knowledge in the field of educational leadership by facilitating an international comparative study of how those involved in school leadership are supported in their preparation and development as leaders.\ndqn8 | Selection criteria for participants in International Schools Leadership Development Network research across countries such as Mexico, Sweden, USA, and Australia include high percentages of individuals from families with incomes below the poverty line; high teacher/leader turnover rates; and high percentages of historically socially excluded groups. More specifically, in terms of leadership, research teams in the participating countries focused on new principals or principals with greater than two years in their post where the school showed signs\ncop0 | of improvement. Data collection sources featured interviews with the school leader, teachers and other senior staff members, parents, and students as well as observations and relevant document analysis. Interview questions focused on learning, leadership, and context. In International Schools Leadership Development Network literature and related leadership literature, context is challenging to define, as context can be an element or layer or conceived as several layers. Findings from International Schools Leadership Development Network scholars indicate, not surprisingly, that school leaders adapt their leadership practices to suit the context. Okilwa and Barnett describe this leadership ability as contextual acuity. Contextually driven leadership practices include entrepreneurial strategies such as marketing to neighboring schools for students, strategic interventions to improve student outcomes, adaptability to changing circumstances, building trust and relationships to bring people together around a common purpose of providing quality education, and transformative leadership practices aimed at equity and social justice.\nlhkq | This literature not only synthesized current school leadership practices, but also pointed out the direction of future inquiry and capacity development for leadership culturally diversity, responsiveness, and social justice. And while we appreciate extant attempts to define culture as part of the context for empirical study, we see the need to extend and enhance this work theoretically and empirically in light of the contemporary situation of increasing cultural diversity among students. For this, we draw primarily on the work of Pierre Bourdieu as well as Lingard and Christie, two scholars who have applied Bourdieu's theories to educational leadership.\n82ju | Four point one Leadership Approaches from Social Theories\n```",
