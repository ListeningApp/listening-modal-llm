You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

gc7v | For the first subtask, the performance at TF and cell type ASBs was 0.74 and 0.73 for the area under the receiver operating characteristic (auROC), and 0.44 and 0.56 for the area under the precision-recall curve (auPRC), respectively (see the plots in Supplementary Fig. 8). For the second subtask, we used the top 10 TFs and top 10 cell types with the highest numbers of ASBs, and a dedicated model was trained for each TF and each cell type (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 8). The quality of the models was different for different TFs and cell types, with the highest auROC of 0.72 and 0.81 for CTCF (of TFs) and HepG2 (of cell types), and the highest auPRC of 0.35 and 0.64 for CTCF and A549. Of note, RAD21 ASBs were also predicted with
wqfv | very high reliability, as they are often located at the same variants as CTCF ASB.
j30a | Analysis of the feature importance (Supplementary Fig. 8) showed that all models utilized signals from the final layer of the DeepSEA neural network that was specifically designed to distinguish regulatory SNVs. Of note, among multiple DeepSEA features, those for the matched cell types were automatically prioritized. In agreement with previous studies16,20, the models also obtained useful information from the experimental DNase- Seq data, and the data on allelic imbalance were generally more important than the basic read coverage. In the case of ASBs of particular TFs, motif-based features further facilitated distin- guishing ASBs from non-ASBs. We expect that the same framework can allow further improvement of ASB prediction when supplied with additional chromatin accessibility and allelic imbalance data from matched cell types and with improved models of TF-binding sites.
7bdk | Disease-associated SNPs and eQTLs are enriched with ASBs. To assess if ASB facilitates the identification of functional reg- ulatory sequence alterations, we annotated the ASB-carrying SNVs using data from several databases on phenotype-genotype associations: NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog36, Clin Var37, PheWAS38, and BROAD fine-mapping catalog of causal auto- immune disease variants39. With these data, we counted the number of known associations per SNP, considering SNVs of several classes: low-covered SNVs not tested for ASB (non-can- didate sites having the maximal read coverage across experiments not reaching 20); candidate sites that exhibit or not exhibit ASB from the data sets of a single TF; candidate sites from the data sets for two or more TFs that, again, exhibit ASB or do not; and finally, regulator-switching ASBs, where different TFs prefer to bind alternative alleles, e.g., in different cell types. All variants
fim0 | were segregated into classes in regard to known associations: no known associations, with a single association, and with multiple associations.
ojro | We have found that the share of ASB variants with genetic associations was consistently higher than expected by chance (Fig. 5a), which apparently makes ASBs good candidates for prospection for causal SNVs. Specifically, the odds ratio between the observed and expected SNP numbers was specifically high for TF-switching ASBs, although only 1.5% of such ASBs were involved in two or more known GWAS associations. For many variants, there are no known associations with "macro-pheno- types," as provided by GWAS studies, but there are data on molecular phenotypes like variations in mRNA levels. In fact, the effect of the so-called eQTLs40 can be explained by the alteration of TF-binding affinity that is revealed by ASB. Using the same classification of SNVs as above, we tested ASB and non-ASB SNVs for overlaps with GTEx41 eQTLs and observed the same pattern as for phenotype associations, with the strongest enrichment of ASBs for which different TFs preferably bind alternative alleles (Fig. 5b). The enrichment also grew stronger with the number of genes, mRNA levels of which were associated with the variant. The same effect holds for multi-cell type ASBs (Supplementary Fig. 9).
l6t9 | More than 80% of ASB SNVs with alternative alleles preferably bound by different TFs overlap eQTLs in at least one cell type, whereas 10% of such ASB SNVs overlap eQTLs targeting ten or more genes. A large fraction of genes of medical relevance from the ClinVar catalog37 was found among protein-coding genes associated with ASB eQTLs (twofold enrichment as compared to random expectation, Fisher's exact test P ~10-49). Of note, as many as 90% of genes of medical relevance in Clin Var are eQTL targets of ASB SNVs, and this constitutes 30% of all target genes of ASB eQTLs.
1ujy | It is not trivial to measure the reliability of ASB identification due to difficulty in assembling a highly reliable "ground truth" set of ASBs, that is necessary to compute standard performance measures based on true and false positives/negatives. For instance, only synthetic data were used for benchmarking purposes in the original BaalChIP paper19. On the other hand, despite difficulties in the direct evaluation of ASB calling performance, it is possible to estimate implicitly the "regulatory potential" of particular SNPs from functionally related data. We performed a comparison of ASB calls between ADASTRA, BaalChIP, and Shi et al. data comparing ASBs with GTEx eQTLs (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 9). The level of eQTL support for ADASTRA ASBs turned out to be comparable to that of the BaalChIP ASB set, with Shi et al. data close behind.
qzor | We also studied the association of GWAS-tested phenotypes with all candidate SNVs, not necessarily significant ASBs, found in TF-binding regions. To this end, we performed a general enrichment analysis for SNPs found in ChIP-Seq data of particular TFs within linkage disequilibrium blocks (LD-islands identified in42) using Fisher's exact test (see "Methods"). Thus we identified TFs for which phenotype-associated SNVs were enriched within TF-binding regions (Supplementary Fig. 9). For a number of TFs such association with phenotypes was reported in other studies. The examples include FOXA1 (involved in prostate development43 and in our case, found associated with prostate cancer), IKZF1 (for which the protein damaging mutations are associated with leukemia), STAT1 (involved in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus44), and others. Practically in all cases one or several of the associated SNVs also acted as ASBs of the respective TF, providing strong candidates for causality.
a0by | To illustrate how the functional role of regulatory SNPs can be highlighted with ASB data, we present several case studies. First, there is rs3761376 (G > A) that serves as a Ref-ASB for ESR1, which was already confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay45. rs3761376 is located in the TFF1 gene promoter and was shown to reduce TFF1 expression through altered ESR1 binding, suggesting a molecular mechanism of the increased risk of gastric cancer45.
