        "content": "ffx8 | We can take this a step further and look at followership during cultural clashes. When a culture that advocates free speech and a free press produces a political cartoon that is viewed as insulting by another culture, how does followership play out? What drives followers in the offended group to start rioting and harming members of the free speech culture? What makes the followers in the free speech culture surprised by this retaliation, but not retaliate in return?\ns6su | Leader(ship)\ny219 | Traditionally, we have viewed the world from a leadership-centric vantage point. We have assumed that all other factors, including followership, are secondary to leadership. When followers have been surveyed, it was to determine their views of the leaders. But what if we turned all this around? What if we put followership center stage and asked all the same questions, but only in reference to the followers instead of leaders? For example, when we talk about leader-follower distance, we always talk about the follower's distance from the leader, but we should also talk about the leader's distance from the follower. Likewise, what are the interactions between leaders and followers from the follower's point of view? We tend to think of leaders as the proactive \"cause\" and followership as the reactive \"effect.\" But what if the opposite were true? Are leadership attitudes, behavior, and performance more a result of followership than the other way around? For example, do sheep produce a particular style of leadership, regardless of the leader's personality or predisposition? Is it this turn of events that leads to a particular outcome?\n06ht | Rethinking Followership\nv3r2 | We might also reframe the interaction effects between followers and leaders. For example, when we talk about charismatic leadership, we can ask, What style of follower would a charismatic leader attract? However, we should also ask, What style of leader would a yes-person attract? What is the psychological and emotional dynamic between them? These possible interactions between different followership and leadership styles, and the complexity therein, would be fertile areas for research, complementing Kellerman's and Lipman-Blumen's work on bad leaders. This topic also ties in to the aforementioned world events and culture areas.\nnv42 | Follower Qualities\nxags | The question that still sticks in my head after twenty-plus years is, In our society, why does anyone want to be a follower, when all the perks and all the attention go to leaders? Although I identified seven paths to followership in my book The Power of Followership, we still have a long way to go to understand it more fully. For example, college applications ask for examples of leadership, but not of followership. It would be an unusual kid who would take the risk to extol followership qualities and the even more unusual admissions officer who would reward it.\njc47 | So from where do followership attitudes, styles, and aspirations come? What's the role of parenting, early childhood experience, school, religion, sports participation, the media, or important role models on followership development? Consider peer pressure in middle school, for example. Most of the serious social issues students may face-alcohol and drug experimentation, gangs, sex, fear of social ostracism-are peer-pressure driven. Schools treat peer pressure as a leadership issue when actually it's a followership issue. They believe that if they teach leadership skills, they will alleviate the negative effects of peer pressure. A better approach may be to teach better followership skills. Kids need to learn how to protect themselves from leaders who encourage them to engage in either self-destructive or socially destructive behavior, as well as learn how to support positive leaders.\nko3c | But peer pressure and toxic leaders are not just a middle school problem. Many of the world events mentioned earlier involve peer pressure and toxic leaders. We need to learn what life events produce followers who can think for themselves; exercise their own independent, critical judgment; and act in the best interests\nxek3 | The Art of Followership\nbbpr | of the organization or the society, even if doing so means going against the leader or the group.\n5zyf | Role of the Follower\n9own | One of the questions that I ask executives is, \"If you could have an ideal mix of the five followership styles in your organization, what percentage of each style would you prefer?\" I'm surprised at how many say they would like all yes-people. Their reasons are that one, yes-people are \"doers\" who are willing to do the grunt work and who get the job done with little fuss; two, yes-people have limited aspirations and will neither pressure the leader for promotions nor quit for better jobs elsewhere; and three, yes-people are loyal and dependable.\nbqfb | Other executives say they would prefer the following mix. Start with a sprinkling of alienated because they keep the leader honest. Add a small group of star followers who would lead the charge, but avoid adding too many because they can get demanding, and they think for themselves too much. Then split the remaining majority among pragmatics who serve as an institutionalized, status quo base and yes-people who will get the job done.\nwwdt | It is the rare executive who wants all star followers. Most executives fear that they can neither keep star followers challenged by the job nor satisfied with their role in the organization. They believe that star followers will grow bored and disillusioned, seeking greener pastures and leading to high turnover. My own experience is that organizations with more star followers perform better because the star followers need not depend on the leader for direction or motivation. This reduces the transaction costs that hinder organizational success.\nmn1r | Pondering the roles of followers results in intriguing research questions. What assumptions do leaders make about the various followership styles? Are those assumptions accurate, or are they dysfunctional stereotypes? Is the common leader preference for loyal doers justified or problematic? Is there an ideal mix of followership styles, or is the search for such a mix a quixotic quest? Is the ideal mix dependent on the context or situation? Do certain mixes attract certain types of leaders? Do certain leaders reshape the mix to suit their own preference? If we prefer a certain mix, say all star followers, can people move from one followership style to another, such as from yes-person to star follower? If so, how does that happen? Rethinking the role of followers can help the field move forward.\n5vqw | Rethinking Followership\nmeyw | Language of Followership\n2e62 | If I had a dollar for every time someone said to me, \"You need to come up with a word other than 'follower' because it's socially unacceptable,\" I would be much wealthier today. \"If you had a sexier, easier term,\" they say, \"then you'd be able to sell this concept much more easily.\" My response is always \"I would be glad to do that as soon as we get rid of the word 'leader.' Once you're ready to do that, then we can talk.\"\n75y3 | My rigid stance actually stems from the point that these people are making- that language does make a difference. Language has an effect. If we stop using \"follower\" (as some businesses, such as Wal-Mart, have done, using words like \"associate\" in its place), can we really continue to use the word \"leader\"? Does \"leader-associate\" have the same dialectical relationship as \"leader-follower\"? I think not. Instead, it masks the underlying beliefs that the leaders have about their \"associates\" with a more democratic sheen.",
