You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

2vn7 | I could keep listing these, but hopefully you get the idea. Now it's time for you to give it a try for your Grand Slam Offer.
mv86 | Again, you don't necessarily have to use all the power components of the headline. Using three to five will typically create something that is more unique and desirable, allowing you to separate yourself from the competitive field and create an offer that will get clicks and engagement, and ultimately make you money.
8miy | Furthermore, you don't need to do them in the M-A-G-I-C order. Do what sounds punchier to you. After doing this for a while, you'll see that some offers convert better than others. That's natural. And every once in a while you'll get a name that takes off like a rocket. I honestly have no idea why some names win and others do not. So, don't be emotional about it. Keep trying. Keep striking out. Then try more. You'll get there.
h5l3 | Now that you have several working names for your offer, you can use two to three of your best names in your advertising campaign. Quickly note the winner, then use that as a control to test against with new names. That is how you promote.
77nj | Pro Tip - Name Sub Items & Bonuses
wa9j | Use the magic headline formula for each item in your stack and bundle. It will automatically enhance the value of your offerings simply by naming in a way that resonates with your prospects.
pj74 | What Happens When Offers Fatigue
tv7e | As you market offers, you will need to create variations over time as the tastes of the market change over time. Here's the order in which you will change things to keep lead flow consistent.
cicu | 1. Change the creative (the images and pictures in your ads)
m5cf | 2. Change the body copy in your ads
ug1e | 3. Change the headline - the "wrapper" of your offer
txjz | 4. Free 6 Week Lean Challenge to Free 6 Week Tone Challenge
tahh | 5. Holiday Hangover to New Year New You
rja2 | 6. Change the duration of your offer
jk9f | 7. Change the enhancer of your offer (your free/discount component)
lu5d | 8. Change the monetization structure, the series of offers you give prospects, and the price points associated with them (Book II)
mw2y | I follow this variation framework because most of the time it's the first handful of items that need to be changed. Typically, they need to be changed again and again without touching anything on the bottom of the list.
kba4 | For example, when ads fatigue, we don't change our entire business; we just run the same ad again with a different video or image. Once that stops working, we change it again. Eventually you need to change the words in your ads. And repeat the process. Then, and only then, would you change the wrapper.
lxpp | Let's say we change from a Six-Week Stress Release Challenge to a 42-Day Relaxing Holidays Challenge for a massage center. Same core offer, just a different wrapper. Then, of course, you could change the duration of your offer - six weeks to 28 days or eight weeks, etc. The lower on the list you go, the more operationally heavy it is, so really be sure you have exhausted the earlier "lighter" ways of varying your offer.
xvte | Once you've monetized an offer, rarely should you change it. Just rinse and repeat over and over and over again. This can be hard because we are entrepreneurs and love change. Change here usually just creates inefficiency and operational drag, costing you money. No bueno.
3qkr | So use your entrepreneurial ADD on the "wrapper" first - the "look and feel" of the offer (copy, creative, headlines). Then change the seasonality of the offer. Then change the duration. If you're still stuck, change what you are giving away for free or discount. Change the entire machine behind it only as a last resort and for a darn good reason, especially once you get traction.
5y46 | But how do you get initial traction? Good question. Try the offer structure and headline that you think has the highest likelihood of working. Then stick with it.
9dqf | And if they don't convert at first, don't worry. You'll get better. Oftentimes, if you are using these types of models, many of them will work. In that case, stick with the one that gives you the highest return. You can also rotate between offers if it doesn't create lots of operational drag for your type of business. This is the ultimate position of power. You have multiple "aces in the hole" that you can play at any time, which keeps your marketing converting at an even higher level.
vugf | Author Note - Marketing Local Businesses
7d5n | Ironically, local business marketing is both easier and harder than national level marketing. It's easier to get to work, but harder to keep working or scale. And the reason is - in local markets, it's easier because there' is trust in the familiar. So selling in- person at higher prices in a local market is inherently easier. It means you will convert a much higher percentage of your leads. This makes marketing work most of the time.
22rs | The downside of local marketing is that offers fatigue rapidly because there is only a limited radius that a local business can serve. To reference an earlier concept, the TAM (total addressable market) for a brick & mortar is only its immediate radius (most times). So by extension, the smaller the radius, the faster offers fatigue. This is the double-edged sword of local.
bjpt | Learning to rapidly variate my offers, headlines, and creative when I had my local businesses was a cornerstone skill that made my expansion to national level advertising much easier for me. So if you are in a local market, just remember you aren't going to change the value stack of your offer. You are just going to change the way it looks to the marketplace in your marketing.
vkpg | Naming Summary
yix9 | We must appropriately name our offer to attract the right avatar to our business. True to the moniker, people do judge a book by its cover. Half-ass naming your product or offering can ruin conversions. Don't fall victim to lazy naming. Follow the steps here to name your product or service offering and watch the same offer get 2x, 3x, or 10x the response rate. You'll believe it when you see it - I know I did.
iaod | Enhancing Your Offer Section Recap
t8jd | Congrats! You figured out how to make your offer valuable, how to break your services into component parts, and how to rebundle them into a more valuable whole.
nz5q | You added a guarantee to get more people to buy your offer and actually consume it so they could be more successful.
a2fr | You presented it with urgency and scarcity to get more people to desire it.
hm2f | And now you've named your offer so it attracts the right prospects and repels the bad ones, all while containing a big promise everyone can understand.
rrgl | But we covered a lot, so I want to give you a quick breather before we forge into Book II to help you attract clients and monetize your offer.

3e6g | March 2017.
p9wt | My heart was racing. I could literally feel each beat pounding in my chest. I clenched my jaw to fend off the knot in my throat that I knew would lead to tears. I wanted to give in. Years of emotions were bottled below the surface.
bg6v | Years of ignoring my reality and lack of success. Years of putting off how I felt just focusing on moving forward. The pressure was shooting to the surface. I could feel it.
ek18 | "We did it," I said.
hdkt | Leila, my wife now, looked up at me. She was in the kitchen making dinner and stopped, spatula in hand. "What do you mean?"
yyzt | "We did it. We hit $100k." I could barely get the words out because I didn't want the tears to break through the tremble in my voice.
7lvc | "Like revenue?"
rt7z | "No. Like in our personal bank accounts."
wpui | "Holy shit really ?! That's amazing !! "
23tt | She ran over to me, disregarding the food on the stove, and wrapped her arms around my neck, spatula still in hand.
v3cv | "I'm so proud of you"
o6hl | She squeezed me. I slumped into her arms. It was like every knot in my body that I had been holding onto melted all at once. I could barely contain myself. But when I think back to it, the feeling I had wasn't happiness. It was relief. I'd moved from fear to security. I'd traded feeling like a failure everyday, watching my work and effort yield nothing, to realizing a dream. The constant anxiety and fear of "what are we gonna do" finally be replaced by something else. I finally had time to let myself feel something.
pv9r | I felt like this "struggle" chapter of life was finally over.
3ujw | "Look," I said. "It's for real"
ekyb | I nuzzled my head out of Leila's arms. I didn't want to look her in the eyes because I knew it would put me over the edge. I pulled my phone out and put it between us. We both stared at the unmoving screen with our personal bank account balance.
09tz | $101,018
ncf7 | Our gazes remained unbroken as they confirmed a new, shared reality. It wasn't an illusion. It wasn't revenue. It wasn't "profit" that was still in the business account, only to be taken out later by some unforeseen emergency. It wasn't "earmarked" money that had to be used to pay off some debt. It was ours. For real.
qd2c | "Babe," I said. "We could fuck up and not make another dollar for three straight years, and still be okay."
in7g | At the time, $33,000 per year was more than enough for us to live at our current expenses for three years and some.
1sn7 | Years of ups and downs. Years of ploughing money into my business(es) only to watch it vanish in overhead, payroll, and mistakes. Years of seminars, courses, workshops, coaching programs, masterminds . . . had F-I-N-A-L-L-Y turned into wealth. It felt like I had broken into a new plane. The relative increase in wealth was more than I ever felt.
bcxr | Tens of millions of dollars in the bank later, it was, and still is, the richest I have ever felt in my life. It was the beginning of the next chapter in my life as a business person and entrepreneur.
0dtd | Some people get there fast. Some people get there slowly. But everyone gets there eventually, as long as you don't give up. Keep moving forward. Keep getting up. Keep believing it can happen.
rnxf | And, it will. In A Nutshell
s6hr | We've covered a lot. And I think it's important for information to sink in, that it be consolidated and restated. So this is the "back of the napkin" bullet list to summarize what we've learned so far and why.
p6cq | 1. We covered why you must not be a commodity in this marketplace.
99rc | 2. Why you should pick a normal or growing market, and why niches get you riches.
n6d5 | 3. Why you should charge a lot of money.
1kke | 4. How to charge a lot of money using the four core value drivers.
zp0n | 5. How to create your value offer in five steps.
f9ca | 6. How to stack the value, deliver it, and make it profitable.
yidf | 7. How to shift the demand curve in your favor using scarcity,
ysbk | 8. How to use urgency to decrease the action threshold of buyers
1cv5 | 9. How to strategically use bonuses to increase the demand of your offer
cst3 | 10. How to completely reverse buyer risk with a creative guarantee.
w2ec | 11. How to name it in a way that resonates with your avatar.
ov01 | You now have a valuable, high margin, de-commoditized grand slam offer. This is the first building block of a wonderful business - a product or service that people desperately want and truly solves their problem. For many, this will be enough to make far more sales, at higher prices, with more profit. Your first true grand slam offer should be able to get you to your first $100,000. For others, you will still want more. Which is 100 percent your right as a capitalist.
bovo | There's so much more to building an acquisition machine profitably. I could not cover it all in one book. Out of respect for you, I wanted to make this thorough but manageable. That being said, the next book is dedicated to exactly that - getting more - through generating leads. In that book, I will break down exactly how to acquire customers at a profit. Meaning, if you structure your promotions correctly, you should never have to pay for a new customer again. That is the subject of Acquisition.com Volume II $100M: Lead Generation.
atnz | Final Thoughts
85ak | Entrepreneurship is about acquiring skills, beliefs, and character traits. To advance, I find that we must determine which skills, beliefs, and character traits we lack. Most times, we simply need to improve. And the only way to do that is through learning from experience and/or high quality sources. I have received terrible advice from people who were ahead of me at the time. And though experience is the best teacher, she is not the kindest.
gk8u | It is my most sincere hope that what I produce provides the guidance I so desperately needed when I was coming up on my entrepreneurial journey. And I wish I could cover it all in a single book (for my sake and yours). But, to do you the service I wish I had had, I cannot. The devil is in the details. Excellence exists in the depth of knowledge and nuances. That's what separates the greats from everyone else. I hope that in all the content I produce you see my dedication to this detail and nuance that makes all the difference. These lessons were hard won.
dyg8 | I hope you've enjoyed this first volume in my offers series. Before we move forward into volume two, where we'll be focusing on lead generation, as mentioned above, I wanted to circle back to where we started. After reading this book, I hope:
qoea | 1. You're well on the path to creating your first Grand Slam Offer. Or at the very least, can take components that you were missing in your offer to make it more compelling to your market.
