You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

w6d9 | 3. Newton-MR Two-Metric Projection
lbm8 | We now propose and theoretically study our extensions of the TMP framework, which involves simultaneously em- ploying gradient and inexact Newton steps, which are, re- spectively, restricted to the active and inactive sets.
krjy | 3.1. MINRES and Its Properties
n7dw | The inexact Newton step is based on the recently proposed Newton-MR framework (Liu & Roosta, 2022b; Roosta et al.,
9nt1 | 2022), where instead of CG, subproblems are approximately solved using the minimum residual (MINRES) method (Paige & Saunders, 1975). Recall that the tth iteration of MINRES is formulated as
fr45 | s(t) = arg min |Hs + g|2. SEKt (H,g)
s2ty | (8)
3cdb | where Kt (H, g) = Span{g, Hg, ... , Ht-1g} is the Krylov subspace of degree t generated from H and g. On each itera- tion MINRES minimises the squared norm of the residual of the Newton system over the corresponding Krylov subspace. Note that, from an optimisation perspective, the residual itself can be viewed as the gradient of the second-order Taylor approximation typically considered by second-order methods (e.g. Newton-CG), that is, r ^ -Hs - g = -Vs (g, s) + (s, Hs). This highlights an advantage of MINRES over CG. Indeed, unlike CG, which aims to min- imise the second order Taylor approximation, minimisation of the residual norm remains well defined even if H is in- definite. For more theoretical and empirical comparisons between CG and MINRES, see Lim et al. (2024).
6hsm | Recently, Liu & Roosta (2022a) established several prop- erties of MINRES that make it particularly well-suited for nonconvex settings. For example, to assess the availability of a nonpositive curvature (NPC) direction in MINRES, one merely needs to monitor the condition
om5d | (r(t-1), Hr(t-1)) ≤0, (9)
0svq | This condition is shown to be both necessary and sufficient for the existence of NPC directions in Kt (H, g) (Liu & Roosta, 2022a, Theorem 3.3). In addition, MINRES en- joys a natural termination condition in non-convex settings. More specifically, for any user specified tolerance n > 0, the termination condition
1too | |Hr(t-1) | < |Hs( -1)|, (10)
pti9 | is satisfied at some iteration. Note that the left hand side, Hr(t-1), is simply the residual of the normal equation H2s = - Hg. Condition (10) is particularly appealing in non-convex settings where we might have g ¢ Range(H) and therefore ||r|| > 0 for all s & Rd. In this case a more typical termination condition ||r(t-1) || < n may never be satisfied for a given n > 0. By contrast, (10) is applicable in all situations since |Hr(t-1) || is guaranteed to monoton- ically decrease to zero, while ||Hs(t-1) | is monotonically increasing (Liu & Roosta, 2021, Lemma 3.11). Remark- ably, both Conditions (9) and (10) can be computed with a scalar update directly from the MINRES iterates without any additional Hessian-vector products; see Lemma A.1.
4mtx | A Newton-MR step is computed by running MINRES until (9) is detected, in which case r(t-1) is returned. Since r(t-1) is a nonpositive curvature direction, we label this
rgxy | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimisation with Nonnegativity Constraints
vsq9 | case as a "NPC" step. Otherwise, when the termination condition (10) is satisfied, <LATEX>s ^ { \left( t - 1 \right) }</LATEX> is returned. This step serves as an approximate solution to (8) and so we label this case as a "SOL" step. Let p denote the direction returned by negative curvature detecting MINRES. Liu & Roosta (2022a) shows that <LATEX>\mathrm { p }</LATEX> serves as a direction of first and second- order descent for the function <LATEX>f ,</LATEX> namely <LATEX>\langle \mathrm { p } , \mathrm { g } \rangle < 0</LATEX> and <LATEX>\langle \mathrm { p } , \mathrm { g } \rangle + \langle \mathrm { p } , \mathrm { H p } \rangle / 2 < 0</LATEX> (Liu & Roosta, 2022a, Theorem 3.8), as well as a direction of non-ascent for the norm of its gradient <LATEX>\| \mathrm { g } \| ^ { 2 } ,</LATEX> that is, <LATEX>\langle \mathrm { p } , \mathrm { H g } \rangle < 0</LATEX> for a SOL step and <LATEX>\langle \mathrm { p } , \mathrm { H g } \rangle = 0</LATEX> for a NPC step (Liu & Roosta, 2022a, Lemma 3.1).
