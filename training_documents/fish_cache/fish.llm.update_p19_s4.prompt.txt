You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

lvae | The survey relies on 38 kHz as the primary acoustic frequency to estimate Pacific hake biomass, although additional frequencies as available on the U.S. and Canadian survey vessels are also used to help distinguish hake from other acoustic targets. Acoustic backscatter attributed to Pacific hake is scaled to biomass or abundance using a length-based model of target strength (TS), the log-transformed acoustic backscatter expected from a single fish or unit biomass. In 1995, this model was changed from a weight-based TS of -35 dB/kg to a TS-length relation of <LATEX>T S = 2 0 \log L - 6 8</LATEX> (Traynor, 1996), where <LATEX>L</LATEX> is fork length in centimetres. Variability in Pacific hake TS has continued to be an active area of research (e.g. Henderson and Horne, 2007); data from the most recent field measurements (Fleischer et al., unpub- lished data) were generally consistent with mean and variation indicated in Traynor (1996).
o9sc | Sources of uncertainty in the acoustic surveys of Pacific hake abundance involve climate-ocean effects on distribution and availability of fish to the sur- vey, the ability to acoustically differentiate Pacific hake from other acoustic targets and the uncertainty in Pacific hake TS. For example, the current stock assessment models use the acoustic-based survey biomass indices from 1995 to present only, excluding the earlier surveys that had reduced spatial cover- age and used a different TS model. A second example of the uncertainty in acoustic surveys occurred during the 2009 acoustic survey with the northward expansion of Humboldt squid into the CCLME. Several factors make it diffi- cult to acoustically distinguish Humboldt squid and Pacific hake: the TS and frequency response of Humboldt squid are similar to those of Pacific hake. There was overlap in the depth and geographic ranges of both species in 2009, and squid predation may cause an avoidance response leading to altered aggre- gation behaviour in hake (Holmes et al., 2008). Because the proportions of backscatter attributable to hake and Humboldt squid were based on limited information, the estimated uncertainty (CV) of the acoustic survey biomass estimate was higher in 2009 than in other survey years (Stewart and Hamel, 2010). Further irruptions of Humboldt squid have not been observed during hake acoustic surveys since 2009.

zh03 | 9.6 Assessment and management strategy evaluation
1mvw | Age-structured models have been used to model the population dynamics of the coastal stock of Pacific hake since the early 1980s. Cohort analyses were replaced by statistical catch-at-age models by the early 1990s. These latter mod- els provide a time series of estimates of total biomass, biomass-at-age, spawn- ing biomass and age-0 recruits. The current assessment model relies on catch, survey indices, weight-at-age and age composition data. The 2013 assessment estimated a mean unfished female spawning biomass of a little more than 2 million tonnes, with a female spawning biomass at the beginning of 2013 of 1.5 million tonnes, or 72% of unfished equilibrium female spawning biomass. Assessments have consistently found that the population dynamics of Pacific hake are characterised by infrequent large year classes, including from the years 1980, 1984 and 1999, and potentially 2008 and 2010. These large year classes have sustained the population, through long periods with moderate to low recruitments.
6d4s | Prior to 1997, separate Canadian and U.S. assessments for Pacific hake were submitted to each nation's assessment review process, which resulted in differ- ing yield options being forwarded to each country's managers for this shared trans-boundary fish stock. Multiple interpretations of Pacific hake status made it difficult to coordinate an overall management policy. From 1997 through 2010, the Stock Assessment and Review process for the PFMC in the United States evaluated assessment models and the PFMC council process, includ- ing NOAA Fisheries, has generated management advice that has been largely utilised by both nations. In 2003, the United States and Canada signed the Treaty, which specifies science and management processes. The terms of the treaty were not fully implemented until 2012, but stock assessments and man- agement activities have conformed to the treaty for many years (Helser et al., 2006; Hamel and Stewart, 2009; JTC 2012, 2013). Under the Treaty, Pacific hake stock assessments are prepared by the JTC composed of both U.S. and Canadian scientists and reviewed by the SRG, with members of both groups appointed by both Parties to the agreement. In 2012, after formal appoint- ments were made to Treaty-specific committees, the stock was assessed and managed under the full auspices of the treaty for the first time. Between 2003 and 2011, the Parties honoured the intent of the Treaty during its implementa- tion, which included joint stock assessment reviews and allocations to the each country based on the Treaty allocation structure.
mqah | The 2013 assessment (JTC, 2013) was a fully Bayesian assessment conducted using the Stock Synthesis modelling platform (Methot and Wetzel, 2013), with the base-case model incorporating prior information on two key parameters (natural mortality, M, and steepness of the stock-recruit relationship, h) and integrating over estimation and parameter uncertainty to provide results that could be probabilistically interpreted. The base case model showed large vari- ations in Pacific hake biomass over the past four decades (Figure 9.7), largely related to variation in recruitment (Figure 9.5), with an apparent strong year

vz32 | The 2013 assessment (JTC, 2013) estimated that the stock was, in fact, not overfished in the early 2000s (reaching a low of 32.3% of unfished biomass in 2000), but in contrast did meet the overfished definition in 2009 (at 20.4% of unfished biomass). As the official declaration of overfished status in the United States applies only to a current estimate, and as Pacific hake are now managed under an international treaty that does not include an 'overfished' definition, the retrospective 2009 estimate in the 2012 assessment does not impact current management.
ncb0 | A retrospective comparison of Pacific hake assessment models from 1991 through 2013 shows considerable variability in the estimates of Pacific hake
