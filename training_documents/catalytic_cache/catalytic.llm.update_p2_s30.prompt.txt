You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

The as-obtained samples were diluted with deionized water until pH reached 7 and dried at 80 ℃. The samples were denoted as FC-0-8 and FC-1-8. The yield of FC-1-8 was almost 52.5%. For comparison, FC-1-8-HCl was prepared by etching FC-1-8 with concentrated HCl and washed with deionized water to neutrality and dried at 80 °C.
qws8 | 2.4 Characterizations
877u | The main text of the article should appear here with headings as appropriate. A series of measurements were conducted to determine the structure of the products. The crystal structure was determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (D/MAX- 1200, Rigaku Denki Co. Ltd, Japan) with a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with Cu Ka radiation at 1 = 0.15406 nm at 40 kV and 40 mA were recorded in the range of 20 = 10-70. The morphological morphology was measured using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) at 5.0 kV and a transmission

Raman spectra were recorded from 1000 to 2500 cm-1 on a microscopic confocal Raman spectrometer (LabRAM Aramis, Horiba Jobin Yvon) using a 532 nm YAG solid-state laser. The chemical composition of the sample was verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted by 500 um beam spot of an Escalab 250Xi electron spectrometer

The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was determined by an <LATEX>\mathrm { N } _ { 2 }</LATEX> adsorption method using an auto- mated surface area and pore-size analyzer (Autosorb-IQ2-MP-C system). The pore size distribution was calculated according to a quenched solid density functional theory (QSDFT) theory.
f2y8 | 2.5 Electrochemical tests
o7qm | The electrochemical properties were measured by a three- electrode system with a platinum foil as counter electrode and Hg/HgO electrode as the reference electrode. A 6 M KOH aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. The working electrode was prepared by mixing active materials, carbon black and PTFE at a weight ratio of <LATEX>8 : 1 : 1</LATEX> in ethanol solvent. The slurry was mixed by ultrasonication for 2 h and then loaded on graphite paper <LATEX>\left( 1 \times 1 c m ^ { 2 } \right. ,</LATEX> followed by vacuum drying at 70 ℃ for 24 h.
d52l | The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge- discharge (GCD) curves were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CorrTest, China) at a voltage range from -1.2 to -0.3 V. The specific capacitance (C) was obtained from <LATEX>\mathrm { C V }</LATEX> curves using the following relationship:
