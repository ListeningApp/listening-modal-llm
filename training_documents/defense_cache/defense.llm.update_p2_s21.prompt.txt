You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

More interesting was a spontaneous decrease in eosinophil numbers in the absence of treatment, suggest- ing active downregulation of the eosinophilia, a process seen in other experimental volunteer infections.25,26 This active (and spontaneous) modulation of eosinophilia gen- erally occurred when migration of the larval forms ceased and the infections became patent (sexually mature adults began egg laying [eg, hookworm23 or schisto- somes]) or larval release (eg, filariae24).
li1k | EOSINOPHILS AND PROTECTIVE IMMUNITY
pbea | Epidemiologic evidence for the role of eosinophils in the immune response to helminth infections
ccpt | As early as 1939, eosinophils were postulated to play a role in the immune response to helminth infection.27 Such hypotheses were based primarily on histopathologic evi- dence of eosinophils surrounding dying parasites in tissue biopsy specimens. Later, in vitro killing of parasites by eosinophils (in the presence of antibodies, complement, or both)28-30 and eosinophil granule products31,32 was demonstrated. Despite these in vitro findings and epi- demiologic evidence correlating high eosinophil counts with resistance to posttreatment reinfection with Schisto- soma haematobium and S mansoni in human sub- jects, 33,34 the in vivo role of eosinophils in immunity to helminth infection has been much more difficult to define. There has been conflicting evidence35,36 on the protective efficacy of eosinophils in animals depleted of eosinophils and subsequently challenged with a variety of parasites

cop0 | (Table II). Overall, the discrepancy seen in the various studies examining the role of eosinophils in protective immunity in different animal models of parasite infec- tions has been attributed to the redundancy of effector immune responses or to the basic differences in the ani- mal models used.37
lhkq | Animal models
82ju | Animal models of helminth infection have allowed for the assessment of the eosinophil's role in vivo. Treatment with anti-IL-5 antibody prevents the tissue and blood eosinophilia that occurs in animal models of gastrointesti- nal helminth infection.10,38 However, such treatment has not been shown to increase susceptibility to infection in murine models of T spiralis,39 Trichuris muris,40 Nip- postrongylus brasiliensis,10 H polygyrus,9 or schistosomia- sis.41 Similarly, IL-5 transgenic mice that have persistent increases of eosinophil levels do not demonstrate enhanced immunity to T spiralis or S mansoni infection. 42,43
y2qo | Eosinophils do appear to play a role in the killing of some helminths, particularly those with tissue-migratory stages. Larval stages of many of the intestinal helminths, including Strongyloides, Nippostrongylus, and Ascaris
1piq | species, migrate through the lungs or skin on their way to the gastrointestinal tract. Although treatment with anti-IL- 5 antibody had no effect on primary infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis in mice, recovery of worms from the lungs after challenge infection was increased in anti-IL-5-treated mice compared with that in control ani- mals.44 The most conclusive in vivo evidence for the role of eosinophils in helminth killing comes from experiments with diffusion chambers containing infective Strongy- loides stercoralis larvae implanted in the subcutaneous tis- sue of mice. Not only were eosinophils the only cells that accumulated in the chamber concomitant with larval killing,45,46 but such killing could be prevented by means of inhibition of eosinophil migration into the chamber or treatment of the mice with anti-IL-5 antibody.45-47
7fqw | In Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection in mice, immature worms develop in the brain before migrating to the lungs. Prolonged survival of intracranial worms resulting in a larger parasite burden in the lungs has been demonstrated in normal mice treated with anti-IL-5 anti- body,48 as well as in IL-5 receptor «-deficient mice,49 which is again consistent with a role for eosinophils in tissue-based larval killing.
rhaz | Animal models of protective immunity to the exclu- sively tissue-dwelling nematode Onchocerca species fur- ther support this hypothesis. In diffusion chamber studies of infective larval survival in immune mice, eosinophils were the only cells that accumulated in the chambers at the time of larval killing.50 Furthermore, similar to the results with Strongyloides species larvae, eosinophil lar- val contact was necessary for larval destruction to occur.50 In a different murine model system, mice infect- ed with Onchocerca lienalis depleted of eosinophils (but not macrophages or neutrophils) with mAb showed delayed clearance of primary infection and abrogation of resistance to secondary infection.51
wak1 | Overall, despite the prevailing dogma, the animal mod- els do not strongly support an indispensable role for eosinophils in immunity to most helminth parasites in vivo.
wtfz | Human studies
qy1i | In human subjects with onchocerciasis, the picture is somewhat more complex. Some studies of in vitro cytokine production in response to parasite antigens have demonstrated increased levels of IL-5 production by PBMCs from putatively immune individuals living in areas endemic for onchocerciasis in comparison with infected individuals,52 whereas others have detected no difference in parasite antigen-induced IL-5 production between these groups.53 The most compelling associa- tion between eosinophilia and protective immunity in human subjects comes from the elegant posttreatment reinfection studies in schistosomiasis that demonstrated a direct relationship between the lack of reinfection and the level of peripheral blood eosinophils in patients from areas endemic for both S mansoni and S haematobium infections.33,34
1k9e | Mechanism of eosinophil-mediated killing of helminth parasites

Interestingly, evi- dence suggests that there might be significant differences in the susceptibility to and mechanisms of eosinophil- mediated killing between different life-cycle stages of the same parasite. 54,55 Unlike protozoa, helminths are too big to be engulfed by phagocytes and can only be killed by these cells when the latter have been activated by products of the adaptive immune response.
