        "content": "bgre | page. The maps of Delaware and Rhode Island covered as much paper space as did the maps of Maine and Pennsylvania. Optically, then, the state maps repeated the same cartographic designs that initially had been reserved for the national map. Like the national map, the state map turned on a binary structure of territorial representation, privileging the state's visual outline over its verbal identification, its geographical over its political anatomy, its interior over its exterior relations.\n57lp | United States atlas maps here seem to confirm the Federalist and Antifederalist fear that even those writing systems that ceased to subordinate the reading experience to an exclusively alphabetical order were still incapable of representing the idea of a new nation-state in immediate and unambiguous terms. While the image of the national map seemed to uphold the constitutional principle of checks and balances (maps represented states optically in equal terms), the state map appeared to undercut the Federalist ideal of national unity by projecting the thirteen or more states as separate nations and unrelated to the larger union. The pictorial rhetoric of the national map failed to offer a design that established a hierarchical relationship between the union and state. Unable to give precedence to either unit, the medium of the map potentially undercuts its symbolic power by signifying opposite values: even as its visual rhetoric could serve as a tool of national integration, it also could promote the union's disintegration.\nukth | The ambiguity surrounding the image of the national map grew out of the post-Revolutionary debates over the issue of statehood. Federalists, Antifederalists, and local patriots like Thomas Jefferson were equally invested in the rhetorical trope of the national map, but for very different reasons. If we turn to the constitutional debate first, the national map appeared in the two opposing literatures-John Jay's Federalist Number Two and the Agrippa Letters by James Winthrop-that were influencing both public opinion and the text of the Constitution itself. Jay invoked the map as a metaphor in order to persuade his audience of the Republic's natural predisposition to unity. As if he were reading one of the schoolbook maps, Jay traces out the geographical body of the new nation-state:\nkpvt | It has often given me pleasure to observe, that independent America was not composed of detached and distant territories, but that one connected, fertile, wide-spreading country was the portion of our western sons of liberty. Providence has in a particular manner blessed it with a variety of soils and productions, and watered it with innumer-\njie2 | able streams, for the delight and accommodation of its inhabitants. A succession of navigable waters forms a kind of chain round its borders, as if to bind it together.\nd0ik | In Jay's word map, natural boundaries become indistinguishable from the artificially imposed political ones. In a move that anticipates Fichte's call for the \"external frontiers\" of the state to become the \"internal frontiers\" of the citizen, Jay transforms his cartographic vision of connectedness into a vision of cultural uniformity: \"With equal pleasure I have as often taken notice, that Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people-a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs.\" Implicit in his word map is the dialectical assumption that, by mapping the territory of the nation, the latter's inventory consisting of language, religion, and custom becomes inflected by the terms of the national map. Just as the word map upholds the imaginary fusion of \"one connected country to one united people,\" Jay suggests that in order for Americans to imagine the United States they would have to interweave two different linguistic systems: if English was the language spoken by the \"people,\" the word map emerged as the second language of \"the country.\"\n0x0s | The motive of Jay's deferral to geographical literacy is his desire to shorten the enormous distance separating many of the new Republic's constitutive parts. Jay's word map seeks to deflect the Antifederalist argument that, as a federal union that models itself upon the classical republic, the United States would be ungovernable because of its over-extended size. Geographical dimension was the standard argument made by Antifederalists like James Winthrop, who invoked the image of the national map to dismantle the Federalist argument of unity. \"The idea of an uncompounded republic, on an average, one thousand miles in length, and eight hundred in breadth, and containing six millions of white inhabitants all reduced to the same standard of morals, or habits,\n4exe | and of laws, is in itself an absurdity, and contrary to the whole experience of mankind.\" For Winthrop, the new nation's geography was politically debilitating, and the national map was the proof demonstrating the flaw in the Federalists' argument. It illustrated in certain terms how the geographical or, rather, natural dimensions of the United States would undermine the union's political structure and seriously impede the formation of a republican government. Because large distances separated the states from each other, it would prohibit political participation inside the union; looking at the national map revealed that distance would prevent the equal application of federal power, hindering the union's task to supervise the new citizens or to reconcile federal and state interests.\n0myz | But, while both Jay and Winthrop cited the national map in the forensic sense as proof of the feasibility or unfeasibility of a greater continental polity, the map's rhetorical clout had already become seriously defused in the writings of local patriots like Thomas Jefferson. His Notes on the State of Virginia, seventeen eighty-five reveals how, through the practice of cartographic writing, the state of Virginia emerged as a geopolitical construct sharing the identical symbolic and discursive attributes that Webster, Morse, and the authors of the Federalist papers ascribed to the national map.\nxh3i | From the start, Jefferson locates the Notes inside the map image of Virginia; he opens his first query with the verbal recitation of the \"Boundaries of Virginia,\" which corresponded to a manuscript map that had accompanied the original draft. Acknowledging that both his own notes and map drawings might be compromised, Jefferson grounds the authority of his Notes in two specific cartographic texts. When he states in his fourth query, \"For the particular geography of our mountains I must refer to Fry and Jefferson's map of Virginia; and to Evans's analysis of his map of America for a more philosophical view of them,\" Jefferson refers the reader to his father's Map of the Most Inhabited Part of Virginia, seventeen fifty-three and the mapmaker's manual Geographical, Historical, Political, Philosophical, and Mechanical Essays, seventeen fifty-five by Lewis Evans.\nsyiw | In the chapter \"On Rivers\" Jefferson presents yet another argument for the way in which post-Revolutionary Americans embraced the map as a writing system superior to the English language and conventional literary forms, in this case the practice of note-taking and verbal description. Before describing the rivers of Virginia, Jefferson deliberately cautions the reader against his verbal efforts, because \"an inspection of a map of Virginia, will give a better idea of the geography of its rivers, than any description in writing.\" Jefferson encourages readers to consult maps rather than his own text because, unlike any other form of \"description in writing,\" only maps are capable of communicating the idea of rivers in ways that normal language could not-immediately and yet mediated, undistorted and yet artificially represented. Ever wary of language as a means of communication, Jefferson indicates that in order to ensure the proper representation of the state of Virginia he must defer his own writing to the signs and script of cartographic writing.",
