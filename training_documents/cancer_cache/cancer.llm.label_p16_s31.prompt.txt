You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ccpt | 5.2.6. Spatially-Resolved Imaging of Platinum Metallodrugs in 3D Spheroids
0fpw | Driven by the fact that tumor penetration of a metallodrug is a crucial step that has to be studied in order to better understand the tumoral cell's response, Theiner et al. aimed to apply LA-ICP-MS to study this parameter in two types of tumoral spheroids: colon HCT116 and ovarian CH1/PA-1, exposed to three Pt (IV) compounds. Spheroids derived from HCT116 and CH1/PA-1 were grown in U-bottom 96-well plates at densities of 2000 and 10,000 cells/well, respectively. Using LA-ICP-MS, it was possible to detect the accumulation of the Pt (IV) compounds in specific areas of the spheroids. As can be seen in Figure 5, in the HCT116 spheroids, the Pt enrichment of the three compounds was observed in the periphery and the core, while in CH1/PA-1 spheroids, the accumulation occurred primarily in the periphery (compounds 1 and 2) and in the central region (compound 1). The distribution of compound 3 (satraplatin) in the CH1/PA-1 spheroids, did not follow a particular pattern. These findings showed that LA-ICP-MS may be used to analyze the spatial distribution of Pt in heterogeneous structures such as multicellular tumor spheroids [74].

lhkq | 5.2.7. Single-Spheroid Metabolomics
82ju | Despite being the subject of several studies, the mechanisms of action of some of the metallodrugs in clinical evaluation are still not fully understood. Studying the metabolome of tumoral cells after incubation with these metallodrugs could be a way of elucidating their anti-tumoral action. Rusz et al. tested spheroids on two different metallodrugs with distinct modes of action on colorectal cancer (HCT116): oxaliplatin and the ruthenium complex KP1339 under clinical trials [76].
y2qo | Spheroids were grown in ultra-low attachment U-bottom 96-well plates at a den- sity of 3000 cells/well. The spheroids metabolome was assessed 24h after exposure to 20 µM and 200 µM of oxaliplatin and KP1339, respectively. In the KP1339-treated samples, 19 metabolites were significantly downregulated compared with only six metabolites in the oxaliplatin-treated samples [76]. These findings were correlated to what was seen in the monolayer culture, where oxaliplatin demonstrated significantly milder effects than KP1339 [190]. The pathway enrichment analysis indicated that oxaliplatin exposure (Figure 6a) altered the purine metabolism and pyrimidine synthesis, being consistent with its established mode of action of DNA targeting, as well as pathways associated with redox stress, such as glutathione metabolism, biosynthesis of coenzyme <LATEX>\mathrm { A } ,</LATEX> and nicoti- namide metabolism [76,191,192]. Furthermore, this work allowed for elucidating the hypothesis that oxaliplatin was also involved in ribosome biogenesis stress [76,192]. On the other hand, KP1339 (Figure 6b) had a distinct mode of action, which resulted in different metabolic perturbations. This drug affected the pathways associated with redox stress, such as glutathione metabolism and purine metabolism, but also unfolded protein response, such as glycerophospholipid metabolism and several amino-acid-metabolism-related path- ways [76]. Overall, Rusz et al. were able to develop a protocol for metabolomics studies in tumor spheroid samples, allowing for the comparison of various conditions, such as incubation with different metallodrugs [76].

rhaz | These examples underline the need for incorporating cancer 3D models in the preclini- cal testing of metallodrugs, which can support, or not, the results obtained in 2D models. This combined approach can enhance the accurate in vitro assessment of the anti-tumor capabilities of metallodrugs, thereby potentially increasing the success of the process of drug exploration and advancement.
wak1 | 6. Conclusions
wtfz | The majority of clinically tested drugs fail during clinical trials due to inadequate ef- fectiveness or excessive toxicity, resulting in a significant financial loss [193]. As mentioned previously, this occurs in part due to the use of drug testing platforms that are unable to fully represent the tumor and the in vivo microenvironment [194].
qy1i | Different models such as 2D and 3D cellular platforms, and animal models are neces- sary for the proper preclinical study of metallodrugs for anti-cancer treatments. Nonethe- less, most of the metal compounds are still not tested in 3D models. Additionally, as far as we know, the few studies that incorporate 3D models use mostly spheroids. We envisage that in the future this paradigm may change and that 3D models become a regular tool in metallodrug preclinical studies. In addition to the most commonly used spheroids, more advanced platforms, such as organoids and tumoroids, have the potential to make these studies even more relevant by introducing multiple cell types. Complex models such as organ-on-a-chip are already used in drug toxicity assessments for predic- tive evaluations [156], and tumoroids could even be used in the future as platforms to verify which metallodrug will be more adequate for each patient, covering an important aspect of precision medicine. Tumoroids might also be used to determine whether some subpopulations are more likely than others to respond differently or have side effects to certain metallodrugs depending on their genetic makeup [195]. This is already the case for cystic fibrosis, in which concerted efforts in several European projects have developed and validated intestinal organoids as a clinical tool [196]. All in all, the potential for 3D models as valuable platforms for anti-cancer metallodrug testing has already been proven, and drug development could benefit greatly in the future from the introduction of 3D models as tools in preclinical studies.
