You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

o2kr | 'Colonia' Land and Housing Market Performance and the Impact of Lot Title Regularisation in Texas
v6sk | [Paper first received, September 2003; in final form, March 2004]
1wj6 | Summary. This article analyses performance of the land market in several irregular settlements (colonias) outside Rio Grande City, Starr County, Texas. Specifically, it explores the impact upon land prices of a major title 'regularisation' initiative to clear property titles of very poor households undertaken by the Community Resources Group (CRG) Receivership Program at the behest of the Texas State government between 1995 and 2002. Land price data and trends are analysed using a major CRG database of over 1400 price records and files, complemented by a questionnaire survey of over 260 households applied by the research team as part of an evaluation of the CRG Program. The data show that prices are relatively 'flat' in real terms over time and that, while there was a spike in prices during the early 1990s, there does not appear to have been any significant increase since regularisation. The data suggest that prices appear to be shaped more by socially determined criteria associated with the developers themselves, rather than by settlement characteristics, location, etc. Regularisation of land title appears to make little difference to land market performance and, while colonias are a vehicle for investment for low-income groups, the rate of return compared with other segments of the (formal) property market is very low. These findings are compared with similar work for less developed countries and also challenge those theories that argue in favour of land regularisation as a means to improve land market performance and integration of the urban poor.
936l | Informal Land Markets and 'The Mystery of Capital'
06yq | Scholars and analysts who study rapid urban- isation in less developed countries are fam- iliar with 'regularisation' programmes, understanding these as policy interventions to provide services and legal property titles to settlements that will often have developed illegally, either through squatting or by il- legal land sales and development. In many
dpv6 | contemporary Latin American cities, rapid population growth in the second half of the 20th century led to anything between 25 and 60 per cent of the built-up area having origi- nated as irregular residential settlement (Gilbert and Ward, 1985; Gilbert, 1996). To- day, such regularisation policies have at- tained conventional wisdom status throughout the region and come in two forms: first, those that focus upon extending
8r5j | 2622
2taz | essential infrastructure (power, water, drain- age, public lighting, street paving, etc.) to areas that lack them; while elsewhere a se- cond approach is to accord priority to legalis- ing the illegal by converting de facto ownership into full de jure legal title.1 Some- times the two programmes go hand-in-hand and, although full title has rarely been an absolute requirement in order to secure government intervention (Varley, 1985, 1987), it usually helps, if only because it brings people onto the property registry, pro- viding a basis for on-going cost recovery of (service) consumption charges and for the levying of property taxes, albeit at low and modest rates, thereby making urban develop- ment programmes more sustainable (Ward, 2003a). Moreover, to the extent that planning controls can only be exercised effectively where the property market is formalised, title regularisation forms an increasingly import- ant component in programmes to improve urban management and administration (Jones and Ward, 1994).
o3ya | In Latin America, such policy scenarios are neither novel nor controversial, such that in the region today the principal questions usually hinge around two issues: first, how to recover the costs of regularisation without imposing an excessive burden upon the poor, inadvertently forcing their displacement. And, secondly, how best to prioritise pro- grammes given the large backlog of service requirements in older settlements as well as more newly created ones that continue to proliferate, notwithstanding tighter govern- ment controls and greater political willing- ness to prevent developers from continuing their egregious land development and lot sales. Important background variables in the Latin American policy environment are democratisation, together with economic lib- eralisation and greater global integration. Political and economic opening have had a profound impact not only upon socioeco- nomic conditions, but also upon the housing process and the nature of land market per- formance. Time-worn practices of patron- client links between politicians and the urban poor whereby settlement services and legal
r5il | recognition were a quid pro quo for party political (or individual) support are largely a thing of the past; as is the existence of an overarching (patrimonial) state seeking to provide a broad range of social benefits to the poor. Today's government bureaucracies are slimmer and programmes are more care- fully targeted to those that need them most. Social services may also increasingly be con- tracted out to privately organised enterprises and to non-government organisations that have become a virtual arm of the state (Ward, 2005). The prevailing orthodoxy is that, wherever possible, the market(s) should provide, such that the primary task of policy- makers is effectively to 'prime' the market, or at the very least to make it work more equitably by generating jobs, cutting out red tape that frustrates entrepreneurial spirit, en- gaging the private sector in home-building programmes for the lower end of the market and providing serviced lots at affordable lev- els, etc. Thus, from the 1980s onwards, the policy paradigm has changed: initially to- wards greater active sponsorship and support for self-help housing and informal settlement initiatives; and latterly to more effective regulation and improved administration that would reduce waste, enhance cost recovery and provide greater incentives for the poor to become a part of the market place and be better placed to fend for themselves (Ward, 2005).
5gui | Notwithstanding a growing recognition of some of the positive elements of informality (Roy and AlSayyad, 2003), for those wedded to the orthodoxy of formal urban land devel- opment, the very idea of informal title and property land markets remains anathema. Therefore, numerous arguments are re- hearsed in favour of titling programmes. First, planners and public officials, for whom the formal legal system is the one that they know best and work towards, are often un- easy with 'plural' systems and alternative property rights that are unfamiliar and which threaten and jibe with the sanctity of private property. A second argument stems from the assertion that only within a formally or- ganised property market can a true market
82qc | economy flourish (McLaughlin and de Soto, 1994). A third argument is the idea that legal title provides security against eviction and displacement, and provides the necessary in- centives for home improvement and consoli- dation. As Mclaughlin and de Soto argue
ls7d | When people have formalized titles they feel their property is under their legal con- trol and therefore have the incentive to invest their intelligence and work in im- proving it (McLaughlin and de Soto, 1994, p. 308).
tzt3 | They further add that when there is no formal title to provide security of tenure, planning horizons are shorter and there are no incen- tives to protect and improve property. Fourthly, it is argued that service providers cannot, or will not, introduce services until legalisation and full property entitlement are in place and secure. A fifth assertion is that tenure offers people a new source of col- lateral (legal property), thereby leveraging access to credit. Sixthly, there is an ideologi- cal component to regularisation, insofar as formal title 'integrates' the poor into the urban citizenry, inculcating a belief system that respects free markets, supports democ- racy and engenders respect for, and partici- pation in, the tax and regulatory bases of city management.
t8vv | In actual fact, research in less developed countries has revealed many of these argu- ments to be fallacious. Far from being ex- cluded and sluggish, the informal land market is quite dynamic, with free exchange (sales) of land and dwelling units (Jones and Ward, 1994). This is because the very infor- mality and poorly serviced nature of the land makes housing affordable in the first place. Moreover, far from being outside the market as some would argue, informal housing is actually firmly commodified within the mar- ket-place, albeit a less regulated one (Burgess, 1982). Nor is it axiomatic that only full legality and secure property titles prime the market-place as McLaughlan and de Soto argue: in both formal and informal land mar- kets regulation and restrictions may also severely inhibit property development, as
qvnu | 2623
kggw | well as preventing the creation of activities such as renting, the creation of jobs and income-earning opportunities, sometimes re- ferred to by international aid organisations as 'urban productivity' (Ward, 1999). Indeed, greater regulation in the formal market often severely restricts its operation-hence the somewhat perverse and simultaneous argu- ment by these same authors for the need to deregulate. Nor does it appear that legal title per se raises land prices significantly (Jones et al., 1994), although some assert otherwise (see Legoretta, 1994). As for the poor using the property as collateral to secure credit for home improvements, this would appear to be primarily a middle-class projection, since most low-income households eschew formal credit (Riofrio, 1998). Even though NGOs and government departments have moved to- wards micro-credit support in recent years, they often do not require full legal title as a criterion for a loan (Jones and Mitlin, 1999; Cosgrove, 1999).
xrd1 | This research notwithstanding, within the US and elsewhere many still believe that clean property title is an essential element to effective participation in the market-place. Only by holding legal title to their land can homesteaders become true players and beneficiaries of the market: the nub of the 'Mystery of Capital' extolled by de Soto and his adherents (de Soto, 2000; McLaughlin and de Soto, 1994). They argue that by hav- ing full legal title to their land and home, property values will no longer be depressed by illegality, and lots and homes can be freely traded in the market-place, making people more mobile. In short, regularisation and legalisation enhance bootstraps pro- grammes, foster mobility, help to build wealth and allow people to leverage capital using their property as collateral. However, such broad-brush propositions beg many questions and there is a rising body of re- search that questions these assertions from both the perspective of theoretical logic, as well as empirical practice (Gilbert, 2002; Varley, 2002). At best such assertions are overdrawn and at worst they are gravely misleading.

7toz | This article analyses the intersection be- tween land titling programmes and land mar- ket behaviour and performance. However, unlike other research that derives almost ex- clusively from less developed countries, this research reports on similar low-income land and housing markets that exist in the US, analysing specifically the phenomenon of peri-urban 'irregular' settlements outside Rio Grande City (RGC), located in Starr County, on the Texas-Mexico border. Drawing upon detailed land market research and survey data collected as part of a formal evaluation of a major land title programme in Rio Grande City, we analyse and track land price changes in several low-income self-managed housing neighbourhoods for the period 1970-2001. This allows us to evaluate the impact of land titling programmes upon a number of possible outcomes for market per- formance: land and home affordability; and the opportunity and extent of wealth creation among impoverished households. The article further explores the apparent determinants of land price differences and changes over time, and compares conventional explanations that attribute land values to variables such as location, level of servicing and settlement layout, with alternative explanations that give greater credence to what we will call 'social determinants' such as the nature of lot sale and development entrained by individual developers, and their social relations with low-income populations.
j346 | At this lowest end of the land market, we conclude that land prices are fixed socially more by the idiosyncrasy of the developer, and not by differences in location or level of servicing. And while it may still be too early to be definitive, the evidence and prima facie findings that we present here suggest that there is little positive direct relationship be- tween land title regularisation, rising prop- erty values and turnover of lots through the market-place. For a raft of other reasons, the market is 'stunted' and, while land titling programmes do change the status of the way in which land is perceived and held by low- income residents, by itself title does little either to enhance directly valorisation and
v8uq | wealth creation, or to shape demand and property transfers. The lack of demand and the minimal opportunities for selling one's lot and home in the market-place, effectively impede any significant opportunities for wealth creation. True, colonia residence of- fers important use value to the populations (i.e. as a place of residence albeit at high social costs), but to date the ability of low-in- come (and now) legal property owners to capture any significant increase in the ex- change value is severely inhibited. And this bears little or no relation to whether or not the property is titled.
x972 | Colonias in Texas and the Land Titling Programme in Starr County
cwrw | Before analysing the specifics of land devel- opment and land market practices in the study areas, it is important to outline briefly the nature of irregular settlement develop- ment and self-help in Texas and elsewhere in the US, not least since few researchers are aware of the widespread existence of settle- ments that are so closely akin to their Latin American and Mexican counterparts. In Texas alone, an estimated one-half a million people, almost exclusively of Mexican ori- gin, live in some 1600 plus settlements or colonias as they are more generally known (TWDB, www.twdb.state.tx.us; Ward 1999); while significant additional numbers of peo- ple also live in colonia-type sub-divisions in other border states such as New Mexico and Arizona (Ward and Koerner, 2004). While significantly different in many important re- spects from their Mexican counterparts (not discussed here, see Ward, 2003b, for further details), the formation of these settlements responds to a similar logic-namely, rapid urban and population growth, a context of little or no public housing supply and low state support for other low-income housing opportunities. Although illegal, they are ef- fectively the only route that poor households have if they are to embark upon home-own- ership, build a home and create a family patrimony, all within a context of poverty and low-wage economies, without access to
