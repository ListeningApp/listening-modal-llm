Hypertensive heart disease is primarily characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial dilatation, myocardial fibrosis, diastolic before systolic dysfunction, and increased incidence of coronary artery disease, both epicardial and microvascular. A comprehensive evaluation of myocardial hypertrophy also allows a proper follow-up of patients on antihypertensive therapy, as the regression of LVH with antihypertensive treatment reduces the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality. Morphological and functional changes of the myocardium can be followed through every stage of hypertensive heart disease, even in the subclinical phase, which is important to prevent further complications and development of heart failure with both preserved and reduced ejection fraction. Myocardial strain abnormalities, important in the early detection of myocardial damage, were observed in the majority of the patients. This is significant as it was shown that global longitudinal strain and its deterioration are associated with major adverse cardiovascular events even in patients with asymptomatic hypertensive heart disease. Left atrial enlargement is a common finding in patients with HHD and is an independent factor\nhntf | associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and also the possibility of atrial fibrillation. The signs of incipient interstitial fibrosis are accessible to cardiac magnetic resonance through sophisticated tissue characterization techniques, mainly T one mapping and ECV, and are also a common finding even in patients with the recent onset of hypertension. This is important as in the subclinical phase of the disease this type of fibrosis is still reversible with proper and forehand treatment. In the advanced stage with both focal and diffuse fibrosis, myocardial scar quantification can differentiate those patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death, as myocardial scar burden is significantly associated with adverse cardiovascular events, even in patients with preserved ejection fraction.\n99fo | rate (less than thirty milliliters per minute per one point seven three meter squared), which makes this examination limitative in patients with chronic kidney disease. Claustrophobia is also an important patient-related limitation that should be taken into consideration.\ny5r7 | Ten. Conclusions\nlrry | A wide range of clinical and especially subclinical presentations of hypertensive heart disease is often hard to discover, challenging to evaluate properly and incorporate into a proper real-life clinical scenario. The majority of these changes are accessible to the frequently performed diagnostic modalities in an advanced stage of the disease, with an already established high risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Cardiac magnetic resonance is a non-invasive, sophisticated diagnostic tool that can provide more detailed information on left ventricle volumes, tissue characterization, and scar quantification with excellent reproducibility and less inter-observer variability in patients with hypertensive heart disease. It can detect subtle changes in ventricular mass and volume parameters, access overall and regional LV function, and estimate the presence of focal or diffuse myocardial fibrosis. Although it is not recommended as a golden standard in hypertensive heart disease due to its poor availability and relatively low cost-benefit ratio, cardiac magnetic resonance is indicated if there is a severe, progressive left ventricular hypertrophy, an inconclusive echocardiogram or poor acoustic window, and a mismatch between clinical evaluation, ECG, and echocardiography. Additionally, it is of great importance in estimating the positive effects of treatment, as well as an optimal tool in clinical trials. Further studies will bring more information about the benefits of cardiac magnetic resonance in patients with hypertensive heart disease, leading to the more pronounced implementation of this important imaging modality into everyday practice.\n```",
