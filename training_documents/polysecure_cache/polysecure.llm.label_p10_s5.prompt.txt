You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

lrry | GLOSSARY
hvhm | COMPERSION
863b | The state of happiness, joy or pleasure that comes from delighting in other peo- ple's happiness. In nonmonogamy, this term is more specifically used to refer to the positive feelings experienced when your lover is having a positive experience with one of their other lovers.
fj24 | CONSENSUAL NONMONOGAMY (CNM)
uz3c | The practice of having multiple sexual and/or romantic partners at the same time, where all people involved are aware of this relationship arrangement and consent to it. CNM can include, but is not limited to, polyamory, swinging, open marriage, open relationship, solo polyamory and relationship anarchy.
d5bi | METAMOUR
ba4l | Two people who share a partner, but are not romantically or sexually involved with each other. For example, if you have a partner who also has a spouse, you and their spouse would be metamours, or if you have a boyfriend and a girlfriend who are not involved with each other, the two of them would be metamours to each other.
ffx8 | MONOGAMY
s6su | The practice of having one sexual or romantic partner at a time.
y219 | MONONORMATIVITY
06ht | This term was coined by Pieper and Bauer to refer to the societal dominant as- sumptions regarding the naturalness and normalcy of monogamy, where political, popular and psychological narratives typically present monogamy as the superior, most natural or morally correct way to do relationships.
v3r2 | POLYSATURATED
nv42 | The point at which the thought of another relationship leaves one feeling more ex- hausted than excited. When a polyamorous person has as many significant and
xags | insignificant others as they think they can handle at a given time.
jc47 | INTRODUCTION
ko3c | I'M WRITING THIS BOOK because I believe in love. Again and again, I have experi- enced the power of love to heal, to bridge, to connect and to awaken, as well as the trauma that ensues in its absence. In many ways my life is centered in not just be- lieving in love, but in being love. That is, emanating love as best as I can, moment by moment, interaction by interaction. I am confident that many of you reading this also believe in love and that it is the desire to strengthen and deepen your love rela- tionships that has led you to pick up this book.
xek3 | My journey to writing this book officially began within the last year, but it really began 40 years ago, with my first attachment experiences as an infant and the mul- tiple attachment ruptures that followed. A third-generation New Yorker, I grew up in the housing projects of Brooklyn in a neighborhood well-acquainted with vio- lence and a family considerably impacted by multiple divorces, multi-generational traumas, sexual abuse, substance abuse, mental illness and interpersonal discord. These experiences had an impact that was challenging for many years, affecting all areas of my life, but they also created a powerful determination in me to not only thrive and be resilient in the face of my early childhood hardships but to also con- tribute to the healing and transformation of others who have been impacted by ne- glect, abuse, trauma and poverty. In wanting to understand how to heal the mind, body and heart, I began to study everything I could, from the spiritual to the aca- demic. I devoted my life to the investigation of how we change, evolve and develop, how we can communicate healthily and effectively, how we can heal and become safely embodied in the wake of trauma, how we can unshackle our hearts from our survival-based reactivity and defenses, and how we can liberate our minds from bigotry, ignorance and internalized oppression.
bbpr | As you can probably imagine, this led me to have a diverse professional life that crossed over several seemingly disparate intersections-I was both a socially en- gaged Buddhist and a somatic bodyworker, a genocide researcher and a therapist. About a decade into my healing practice with individuals, I began to expand my
5zyf | psychotherapy practice to include couples work. In the earlier stages of building up my client base of couples, there was one particular week in which three different couples' sessions included one of the partners bringing up their desire to explore polyamory for the first time. Needless to say, this caught my attention. I knew about polyamory from a personal perspective, but professionally I was at a loss. Nonmonogamy was barely mentioned in any of my training and when it was men- tioned, it was usually dismissed or disparaged. One of the couples I was working with mentioned that they were reading the book Sex at Dawn: The Prehistoric Origins of Modern Sexuality, in which authors Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha discuss the evolution of monogamy as being relatively recent in human history. So, like any decent (and underinformed) therapist I quickly bought the book to better support them in our work together. To my surprise, reading Sex at Dawn turned out to be a personal awakening. Within the pages of the book I found descriptions of myself I didn't know existed and desires that had lain dormant for years. As a bisexual woman, I was often confused about how to reconcile my sexuality within a monog- amous relationship with either a man or a woman. Even though I already knew a decent amount about polyamory, it was mainly from a second- or third-person per- spective where polyamory was something you or they did. It wasn't until reading Sex at Dawn that I finally identified with polyamory from a first-person perspective, realizing that not only had I already practiced forms of nonmonogamy for years in my late adolescence and early twenties, but that it was also what I felt to be the fullest expression of my love and sexuality now.
9own | This all happened while I was in a monogamous marriage, so immediately throwing off the relational restraints of monogamy to more fully express my capac- ity and desire to love more than one person was not something that I could just do the very next day. But the personal realizations that came from reading the book impacted not only myself, but also my marriage and my family. Thankfully, after many long walks and talks with my then-husband, he was willing to take on the transition from monogamy to polyamory with me. However, no matter how willing and eager we were to take on the transition, we were both mostly unaware of the
bqfb | irreversible changes that lay ahead. We experienced changes to each of us individ- ually, changes to our marriage, immense growth in each of our capacity to expe- rience more love, honesty, closeness and pleasure, as well as all the changes that resulted from significant losses, heartbreaks and attachment alterations within our own relationship and with family, friends and other partners. At that time there was nothing in the non-monogamy self-help genre that could fully prepare us for every- thing our attachment systems were going through, and like many polyamorous couples we had to forge our own path forward, repeatedly stumbling along the way and learning retrospectively at the expense of ourselves, each other and our other partners.
wwdt | Nothing about my personal journey, professional experiences or transition from monogamy to polyamory has been linear. Unexpectedly, my therapy clients served as my personal catalyst to claiming my own polyamory, which then led me to specialize in working with people practicing nonmonogamy as my primary pro- fessional focus. Today, approximately 75 percent of my clients are nonmonog- amous, and when I'm not working with clients in person or long distance, I spend my professional time speaking and leading workshops on nonmonogamous rela- tionships, trauma, attachment and transformation.
mn1r | Why a Book on Nonmonogamy and Attachment?
5vqw | Romantic relationships in Western society are still fraught with prescriptions and restrictions that inhibit nontraditional expressions of love, and many of us suffer greatly from this. As the landscape of romantic love continues to expand and monogamy is no longer the only possible course of action that a relationship can take, our societal notions, as well as our psychological models of love and part- nership, also need to grow and include relationship structures beyond the monog- amous norm.
meyw | Attachment theory offers an important-even revolutionary-framework for understanding the biological and psychological necessity of being securely bonded to others. The psychological model also allows insight into how disruptions in
2e62 | attachment can create significant challenges in the giving and receiving of the love and affection we so desire with our partners. Research has consistently demon- strated that understanding our different attachment styles and using this knowl- edge to move into more secure functioning with a partner is an important compo- nent in creating fulfilling and sustaining relationships. Attachment theory was developed in the 1960s by British psychologist John Bowlby,2 but in the past sev- eral years, it has expanded its reach outside of the academic and therapeutic spheres, becoming more popularized in general public discourse regarding per- sonal healing, parenting, dating, marriages and relationships.
75y3 | Many people who practice ethical nonmonogamy (who often proudly describe themselves as relationship geeks) have been drawn to attachment theory as a way to further enhance their general knowledge about relationships. The theory is also more specifically used to support nonmonogamous people in comprehending and working with the distinct challenges and patterns that arise when someone has multiple partners. While therapeutic practices based on attachment theory have be- come some of the most effective and well-researched modalities for couples ther- apy, how it applies to nonmonogamous relationships can be unclear. To no sur- prise, the majority of resources and advice available on how to create securely at- tached romantic relationships assume monogamy. Whether intentionally or not, these resources encourage highly mononormative practices, often leaving people who are nonmonogamous at a loss in how to create secure bonds with their mul- tiple partners.
s2g2 | Several years ago, I was in a polyamorous relationship with a partner named Corey. At that time, I lived with my husband and our child, and Corey lived in a nearby town with his primary partner. One day Corey admitted to having an anx- ious attachment style. We both wanted our relationship to be a close and con- nected one, but we also knew that living together and blending our families was not in the cards for us, so we began to wonder how we could establish more se- cure functioning together without the boost in security that comes from either liv- ing with a partner, being primaries, sharing finances or having a child together.
q1q2 | We began to listen to an audio version of one of the better books on attach- ment, eagerly jumping ahead to the section instructing us on the specific things we could do to build secure attachment in our romantic relationship. Being someone who is a minority in several areas of my life, I was already habitually accustomed to having to reinterpret information and advice, automatically translating the typical normative discourses in whatever I was reading to garner any and all kernels of wisdom that I could actually apply to my own life. Corey, however, was not used to having to code switch like this. Taking a more literal read on the chapter, he was left discouraged and concluded that he and I would never achieve secure attach- ment since we were unable to do over half of the suggested attachment behaviors. I was initially surprised by this because when I read the very same section I had been hopeful. When I paused to consider why I had such a different take on the very same chapter, I realized that my optimism didn't actually come from the au- thor's encouragement, but because I was quick to sift the useful from the useless and the relevant from the irrelevant to our nonmonogamous context. But Corey's perspective was illuminating for me because he was right-if we couldn't do the majority of the advised activities, what were we really left with?
cb7r | Around the same time, several of my nonmonogamous clients also began ex- pressing similar grievances. Like me and Corey, they wanted secure attachment with all of their partners, but they felt demoralized and even pathologized when they read about attachment. They were unable to find themselves or fit themselves into the mononormativity of the literature on attachment, since they were unable to partake in many of the behaviors that experts recommend as required for secure relationships. Even though I was able to translate, sift through and reframe what I was reading from the mainstream books and audio programs in order to apply it to my polyamorous relationships and nonmonogamous clients, I realized that this didn't mean that others-even highly intelligent others like Corey or my clients- could or would do the same. And they shouldn't have to, because secure attach- ment is not just for the monogamous. So, I took on Corey's and my clients' under- standable discouragement as a personal and professional challenge. I promised
68xu | Corey that I would at least come up with a list of things that we could do to cultivate a secure attachment that didn't require us to live together, be exclusive or even be each other's primary partner. That list led into a talk, which has since led to this book. Thank you, Corey! Thank you, clients!
hd35 | Many nonmonogamous people have secure, loving, healthy relationships with multiple partners, and this book is my attempt at lifting the lens of monogamy from attachment research so that we can apply all this wonderful knowledge about human connection and bonding to a nonmonogamous context. As far as my edi- tors and I know, this is the first book to explicitly translate the principles of attach- ment theory to nonmonogamous relationships.
