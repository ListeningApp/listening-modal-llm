You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

o9sc | However, there are cases where the Kok effect is not always associated with photorespiration. The change in the slope was occasionally observed to be present under high-CO2 conditions (Sharp et al., 1984), and in <LATEX>\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }</LATEX> leaves and under low-O2 condi- tions albeit to a smaller extent (Yin et al., 2011a). Gong et al. (2015) reported an even lower <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } } : R _ { \mathrm { d k } }</LATEX> ratio in <LATEX>\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }</LATEX> than in <LATEX>C _ { 3 }</LATEX> leaves. Buckley et al. (2017) observed a similar extent of change in the slope under both 21% and 2% O2 conditions for broad- bean (Vicia faba) mature leaves. Nevertheless, the Kok effects reported in the early years (Kok, 1949; Ishii & Schmid, 1981; Sharp et al., 1984) are mostly associated with the abrupt transi- tion in the slope (Fig. 1), whereas the <LATEX>g _ { 5 } - g _ { m }</LATEX> photosynthesis model predicts only a smooth transition (Farquhar & Busch, 2017).
121u | Of the possible mechanisms (Rg, <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { a c t } }</LATEX> and/or <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 }</LATEX> highlighted by Eqns 1-3 that potentially explain the magnitude of the Kok effect (Fig. 2), <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { a c t } }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 }</LATEX> are hard to measure accu- rately by existing equipment, especially at low irradiances along the Kok curve. Also, the pattern of changing <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> in response to <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> is hard to quantify with existing methods. In this study, we will illustrate, using Eqns 1-3, that how <LATEX>R _ { 4 }</LATEX> responds to <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> would have relevance to the Kok effect and in estimating <LATEX>\Phi _ { \mathrm { C O 2 } } .</LATEX> We surmise that if the varying <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> ratio is a major factor accounting for the Kok effect, as stated by Farquhar & Busch (2017), then the magnitude of the Kok effect should be associ- ated with the <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> ratio, regardless of how the variation of this ratio is created. To this end, we designed an experiment in which we used various <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> concentrations or temperatures to generate varying relative amounts of photorespiration, that is, various <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> ratios. Based on a modelling analysis of the

We demonstrate that our results help to identify common threads explaining seemingly contradictory findings among previous studies on
