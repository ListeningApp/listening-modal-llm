        "content": "qt9q | ENTROPY OF THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR: Two\nfkn1 | Classically, a harmonic oscillator at temperature T has entropy\nxqgo | S equals K times the natural logarithm of T plus C. Writing C equals negative natural logarithm of T subscript zero for some constant T subscript zero, this gives S equals K times the natural logarithm of T divided by T subscript zero. Dimensional analysis implies T subscript zero must have units of temperature!\nztv3 | But what is this temperature T subscript zero? For that we must think harder.\nd6tt | The formula S equals K times the natural logarithm of T plus C is a bit scary from the viewpoint of dimensional analysis. We usually avoid working with the logarithm of a dimensionful quantity, like the natural logarithm of T, because it transforms in a funny way when we change our units. But if we write C equals negative natural logarithm of T subscript zero then we get S equals K times the natural logarithm of T divided by T subscript zero, and we see the solution to our problem! If T subscript zero has units of temperature, then T divided by T subscript zero is dimensionless, so the natural logarithm of T divided by T subscript zero does not change at all when we change our units. In other words, now the natural logarithm of T divided by T subscript zero is dimensionless, so S equals K times the natural logarithm of T divided by T subscript zero has units of entropy as it should.\now58 | So, the constant C must equal negative natural logarithm of T subscript zero for some temperature T subscript zero that we can compute for any harmonic oscillator. What is it? We could just compute it. But it is more fun to use dimensional analysis.\nrhnw | What could it depend on? Obviously the mass M, the spring constant K and Boltzmann's constant K. But there is no way to form a quantity with units of temperature from just M, K and K. So we need an extra ingredient.\n78ub | And we have seen this already: to define the entropy of a probability distribution on the Q, P plane and get something with the right units, we need a quantity with units of action! The obvious candidate is Planck's constant H, and this is actually right. The entropy we are after is given by an integral with respect to DP DQ divided by H where H equals H divided by two pi. So, the temperature T subscript zero can depend on H as well as M, K and K.\n49qz | We can compute a quantity with units of temperature from M, K, K and H. The frequency of our oscillator is omega equals K divided by M, and it is a famous fact that it has units of energy. K has units of energy divided by temperature, so H times omega divided by K has units of temperature!\nvw2p | Thus, our temperature T subscript zero must be H times omega divided by K times some dimensionless purely mathematical constant, which I will call one divided by alpha. Alpha must be something like seven or two, or if we are really unlucky, E six six six, though in practice we usually get numbers fairly close to one, not huge or tiny numbers.\njkfz | So, the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator must be\n1jrv | S equals K times the natural logarithm of T divided by T subscript zero equals K times the natural logarithm of alpha times K times T divided by H times omega.\nurci | This is as far as I can get without breaking down and doing some real work. Later we will compute Q.\nzrmd | ENTROPY OF THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR: Three\nvret | We have seen a classical harmonic oscillator with frequency omega has entropy\nurmw | S equals K times the natural logarithm of alpha times K times T divided by H times omega when it is in thermal equilibrium at temperature T.\nhqf9 | Here K is Boltzmann's constant, H is Planck's constant,\n7ahf | and alpha is some dimensionless mathematical constant. We will figure it out later.\n1lig | Even though we do not know alpha, this formula is already very interesting! K times T is known to be the typical energy scale of thermal fluctuations at temperature T. H times omega is the spacing between energy levels of a quantum harmonic oscillator with frequency omega. The ratio K times T divided by H times omega is therefore roughly the number of energy eigenstates in which we may find a quantum harmonic oscillator with high probability when it is at temperature T.\npr1i | Thus, S is roughly K times the logarithm of the number of states that we are likely to find a quantum harmonic oscillator in, when it is at temperature T. This may seem mysterious. After all, we were not trying to do quantum mechanics, much less count quantum states. But there are other examples of this pattern, where the entropy of a classical system in thermal equilibrium at temperature T is roughly K times the logarithm of the number of quantum states that are accessible at temperature T.\n7k5c | We will learn a bit more about this later, when we relate entropy to something called the 'partition function', which can be understood as the 'number of accessible states'. This viewpoint will also explain the constant Q. But now let us calculate this constant.\n14m3 | ENTROPY OF THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR: Four\n8bf1 | A classical harmonic oscillator has energy\nnp7s | P, Q equals P squared divided by two M plus K times Q squared divided by two\nd4te | where P is its momentum, Q its position, M its mass and K its spring constant.\niw5h | At temperature T, the probability density of its momentum and position is the Boltzmann distribution:\n9ogk | E raised to the power of negative beta times E of P, Q divided by P of P, Q equals\nypjv | zero to infinity E raised to the power of negative beta times E of P, Q, DP DQ divided by H\nkegn | where beta equals one divided by K T, K is Boltzmann's constant, and H equals two pi times H is the original 'unreduced' Planck's constant.\npu1o | The oscillator's entropy at temperature T is thus\nt2ag | zero to infinity P of P, Q times the natural logarithm of P of P, Q, DP DQ divided by H\n1a77 | S equals negative K from negative infinity to positive infinity\nkras | Last time we found a formula for the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator ... which includes a mysterious purely mathematical dimensionless constant Q. Now let us figure out alpha.\nktuk | We will grit our teeth and actually do the integral needed to calculate the entropy, but only in one easy case! Combining this with our formula, we will get alpha.\np4za | First, recall the basics. The energy E of P, Q of our harmonic oscillator at momentum P, and position Q determines its Boltzmann distribution at temperature T, which I will call P of P, Q now since the letter P is already being used. Integrating negative P times the natural logarithm of P using the measure DP DQ divided by H we get the Shannon entropy. In physics we multiply this by Boltzmann's constant K to get the Gibbs entropy.\nr437 | ENTROPY OF THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR: Five\nmqfd | We can choose units of length, time, mass and temperature to make a classical harmonic oscillator's mass M, its spring constant K, Boltzmann's constant K and Planck's constant H all equal one.\ng6we | Then at T equals one the Boltzmann distribution of the oscillator is\nb6if | E raised to the power of negative P squared plus Q squared divided by two\ngccv | P of P, Q equals from zero to infinity E raised to the power of negative P squared plus Q squared divided by two, DP DQ equals E raised to the power of negative P squared plus Q squared divided by two\nvi11 | so its entropy is S equals negative integral E raised to the power of negative P squared plus Q squared divided by two times the natural logarithm of E raised to the power of negative P squared plus Q squared divided by two DP DQ from negative infinity to positive infinity\n7apu | Let us do this integral!\nm9ca | Let us compute the Boltzmann distribution P of P, Q and the entropy S. To keep the formulas clean, we will work in units where M equals K equals K equals H equals one, and compute everything at one special temperature: T equals one.\nweud | In this setup H equals two pi, and\nh3u6 | E raised to the power of negative beta E of P, Q equals E raised to the power of negative P squared plus Q squared divided by two\nijlq | is a beautiful Gaussian with integral\natn2 | from zero to infinity E raised to the power of negative P squared plus Q squared divided by two equals two pi.\nubo6 | These two factors of two pi cancel when we compute the denominator of the probability distribution P of P, Q:\nzue6 | DP DQ times two pi times two pi equals one.\nw027 | Thus, we get simply\ncibw | P of P, Q equals E raised to the power of negative P squared plus Q squared divided by two\n8lrx | The entropy of the harmonic oscillator is thus\ne9ut | DP DQ when K equals K equals H equals T equals one. Next let us do this integral.\ntbja | S equals negative integral E raised to the power of negative P squared plus Q squared divided by two times the natural logarithm of E raised to the power of negative P squared plus Q squared divided by two from negative infinity to positive infinity.\n0m6e | ENTROPY OF THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR: Six\ncbgu | When M equals K equals K equals H equals T equals one the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator is\nuzqg | from negative infinity to positive infinity E raised to the power of negative P squared plus Q squared divided by two times the natural logarithm of E raised to the power of negative P squared plus Q squared divided by two DP DQ\nshuh | S equals",
