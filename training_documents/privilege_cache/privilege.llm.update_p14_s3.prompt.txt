You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

Knowledge from the point of view of the unmarked is truly fan- tastic, distorted, and irrational. The only position from which ob- jectivity could not possibly be practiced and honored is the stand- point of the master, the Man, the One God, whose Eye produces, appropriates, and orders all difference. No one ever accused the God of monotheism of objectivity, only of indifference. The god trick is self-identical, and we have mistaken that for creativity and knowledge, omniscience even.
k16v | Positioning is, therefore, the key practice in grounding knowl- edge organized around the imagery of vision, and much Western scientific and philosophic discourse is organized in this way. Posi- tioning implies responsibility for our enabling practices. It follows that politics and ethics ground struggles for and contests over what may count as rational knowledge. That is, admitted or not, politics and ethics ground struggles over knowledge projects in the exact, natural, social, and human sciences. Otherwise, rationality is simply impossible, an optical illusion projected from nowhere comprehensively. Histories of science may be powerfully told as histories of the technologies. These technologies are ways of life, social orders, practices of visualization. Technologies are skilled practices. How to see? Where to see from? What limits to vision? What to see for? Whom to see with? Who gets to have more than one point of view? Who gets blinded? Who wears blinders? Who interprets the visual field? What other sensory powers do we wish to cultivate besides vision? Moral and political discourse should be the paradigm for rational discourse about the imagery and technol- ogies of vision. Sandra Harding's claim, or observation, that move- ments of social revolution have most contributed to improvements in science might be read as a claim about the knowledge conse- quences of new technologies of positioning. But I wish Harding had spent more time remembering that social and scientific revolutions have not always been liberatory, even if they have always been visionary. Perhaps this point could be captured in another phrase: the science question in the military. Struggles over what will count as rational accounts of the world are struggles over how to see. The terms of vision: the science question in colonialism, the science question in exterminism,15 the science question in feminism.
b2lm | The issue in politically engaged attacks on various empiricisms, reductionisms, or other versions of scientific authority should not be relativism-but location. A dichotomous chart expressing this point might look like this:
ti7f | ethnophilosophies heteroglossia deconstruction oppositional positioning local knowledges webbed accounts
oksu | universal rationality common language new organon unified field theory world system master theory
wtow | But a dichotomous chart misrepresents in a critical way the posi- tions of embodied objectivity that I am trying to sketch. The pri- mary distortion is the illusion of symmetry in the chart's di- chotomy, making any position appear, first, simply alternative and, second, mutually exclusive. A map of tensions and reason- ances between the fixed ends of a charged dichotomy better repre- sents the potent politics and epistemologies of embodied, there- fore accountable, objectivity. For example, local knowledges have also to be in tension with the productive structurings that force unequal translations and exchanges- material and semiotic - with- in the webs of knowledge and power. Webs can have the property of being systematic, even of being centrally structured global systems with deep filaments and tenacious tendrils into time, space, and consciousness, which are the dimensions of world history. Feminist accountability requires a knowledge tuned to reasonance, not to dichotomy. Gender is a field of structured and structuring difference, in which the tones of extreme localization, of the intimately personal and individualized body, vibrate in the same field with global high-tension emissions. Feminist embodi- ment, then, is not about fixed location in a reified body, female or otherwise, but about nodes in fields, inflections in orientations, and responsibility for difference in material-semiotic fields of meaning. Embodiment is significant prosthesis; objectivity cannot be about fixed vision when what counts as an object is precisely what world history turns out to be about.
o22k | How should one be positioned in order to see, in this situation of tensions, reasonances, transformations, resistances, and com- plicities? Here, primate vision is not immediately a very powerful metaphor or technology for feminist political-epistemological clari-
nwfz | fication, because it seems to present to consciousness already pro- cessed and objectified fields; things seem already fixed and dis- tanced. But the visual metaphor allows one to go beyond fixed ap- pearances, which are only the end products. The metaphor invites us to investigate the varied apparatuses of visual production, in- cluding the prosthetic technologies interfaced with our biological eyes and brains. And here we find highly particular machineries for processing regions of the electromagnetic spectrum into our pictures of the world. It is in the intricacies of these visualization technologies in which we are embedded that we will find meta- phors and means for understanding and intervening in the pat- terns of objectification in the world -that is, the patterns of reality for which we must be accountable. In these metaphors, we find means for appreciating simultaneously both the concrete, "real" aspect and the aspect of semiosis and production in what we call scientific knowledge.
nvfy | I am arguing for politics and epistemologies of location, position- ing, and situating, where partiality and not universality is the con- dition of being heard to make rational knowledge claims. These are claims on people's lives. I am arguing for the view from a body, always a complex, contradictory, structuring, and structured body, versus the view from above, from nowhere, from simpli- city. Only the god trick is forbidden. Here is a criterion for deciding the science question in militarism, that dream science/ technology of perfect language, perfect communication, final order.
mror | Feminism loves another science: the sciences and politics of in- terpretation, translation, stuttering, and the partly understood. Feminism is about the sciences of the multiple subject with (at least) double vision. Feminism is about a critical vision consequent upon a critical positioning in unhomogeneous gendered social space.16 Translation is always interpretive, critical, and partial. Here is a ground for conversation, rationality, and objec- tivity- which is power-sensitive, not pluralist, "conversation." It is not even the mythic cartoons of physics and mathematics-incor- rectly caricatured in antiscience ideology as exact, hypersimple knowledges-that have come to represent the hostile other to fem- inist paradigmatic models of scientific knowledge, but the dreams of the perfectly known in high-technology, permanently militar- ized scientific productions and positionings, the god trick of a Star
zlxc | Wars paradigm of rational knowledge. So location is about vul- nerability; location resists the politics of closure, finality, or to bor- row from Althusser, feminist objectivity resists "simplification in the last instance." That is because feminist embodiment resists fix- ation and is insatiably curious about the webs of differential posi- tioning. There is no single feminist standpoint because our maps require too many dimensions for that metaphor to ground our vi- sions. But the feminist standpoint theorists' goal of an epistemology and politics of engaged, accountable positioning re- mains eminently potent. The goal is better accounts of the world, that is, "science."
