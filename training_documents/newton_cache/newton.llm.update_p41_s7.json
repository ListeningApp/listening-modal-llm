Longrightarrow the norm of X sub K minus X sub star is less than Delta over one plus L sub G over Mu. Applying fifty-five we have\n5vry | The norm of X sub K plus one minus X sub star is less than Delta, which implies that X sub K plus one is in B of X sub star, Delta cap X sub star. In addition, Alpha sub K satisfies the line search criterion, which guarantees that f of X sub K plus one is less than or equal to f of X sub K and so\n9w33 | f of X sub K plus one minus f of X sub star is less than or equal to f of X sub K minus f of X sub star is less than or equal to Mu over two times the quantity Delta over one plus L sub G over Mu squared, which implies X sub K plus one is in Script N of X sub star, as needed. In the above argument we are free to replace Delta with any Delta prime in zero to Delta which implies that we can always choose Script N of X sub star sufficiently small.\njohv | We our now ready to prove Theorem three point thirteen.\n2olp | Proof of Theorem three point thirteen. Note that we are free to choose the neighbourhood Script N of X sub star of X sub two on X sub star from Lemma E point four small. We therefore select Delta sub zero less than Delta sub C V X and Script N of X sub star to satisfy the following inclusions\nzb7x | B of X sub star, Delta sub zero cap X sub star is subset or equal to Script N of X sub star is subset or equal to B of X sub star Delta sub B N D cap X sub star.
