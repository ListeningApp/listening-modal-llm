You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

v6sk | Therapeutic Hyperthermia Is Associated
1wj6 | With Improved Survival in Afebrile Critically
936l | Patients With Sepsis: A Pilot Randomized Trial
06yq | OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that forced-air warming of critically ill afe- brile sepsis patients improves immune function compared to standard tempera- ture management.
dpv6 | DESIGN: Single-center, prospective, open-label, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: One thousand two hundred-bed academic medical center.
8r5j | PATIENTS: Eligible patients were mechanically ventilated septic adults with: 1) a diagnosis of sepsis within 48 hours of enrollment; 2) anticipated need for mechan- ical ventilation of greater than 48 hours; and 3) a maximum temperature less than 38.3℃ within the 24 hours prior to enrollment. Primary exclusion criteria included: immunologic diseases, immune-suppressing medications, and any existing condi- tion sensitive to therapeutic hyperthermia (e.g., brain injury). The primary outcome was monocyte human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression, with secondary outcomes of CD3/CD28-induced interferon gamma (IFN-y) production, mortality, and 28-day hospital-free days.
2taz | INTERVENTIONS: External warming using a forced-air warming blanket for 48 hours, with a goal temperature 1.5℃ above the lowest temperature documented in the previous 24 hours.
o3ya | MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We enrolled 56 participants in the study. No differences were observed between the groups in HLA-DR expression (692 vs 2,002; <LATEX>\left. p = 0 . 3 9 6 \right)</LATEX> or IFN-y production (31 vs 69; <LATEX>\left. p = 0 . 6 7 8 \right) .</LATEX> Participants allocated to external warming had lower 28-day mortality (18% vs 43%; absolute risk reduction, 25%; 95% CI, 2-48%) and more 28-day hospital-free days (differ- ence, 2.6 d; 95% CI, 0-11.6).
r5il | CONCLUSIONS: Participants randomized to external forced-air warming did not have a difference in HLA-DR expression or IFN-y production. In this pilot study, however, 28-day mortality was lower in the intervention group. Future research should seek to better elucidate the impact of temperature modulation on immune and nonimmune organ failure pathways in sepsis.
5gui | KEY WORDS: clinical trial; fever; hyperthermia; immunosuppression; sepsis
82qc | F ever is a key feature of infection, yet fewer than half of critically ill patients with sepsis have a fever at the time of diagnosis (1-4). Afebrile sepsis patients have up to twice the mortality and are more likely to develop secondary infections than patients with fever, but the reason for these observa- tions is unknown (2-9). Fever may be an adaptive response to infection that is critical for survival. Animal and in vitro studies have shown elevated tem- perature to have beneficial effects on adaptive and innate immunity, including increased antibody production, T-cell activation, macrophage function, and heat shock protein response (10-14).

kggw | Sepsis is associated with pro- and anti-inflamma- tory mechanisms that can lead to prolonged periods of immunosuppression (15-22). Several biomarkers have been implicated in sepsis-induced immunosuppres- sion, including reduced expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, decreased lipopolysaccharide- induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) pro- duction, decreased anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated interferon gamma (IFN-y) production, and persistent lymphopenia (23). Patients exhibiting persistently de- pressed levels of these immune markers suffer from higher mortality and increased secondary infections compared to patients with intact immunity (24-32). While fever has been associated with immunocompe- tence, the role of temperature itself has not been rigor- ously evaluated.
xrd1 | Therapeutic hyperthermia, artificially raising body temperature through external warming, has been used for immunomodulation to treat several types of cancer (33, 34). This strategy is thought to improve function of natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and T cells (33). In addition, perioperative warming has consistently been shown to decrease postoperative infections (35-37). As a whole, these data provide compelling biologic ra- tionale that therapeutic hyperthermia may be an effec- tive treatment for sepsis.
5746 | The objective of this trial was to determine whether forced-air warming of critically ill afebrile sepsis patients improves immune function compared to standard temperature management. We hypothesized that warmed patients would exhibit higher levels of HLA-DR expression and CD3/CD28-stimulated IFN-Y production and a reduced prevalence of persistent lymphopenia. We also aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of raising body temperature in critically ill sepsis patients and to evaluate the impact of warming on clinical outcomes.

cwrw | gov (NCT02706275). Written informed consent was obtained from legally authorized representatives, and this study is reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Statement extension for pilot/feasibility trials (38). The study protocol is included in Appendix A (http://links.lww. com/CCM/H30).
4i0e | Participants
h2l3 | This study was conducted in the medical and surgical ICUs of a 1,200-bed tertiary care academic medical center between March 2016 and April 2019. Adult patients admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of se- vere sepsis were screened daily by a study coordinator for inclusion. Severe sepsis was defined according to the 2001 Sepsis Taskforce consensus statement (39), and a post hoc review verified that all included patients met Sepsis-3 criteria (40). Enrollment crite- ria also required participants to be enrolled within 48 hours of sepsis diagnosis (defined as the date/time of the first order for antibiotics), mechanically venti- lated with an expected duration of mechanical ven- tilation greater than 48 hours, receiving continuous pharmacologic sedation with a Richmond Agitation- Sedation Scale less than 0, and having a maximum temperature less than 38.3℃ within the 24 hours prior to enrollment. Exclusion criteria included: his- tory of immunological disease; treatment with im- munosuppressive medications within the previous 6 months; treatment with corticosteroids at a dose of greater than 300 mg/d hydrocortisone or equivalent at the time of enrollment; history of chronic infec- tion with hepatitis B or C virus; contraindications to hyperthermia (e.g., sudden cardiac arrest, acute ischemic stroke, acute coronary syndrome, trau- matic brain injury or spinal cord injury, sickle cell disease, or multiple sclerosis); pregnancy; comfort care treatment status; contraindications to forced-air warming devices per manufacture instructions (i.e., ischemic limbs); or enrollment in another clinical trial. These inclusion/exclusion criteria were selected to maximize participant safety and tolerance of the intervention and to exclude participants in whom immune biomarkers were unreliable or who might be harmed by artificially elevated body temperature. Patients admitted to the ICUs were screened daily and eligible patients were consecutively approached for enrollment.

u6ty | Randomization
awvu | Participants were randomized to usual care or to the study intervention in a 1:1 ratio by computer-gener- ated, block randomization with variable block size (using random blocks of 2, 4, and 6) to ensure allo- cation concealment. An allocation table based on this randomization scheme was uploaded to Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), a secure, web- based application for research data management, by a statistician. A study coordinator obtained the random- ization code for each patient from the REDCap data- base after informed consent had been obtained. Block randomization was used to ensure similar numbers of participants in each study group given the overall small sample size, which was calculated a priori.
on9b | Study Treatments
a8ge | The study intervention consisted of 48 hours of ex- ternal warming with a forced-air warming system (Bair Hugger, 3M, St. Paul, MN) to a goal core temperature 1.5℃ greater than the lowest recorded temperature in the 24 hours prior to enrollment or to at least 37.5℃ (whichever was higher). This goal temperature was chosen based on evidence from preliminary studies in our laboratory showing improved monocyte HLA-DR expression in patients with a 1.5℃ increase in min- imum body temperature during the first 48 hours after sepsis diagnosis (41). All participants enrolled in the study had temperature monitoring using a core tem- perature monitor (esophageal, bladder, or rectal). Immediately following randomization to the interven- tion group, a forced-air warming blanket on the high- est setting (43℃) was applied to participant with the aim of attaining the target temperature within 6 hours of warming onset. After 6 hours, if the goal tempera- ture was not achieved, warm blankets were added on top of the forced-air blanket and the room tempera- ture was increased. Once the goal temperature was achieved, the forced-air blanket was used to maintain the temperature above the goal for the remainder of the intervention period.
h27a | The warming intervention was terminated early if any of the following criteria were met: vasopressor in- crease greater than 50% for 6 hours and greater than 0.1 µg/kg/min norepinephrine-equivalent dose, heart rate (HR) increase by greater than 25 beats/min and HR greater than 90, evidence of thermal skin injury, or

xmgs | extubation. These termination criteria were chosen to avoid negative adverse effects of hyperthermia and to ensure participant comfort.
bd9h | Participants randomized to the control group re- ceived usual care temperature management in ac- cordance with our current ICU protocols during the 48-hour intervention period, at the discretion of the clinical team.
m047 | Data Collection
gy8c | Demographics, comorbidities, microbiological cul- ture results, and sources of sepsis were extracted from the electronic medical record. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores were calcu- lated based on data from the first 24 hours in the ICU. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores (excluding the Glasgow Coma Score component) were calculated prior to and following the intervention pe- riod. Throughout the 48-hour intervention period, core body temperatures were recorded hourly. Mean arterial blood pressure, vasopressor dose (in norepi- nephrine-equivalents [42]), and HR were documented every 6 hours. If warming was terminated early in the participants randomized to the study intervention, the reason for termination was noted. Blood samples were collected at randomization (days 1-2 after sepsis diag- nosis) and following the 48-hour intervention period (days 3-4 after sepsis diagnosis) to evaluate markers of immune function. Absolute lymphocyte counts from complete blood cell counts ordered by the treating clinical team were recorded from the electronic health record for the first 7 days following sepsis diagnosis.
y4mj | Outcomes
vpgq | The primary outcome was monocyte HLA-DR ex- pression following the 48-hour intervention period. This outcome was chosen because 1) HLA-DR ex- pression is one of the most widely accepted measures of sepsis-induced immunosuppression; 2) low levels are associated with mortality and acquisition of nos- ocomial infection infections in septic patients; and 3) our preliminary data (41) suggested HLA-DR expres- sion is higher in patients who experience fever during the first 48 hours of sepsis. Secondary immune out- comes included CD3/CD28-induced IFN-y produc- tion following the intervention period and prevalence of persistent lymphopenia (defined as an absolute

Clinical outcomes included the delta-SOFA score (change in SOFA score based on laboratory studies and vital signs from the 24-hr period prior to the start of the intervention compared to score based on data from the 24-hr period after completion of the intervention), 28-day hospital-free days, 28-day ventilator-free days, acquisition of secondary infections, and 28-day mor- tality. Secondary infections were defined as new pos- itive cultures or new antibiotics started after 48 hours and documentation of a new confirmed infection by the treating clinical team.
