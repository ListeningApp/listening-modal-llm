        "content": "0i1k | As the conflict escalated the international community scrambled to negotiate the conflict. It soon became clear, however, that both Ethiopia and Eritrea knew this conflict would be settled on the battlefield, and not around the negotiation table. Ethiopian counter-offensives, first to retake Badme in March nineteen ninety-nine, and later in May two thousand on the Tsorona, Zalambessa and Assab fronts, led to devastating losses. The entrenched Eritrean positions were attacked head on by waves of Ethiopian foot soldiers. Tens of thousands of young men perished on the plains of Badme and hillsides of Tsorona. When the Ethiopian military command leadership later assessed the terrible details and losses on the Tsorona front, they reportedly all broke down crying.\ndqlg | During the spring offensive of two thousand, Ethiopia managed finally to break through the Eritrean defense lines on the Western and Central front lines. The Eritrean government ordered a strategic retreat. At the same time they communicated acceptance of a negotiated settlement and cease-fire agreement. Although parts of the Ethiopian military and political leadership wanted to continue the offensive towards Asmara, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi ordered a halt in military operations and indicated a willingness to negotiate. Total Ethiopian losses amounted to close to one hundred thousand killed and two hundred thousand wounded, while Eritrea officially lost nineteen thousand. My personal communications with former high-ranking members of the Eritrean armed forces indicates that the number might be twice as high.\np6pq | The Algiers peace agreement\nzse6 | A Comprehensive Peace Agreement (called the Algiers Agreement) negotiated by the United Nations and African Union was signed in Algiers in December two thousand, which should have paved the way for border demarcation and normalization of bilateral affairs. At that time the peace agreement was hailed as a success and the international community expressed great optimism for a speedy normalization of relations between the two warring countries. Soon thereafter, however, the peace process stalled as the parties apparently never truly committed themselves politically to implementing fully the subsequent decisions reached in the internationally driven border arbitration process.\np2n3 | The most important aspect of the peace agreement was handled by the Eritrean-Ethiopian Boundary Commission, also known as the Commission, which, on the thirteenth of April two thousand two, made public its ruling on the delimitation of the border. At first, both countries issued statements proclaiming to be the 'winner' in the ruling. When it became clear that Eritrea had gained the contested village of Badme and the district of Irob in Tigray, however, Ethiopia protested the ruling. Badme village in itself is just a small cluster of houses without any significant strategic or economic value. However, as this was the site of the outbreak of hostilities and both parties had sacrificed tens of thousands of troops in order to defend and reconquer the village, Badme had - and still has - a huge symbolic significance for both Eritrea and Ethiopia. The Irob, a small minority group defining themselves as Ethiopians, was granted to Eritrea.\nohh7 | Consequently, the Ethiopian government initially refused to implement the Commission's border ruling in Badme and Irob, but welcomed the demarcation along the rest of the borderline. Since then, both parties have repeatedly accused each other of violating the principles of the peace agreement. The Ethiopian government argued for a more 'flexible' solution to the demarcation on the ground, to avoid for instance local communities being divided by the new border. This request was formally rejected by the Commission, which referred to the fact that the Algiers Agreement did not have any appeals procedure. While the Ethiopian House of Representatives voted on the twenty-fifth of November two thousand four to accept in principle the Commission's decision (through its five-point peace plan), Eritrea rejected any talks prior to Ethiopian withdrawals from occupied territories. Subsequently, in a letter to the United Nations Secretary General of the eighth of June two thousand seven, Ethiopia 'accepts the delimitation decision without precondition'; but the frozen political situation between the two countries stalled any initiative for follow-up on the matter.\nvbni | Shifting identities during the period of estrangement: two thousand to twenty eighteen\ndgcw | The devastating nineteen ninety-eight to two thousand war and the subsequent 'no war, no peace' stalemate which entailed a sustained militarization of the border on both sides, kept the borderlands populations physically apart for twenty years. At no other time during a history which stretches back over two thousand years has the Tigrinya-speaking highland population of Tigray and Eritrea been separate for such a long period. War and long-time physical and social separation will eventually lead to a reconfiguration of identities that used to be aligned and considered as affiliated groups. Research conducted in a border village on the Ethiopian side some years after the border closure notes that the younger generations have a very different conceptualization of, and identity towards, their brethren on the Eritrean side, from their parents' generation. The physical separation has naturally made an imprint on their understanding of the 'other' on the other side of the trenches. What used to be conceptualized in terms of 'kinfolk', are now increasingly considered as 'aliens' by the youth. Will this shift in conceptualizing identity, however, be a permanent feature among the borderlands population?\ngvwz | Due to the long separation and feeling of betrayal on both sides, many Eritreans and Ethiopians were hesitant about the possibilities of future reconciliation between the two peoples. Lacking any representative study, my impression is that more Eritreans than Ethiopians initially questioned the possibility for broad-based reconciliation between the two peoples. This may be due to a number of reasons. For one, the continued Ethiopian occupation of territories granted by the Commission to Eritrea sustains the image of Ethiopia as a threat to Eritrean sovereignty. The domestic context in Eritrea has also contributed to and sustained the image of Ethiopia as an enemy: social and political isolation since two thousand; sustained war mobilization; and the lack of access to information and narratives other than that produced by the ruling People's Front for Democracy and Justice. This has been countered to some extent: as Eritrean internal grievances increased due to the regime's repressive nature, more and more Eritreans were saying in private conversations that 'we - the Tigrinya-speakers - are all one and only separated by political leaders'.\nsk5m | Ethiopians have, on the other hand, 'moved on' quickly after the war. They demobilized their war army, the additional forces called up for the duration, and reprioritized their resources to development projects. The restoration and reparation directive enacted in Ethiopia in two thousand nine, which provides for restoration of property\nqws8 | rights and compensation for Eritreans expelled during the war, has also shown an official capacity to reconcile and abolish the 'formal enemy image' produced during the war. In addition, as Ethiopia's challenging domestic political developments are the Ethiopian people's main concerns, accordingly, the enmity against Eritreans harbored during the war has long since subsided and been forgotten.\n877u | The fortified and closed Eritrea-Ethiopia border only had a sustained direct impact on livelihoods in the borderlands and political development in the northern border region of Tigray. This is also the region with the deepest political legacy of the war, as the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front was the primary adversary of the Eritrean government. Consequently, when the political power balance shifted in Addis Ababa with the change of prime minister in twenty eighteen, so also did the formal bilateral relations between the two countries.\nrzhj | The peace rapprochement of twenty eighteen",
