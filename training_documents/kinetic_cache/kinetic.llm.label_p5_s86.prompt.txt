You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

s6su | The apparent reduction rate constants <LATEX>k _ { \mathrm { a p p } } ^ { \mathrm { R e d } }</LATEX> were measured at <LATEX>p H = 1 , 3 ,</LATEX> and 5 at various applied potentials, thereby altering the driving force <LATEX>- \Delta G ^ { \circ } .</LATEX> The potential-dependent apparent rate constant of this interfacial ET/PCET system can be described by the MG theory, where the rate constant plateaus at a large driving force. Based on the experimentally measured <LATEX>p K _ { a }</LATEX> of the <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } }</LATEX> -OH2 complex attached to ITO, the mechanism was presumed to be ET at <LATEX>\mathrm { p H } = 1</LATEX> but PCET at <LATEX>p H = 3</LATEX> and 5. At low <LATEX>p H ,</LATEX> the axial ligand coordinated to Ru is <LATEX>H 2 O ,</LATEX> and therefore only ET is possible, but at higher pH, the ligand coordinated to Ru is OH , and ET is accompanied by proton transfer to the OH ligand to generate a water ligand. A weak pH dependence was observed for the overall process. When the <LATEX>p H</LATEX> increases from 3 to 5, the maximum rate constant only decreases by around 3-fold rather than decreasing 100-fold, as would be expected according to a model based on a single PCET pathway with <LATEX>\mathrm { H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { O } ^ { + }</LATEX> as the proton donor, or being pH-independent, as would be expected according to a model based on a single PCET pathway with H2O as the proton donor.19
y219 | <LATEX>R u ^ { I I } - O H _ { 2 } .</LATEX> Here, we focus on the PCET process associated with the reduction of the <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } }</LATEX> catalyst37-44 attached to ITO. The two ET and two EPT channels, as well as Ox, OxH+, Red , and RedH for this process, are depicted in Figure 3. As no buffer solution was added in the experiments, the diagram in Figure 1 gives a complete set of the possible ET and EPT channels in this system, which is recreated using system-specific notation in Figure 4. The experimental rate constant was obtained by analyzing the absorbance change of the <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I } }</LATEX> catalyst (the product) as a function of time. In this system, the <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } }</LATEX> catalyst, which is the reactant, is generated by photoexcitation. The equilibrium assumption thus requires PT and complex association to be faster than ET and EPT. This assumption is reasonable for this system in the <LATEX>p H</LATEX> and potential range studied experimentally (see the SI). Note that the experimental measurement of the change in total concentration of the reduced species (i.e., the <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I } }</LATEX> catalyst) is consistent with our

xags | Prior to analyzing the experimental data, we introduce certain physically motivated assumptions regarding the parameters. We can estimate the values of <LATEX>K _ { 1 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>K _ { 2 }</LATEX> using density functional theory (DFT) calculations in conjunction with the experimentally measured <LATEX>\mathrm { p } K _ { \mathrm { a } , \mathrm { O x } }</LATEX> and <LATEX>p K _ { \text { a } R e d } .</LATEX> These calculations lead to estimates of <LATEX>K _ { 1 } \approx 1 0 ^ { 0 . 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>K _ { 2 } < 1 0 ^ { 4 . 5 }</LATEX> (see the SI). Furthermore, since the potential-dependent rate constant can be well described by MG theory, the maximum rate constant has the same expression for both ET and

ko3c | where <LATEX>\rho \left( \varepsilon _ { \mathrm { F } } \right)</LATEX> is the density of states at the Fermi level of the electrode and <LATEX>V _ { \mathrm { e l } }</LATEX> is the electronic coupling between the electrode and the redox molecule. For a surface-attached molecule, it is reasonable to assume that the electronic coupling is approximately the same if the ligands are the same for the reactant species. Therefore, we will assume that <LATEX>k _ { \max , \mathrm { E T 2 } }</LATEX> <LATEX>= k _ { \max , \mathrm { E P T 1 } } = k _ { \max , \mathrm { E P T 2 } }</LATEX> because the ligand is OH for the reactant in each of the three channels (Figure 3).
xek3 | For electrochemical systems, the apparent <LATEX>p K a</LATEX> of a surface- attached molecule has been reported to depend on an applied potential.45 When the potential becomes more negative, the negative charge accumulating on the electrode surface will disfavor deprotonation of the attached catalyst.

bqfb | dependent behavior has been observed in experiments on metal surfaces and described in terms of an increase of ~0.10 <LATEX>p K _ { a }</LATEX> unit per 59 mV of potential decrease.45 ITO, a degenerate semiconductor, is expected to exhibit similar behavior due to its metal-like conductivity and carrier density <LATEX>\left( \sim 1 0 ^ { 2 0 } \right.</LATEX> cm-3).24,46,47 For the ITO-Ru system, the <LATEX>p K _ { a , 0 x }</LATEX> is measured to be 1.2 at 1.1 V vs NHE, and the apparent rate constant reaches its maximum value in the range of -0.1 to +0.1 V vs NHE for <LATEX>p H</LATEX> of 1, 3, or 5 (symbols in Figure 5a).19 To reproduce the experimental data with our model, we used a slope of <LATEX>a = 0 . 1 2 p K _ { a }</LATEX> unit per 59 mV of potential decrease, similar to previous findings.45 Thus, the potential dependence of <LATEX>p K _ { a , O x }</LATEX> was modeled as

mn1r | Note that this potential dependence on ITO has not been experimentally verified. Anchoring a <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I } }</LATEX> water oxidation catalyst with a pH-sensitive visible absorption spectrum48 to the surface and monitoring its spectral behavior with an applied potential could provide useful insights. We also investigated models where <LATEX>p K _ { a , O x }</LATEX> is independent of the potential <LATEX>E</LATEX> and found that such models could only reproduce the experimental data at higher <LATEX>p \mathrm { E } ^ { \mathrm { H } } ,</LATEX> such as <LATEX>p H = 5 ,</LATEX> but not for the entire <LATEX>p H</LATEX> range (Figure S5). For the ITO-Ru system, <LATEX>\mathrm { p } K _ { \mathrm { a } , \mathrm { R e d } }</LATEX> cannot be measured for the attached complex due to the instability of the phosphonate anchoring group at <LATEX>p H ></LATEX> 5.49 We also used eq 13 to describe the potential dependence of <LATEX>\mathrm { p } K _ { a , R e d }</LATEX> with a value of 8.2 at 1.1 <LATEX>\mathrm { v } ,</LATEX> which will give a value of <LATEX>\sim 9 . 2</LATEX> at <LATEX>E _ { \mathrm { E T 2 } } ^ { o }</LATEX> to be consistent with the Pourbaix diagram of the free complex in solution. We found that the results using a higher value could not reproduce the results at <LATEX>p H =</LATEX> 5.
5vqw | This potential-dependent apparent <LATEX>p K _ { a }</LATEX> of the surface- attached species can also be viewed in terms of a potential- dependent work term due to bringing a proton to the interfacial region. A similar work term is necessary for the ET steps for the same physical reason and to ensure that the overall free energy of the PCET process is independent of path. Therefore, this work term was added to all of the ET and PT steps. Including these work terms for the diagonal steps does not alter the results because they effectively cancel. These work terms are effectively accounting for nonideal behavior at the interface.50,51 The impact of the potential dependence of
