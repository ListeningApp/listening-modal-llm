        "content": "sy14 | Despite the completion of the US military withdrawal in June nineteen forty-nine, and the increase of intelligence indications warning of an upcoming invasion, the CIA provided no specific warning until war broke out. The agency's \"Weekly Summary\" of January thirteenth, nineteen fifty, shortly before Kim Il Sung obtained Stalin's green light for the invasion, noted the continued North Korean military buildup in the border area, but estimated that this was probably \"a defensive measure to offset the growing strength of the offensively minded South-Korean army.\" The CIA's Watch Committee-a small body that was set up in nineteen forty-eight and met about twice a month with representatives of the army, navy, air force and State Department to discuss indications of incoming threats-was asked on June fourteenth to consider a list of potential areas of conflict with the USSR in the next six months to a year. Their ranking order was Indochina, Berlin, and West Germany, Iran, Yugoslavia, South Korea (sixth), the Philippines, and Japan. Less than a week before war started, the CIA issued a report that grossly underestimated the KPA's capabilities: sixty-six thousand troops organized in at least three infantry divisions and one independent brigade; at least sixty-five T-thirty-four tanks; and about thirty-five Soviet-made fighters which probably had not yet attained operational status. In reality, the KPA had at least one hundred thirty-five thousand soldiers, one hundred fifty T-thirty-four tanks and an air force of one hundred eighty Soviet-made aircraft including forty fighters and seventy attack-bombers. This\nghss | The Far East Command G-two was even more off the mark. Less than three months before the North Korean invasion, Willoughby estimated:\n3s61 | It is believed that there would be no civil war in Korea this spring or summer. South Korea is not expected to seriously consider warfare so long as her precipitating war entails probable discontinuance of United States aid. The most probable course of North Korean action this spring and summer is furtherance of attempts to overthrow South Korean government by creation of chaotic conditions in the Republic of Korea through guerrillas and psychological warfare.\ns3rm | In contrast, the ROK army estimate of the KPA OB was far more accurate: one hundred three thousand five hundred soldiers in six infantry and one armored divisions; one hundred seventy-three tanks, and one hundred ninety airplanes. These figures were rejected by the Americans who also rejected South Korean warnings in May that \"an invasion by the North was imminent.\"\npqxb | The North Korean attack started at four a.m. on June twenty-fifth Korean time, or three p.m. on June twenty-fourth Eastern Standard Time. It caught everyone by surprise, from the American ambassador and his staff in Seoul to President Truman, who first heard about the attack more than eight hours after it started. Truman and Acheson, who headed the group that was called together to deal with the crisis, processed the incoming information through a Munich analogy, and in an almost Pavlovian response connecting provocation with defense, decided to act militarily. In this sense, the decision to intervene was a product of the gap between strategic thinking that ranked South Korea at the bottom of the Far East order of priorities before the invasion, and political considerations that ranked it high once the invasion took place. At its root stood three intelligence shortcomings:\n08qc | . Underestimation of the KPA military capabilities, which caused the administration to limit its assistance to the South Korean army, which facilitated its fast collapse.\nhdj2 | Â· Lack of high-quality early warning about the coming invasion, which prevented more effective South Korean and American military and diplomatic preparations to meet the challenge.\na57g | . The failure to realistically assess the nature of the triangular relationship between the USSR, the PRC, and North Korea, which led to the mistaken belief that Stalin rather than Kim Il Sung was the driving force behind the invasion. Hence, an American military intervention was perceived as the adequate means to stop aggression.\ng8m3 | c. Explaining the lack of preparedness\na9av | The first communist military challenge in the postwar era, the North Korean invasion, found the United States unprepared to meet its role as the status quo defender. One source of this problem was insufficient American experience in that role, which manifested itself in the rapid manner in which the American weltanschauung moved from postwar optimism to McCarthyism and \"red scare,\" and an insufficient body of expertise in world affairs inside the administration. The other source, which derived mainly from postwar optimism, was insufficient military and intelligence resources that were needed to support America's global posture. This was a result of the fast demobilization and the deep cuts in defense budgets in the aftermath of WWII.\n73l3 | Attempting to bridge the gap between its new status and the lack of resources to support it started with a policy of containment as the national strategy, and the concomitant passing away of the Truman Doctrine and Marshal Plan. The nineteen forty-seven National Security Act that reorganized the administration gave the president\nornm | more effective tools to meet the new American commitments. NATO's establishment in nineteen forty-nine in reaction to the \"Berlin blockade\" created the main instrument to limit Soviet expansion in Europe. And following the Soviet nuclear test and the \"fall of China\" that amplified the \"red scarce,\" Paul Nitze, the director of policy planning in the State Department, and his colleagues, formulated the NSC-sixty-eight aimed at putting financial and military teeth into the strategy of containment. It was submitted to President Truman in April nineteen fifty, but he did not sign it until September, and then, only under the pressure of the Korean War. This was the political envelope in which the failure to forecast the incoming invasion was sealed.\nu2z1 | The issue at stake\natmh | Relatively speaking, postwar Korea was terra incognita for American Far Eastern policy. Japan had been well-known since the time of Commander Perry's visit there in the mid-nineteenth century. Its conversion under MacArthur into a peaceful democratic state attracted much attention. Americans thought of rural life in China in terms of Pearl Buck's books, primarily the Good Earth, which also became a major film; these images of course involved wild distortions but many Americans were unaware of the misrepresentations. Extensive American resources, including more than two billion dollars in aid, were invested in Chiang Kai-shek's struggle to win the civil war in China. The Philippines had been an American colony since eighteen ninety-eight, and the independent government that was established there after the Japanese occupation received US aid in its war against the Hukbalahap (\"Huks\") Rebellion.",
