You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

p6pq | Y1H assay
zse6 | The CDS of MdERF3 and MdERF118 were ligated into the PJG4-5 vector in restriction enzyme sites EcoRI/XholI. MdPME2, MdPGLR3 and MdACO4 were ligated into the Placzi vector in restriction enzyme sites EcoRI/XholI, KpnI/XholI, and KpnI/XholI, respectively. The CDS of MdDof5.3 and MdRAVL1 were ligated into the PJG4- 5 vector using restriction enzyme sites EcoRI/XholI. MdERF3 and MdERF118 were ligated into the Placzi vector, using restriction enzyme sites EcoRI/XholI. All primers used are listed in Table S16.
p2n3 | EMSA
ohh7 | The proteins of MdDof5.3 and MdRAVL1 were induced at 37 ℃ for 6 h. Proteins were purified as described by Li (Li et al., 2016). Oligonucleotide probes were synthesized and labelled with biotin (Sangon Biotech.Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). The biotin end- labelled double-stranded DNA probes were prepared by anneal- ing complementary oligonucleotides as follows: the oligonu- cleotides were heated at 95 ℃ for 5 min, then <LATEX>7 2 ^ { \circ } C</LATEX> 20 min, and immediately left to cool to room temperature before use. The biotin-labelled MdERF3 promoter and MdERF118 primer sequences are shown in Table S16.
vbni | Y2H assay
dgcw | The CDS region of MdERF3 was ligated into the pGADT7 vector using the EcoRI and XholI restriction sites as described previously (Jia et al., 2018). The full-length MdERF118 (1-344 amino acids) was ligated into the pGBKT7 (Clontech, Beijing, China) binding domain (BD) vector using the EcoRI and SalI sites. The primers used are shown in Table S16. BD and AD vectors were co- transformed into the Y2HGold yeast strain. The interactions between two proteins were detected using the Matchmaker Gold Y2H library screening system (catalog no. 630489; Clontech, Beijing, China).
gvwz | BiFC assay
sk5m | The full-length CDS of MdERF3 or MdERF118 without stop codon was amplified and ligated into pSPYNE-35S and pSPYCE-35S vectors containing green fluorescent protein (GFP), using the one- step seamless cloning kit (Aidlab Biotechnologies); the constructs were checked by sequencing and then transformed into A. tumefaciens strain GV3101. Two plasmids were co-transformed into the abaxial side of 4- to 6-week-old N. benthamiana leaves to detect specific interactions as described previously (Zhang et al., 2013). After 48 h co-infiltration, the N. benthamiana leaves were observed using an LSM 510-Meta confocal laser microscope (Zeiss). GFP signals were imaged under 488 nm excitation wavelength.

bfax | Delicious', and 'Jonathan' x 'Golden Delicious'. All these hybrids were genotyped for the 56 markers (29 for flesh firmness retainability and 27 for flesh crispness retainability) using KASP assay. The 200-bp sequences flanking the interested SNPs were used for KASP primer design (Chen et al., 2011). The KASP primers are listed in Table S7. The KASP assay was performed using the LGC SNPline (Laboratory of the Government Chemist, UK) and the data were analysed using SNPviewer software. The DNA of parental cultivars, 'Jonathan', 'Golden Delicious', 'Zisai Pearl', and 'Red Fuji', were used as control in KASP assay, because the marker genotypes of these cultivars were already known by previous parental re-sequencing (Shen et al., 2019).
f2y8 | Marker genotype effect was estimated by the deviation between the average OPV of the hybrids with the same genotype and overall mean phenotype value of the training populations. By using hybrids without missing marker genotype data, the GPV was calculated by sum up the genotype effects of all markers and population mean phenotype value. The prediction accuracy of GPV was evaluated by the Pearson's correlation coefficient between GPV and OPV of the hybrids (Kumar et al., 2012a). Fivefold cross- validation (run five times) was used to test the accuracy of the GAP models (Abed et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2012a).
o7qm | Statistical analysis
d52l | Significant differences were analysed using the independent samples Student's t test (SPSS Statistics 21; IBM). Asterisks denoted significance: <LATEX>* P < 0 . 0 5 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>* * P < 0 . 0 1 .</LATEX> Error bars indicate standard deviation of three biological replicates, each containing at least three technical replicates.
