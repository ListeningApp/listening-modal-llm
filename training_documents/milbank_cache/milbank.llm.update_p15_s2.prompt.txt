You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

We stress that analysis of this kind, though essential to empirical legal research, does not exhaust legal scholarship on laws, eliminate the serious challenges often entailed in interpreting what the law "is," or replace serious discussion of what the law ought to be.
m61y | Implementation Studies
u2ob | For a law to be effective, its implementation must be such that it will actually influence the behavior of its targets. The process of putting a law into practice can be understood in terms of a series of mediating factors, including the attitudes, management methods, capacities, and resources of implementing agencies and their agents; the methods and extent of enforcement; the relationship between the legal rules and broader community norms; and the attitudes and other relevant characteristics of the population whose behavior is targeted for influence. The text of the law and the resources appropriated for its enforcement constrain, but do not eliminate, the discretion of bureaucratic entities to reshape the rules to fit their existing culture and mission (Deflem 2004).
2gnm | Implementation research classically starts with investigating the "transformation process" that occurs along path B in figure 1, the differ- ences between the goals and methods of the law as explicitly or implicitly contemplated in the "law on the books," and the "law on the streets" actually put into practice by legal agents charged with enforcing the law (Percy 1989). Case studies or other analyses of how health agencies have organized their mission or performed in a given mission are a common form of implementation research (Buehler, Whitney, and Berkelman 2006) and often investigate what legal powers an agency had or how it used them (Lawson and Xu 2007). Creative compliance and outright resistance by the targets of regulation also may be studied (Nakkash and Lee 2009). Implementation research in PHLR includes studies of the relationship among "legal infrastructure," legal or other competencies, and agency function (Kimball et al. 2008). Such studies may explore the effects of law on private agencies operating under a legal authorization, such as the effect of legal authorization on syringe-exchange programs (Bluthenthal et al. 2007). Implementation researchers also measure

xaqt | Research on legal practices in PHLR may investigate the means through which systems may be better governed or regulation better designed in order to achieve their goals. Although it has as yet had little impact on PHLR, the study of techniques of regulation and governance has become an important part of empirical legal research and scholar- ship (Ayres and Braithwaite 1992; Croley 2008; Moran 2002; Rhodes 1997). For nearly three decades, regulation in the United States and many other developed countries has exhibited an increasing pluralism, not just in spreading regulatory functions beyond government to private parties and public-private hybrids (Burris, Kempa, and Shearing 2008; Lobel 2004; Osborne and Gaebler 1993), but also in using a wide range of strategies beyond detailed rules backed by carrots and sticks (Parker and Braithwaite 2003). Contemporary regulators use cooperation, de- liberation, education, competition, and other "soft" strategies that can be more effective than traditional command-and-control bureaucracy (Lobel 2004). Theory and research in governance have highlighted the importance of actors outside government-such as advocacy groups, corporations, and gangs-in managing the course of events in social systems and have investigated how these actors regulate governments and one another (Buse and Lee 2005; Scott 2002).
5rcb | New regulatory and governance approaches have raised a fascinating range of empirical questions, from the use of the audit as a compli- ance tool (Power 1997) to the design and effectiveness of public/private and self-governing regulatory structures (Gunningham 2009; Ostrom 2005). This work resonates with research in behavioral law and eco- nomics, captured in Sunstein and Thaler's Nudge, which describes how regulators can creatively structure options to systematically influence behavior by means other than simple legal rules (Sunstein and Thaler 2008).
524j | Because so much regulation is now conducted outside traditional bu- reaucratic frameworks (and indeed outside government), scholars work- ing in this area begin with a generic definition of regulation and its con- stituent elements. "Regulation" is the "sustained and focused attempt to alter the behaviour of others according to defined standards or purposes in order to address a collective issue or resolve a collective problem" (Black 2008, 139). It uses a combination of basic strategies of control,

8qb6 | including standard setting, monitoring, and enforcement (Scott 2001). The use of these strategies can be studied without regard to the particu- lar mode through which the regulatory task is accomplished or what sort of entity is performing it (Braithwaite and Drahos 2000). This analytic approach allows researchers both to better capture the regulatory role of actors outside traditional regulatory agencies-for example, the role of Mothers Against Driving Drunk in fostering stronger social norms condemning drunk driving-and to offer more creative approaches to regulation, as exemplified by Nudge and other works of behavioral law and economics (Lobel and Amir 2009).
wkbn | Although research in regulation and governance has been limited in public health law (Biradavolu et al. 2009; Burris 2008; Trubek 2006), its applicability is clear (Magnusson 2009). Public health services are pro- vided by a diversity of public and private actors, and private entities play an important role in practicing and promoting standards of healthy be- havior and health-promoting practices (IOM 2003). We recognize that complex systems like health care cannot simply be managed by top- down rules but require the use of many flexible tools, like professional self-regulation, ethics, accreditation, collaborative and deliberative de- cision making, continuous quality improvement, and market incentives (Braithwaite, Healy, and Dwan 2005; Berwick and Brennan 1995; Lobel 2004; Trubek 2006). Health governance around the world has been dra- matically altered by the rise of new public/private hybrid institutions like the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; the enormous wealth of the Gates Foundation; and the consolidation of au- thority over national health, safety, and intellectual property law in the World Trade Organization (Hein, Burris, and Shearing 2009; McCoy and Hilson 2009). The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is a typical instance of the "soft law" approach, setting broad goals for na- tional action but minimizing binding rules in favor of deliberation and flexibility. Legal scholarship has begun to explore the "constitutional" implications of these structural changes (Fidler 2004), but they have not been extensively investigated in PHLR.
