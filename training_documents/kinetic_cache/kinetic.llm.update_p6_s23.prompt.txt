You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

cp13 | where <LATEX>\rho \left( \varepsilon _ { \mathrm { F } } \right)</LATEX> is the density of states at the Fermi level of the electrode and <LATEX>V _ { \mathrm { e l } }</LATEX> is the electronic coupling between the electrode and the redox molecule. For a surface-attached molecule, it is reasonable to assume that the electronic coupling is approximately the same if the ligands are the same for the reactant species. Therefore, we will assume that <LATEX>k _ { \max , \mathrm { E T 2 } }</LATEX> <LATEX>= k _ { \max , \mathrm { E P T 1 } } = k _ { \max , \mathrm { E P T 2 } }</LATEX> because the ligand is OH for the reactant in each of the three channels (Figure 3).
bgre | For electrochemical systems, the apparent <LATEX>p K a</LATEX> of a surface- attached molecule has been reported to depend on an applied potential.45 When the potential becomes more negative, the negative charge accumulating on the electrode surface will disfavor deprotonation of the attached catalyst.

jie2 | Note that this potential dependence on ITO has not been experimentally verified. Anchoring a <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I } }</LATEX> water oxidation catalyst with a pH-sensitive visible absorption spectrum48 to the surface and monitoring its spectral behavior with an applied potential could provide useful insights. We also investigated models where <LATEX>p K _ { a , O x }</LATEX> is independent of the potential <LATEX>E</LATEX> and found that such models could only reproduce the experimental data at higher <LATEX>p \mathrm { E } ^ { \mathrm { H } } ,</LATEX> such as <LATEX>p H = 5 ,</LATEX> but not for the entire <LATEX>p H</LATEX> range (Figure S5). For the ITO-Ru system, <LATEX>\mathrm { p } K _ { \mathrm { a } , \mathrm { R e d } }</LATEX> cannot be measured for the attached complex due to the instability of the phosphonate anchoring group at <LATEX>p H ></LATEX> 5.49 We also used eq 13 to describe the potential dependence of <LATEX>\mathrm { p } K _ { a , R e d }</LATEX> with a value of 8.2 at 1.1 <LATEX>\mathrm { v } ,</LATEX> which will give a value of <LATEX>\sim 9 . 2</LATEX> at <LATEX>E _ { \mathrm { E T 2 } } ^ { o }</LATEX> to be consistent with the Pourbaix diagram of the free complex in solution. We found that the results using a higher value could not reproduce the results at <LATEX>p H =</LATEX> 5.
d0ik | This potential-dependent apparent <LATEX>p K _ { a }</LATEX> of the surface- attached species can also be viewed in terms of a potential- dependent work term due to bringing a proton to the interfacial region. A similar work term is necessary for the ET steps for the same physical reason and to ensure that the overall free energy of the PCET process is independent of path. Therefore, this work term was added to all of the ET and PT steps. Including these work terms for the diagonal steps does not alter the results because they effectively cancel. These work terms are effectively accounting for nonideal behavior at the interface.50,51 The impact of the potential dependence of
