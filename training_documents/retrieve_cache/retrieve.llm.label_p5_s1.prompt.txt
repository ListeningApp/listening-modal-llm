You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

y4mj | Because the two sets of leadership skills in a duality comprise opposite approaches, managers can experience tension between them or even see them as contradictory or incompatible. The challenge for the versatile leader is thus to meet what F. Scott Fitzgerald called "the test of a first-rate intelligence": to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function. That challenge is all the greater, given that most leaders will have to overcome their bias in favor of one of the ideas and against the other. This notion of versatility is not to be mistaken as moderation in all things. It simply denotes a wide and flexible range of behaviors, which can indeed include immoderate behavior when extreme circum- stances require it.
vpgq | Versatility pays off. Our research found a close association between versatility, as measured by our 360-degree question- naire, and overall effectiveness. In every sample of senior man- agers we have studied, we found substantial correlations between ratings of effectiveness and versatility on both the forceful-enabling and strategic-operational dualities. These strong statistical relationships reflect the fact that versatile man- agers are consistently regarded as the most effective leaders in their organizations.
ousl | Our data also revealed that, in addition to versatile and lop- sided, there is a third, less prevalent leadership pattern: what might be called the "disengaged leader," one who underdoes both sides of a duality. Disengaged leadership is associated with the lowest ratings of effectiveness.11
m4ju | The Root Causes of Imbalance
a0mb | The fact that so many managers are lopsided on one or another duality raises the question: What throws off their behavior?
ki8m | Uneven Skill Development Imbalance can be a function of some- thing as straightforward as overdeveloping one side (hypertro- phy) and neglecting to develop the other (atrophy). For example, when a manager is repeatedly given the same type of assignment because of his or her obvious strengths in that area, it can deprive that manager of the opportunity to round out his or her reper- toire. Also, the skills most critical to success on the lower levels of an organization - forceful and operational leadership - tend to be well developed in managers and are consequently overused as those managers rise to more senior levels.12 Similarly, the stra- tegic and enabling skills that can be crucial at in upper man- agement tend to be underdeveloped in freshly minted senior managers.
km8w | Skewed Mental Models All managers operate on the basis of assumptions, beliefs, values and attitudes. When these notions are uninformed, untrue or otherwise distorted, they in turn dis- tort the leader's behavior.13 The least problematic case occurs
wzno | when an executive fails to realize that the skills that earned her a senior-level position are not the same as those required in that position - that she is, for example, no longer responsible for actually doing research and development or marketing but for orchestrating the efforts of those who are.
xagm | Overgeneralizations also tilt leaders toward imbalance.14 For instance, a manager who interprets his employees' need for autonomy as a mandate to be completely hands-off will often give his staff plenty of latitude to do their jobs but not make himself sufficiently available to provide technical assistance or emotional support; an executive with a core belief in "putting others first" may listen extraordinarily well but have a difficult time articulating her own views with the conviction that his staff is looking for; a manager with an exaggerated fear of overstep- ping bounds can be accommodating to his peers but inhibited from fighting for the resources that his or her unit needs.
iwn5 | One-Sided Values An executive will tend to underemphasize cer- tain skills and approaches that he simply does not deem impor- tant or part of his job. We have seen many executives give short shrift to the operational aspects of their jobs because they char- acterize such attentiveness as being "consumed with details," whereas they envision that their mandate is dealing with strategic considerations. They believe they no longer need to follow up or follow through, and they have yet to discover that those functions simply take on a different character in higher-level positions.
uooz | Executives also tend to overdo those things on which they place a premium. Those who are goal-oriented and focused sharply on hitting their targets see all too clearly how important it is to get things done, but they may overlook the strategic ques- tion of whether the right things are getting done. It is difficult for them to see how something they believe in deeply can be taken too far. It is only when they are asked to consider what goals and functions are being neglected because of their extreme behaviors that the problem begins to come into focus.
pxbq | Fear of Inadequacy A good deal of out-of-balance leadership results from the fear of being inadequate or incompetent even though, in our experience, most executives tend to underestimate their true abilities. Managers will avoid things they believe they are not good at, such as public speaking or dealing with technical issues such as information systems or even e-mail. We have seen executives isolate themselves because they are insecure about their ability to relate to other people, or they shy away from strat- egy because they fear they are intellectually inadequate.15 Of course, this sets up a self-fulfilling prophecy: Managers who avoid certain approaches because of self-perceived deficiencies forgo the opportunity to improve.
jfsr | Ironically, underestimating oneself can also lead to overdo- ing certain behaviors. Managers who privately underrate their

3g9w | Leadership Models and Measures as an Organizational Intervention
d09o | Organizations regularly adopt leadership models to reinforce or change their lead- ership culture. If such a model is to send a message, it must be compact and clear, which the oft-used long lists of competencies - however worthy - are not. A list ought to be short enough to be remembered, and the desired leader- ship qualities should be significant enough to make an impression on man- agers. It also helps if the list is inte- grated. The unifying principle that we favor is versatility, the capacity to strike balances between opposite types of leadership. This has the added advan- tage of reflecting the real tensions and trade-offs that make the job of manage- ment a balancing act. What organization doesn't, for example, need to strike a balance between strategic leadership and operational leadership - between positioning the organization for the future and executing its short-term objectives? How many organizations are trying to be more customer-oriented and less internally oriented?
ylhz | In any of these or similarly paired objectives, imbalance, by definition, is doing too much of one of them. Compe- tency models, which are predicated on
a3td | own competence, for instance, are liable to put pressure on themselves to demonstrate their value at every opportunity, depriving their staff of the chance to answer their own ques- tions or solve their own problems. Others who believe they are not well liked may ignore subordinates' performance prob- lems. Indeed, many of the excesses in managerial behavior are compensatory.
ex5k | The tendency to do too much is often linked to a concern about doing too little. Driven people, for example, lack objec- tivity about what is reasonable to expect of themselves and oth- ers. The literature on perfectionism is replete with insights into this phenomenon.16 Managers who take too much responsibil- ity are privately afraid that they will not take enough. Those who take too much power may harbor a mistaken sense of themselves as relatively powerless. Individuals who intimidate others intellectually are surprised to hear that said about them- selves, because they actually feel intellectually inadequate.

5esx | the idea of leveraging strengths but have no way of assessing overleverag- ing, simply cannot detect when a lead- ership strength is being corrupted through indiscriminate application. Yet organizations and individuals regularly fall prey to this problem. To determine how balanced (or out of balance) indi- vidual managers or an organization's management team may be requires a measure that can capture and express overdoing.
m5ka | Motorola Inc. has adopted such a model and measure, which we helped to develop.' The model consists of five leadership requirements: envision, ener- gize, edge, execute, and ethics and char- acter. The first four requirements, which we had no hand in choosing, amount to the two dominant dualities we have identified in our research. "Envision" and "execute" are synonymous with strategic leadership and operational leadership, respectively. "Edge" is the equivalent of forceful leadership and "energize" has properties of enabling leadership. The fifth requirement, ethics and character, refers to the individual's core values and is the base on which the other four requirements rest. The per-
byu8 | Senior managers who take too much credit or are arrogant are actually among the least sure of themselves.
76b0 | The Tendency To Polarize Human beings' inherent tendency to see choices as either/or scenarios feeds into the psychology of over- doing and underdoing. When presented with a pair of opposing virtues, most people tend to choose one over the other, though in fact they may not even realize they are making a choice. For whatever personal, historical or organizational reason, they adopt a principle, a truth about leadership and do not realize they are forsaking its complementary truth.
zxz6 | Take the case of an executive who excels at treating people well. She listens attentively and creates an atmosphere in which people feel comfortable speaking up in meetings. She empowers people and supports them when they need help. She is soft- spoken and nonthreatening. She believes in this way of leading and strongly identifies with it. The problem is that she has turned
xnth | formance measure that we developed for Motorola employs two rating scales designed to detect imbalance. Using the two scales, subordinates and superiors rate a target manager on 33 specific behaviors. On the first scale, raters are asked to evaluate the manager's effec- tiveness on each behavior from 1 (inef- fective) to 5 (extraordinarily effective). On the second scale they rate how the manager should change his behavior to become more effective - that is, from "do a lot less" (a rating of -3) to "do a lot more" (a rating of +3).
vafm | A leadership model of this sort, organized around basic dualities ger- mane to an organization, equips that organization to better analyze job requirements, assess individuals, make staffing decisions, plot development plans and reward people - in other words, it helps form the basis of a talent- management system designed to build the desired leadership culture.
2zmw | her back on power and self-assertion, on telling people what they may not want to hear - for example, that she is not satisfied with their performance or is unhappy about a missed deadline. This is a nearly pure case of polarizing. The individual has formed a blind attachment to the enabling side of leadership because she can find practically no fault with it. She has misgivings about the forceful side because she focuses only on its negative aspects and excesses. The side she turns away from becomes her blind side and compromises her performance.
bf9k | How Managers Can Improve Themselves
otkr | An out-of-balance leadership style almost always rests on the shaky foundation of distorted beliefs about leadership, as well as associated fears. The duality-oriented model of leadership is use- ful because it naturally calls attention to the beliefs and feelings that underlie a manager's approach. (See "Leadership Models and Measures as an Organizational Intervention.") The resulting self- awareness puts managers in a stronger position to increase their versatility and, thereby, boost their effectiveness.
ibgs | The first step toward correcting imbalance is to see it in one- self. Our data show that executives have difficulty with this: Their reading of their versatility or lack thereof was often inaccurate. Self-ratings were barely related to coworker ratings - on versatil- ity, on effectiveness or on the link between the two. Yet superior, peer and subordinate ratings showed substantial convergence with one another. What's more, self-ratings of versatility bore vir- tually no relationship to self-ratings of overall effectiveness.17 It seems that everyone sees leadership imbalances and their link to ineffectiveness except for the person in question.
colo | Whether a manager overdoes or underdoes something, he tends to look upon it as the proper response to the task at hand. Because he overdoes what he's good at, he places a high value on it and has a difficult time seeing how one can do too much of a good thing. Because he underdoes what he does not value, he has trouble seeing the problem with neglecting what he deems value- less behavior. It is no wonder that performance problems don't get corrected easily.
d6r4 | Strengthening the Weak Side If they're not careful, managers can fool themselves into thinking that making up a versatility deficit is merely a matter of acquiring a skill. But reversing an imbalance requires internal work - contending with a mis- conception, a bias, a prejudicial attitude or a fear. The easiest internal change is simply to recognize what the job requires. It is relatively easy to make that intellectual adjustment, but the emotional and behavioral adjustments are not nearly as straightforward.
9mrz | It can be equally challenging to put a highly personal modus operandi into perspective. A manager who, for instance, values her own autonomy and self-sufficiency and operates best that way
pk06 | must nevertheless recognize that her staff's needs may be quite different and that she must adjust her style to meet those needs.
7wn9 | Harder still for a manager is overcoming an inhibition or fear of what he would become if he were to strengthen his neglected side. Forceful managers, for example, worry that they will become weak. Overly enabling managers worry that they will become mean, abrasive or power-mongering. Looking across the dividing line, they see not the virtues of the other side but the worst excesses, and they recoil. These fears cut straight to the heart of managers' sense of who they are. The more out of bal- ance the manager, the more polarized the mind-set and the stiffer the emotional challenge.
wcd0 | Complicating the task, otherwise objective managers have dif- ficulty gauging how much of the new behavior they are exhibit- ing and, afraid of exhibiting too much, they regularly overestimate. As one shrewd fellow said, "I'm learning that when I think I'm coming on like a ton of bricks not to worry about that because my sensors are bad and so my data are unreliable." Knowing this, he has taken to asking others for their reading.
caos | Moderating the Overused Side To stop overdoing it, managers also need to do some internal work, although of a somewhat different character. Rather than strengthening muscles they have allowed to atrophy, they have to undertrain muscles developed to the point of hypertrophy. That kind of work involves learning to place less value on, and identify less with, a particular skill or per- sonal quality such as operational competence or tough-minded- ness. Underneath these exaggerated values or distorted beliefs often lie unacknowledged needs or fears. Managers whose fear of not being responsible enough leads to a debilitating sense of responsibility, or whose anxiety about not adding enough value causes them to strain to prove themselves at every opportunity often cannot allay such anxieties on their own. They can, how- ever, be greatly aided with positive feedback about their compe- tence in general or in the particular respect that they fret about - if they can internalize the feedback.18
qrvy | The key to moderating strengths that have been taken to an extreme is for managers to learn to be more nuanced in their application. When managers contemplate easing up, they tend to worry that they will lose all of the capability they rely so heavily upon. Unconsciously, they treat any modulation as binary. They need to see the control mechanism not as an on-off switch, but rather as a dial, one that they simply can turn down a notch or two. They don't have to give up their gift; they can instead make more discriminating, and therefore more effective, use of it.
