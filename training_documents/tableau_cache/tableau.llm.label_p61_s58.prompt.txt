You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ffuj | The problem with this table is that the years, which actually are qualitative descriptions of when each population measurement was made, are used as separate columns even though the year is a dimension and should run down the page. (Dates are dimensions too and not facts, because they describe something qualitative). If we loaded this table in Tableau Public, we would see a separate measure field for each year because Tableau Public recognizes each column as a distinct field. (In one of the following examples, we will use Tableau Public's new data interpreter to structure the data source properly).
h7f6 | The correct structure for this table will have three columns, namely [Country], [Year], and [Population], with a separate row for each combination of country and year.
t74k | Connecting to the data in Tableau Public
qdn7 | Tableau Public has a graphical user interface (GUI) that was designed to enable users to load data sources without having to write code. Since the only place to save Tableau Public documents is in Tableau's Cloud, data sources are automatically extracted and packaged with the workbook. (The ability to save extracts as separate documents or open extracts and share them with different users is a feature of Tableau Desktop Professional).

wyu0 | Connecting to data from a local file, that is, an access, excel, or text file saved on your computer, takes several steps that have little variability by data source, which will be illustrated as follows with detailed screenshots:
s8xw | 1. Click on the Connect to Data Link option from the Data menu.
afv1 | 2. Select the data source type.
fwf1 | 3. Select the file or website to which you want to connect.
3wck | 4. For a Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, or a text file, determine whether the connection is to one table or multiple tables or it requires a custom SQL connection:
jq2u | ° If the connection is to one table, select the table.
9zf9 | ° If the connection is to multiple tables, select the option for the connection to multiple tables and identify the join conditions. We will discuss this in detail in the next section.
clwo | ° Alternatively, you can type or paste a custom SQL.
aki1 | 5. When all the selections have been made, click on Ok.
vf5h | Now that you have learned what data sources look like and how they are structured, we will give you a couple of examples of data connections.
l51p | In the first exercise, we will connect to the World Bank's environment indicators. You can download this data, which is formatted either for Microsoft Excel or as a text file, at www.worldbank.org.
s9zz | This data source is not formatted properly, which is shown in the following screenshot. It has a spacer row between the top of the worksheet and the headers' rows, and the years in which the measurements were taken were distributed as columns rather than individual dimensional values in a row.
x97k | Once we connect to the file, we will use Tableau Public's new data interpreter to clean up and pivot the rows:

kwpw | The data source user interface
usfa | Before loading data, it's important to know what the different parts of the data connection user interface are. The Tableau Public 9.x user interface that is used for the connection to data is shown in the following screenshot. Don't forget that the Start button remains in the upper-left corner of the UI. You can click on it from either the data source window or a worksheet to get back to the Start menu:
dnjr | The parts of the user interface and their descriptions are as follows. The parts have been given in alphabetical references:

lw7l | To load this file into Tableau Public, we will start with a new Tableau Public workbook. You can download the Tableau Public workbook that we used for this chapter by visiting https: //public.tableau.com/profile/tableau.data. stories#! /. The following steps will guide you through how to connect a file to Tableau Public:
2exi | 1. Open a new instance of Tableau Public.
16py | 2. From the Connect pane, click on the data file type to which you'd like to connect. In this case, we are using an excel file.
m4ov | 3. Browse to the file to which you would like to connect.
9uqd | 4. Drag a table from the list of tables, which is a list of different worksheets in this case, along with the workbook onto the workspace.
8szx | 5. Note that the values in the data source are now populating the space below the workspace, but at least with this data set, there is no complete set of field headers. We will edit the data source by using the data interpreter in the next exercise.
iwdc | The name of the data source is showing a concatenation of the name of the workbook and the table name. Click on it (in the previous screenshot, it's A) to give the data source a good name. Remember that anything that you publish on Tableau Public is available for other people to download, and since they aren't able to see the actual origin of your data source, it's a good idea to give it an explicit name so that there are no errors of attribution.

nyqt | Using the data interpreter
7odd | Tableau Public 9.x has a new feature that is designed to reduce the amount of transformation that you need to do to your data sources. The data interpreter automatically detects where the first row of headers or data is in a Microsoft Excel data file, and if there are empty or semi-structured rows before the data, it can remove them. (The data interpreter does not work with text files.)
0le2 | The following data source has the following major errors in it:
5dw0 | . There are two rows of mostly blank, non-data values before the first row of the valid data; we will use the data interpreter to fix this
i4yq | · The years in which the measurements were taken should be going down a column rather than across the columns; we will pivot the data in the next exercise to fix this
fj3g | We will use the data interpreter to fix the first problem. In the following screenshot, you will see that Tableau Public has suggested that we use the data interpreter. The steps are as follows:
zuua | 1. Under the workspace, note that Tableau Public has recognized that the data might not be formatted properly and has suggested using the data interpreter. Click on the button that says Turn on:

jnqv | www.it-ebooks.info
unp3 | Chapter 3
v8vk | 2. Now that the data interpreter is on, you can review the results in the following screenshot and see how the data was transformed:
sr40 | The two rows of garbage are now gone, and the field headers are populating properly. We still need to resolve the issue of the date dimension going across the columns rather than down a column. We can resolve this by pivoting the data.
5zjj | Pivoting data
f56l | Pivoting data is a capability designed to help you resolve issues within data sources, like in the previous example, where the date dimension is not formatted properly.
ar2z | By highlighting the headers, you can pivot them from columns into rows by performing the following steps:
yad0 | 1. Highlight the field headers that you need to pivot. In this case, we click on 1960 and scroll all the way to the right, holding down the Shift key as we select columns.
3g38 | 2. Right-click on a selected header and choose Pivot.
vtbo | 3. The pivoted fields now have transformed into two new columns -the headers that you selected appear as values in a new column called pivot field names, and the measures now appear in a field called pivot field values.
q8pa | 4. Right-click on the headers for each of these fields and rename them. We renamed Pivot field names to Year and Pivot field values to Measure.

00aw | 5. Check out the following modified data source. It is now formatted properly, but there is one issue - the numerous rows with null values. We will edit those in the next exercise:
351p | Filtering data sources
zzcb | It's reasonable to expect that you won't need to load all the data in the data source. It is important to load only what you need because the more the data in the data source, the slower it will be. In the current example that we are using, there are many rows with null values. The reason that they have null values is that for the selected measure, no measurement was taken for certain time periods.
mxnx | The null values are different from measurements of zero. Values of zero mean that a measurement was taken and the value was zero. Null means that no measurement was taken.
11k8 | We have no reason to load rows with null values. Therefore, we can filter them as follows:
twwy | 1. In the upper-right corner under Filters, click on Add.
fyp8 | 2. Click on Add again.
z994 | 3. Select the field that you wish to filter. (We filtered on Measure).
vvqn | 4. Since Measure is a measure and not a dimension, we see a continuous spectrum of values. But we want to include everything except null values.
p6xg | 5. Click on the Special button on the upper-right side.
bppc | 6. Click on Non-null values.
ilnw | 7. Click on OK.
f3rc | 8. Click on OK again.
d7bx | 1
gx97 | The data source shows values of zero, but not null. The data source is almost complete. The only item that is remaining before we can start using filter is joining it with another table in the same data source.

2kb3 | Joining tables
lqcx | In this exercise, we will join the fact table with a dimension of the countries so that we can group the countries by region. A join is a logic statement in which you tell Tableau's data engine how two tables are related to each other. There are two parts to it, the join types (the left join, inner join, right join, or outer join) and the join conditions.
3h7w | . The left join: This keeps all the records from the left (or first) table and the corresponding records from the right (or second) table.
th5p | . The inner join: This keeps only the records from both the tables that match the join condition.
b7nk | . The right join: It is the opposite of the left join; it keeps all the records from the right table and only the corresponding records from the left table. Outer joins keep all the fields from all the tables.
cbb5 | 1
5qcf | [ The availability of join types depends on your data source. For this data source, we can create an inner join or a left join.
8u2c | A join condition is where you tell Tableau Public's data engine, which is functioning as a database management system in this case, how the two tables are related. In order to join tables, you need to have at least one field whose contents occur in both tables. In the following example, we will join our tables by the country name so that we can see the corresponding region for each country.
c1e3 | ]
7pez | Tableau Public will automatically join your tables on the first fields that occur alphabetically in both the tables and have the exact same field name and field type.
qs5t | In order to add new tables, you need to drag them from the list of tables on the left into the workspace next to the existing tables:
en4s | 1. Drag the Country Metadata table into the workspace and drop it next to the Environmental Fact Table.
csb5 | 2. Tableau Public automatically detects the field that occurs first in both data sources alphabetically and has the following properties:
i096 | ° The exact same field name, including capitalization and punctuation
tlzt | ° The same field type

0yxe | 3. You can view and edit the Join details by clicking on the Venn diagram icon between the tables, as shown in the following screenshot. In this case, our data sources are joined by Country Code, which is correct. In order to select different fields, click on the name of the joined field and replace it with someone more appropriate:
erre | 4. When you are satisfied that the join condition is correct, click on the Venn diagram icon again.
835g | 1 L
x3l9 | . The additional fields, with their source table name appended in parentheses, are included in the data set below the workspace.
d2fj | 5. Just because a field is included in a join condition, it does not mean that you need to load it in the workbook. You also do not need duplicates of existing fields. For that reason, click on the Country Name (Country Metadata) and Country Code (Country Metadata) fields, which already occur in the fact table, and from their context menus, select Hide, as shown in the following screenshot:
geyi | 6. If you would like to see the fields that you have hidden, click on the checkbox next to the Show Hidden Fields text above the data source.

09xa | When you load a new data source, the following are some of the several items that you should check before you can use it:
yi97 | · Confirm that all the dimensions, are in fact in the Dimensions pane, rather than in the Measures pane
4zj7 | . Confirm that the data source types of all the fields are correct. For instance, in this data source, Year is formatted as a string, but it really should be a number
3wgh | · We can change the data type by right-clicking on the field, selecting Change Data Type, and choosing Number (Whole)
uvo3 | Connecting to web-based data sources
yjbv | The steps required to connect to OData are different from the steps required to connect to the previously mentioned sources because they involve web servers and network security. These steps are a subset of the steps in Desktop Professional that are used to connect to a server:

d2za | 4 Visualization - Tips and Types
r38m | A journalist or blogger who uses Tableau Public must convert data to visualizations so that readers can quickly understand large quantities of data that have been distilled down to a single graphic. The role of an author is data abstraction, the conversion of real-life data into visual cues (primitives, as some people who work in the field of data science call them), such as colors, shapes, lengths, and positions. The role of your reader is to do the reverse, consume data primitives and convert them back into real-life things, events, and phenomenon. If you have done a poor job choosing the elements of your data visualization, your readers will have a difficult time relating your visualization to the real world, which means that the story that you're telling isn't as compelling as it should be. Your visualization will not have the value that you wanted, because the connection between the data visualization and the underlying data has been broken.
qq0z | Before you create a visualization for people to utilize, there are several considerations that go into the design. The following are some of these considerations:
