DA release in the NAc is regulated by cholinergic interneurons within the NAc, which are tonically active and release acetylcholine. Acetylcholine binds to nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors on DA nerve terminals to directly depolarize DA terminals increasing striatal DA release independently of somatic firing, which provides a distinct modulatory mechanism. Moreover, terminal DA signalling depends on DA\ngc7v | receptor availability and the efficiency of DA clearance, which is determined by the DA transporter, the level of enzymatic degradation of DA by COMT, mainly in cortex and less in DA midbrain, and its diffusion from the synapse. The inhibitory DA auto-receptor D2 modulates several of these regulatory steps: Upon binding of DA to axonal D2 receptors in the NAc, it reduces the\nwqfv | exocytotic release of DA from axon terminals, increases the activity of the DAT and consequently DA clearance from the synaptic cleft. It also inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase activity and therefore DA synthesis. Somatodendritic D2 receptors in the VTA also regulate DA signalling. Upon DA release from the soma and dendrites, DA binds to somatodendritic D2 receptors, which activates hyperpolarizing G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel currents resulting in reduced firing rate and excitability of VTA DA neurons. While both axonal and somatodendritic D2 receptors reduce DA signalling onto medium spiny neurons in the NAc, it is unclear how regulation of DA signalling via axonal and somatodendritic D2 receptors is intertwined and whether treatments, that change efferent axonal DA release, also cause similar changes in local somatodendritic DA release. Additionally, neuronal DA signalling is modulated by surrounding astrocytes, along with microglia and oligodendrocytes, which are important for the homeostasis of the brain microenvironment.\n7bdk | One point three.
