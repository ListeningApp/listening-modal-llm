As a warmup, let's figure out the entropy of a single particle in a box. In fact, let's start with a free classical particle in a one-dimensional box: that is, in some interval [zero, L].\nhqgv | The first step is to compute its partition function. As you can see, this is easy enough. But the whole idea raises some questions. Some people get freaked out by the concept of entropy for a single particle, I guess because it involves probability theory for a single particle, and they think probability only applies to large numbers of things.\ntf20 | I sometimes ask these people \"how large counts as large?\" In fact the foundations of probability theory are just as mysterious for large numbers of things as for just one thing. What do probabilities really mean? We could argue about this all day: Bayesian versus frequentist interpretations of probability, etc. I said a tiny bit about this before, and I won't say more now.\nar2w | Large numbers of things tend to make large deviations less likely. For example, the chance of having all the gas atoms in a box all on the left side is less if you have one thousand atoms than if you have just two. This makes us worry less about using averages and probability.\nu6pz | But the math of probability works the same for small numbers of particles-even one particle! Even better, knowing the entropy of one particle in a box will help us understand the entropy of a million particles in a box-at least if they don't interact, as we assume for an ideal gas.\n4bof | But why just a one-dimensional box? The answer is that particle in a three-dimensional box is mathematically the same as three noninteracting distinguishable particles in a one-dimensional box! The x, y, and z coordinates of the three d particle act like positions of three one d particles.\n6s2c | PARTICLE IN A BOX: EXPECTED ENERGY\nugrk | A classical free particle of mass m in a one d box of length L has partition function\nteua | Z equals L divided by h times the square root of two pi m divided by beta. The expected energy of any system in thermal equilibrium is\nv8g1 | expected value of E equals negative d divided by d beta of ln Z. So, by the miracle of basic calculus, we get\n2y4v | expected value of E equals one divided by two beta equals one divided by two k T as we'd expect from the equipartition theorem!\nzl6z | We worked out the partition function of a classical free particle in a one-dimensional box. From this we can work out its expected energy. Look how simple it is! It's just one divided by two k T, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature!\nxmyv | Why is the final answer so simple? We can use the chain rule\npu5p | d divided by d beta of ln Z equals one divided by Z d Z divided by d beta to see that only the power of beta in\nmxd4 | Z equals L divided by h times the square root of two pi m divided by beta matters, not all the constants: these constants show up in d Z divided by d beta, but also in one divided by Z, and they cancel. The length L, the mass m, Planck's constant h, the factor of two pi none of this junk matters! Not for the expected energy, anyway. Because Z is proportional to beta to the power of negative one half, we simply get\n6z51 | expected value of E equals one divided by two k T. More generally, if the partition function of a system is proportional to beta to the power of negative c, its expected energy will be\nhxt0 | c k T. Z proportional to beta to the power of negative c implies expected value of E equals c k T. But when is the partition function of a system proportional to beta to the power of negative c? It's enough for the system's energy to be a positive definite quadratic form in n real variables-which physicists call 'degrees of freedom'. Then c equals n divided by two. We've already seen an example with two degrees of freedom: the classical harmonic oscillator. We saw that in this example Z proportional to one divided by beta. This gives expected value of E equals k T. But the result is quite general:\nq1mg | Puzzle forty-five. Suppose we have a system with state space R to the power of n and energy function E from R to the power of n to R that is a positive definite quadratic form, so that\nbi15 | E of x equals one divided by two norm of A x squared for some invertible n times n matrix A. Show that its partition function is proportional to beta to the power of negative c where\nzm4q | c equals n divided by two. In fact, this is just a new outlook on our friend the equipartition theorem.\n81dg | Here's another thing to consider. While our particle in a one dimensional box has two degrees of freedom-position and momentum-its energy depends on just one of these, and quadratically on that one. So its expected energy is one divided by two n k T where n equals one, not\n8gco | n equals two. So here's another puzzle for you:\n```",
