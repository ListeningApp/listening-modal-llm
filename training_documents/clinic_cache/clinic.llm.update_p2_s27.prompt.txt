You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

sy14 | · FQ-1 assesses the prevalence of subjects who achieved the afore- mentioned endpoints at the end of APT/start of SPC.
ghss | · FQ-2 was the incidence of tooth loss (periodontitis-related when available) for treated subjects who had been in SPC for a minimum of 5 years and its association with various endpoints.
3s61 | Study design: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort (pro- spective/retrospective), case-control and cross-sectional studies pub- lished from 2017 were included. Cross-sectional studies were included if the original retrospective data from the study could be obtained. Studies selected for FQ-1 with a minimum SPC follow-up of 5 years were used to answer FQ-2.
s3rm | 2.3 Literature search |
pqxb | A search strategy was formulated with an experienced librarian using a combination of MeSH and free-text terms (Supplemental Material S1), with no language restrictions. Electronic database searches included Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Con- trolled Trials (CENTRAL) and OpenGrey from 2017 to 18 February 2022. This was complemented by a manual search of the Journal of Dental Research, the Journal of Clinical Periodontology, the Journal of Periodontology and the Journal of Periodontal Research from 2017 to 18 February 2022. Reference lists of the included articles and relevant reviews were manually searched. Editors of the above-named journals were contacted about any articles in press that fit the inclusion criteria.
08qc | 2.4 | Screening and study inclusion
hdj2 | Study selection was based on a two-step approach: (i) screening of titles and abstracts and (ii) full-text analysis, with reasons for exclusion (Supplemental Material S2). Full texts were obtained for those studies selected by at least one reviewer. Both steps were performed in dupli- cate by two independent reviewers (V.R. and D.R.). Disagreements were resolved by consensus. An arbitrator (L.N.) was consulted if the disagreement could not be resolved. Where studies showed duplica- tion of the subject sample or database, the first published study with all the required data or relevant multi-centre study were selected. Inter-observer agreement at both stages was assessed via the Cohen's kappa statistic. The corresponding authors were contacted to confirm inclusion, as individual patient data (IPD) are rarely reported.
a57g | 2.5 Data collection |
g8m3 | 2.5.1 Data extraction |
a9av | Data were extracted from journal articles based on the general study and population characteristics (Table 1). Subject-, tooth- and site-level data for periodontal parameters <LATEX>\mathrm { \left( P P D \right. } \pm \mathrm { B o P }</LATEX> were extracted from individual 6-point pocket charts or datasets, sent by the journal article authors, by one reviewer (V.R.). Alternatively, the authors completed <LATEX>a</LATEX> summary data collection form if they opted to do their own re- analysis (Supplemental Material S3). Depending on availability, data were for subjects accounted for in the sample size of the selected journal article or the whole database on which the journal article was based. Data were entered into tables stratified by study design on
73l3 | Microsoft Excel. Data consistency, completeness and sequence gener- ation were reviewed by the second reviewer (D.R.). Any disagree- ments were resolved by consensus. An arbitrator (L.N.) was consulted if the disagreement could not be resolved.
ornm | 2.5.2 RoB assessment |
u2z1 | Quality assessment was carried out by one reviewer (D.R.) and reviewed independently by V.R. Included studies were assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) 2 Tool for RCTs (Sterne et al., 2019), the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort and case-control studies (Wells et al., 2011) and the AXIS tool for cross-sectional studies (Downes et al., 2016). Disagreements were resolved by consensus. An arbitrator (L.N.) was consulted if it could not be resolved.
atmh | 2.6 | Data analyses
7hgg | The data were used to assess the prevalence of achieving the aforemen- tioned endpoints at the subject-level and, when possible, tooth level. Although 'stable periodontitis' defines a case at the subject-level, the com- posite measures defining the endpoint <LATEX>\left( P P D \leq 4 m m \right.</LATEX> and <LATEX>P P D = 4 \quad m m</LATEX> + BoP) were used at the tooth level to identify the teeth responsible for not meeting the endpoint. The number of diseased teeth per patient, as per WWC 2017, was calculated using the total number of 'unstable' teeth divided by the total number of (i) subjects and (ii) 'unstable' subjects.
xwsv | Incidence of tooth loss within a minimum duration of 5 years of SPC was recorded at the subject- and tooth-level in relation to the various endpoints. The number of teeth lost per patient per SPC year was calcu- lated using the total number of teeth lost divided by the total number of subjects with tooth loss data divided by the weighted average SPC years.
756b | Authors of journal articles were contacted if any queries arose from the data. Where data were unavailable for a subject, the corre- sponding subject was eliminated from the analyses.
