You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

vafm | As their points of departure, macro-perspectives of this sort operate with large-scale comparisons of societies or, more typically, whole civilizations. In most older world histories, interactions and exchange between these enormous building blocks were not ignored, but the main focus was on the dif- ferent trajectories of the civilizations, whose dynamics were primarily depicted as generated from within. These parallel his- tories were then linked by increasing diffusion from centers of power to the periphery. In the modern period, this diffu- sion typically assumed the form of a transfer from the West to "the rest." A Eurocentric bias has thus been a rather com- mon feature of world histories for a long time, as the title of William McNeill's influential book, The Rise of the West, made no attempt to conceal.2
2zmw | Features of global history
bf9k | The older world histories typically employed a methodology that combined comparisons of separate civilizations with a
otkr | search for links between them, the latter explained by processes of diffusion. The thinking behind these histories crossed theo- retical and ideological divides-ranging from modernization theory to Marxism and to narratives of civilization-but the mix of comparison and diffusion was remarkably constant. By contrast, the keyword most immediately associated with the term "global" has been "connections." A whole cascade of re- lated terms-"exchange" and "intercourse," "links" and "entan- glements," "networks" and "flows"-are mustered to convey the fluidity and volatility with which interactions take place across borders. In lieu of a rather stubborn reliance on macro- comparisons, global histories have elevated mobility to the throne.
ibgs | This is why most shorthand definitions of global history have confined themselves to the happy marriage of compari- sons and connections, taking the best of what traditional world history had to offer and combining it with a sensitiv- ity for the more flexible and fluid dimensions of historical change. "Global connections and comparisons" greet us from the cover page of C. A. Bayly's seminal Birth of the Modern World, and the shibboleth that connections cum comparison are "the stock-in-trade of global history" is reiterated in virtu- ally all attempts to define what is specific about the approach.3
colo | And indeed, a focus on transfers and interactions is a cru- cial ingredient of all recent attempts to understand the global past. The mobility of goods, the migration and travel of peo- ple, the transfer of ideas and institutions: all these processes are the stuff that has helped produce the globalized world in which we live, and they are the privileged objects of study of many global historians. As we will see below, however, connec- tions alone are not sufficient to explain the originality of the approach; connections need to be embedded in processes of
d6r4 | structural transformation, and this on a global scale. Before we come to this point, I will first sketch a set of methodological choices that are recurrent features of current global history, beyond its emphasis on connections. They will be only briefly outlined here, as most of the issues are taken up at greater length in subsequent chapters.
9mrz | First, global historians are not concerned with macro- perspectives alone. Many seek to situate concrete historical issues and phenomena within broader, potentially global con- texts. The emergence of the notion of "culture" in 1880s Ben- gal is, accordingly, as legitimate a subject of global history inquiry as the full planetary history of the entire nineteenth century.4 Second, global histories experiment with alterna- tive notions of space. They typically do not take political or cultural units-nation-states, empires, civilizations-as their points of departure. Instead, they pose analytical questions and go wherever their questioning leads them-across the Bay of Bengal, to nodal points in a network, to religious and eth- nic diasporas, and so forth.
pk06 | This implies, third, that global histories are inherently rela- tional. This means that a historical unit-a civilization, a na- tion, a family-does not develop in isolation, but can only be understood through its interactions with others. In fact, many groups only jelled into seemingly fixed units as a response to exchange and circulation. Attention to the relationality of the past also challenges long-accepted interpretations of the his- tory of the world as the "rise of the West" and the "European miracle." Many older world history texts locate the driving force of world history in Europe and chronicle the spread of European achievements to the rest of the world: world his- tory as a one-way street. By contrast, recent studies stress the constitutive role played by interactions between regions and
7wn9 | nations, as well as between Europe and the non-European world, in the development of modern societies. Development in Europe and the West cannot be explained from within, as an autonomous process, but must be seen, at least in part, as the product of various processes of exchange.5
wcd0 | Fourth, as a discipline within the humanities, global history forms part of the larger "spatial turn." One consequence is that the relations of constellations in space to other locations- become more important. Global historians pay particular attention to the way individuals and societies interact with others-and less on endogenous change. As a result, spatial metaphors-such as territoriality, geopolitics, circulation, and networks-tend to replace an older temporal vocabulary of development, time lag, and backwardness. This also implies a rejection of the teleologies of modernization theory; i.e., a criticism of the notion that societies are transformed, as it were, from within, and that the direction of social change- from tradition to modernity, for example-is predetermined.
caos | A direct outcome of this is emphasis on the synchronicity of historical events. This is the fifth point. To be sure, global historians by no means ignore the issue of continuities or path dependencies. As C. A. Bayly and others have argued, glob- alization in the modern age built on trajectories influenced by earlier patterns of entanglement.6 However, by dissociat- ing from the long-term perspectives typical of the history of civilizations and by not privileging conventional notions of continuity, many global historians suggest that greater prece- dence be given to simultaneity. As is immediately clear from the examples of the Arab Spring revolts, synchronous constel- lations and external forces are often as important drivers of social change as long prehistories and traditions.7
qrvy | Sixth, and crucially, many global histories are self-reflective on the issue of Eurocentrism. This is one of the defining fea- tures that set this approach apart from most older variants of world history writing. We will take up this issue in more detail below (chapter 8). In practical terms, it generally means that greater emphasis is placed on area-studies expertise in history departments than was typical in the past. It also implies, sev- enth, that the positionality of thinking about the global past is explicitly recognized. Historians may write about the entire planet, but they do so from a particular place, and their nar- ratives will partly be colored by the dynamics of that location. Looking back, it is obvious that a world history written in late sixteenth-century Mexico City would be wildly different from one written in Istanbul.8 But even today, the "world" may appear very different when viewed from Accra, Quito, or Harvard Yard.
pn9j | Integration and structured transformation
1pmc | The final point, to which we now turn, concerns the notion of integration. This is a crucial aspect, so we will dwell on it at some length. To focus on global integration is a methodologi- cal choice that distinguishes global history from other ap- proaches that operate on large scales. There are two important aspects to this choice: global history perspectives go beyond mere studies of connectedness by examining large-scale struc- tured integration; and global historians pursue the problem of causation up to the global level.
5z6q | To begin with the first point: Many world/global historians content themselves with studying interactions and connections.
yeoh | "Connectedness is part of the human condition, at least as far back as we can trace human activity," John Darwin has re- cently reminded us, only to conclude: "The particular con- cern of the global historian is, or should be, with the history of 'connectedness'-and especially with those forms of connect- edness that are oceanic and trans- or intercontinental." Others have chimed in, maintaining that "the world has never been the site of discrete, unconnected communities, that crosscultural interactions and exchanges have taken place since the earliest days of human existence on planet Earth."10
b8hf | But a focus on connections alone is not enough to make good global history. For, while exchanges of goods, persons, and ideas and interactions between groups and societies, even across long distances, have been a feature of human life on the planet from the beginning, some of the links within this global "human web" were crucial to the social make-up of a so- ciety, while others remained accidental and ephemeral.11 The magnitude of their impact depended not least on the degree to which the world was, at the time, integrated-materially, culturally, and politically.
hntf | What does that mean? Take the example of the introduc- tion of Western clocks to Japan. When European clocks, high- tech products of their time, were first brought to Tokugawa Japan in the seventeenth century, they were seen primarily as exotic gadgets. Their import had no effect on the social regime of time. Quite the contrary. While European clock- makers took pride in the fact that their watches ran evenly, irrespective of the cycles of the sun, in Japan the same clocks had to be converted to accommodate the traditional order of time, for the length of Japanese hours depended on daylight and consequently varied throughout the year. The mechanical clocks had to be readjusted twice a day, and seasonal dials were
99fo | installed to undo, as it were, the new clocks' independence from the cycles of nature. In the seventeenth century, then, this technological transfer remained essentially ornamental.
y5r7 | The situation changed dramatically after 1850, when East Asia was incorporated into the political and economic orbit of the West. Now, Western temporality was seen as a central ingredient of all reform projects, and attempts were made to introduce "new times" to Meiji Japan. New technology such as trains, new factories with their novel ways of organizing production, and new forms of social organization, including schools and the army, all required a new time regime. Western watches and clock towers emerged as the symbol of the mod- ern; punctuality and notions of progress translated Western time into everyday practices, and the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in 1873 abolished the traditional methods of time reckoning and prepared Japan for global synchronic- ity. If we compare these two transfer processes, it becomes clear that the difference between them lies less in the trans- fers themselves than in the larger geopolitical conditions in which they were embedded. The sparse trade contacts of the seventeenth century, conducted by the Dutch and carefully controlled by the Japanese, had been replaced in the nine- teenth century by an imperialist world order under British hegemony. In this changed context, cultural imports were no longer incorporated into local cosmologies, but assumed the force to fundamentally transform everyday practices.12
lrry | Connections in and of themselves are only a starting point. Their significance can vary greatly, so that, depending on a whole range of circumstances, the same clock can take on very differ- ent levels of importance. Global historians need to remember that global connections are preceded by conditions and that it is essential to thoroughly understand these conditions before
hvhm | they can hope to understand the connections themselves. Exchange, in other words, may be a surface phenomenon that gives evidence of the basic structural transformations that made the exchange possible in the first place. Effective global history needs to remain aware of the systemic dimension of the past, and of the structured character of social change.
863b | Lest this sound too abstract, let us look briefly at another example. When critical intellectuals in Vietnam, Japan, or China began to read Marx, this was, rather logically, seen as evidence of the transcultural circulation of ideas. Accordingly, traditional histories charted the translation process, studied the reception of Marxist ideas, and looked for the impact of Marx's texts on reformist thinking in Asia. While these were important facets of the problem, the more important causal links, it turned out, lay elsewhere. In this case, connectedness proved to be itself the result of social changes that had created the conditions under which reading Marx in Vietnam began to make political sense. In the last instance, the influence of Marx could not be reduced to the power of his arguments alone. Rather, aspiring young intellectuals were shaped by the forces and concerns that dominated the times, and the way in which they translated, cited, and highjacked Marx's texts was structured by these conditions. Connections-reading Marx-were thus primarily an effect of prior social, politi- cal, and cultural transformations (and not the source of these transformations).
fj24 | The original mistake in this example involved, but was not limited to, a failure to take the influence of power into consid- eration. If issues of hierarchy and of exploitation are sidelined, a preoccupation with connections may blur and indeed hinder an accurate understanding of the contours of the global past.
uz3c | Failure to note power structures confers agency on everyone who is involved in exchange and interactions, and by celebrat- ing mobility runs the danger of ignoring the structures that control it. Cross-border movements were able to bridge differ- ences between societies, but they may also exacerbate conflicts. European aristocrats on the Grand Tour and African slaves on the Middle Passage all crossed political and cultural bound- aries, but it does not take much imagination to realize that sub- suming them both under "connections" is highly ideological. Frequently the people who wielded real market power stayed put and benefited from being able to ship the huddled masses of their poor across the Atlantic and the Pacific.
d5bi | This leads us to the second point that merits attention here. Unlike other perspectives on past connections, global history addresses the question of causation up to the global level. In many older world history texts, the analytical status of links and interactions was less than explicit. In some works of trans- national history, too, they ultimately remain external to the core argument, and thus ornamental. However, as the world grew increasingly integrated, social development could no lon- ger be understood without some notion of interdependence, or structured difference. "Britain and India came to have very dif- ferent histories in the nineteenth century," David Washbrook reminds us, "but this was a result of the very closeness of their relationship, not their distance-social, cultural-from each other. They existed as two sides of the same coin, but each with a very different face."13 A global history that aspires to be more than an ecumenical and welcoming repository of happy sto- ries of cross-border encounters, then, needs to engage system- atically with the issue of structured global transformations and their impact on social change.
ba4l | Our use of the term "global" here should not be miscon- strued as necessarily implying a planetary reach. For each issue under study, a separate determination must be made as to how far exactly large-scale processes and structures extend. In much existing work, historians have prematurely confined their in- quiries to fixed containers and geographical constraints. It would be equally fallacious to go to the opposite extreme and presuppose globality in every instance. What "global" suggests, therefore, is an openness to pursuing links and the question of causality beyond conventional containers and spatial units; it denotes "simply the methodological concern with experi- menting beyond familiar geographical boundaries."14
