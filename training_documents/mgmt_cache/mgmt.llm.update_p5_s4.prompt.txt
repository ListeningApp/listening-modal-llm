You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

6d4s | Context consists of the wider environmental context, "the broad set of stimuli-exogenous to the focal organization-that shape the management dis- course" (e.g., Toyota's Japanese context), and the organizational context, "the administrative and social mechanisms that management can manipulate to shape the behaviors of actors in the organization" (e.g., Samsung's organizational cul- ture and management systems). Birkinshaw et al. argue that "these two aspects of context potentially influence all activities associated with management innova- tion" but never provide further detail of what these contexts might actually consist of.15 In other words, how context influences management innovating largely remains a mystery in the management innovation literature.
mqah | Still, other work has provided insights into aspects of environmental and organizational context. In the environmental context, the nature of a country's institutions (such as its laws, corporate governance systems, and national culture) plays an important role in shaping what kinds of management innovations emerge and when.16 But technology is also known to be an important factor since it offers new opportunities,17 as does the presence of competitive pressure, which may force a firm to innovate.18 In terms of the organizational context, important fac- tors to consider for the successful implementation of management practices are a firm's leadership (especially from the top), fit with the existing structure, and resources (including the right kind of organizational culture).19
xxr8 | How does the environmental and organizational contexts affect management inno- vating in an emerging market multinational characterized by VUCA? An answer to this question raises the intriguing possibility that the sources of competitive advantage of Chinese and other emerging market multinationals may lie not just in cost advantages, or even the ability to come up with innovative products, but also in innovative management practices.
rl4j | Our research on Rendanheyi suggests that both the organizational context and the environmental context contributed greatly to management innovating at Haier. Three key factors emerge for each type. In the organizational context, we found that structure, leadership, and resources were all clearly connected to the management innovation process. In the environmental context, we observed the influences of competitive, technological, and institutional aspects of the environ- ment. Eventually, leadership turned out to be the most important of these factors. Figure 1 captures the overall model.
vz32 | Our research on Haier is based on personal interviews with senior execu- tives (including the Haier Group chairman) and owner-CEOs of xiaowei (micro- enterprises) involved in the design and implementation of Rendanheyi, as well as external consultants and experts who advised senior executives on the company's

We also conducted a tour of the company's Qingdao site and attended a symposium dedicated to Rendanheyi in Beijing. Finally, we consulted internal and external documents to supplement these observations.

mt0f | The Making of the Haier Group
awab | Like other leading Chinese manufacturing firms, Haier has become an effective competitor of western firms over the last decade and a half. But Chinese firms are not known for inventing radical modern management practices. In par- ticular, Chinese management practices are said to maximize efficiency and fast commercialization, and innovative firms from China are said to "excel at cost reduction, accelerated product development and networked production."20 This suggests the Chinese management focus may well support product development and production activities but is unlikely to support creativity and management innovation. So how was Rendanheyi developed, and why did it make sense for Haier to invent it?
ixcc | The Haier Group began as a nearly bankrupt refrigerator company called Qingdao General Refrigerator based in Qingdao, a city in China's coastal Shandong province. In 1984, a young municipal official Zhang Ruimin was appointed as plant director. He had a zeal for improvement from the start, and that same year, he introduced technology and equipment from the German company Liebherr to produce refrigerators. In 1990, the company started exports to Europe as a contract
8p6h | manufacturer for multinational brands. Zhang said, "We started exporting to devel- oped markets first because if your products are good enough for consumers in Europe and in the United States, you will have better products in developing mar- kets." In 1992, the company was re-named the Haier Group, and, in 1993, Zhang was named CEO.
pmgl | Zhang began to focus Haier's attention around key beliefs that have sus- tained its management innovating ever since: continuous external environmental change requires continuous internal change; customer service, not existing prod- ucts, is key to maintaining Haier's forward motion; price competition is ultimately destructive; Haier needs to offer more, not less, to China's increasingly sophisti- cated customers; the secret of what Haier can offer the customer lies in the knowl- edge of Haier' s employees; all too often, an existing organization structure constrains, rather than liberates, employee talent; and only by making the "employment agreement" equitable to all who are affected by it (customers, orga- nization, and employees) can a powerful incentive engine be constructed to drive continuous change. Haier's story is one of consistent change.
90no | By the 1990s, Haier acquired many other Chinese companies. The product range expanded beyond refrigerators to include home appliances such as washing machines, televisions, air conditioners, and telecommunications equipment. The company improved its products by acquiring foreign technology through joint ventures and strategic alliances with companies such as Mitsubishi of Japan and Merloni of Italy. Zhang said, "First we observe and digest. Then we imitate. In the end, we understand it well enough to design it independently."21 By 1998, the Haier Group had a market share of more than 30% in refrigerators, washing machines, and air conditioners in the Chinese market.
jt0y | However, the Chinese home appliances market was saturated, and the Chinese government encouraged Chinese enterprises to expand internationally. Furthermore, Haier faced greater domestic competition, as foreign companies began to expand aggressively in the Chinese market. Therefore, the Haier Group began setting up operations overseas, including in the United States (1999), Italy (2001), and Germany (2001). It emulated the strategies of successful Japanese and Korean firms such as Sony, Samsung, and LG in terms of taking its own brand to foreign markets and in terms of establishing production as well as R&D in west- ern countries. By the mid-2000s, Haier was an established, successful global brand.
qb7o | The Making of Rendanheyi
oae5 | Not satisfied with past achievements, Haier's senior management had the ambition to become the global industry leader and to create a truly innovative global company that competes on the basis of new product innovations. In 2005, Yang Mianmian, group president at the time, said, "We are number three in the world for white goods, we want to be number one."22 Around that time, Zhang first used the word "Rendanheyi," which was aimed at achieving (in Zhang's words) "zero distance to the customer," whereby the entire corporate structure is
