You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

nehb | Q: It is often said that it is better to leave people with their beliefs, rather than to disturb them.
b3ac | A: If the belief is equivalent to believing that an appendix pain is the work of the devil, it is wrong to leave the patient with it, for he is likely to die.
e55f | THE MAN WHO FELL OFF A MOUNTAIN
k9so | It may not be our role to do anything for him, but on the lower level, we can't be prevented from alluding to his state. People like this sometimes resemble the man who fell off a mountain. When he had reached half-way down, he said to himself: 'five thousand feet and nothing has happened yet - in fact it is quite pleasurable'.
uwlw | We may have to leave such a man alone, but we can't help noting his real situation. Such people are often those who turn up and say: 'I am following the X Path, and I find it rewarding, but I would like to add a little of your wisdom ... '
26e7 | WHAT RELIGION IS
54p5 | The belief that something which is really, for instance, a selfish self-absorption in religious activity is anti-religion in effect. Sheikh Ibrahim Gazur-Ilahi truly says: 'That which takes you to God is religion/whatever stands between you and God is "the world" How many pious people realise that?
nzc0 | The levels of sociology and psychology, which your question regards as a 'reduction' are, in fact, essential to examine at the learning how to learn stage, because unless the psychology is correctly oriented, there is no spirituality, though there can be ob- session and emotionality, often mistaken for it Those who trade in such things, mistaking them for spirituality, have of course - knowingly or otherwise - a vested interest in discouraging interest in the psychological and sociological levels. Those interested in truth, however, cannot afford such luxuries. As for the social level, this and the psychological are dealt with by this quotation from one of the greatest of all Sufis, who is not dealing in spirituality, if you define this term narrowly:
uj1r | Sheikh Abdullah Ansari says:
fvix | What is worship? To realise reality. What is the sacred law? To do no evil. What is reality? Selflessness.
r8vh | This is the Sufi approach-not the other way about. There can be no spirituality, according to the Sufi masters, without psychology, psychological insight and sociological balance.
v5qp | So, if you are looking for spirituality which requires such insights, you have to look at the 'reduction' by the great classical Sufi masters, not by me, for I am no innovator in this respect. If, too, you imagine that the Sufis are not to be regarded as 'spiritual' because of their insistence on psy- chology and sociology, you are out of luck again: not only Islamic authorities but scholars from all faiths continue to regard the
g50z | Sufis as among the greatest exponents of the spiritual among humankind.
sy7u | THE INVISIBLE CAT
9wxf | But you must start where it counts: you cannot start halfway along and expect results. Mark Twain advertised, as a hoax, that he had lost a cat so black that it could not be seen by ordinary light, and wanted it back. Nearly a thousand people contacted him claiming to have seen it. Would you begin to teach such people, or at least people in such a state of mind, anything?
3p2p | THE ROBBER-PRIEST
wkdm | In England, no time ago, there was a priest who was a burglar, who even burgled another vicarage, an abbey and a school. He was caught trying to rob a bank, which he travelled to by taxi, having enlisted his housekeeper, convincing her that they were doing something good. Should the social and psychological levels of such a person not be looked at before proceeding with the spiritual, the higher, levels? Another priest got divorced and married a witch ...
unmm | On Attention
onbi | Characteristics of Attention and Observation
4rsf | Q: Can you define characteristics of attention and observation as of importance in Sufic studies?
a6rk | A: Study the attracting, extending and reception, as well as the interchange, of attention.
7qns | One of the keys to human behaviour is the attention-factor.
es6l | Anyone can verify that many instances, generally supposed to be important or useful human transactions on any subject (social, commercial, etc.,) are in fact disguised attention-situations.
mkn8 | It is contended that if a person does not know what he is doing (in this case that he is basically demanding, extending or ex- changing attention) and as a consequence thinks that he is doing something else (contributing to human knowledge, learning, buying, selling, informing, etc.,) he will (a) be more inefficient at both the overt and the covert activity; (b) have less capacity of planning his behaviour and will make mistakes of emotion and intellect because he considers attention to be other than it is.
z5nx | If this is true, it is most important that individuals realise:
1r1a | 1. That this attention-factor is operating in virtually all trans- actions;
v6kr | 2. That the apparent motivation of transactions may be other than it really is. And that it is often generated by the need or desire for attention-activity (giving, receiving, exchanging).
1sw8 | 3. That attention-activity, like any other demand for food, warmth, etc., when placed under volitional control, must result in increased scope for the human being who would then not be at the mercy of random sources of attention, or even more confused than usual if things do not pan out as they expect
4jb0 | CERTAIN PRINCIPLES MAY BE ENUNCIATED. THEY INCLUDE: -
dpn7 | 1. Too much attention can be bad, (inefficient).
pjw4 | 2. Too little attention can be bad.
aa9z | 3. Attention may be 'hostile' or friendly' and still fulfil the appetite for attention. This is confused by the moral aspect.
gml7 | 4. When people need a great deal of attention they are vulner- able to the message which too often accompanies the exercise of attention towards them. E.g., someone wanting attention might be able to get it only from some person or organisation which might thereafter exercise (as 'its price') an undue influence upon the attention-starved individual's mind.
0smi | 5. Present beliefs have often been inculcated at a time and under circumstances connected with attention-demand, and not arrived at by the method attributed to them.
wk0w | 6. Many paradoxical reversals of opinion, or of associates and commitments may be seen as due to the change in a source of attention.
7ae6 | 7. People are almost always stimulated by an offer of attention, since most people are frequently attention-deprived. This is one reason why new friends, or circumstances, for instance, may be pre- ferred to old ones.
m0ox | 8. If people could learn to assuage attention-hunger, they would be in a better position than most present cultures allow them, to attend to other things. They could extend the effectiveness of their learning capacity.
jc5v | 9. Among the things which unstarved people (in the sense of attention) could investigate, is the comparative attraction of ideas, individuals, etc., apart from their purely attention-supplying func- tion.
zl1c | 10. The desire for attention starts at an early stage of infancy. It is, of course, at that point linked with feeding and protection. This is not to say that this desire has no further nor future development value. But it can be adapted beyond its ordinary adult usage of mere satisfaction.
991b | 11. Even a cursory survey of human communities shows that, while the random eating tendency, possessiveness and other un- differentiated characteristics are very early trained or diverted-
adow | weaned-the attention-factor does not get the same treatment. The consequence is that the adult human being, deprived of any method of handling his desire for attention, continues to be confused by it: as it usually remains primitive throughout life.
rrb0 | 12. Very numerous individual observations of human trans- actions have been made. They show that an interchange between two people always has an attention-factor.
