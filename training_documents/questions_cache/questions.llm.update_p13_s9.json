By moving from a problem orientation toward a more rigorous and disciplined focus on essential questions, the organization is slowly shifting from a \"fix-it\" mode to an inquiry model for business and organizational strategy evolution. This company has found that maintaining a rigorous focus on \"questions that matter\" and hosting strategic conversations on the organization's \"big questions\" is a core competence for leaders at all levels.\nu5ug | How Can Leaders Engage Powerful Questions?\ni9k5 | For all organizations, in today's turbulent times, engaging people's best thinking about complex issues without easy answers will be the key to creating the futures we want rather than being forced to live with the futures we get. Leaders will need to develop capacity in the design of \"inquiring systems\" in order to learn, adapt, and create new knowledge to meet emerging opportunities and challenges in the more fluid organizational structures of the future. For example, the leadership challenges of the next twenty years are likely to revolve around the art of engaging and energizing networks rather than solely managing hierarchies as in the past. Successful leaders will be those who see organizations as living networks of conversation and collective meaning-making through which members create new knowledge and bring forth the future. They will understand how to operate in networks that are both internal and external to their organization.\n20z2 | In particular, we believe the following core capabilities, rarely taught in today's MBA or corporate leadership programs, will help define leadership excellence in a networked world where knowledge and learning are keys to success:\n4cgs | Engaging Strategic Questions. How many leaders today know how to frame strategic questions that open the space for thinking about possibilities rather than solving problems? How many leaders are comfortable with not knowing and can constructively help others bring forth their collective knowledge? How many leaders can engage their workers in discovering the \"big questions\" that lie at the heart of their organization's future?\nhtre | In a volatile and uncertain environment, one of the strongest steps leaders can take is to assist their organizations in discovering the right questions at the right time. One of their key responsibilities is creating infrastructures for dialogue and engagement that encourage others at all levels to develop insightful questions and to search for innovative paths forward. Leaders also need to consider reward systems that provide incentives for members to work across organizational boundaries to discover those challenging lines of inquiry that create common focus and new knowledge.\nda3c | Convening and Hosting Learning Conversations. A core aspect of the leader's new work involves creating multiple opportunities for learning conversations around challenging questions.\n890q | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS\njomo | However, authentic conversation is less likely to occur in a climate of fear, mistrust, and hierarchical control. When the human mind and heart are fully engaged in authentic conversation and listening for core questions, new knowledge often begins to surface. Thus, the ability to facilitate working conversations that enhance trust and reduce fear is an important leadership capability.\n06fi | To succeed in this pursuit, it's essential for leaders to strengthen their skills in the use of dialogue and other engagement approaches that deepen mutual inquiry and foster collective intelligence. These capabilities include:\nhb4s | · Creating a climate of discovery\ncqq2 | · Suspending premature judgment\n1ews | · Exploring underlying assumptions and beliefs\nafyn | · Listening for connections between ideas\n8sye | · Encouraging diverse perspectives\nr04h | · Honoring everyone's contributions\norpr | · Articulating shared understanding\nk36m | · Harvesting and sharing collective discoveries\nwnuz | These skills are especially important in situations in which there are no simple answers and finding creative paths forward can make a positive difference.\nsy14 | Including Diverse Perspectives. Leaders must become connectors of both people and ideas. Diverse voices and new perspectives that aren't limited by traditional boundaries of function, hierarchy, discipline, technology, tenure, and geographic region play an increasingly important role in a company's strategizing. As Gary Hamel of the London School of Economics points out, \"Strategizing depends on creating a rich and complex web of conversations that cuts across previously isolated pockets of knowledge and creates new and unexpected combinations of insight.\"\nghss | The connections among these diverse voices and perspectives allow employees to fruitfully explore critical strategic questions. Building and encouraging personal relationships through networks of collaborative conversations across traditional boundaries helps critical strategic questions travel well. In this way, workers enhance their collective intelligence and their capacity to nurture creative futures together.\n3s61 | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS\ns3rm | Supporting Appreciative Inquiry. Opening spaces of possibility in our organizations requires a shift in leadership orientation from focusing primarily on what is not working and how to fix it, to also discovering and appreciating what is working and how to leverage it. Appreciative Inquiry, developed by David Cooperrider and his colleagues at Case Western University, is a process for leveraging emerging possibilities rather than just fixing past mistakes. When used in a disciplined way, this kind of inquiry stimulates lively conversations that use the best of what is as the foundation for what might be.\npqxb | Leaders who ask, \"What's possible here and who cares?\" have a much easier time gaining the cooperation and best thinking of their constituents than those who ask, \"What's wrong here and who is to blame?\" In assessing the results of more than a decade of research and practice in the area of Appreciative Inquiry, Cooperrider has stated unequivocally that \"the most important insight we have learned with AI to date is that human systems grow toward what they persistently ask questions about.\" By asking positive questions, organizations have the opportunity to grow in new directions and tap innovative sources of knowledge, vitality, and energy.\n08qc | Fostering Shared Meaning. We make meaning of our experiences through stories, images, and metaphors. To tap into this pool of shared meaning, which is the ground from which both powerful questions and innovative solutions emerge, network leaders need to put time and attention into framing common language and developing shared images and metaphors. They can do so by constructing compelling scenarios-stories of the future-that provide a context for working on today's \"big questions,\" as in the case of the Game Plan process described earlier. In addition, leaders must\nhdj2 | QUESTIONS FOR ALL SEASONS\na57g | Here is a series of generative questions that we and other colleagues have found useful to stimulate new knowledge and creative thinking in a wide variety of situations around the world. Look at these questions to stimulate your own thinking about questions related to your own specific situation. Play. Use your imagination.\ng8m3 | Questions for Focusing Collective Attention\na9av | on Your Situation\n73l3 | What question, if answered, could make the most difference to the future of (your specific situation)?\nornm | What's important to you about (your specific situation) and why do you care?\nu2z1 | What draws you or us to this inquiry? What's our intention here? What's the deeper purpose (the big \"why\") that is really worthy of our best effort?\natmh | What opportunities can you see in (your specific situation)?\n7hgg | What do we know so far or still need to learn about (your specific situation)?\nxwsv | What are the dilemmas or opportunities in (your specific situation)?\n756b | What assumptions do we need to test or challenge here in thinking about (your specific situation)?\n6bx7 | What would someone who had a very different set of beliefs than we do say about (your specific situation)?\nspl6 | Questions for Connecting Ideas and Finding Deeper Insight\n7wzm | What's taking shape? What are you hearing underneath the variety of opinions being expressed? What's in the center of the table?\ne9xj | What's emerging here for you? What new connections are you making?\n9vl6 | What had real meaning for you from what you've heard? What surprised you? What challenged you?\nc2fd | incorporate time for systemwide reflection in order to enable members to share insights and emerging questions.
