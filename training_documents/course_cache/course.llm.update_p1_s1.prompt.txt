You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

59hi | Scope and Objectives
ua3p | Basic differences between animals and plants
0a2t | 1. Trophism
abow | · Plants only one trophic level; animals up to 5-7 or more levels (Predators of 6th degree)
qx6n | . Algae - Copepod - Fish larvae (1) - Dragon fly larvae (2) - Tilapia (3) - Pied kingfisher (4)
p2bm | · Grass - Locust - Preying mantis (1) - Lizard (2) - Cobra (3) - Mongoose (4) - Python (5) - Leopard (6)
cxyx | · The relationship between competition and predation in community structuring is far more complex for animals as these can be both prey and predators at the same time (plants are normally only prey for herbivores and few are predatory - carnivorous plants e.g. Drosera spp.) 5
w0aw | 2. Mobility
w41b | . Generally, all plants are immobile (except for a few algae) whereas all animals are mobile (except corals and barnacles)
vokd | · Field study of animals far more difficult due to seasonal movements, cryptic behaviour etc.
efir | · Implications - challenges in assessing animal population dynamics (distribution, abundance, density and diversity)
vjhs | 3. Ranges
rcio | · Animals have larger ranges than plants, especially for migratory animals
7qi5 | · Spatio-temporal (circadian/ circannual) variation in animal ranges poses challenges for describing community structure and interspecific interactions
9f5r | 4. Behaviour
j3tt | · Animal generally have more complex and diversified behavioural patterns (intra-/ inter- specific interaction, predation, reproduction)
zoz0 | 5. Reproduction
3blu | · Plants are immobile and reproduction is by fertilization agent (animals, wind or water)
xv2l | . Many plants depend on animals for their reproduction. E.g. pollinators of pollen and dispersers of seeds
xt4k | · Mobile animals actively search for reproductive partners, engage in complex courtship behaviour (e.g. vocalization, body display, pheromone attraction, building of structures such as nesting sites, mating chambers) to initiate copulation
ti78 | · Immobile animals (e.g. marine corals and barnacles) reproduces in a way similar to that of plants (more passive fertilization modes)
k5pk | 6. Dispersion
n093 | · Plants depends on agents for dispersal whereas animals disperse by themselves by virtue of their mobility
4khi | · Good dispersers include flying organisms as well as aquatic organisms that can tolerate a broad temperature range, or highly prolific species with high population turnover
7fh2 | Plant and Animal Interactions
5isn | · Plants depend on animals and vice versa
5vry | . Examples of animal dependencies on plants: Food (Herbivory), Building materials (Nests), Roosting and shelter (Protection)
9w33 | · Examples of plant dependencies on animals: Pollination, Seed dispersal, Protection (Predators on Herbivores)
johv | Different aspects of Animal Ecology
2olp | · Evolutionary Ecology - Focus on how ecology and evolution are linked as inter-related processes. Ecology drives speciation/extinction which again affect community structure
zb7x | · Behavioural Ecology - Focus on how ecology and behaviour is linked. Survival strategies such as Optimal Foraging and Reproductive strategies such as Semelparity/Iteroparity
uadf | . Population Ecology - Focus on how population grow, are regulated and interaction within and between different species (Competition, Predation, Mutualism, Parasitism)
wuf4 | · Community Ecology - Focus on how communities of animals are structured with groups made up of taxonomical and ecological guilds
lfk1 | · Macro-ecology: Focus on large scale (global) patterns of animal communities, spatio-temporal patterns of distribution, abundance an diversity on the Earth
rwjw | ECOSYSTEM: Biotic and abiotic factors interacting in a specific area (Ghana's coastal woodland)
iazp | Practical Implications
ksn3 | · Understanding the relationship amongst niches, species, community structure and functioning;
8xbx | *Land and water - Species-area relationship, habitat heterogeneity, island biogeography models
aod5 | Crop pests: Predator-prey relations, anti-predator strategies, invasive species ecology
ayqs | Design of conservation regions - Species diversity concentrations, gradients, endemic centres
jnpq | Vector control of tropical diseases - Trophic organisations and food webs, predation, competition
r4w4 | * World fish stock - Food webs, predator-prey relations, invasive alien species
sswz | In Summary
0uoj | 1. Animal Ecology is very complex. Plant-Animal interactions important for both
0c89 | · Trophism - Interactions - Mobility - Ranges - Dispersion - Behaviour - Reproduction - Communication
658v | 2. Five major disciplines in the study of Animal Ecology
4gqa | · Evolutionary ecology, Behavioural ecology, Population ecology, Community ecology and Macro ecology
mpgz | 3. Three major interrelated themes
gf06 | · Species abundance, Distribution and Diversity (spatio-temporal)
75hv | 4. Six major organisational/ Spatial levels
tbiu | · Species/Niche - Population - Guild - Community - Ecosystem - Biome
