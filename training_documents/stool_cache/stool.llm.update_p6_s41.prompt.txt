You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

u8nw | In both countries, the increase in sensitivity of a TB diag- nosis under the intervention generated a corresponding reduction in mortality: a 14-20% relative reduction in the fraction of children with presumptive TB dying (table 3). In both countries, costs increased under the interven- tion, and the base-case (using smear microscopy in the SOC) ICERs were US$132/DALY averted in Ethiopia and US$94/DALY averted in Indonesia (figure 2). Restricting the analysis to children under 5 years resulted in cost savings with ICERs of US$-78/DALY averted in Ethiopia

afbe | Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses
78r8 | Model projections showed large uncertainty (figure 2) that included cost savings under intervention (25% of the runs for Ethiopia and 28% for Indonesia), but also some increases in mortality (1.2% of the runs for Ethiopia and 2.8% for Indonesia). At a cost-effectiveness threshold of 0.5×GDP our analysis projected a probability of being cost effective of 87% in Ethiopia and a 96% in Indonesia (see online supplemental appendix 3). The corresponding probabilities for a 1xGDP threshold were 95% (Ethiopia) and 97% (Indonesia). Tornado plots (figure 3) show that prevalence of true TB among presumptive TB, the sensitivity of stool, and the fraction of children able to expectorate were the largest drivers of uncertainty (see also online supplemental appendix 3).
320g | Under the assumption that Xpert was used in the SOC, the ICERs were US$138/DALY averted in Ethiopia and US$115/DALY averted in Indonesia. Assuming half the prevalence of true TB among patients with presump- tive TB changed the ICERs to US$145/DALY averted in Ethiopia and US$150/DALY averted in Indonesia. Finally, assuming a 0% discount rate changed the ICERs to US$55/DALY averted in Ethiopia and US$38/DALY averted in Indonesia, whereas 5% discount rate gener- ated ICERs of US$199/DALY averted in Ethiopia and US$142/DALY averted in Indonesia.

8l69 | aged <5 years, we found a 14%-20% relative reduction in mortality driven by an increase in sensitivity to detect true TB. However, it is crucial that clinical assessment is still undertaken alongside negative bacteriological test results because bacteriological testing has a low negative predictive value especially in young children.34 Relying on bacteriological testing alone can reduce sensitivity to diagnose true TB and increase mortality, especially if referrals and re-assessments are common under the stan- dard of care (data not shown). We estimated ICERs of US$132 and US$94 per DALY averted in the base-case analyses for Ethiopia and Indonesia, respectively. These ICERs are less than 0.5×GDP, which has been suggested as a rule of thumb for cost-effectiveness thresholds,28 as well as country-specific estimates of supply-side thresholds. 29 30 The intervention would be especially cost-effective for children under 5 years of age.
1jyv | Children age <5 years are at higher risk of dying from untreated TB than older children and have the greatest difficulty in spontaneously expectorating sputum. Under the intervention, we found greater increases in bacteri- ologically diagnosis and greater decreases in referrals in the <5 years age group (see age stratified results in online supplemental appendix 3). We found that the cost of introducing the intervention was partially offset by reduced referrals from PHC facilities to hospitals. In Ethi- opia, this produced a projected cost saving in the under 5 age group, despite a slight increase in the average total number of assessments done. In taking a healthcare provider's perspective, we did not include patient costs in
olce | our analysis, but health-seeking costs are a major driver of catastrophic costs in TB.31
erx1 | There are large uncertainties associated with many parameters describing processes and pathways for paedi- atric TB. We found no directly applicable estimates of rates of reassessments or (self-) referral at different stages of care, and had to rely on expert opinion. Addition- ally, the sensitivity and specificity of clinical assessment for paediatric TB is poorly quantified in the literature. Because of this, we placed a particular emphasis on including uncertainty in results, as well as systematically exploring their sensitivity to one-way variation in param- eters, and discrete alternative assumptions. For example, because our estimate of true TB prevalence among chil- dren with presumptive TB was based on data mainly from hospitals which may have higher prevalence than PHC level, we halved prevalence resulting in increased ICERs by less than a factor of two without changing our quali- tative conclusions. Despite these uncertainties, the inter- vention showed probabilities of being cost-effective >85% in each country across a wide range of cost-effectiveness thresholds. This conclusion was also robust to assuming the SOC used Xpert rather than sputum-smear micros- copy at PHC level, and to different choices of discount rate.
b3bt | Some aspects were deliberately simplified or omitted in the modelling. First, we did not model HIV because paediatric HIV rates in Ethiopia and Indonesia are rela- tively low at 0.09% and 0.03%,32 respectively. This may underestimate the benefit from the intervention due to underestimated TB mortality, especially if stool-based
