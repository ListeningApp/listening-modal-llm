You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

5bjs | Characterizing the Norwegian reform trajectory since 2000, Breit et al. (2022) identify three phases. The first phase (2000-2007) involves the establishment of the new NAV organization, and experimentation with integrated work forms. The NAV reform included a merger between the two state administrations (for National Insurance and Labour Market) and municipal welfare services in one-stop local agencies, and the PES moved from a buyer-supplier model to integration and some decentralisation. With its weight on horizontal coordination and autonomy at the local level, the NAV reform displayed traces of a NPG paradigm that frontline managers during the reform process operationalised in a more integrated office.
uodj | In 2008-2014, a broader reform followed to increase efficiency, e.g. by re-centralization of the national insurance administration, (digital) standardized work tools for client services and performance indicators and requirements regarding documentation (Andreassen 2019; Jantz et al. 2015). This second phase involved a roll back and a return to NPM ideas, an effort to turn the frontline offices into single purpose organizations for employment services only (preferable
k16v | to the most job-ready clients) by reducing the number of municipal services and the withdrawal of national insurance benefit case processing to regional administrative units. Additionally, the ministry and the NAV directorate governed the frontline offices through performance measures and efforts to standardise the organizational design and the work of the frontline offices (Jantz et al. 2015; Andreassen 2019). Unlike the Netherlands, rising unemployment did not led to cutbacks but to higher budgets for labour market measures.
b2lm | From 2015, a third policy change breathed new life into the importance of professionalism in service provision. In many ways, the NAV returned to the original reform ideas of the early 2000s, underlining integrated services and local self-government in developing new forms of professionalism and experimentation at the street level (Fossestøl, Borg and Breit 2020). This phase included a return to NPG ideas of horizontal coordination within and outside the NAV offices, and a greater focus on professionalism and clients with more complex issues, in need
ti7f | digitization of communication with clients, but depending on the local NAV manager. In recent years, the trend from 2015 has strengthened, but we also notice the merger of municipalities and NAV offices into much larger first-line organizations, which points to NPM ideas for efficiency at a decentralized level.
oksu | In sum, in Norway we see a move from a TPA/NPM based system in the 1990s to NPG in the early 2000s, followed by more emphasis on NPM at the end of 2000s and a revival of NPG since 2015. The current trend is reinforcing the NPG reform but also a move towards more efficiency (NPM) with municipal mergers and larger regional NAV agencies, argued to strengthen professionalization and specialization. The next section will show that the Dutch reform of the welfare administration ultimately has many parallels with the Norwegian one (growing convergence), but along a completely divergent route.
wtow | Netherlands
o22k | Traditionally, and similar to Norway, there was a strong division between the welfare administration of social benefits, PES, and social assistance. Social benefits in the Netherlands were executed by sectoral organizations governed by social partners; PES was a central government department and social assistance the traditional domain of municipalities. The welfare system was increasingly criticized in the 1980s for high unemployment and disability, and a low degree of activation (Van Oorschot 2006). The PES hierarchy increasingly came under fire for its inability to reverse this trend. After ten years of negotiations between government and social partners, this resulted in a radical reform (PES Act 1990) for a new governance structure with central and regional three-party boards with equal seats for government, employers' associations and unions (3-3-3). So we see here the idea of collaborative networks on a horizontal basis (NPG), in contrast with a principal-agent model (NPM) for PES in Norway in the 1990s.
nwfz | In 2002, the Dutch government implemented a much wider reform with the SUWI Act, encompassing a completely new organizational structure for both social benefits and the PES. The SUWI reform came after endless negotiations since 1994 for 'marketization' in the benefit administration that resulted in an impasse (Van Gestel and Hillebrand 2011). Different from the NAV reform in Norway, SUWI was a typical combination of TPA and NPM, with a minor role for NPG. A large national organization (UWV) was created from a merger of five sector organizations for the implementation of benefits, formerly led by social partners and now centrally managed by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment (a switch to TPA). At the same time, PES' job matching task was outsourced to private agencies, in a principal-agent model (NPM) where UWV, municipalities and employers had to act as principals. New Centers for Work and Income (CWI) were set up for the first registration for benefits and assistance.
nvfy | The UWV, CWI and municipalities were expected to offer 'integrated services', but the how was left open.
mror | In 2008 we saw a merger of UWV and CWI which can be regarded as a re-establishment of the PES, but with limited tasks and significant cutbacks. NPM-type reform became even stronger in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis and growing unemployment. The already minor role of NPG in the original SUWI reform (2002) received even less political support these years: UWV and municipalities were no longer expected to provide integrated one-stop- shop services (SUWI Act 2012), justifying the closure of two-thirds of the 98 shared job centers which had been laboriously built up over the past decade. The national government made further major cutbacks at the UWV, as a result of which 50% of the work coaches lost their jobs and personal contact with clients was replaced by full digitization for most clients. In the general trend towards maximum efficiency (NPM), also sheltered workshops were no longer allowed to take on new clients that are supposed to find a 'regular job' at the labour market.
zlxc | In 2015, as in Norway, but in the Netherlands boosted by a social agreement with the social partners in 2013, we see some revival of NPG in horizontal cooperation of government authorities (municipalities and UWV) and social partners in 35 'labour market regions'. Regional Boards (Work Chambers) should coordinate the implementation of the Jobs Agreement Act (2015) as part of the social agreement with social partners, aiming for 125.000 jobs in 2026 for people with physical and/or mental handicaps. With the Participation Act (2015), local governments should conduct and integrate diverse social services (next to income support) and the largest municipality in each region has to coordinate regional collaboration with public and private parties for implementing the Jobs Agreement.
k0bw | Although policy rhetoric was much about "decentralisation" in the Netherlands since 2015, national regulations and conditions, e.g. for one service point to employers in each region and subsidized labour market projects showed a gradual tendency toward recentralisation and
aq5a | standardization. In 2020, the Dutch government together with social partners, UWV and municipalities initiated Regional Mobility Teams (RMTs) to deal with an expected high job loss due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Here NPG ideas of holistic services and collaboration between public and private partners returned to the reform agenda. In the latest revision of the SUWI Act (2021), the RMTs were legally grounded, and a wider reform for Regional Work Centres is initiated by the national government.3 So there is reinforcement of the NPG trend from 2015; but with a larger role of central government and social partners despite 'decentralization'.
