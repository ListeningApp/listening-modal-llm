You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

gsah | 335 After validating our approach, we next analyzed the effect of AD on neuroproteasome
t5nl | 336 localization, measured by the relative quantity of 20S proteasome subunits in our quantitative
l5s6 | 337 mass spectrometry dataset. First, in comparing AD samples to cognitively normal controls, we
yjnd | 338 find a striking reduction in nearly every 20S proteasome subunit in the plasma membrane
c7v3 | 339 fraction from BA7 tissue (Fig 3B, Table S2). We next sought to determine whether ApoE
iute | 340 genotype influenced neuroproteasome localization in human tissue. Given the significant effect
377g | 341 of AD on neuroproteasome localization, we constrained the analysis only to the effect of ApoE 342 genotype on neuroproteasome localization by comparing the ApoE4/4 AD cohort against the
v79r | 343 ApoE3/3 AD cohort. We observe a clear trend of reduced 20S proteasome subunits in the
555y | 344 membrane fraction in the ApoE4 genotype compared to ApoE3 genotype in the BA7 vulnerable 345 brain region (Fig 3C, Table S2).
7yeh | 347 To validate our proteomics data, we monitored surface localization of neuroproteasomes by
hfsl | 348 immunoblot analysis. We controlled for sample loading by normalizing against Kv1.2, a protein
kmer | 349 whose expression has been reproducibly demonstrated as unchanged in the AD brain(78-80).
5s1o | 350 While this strategy is required for loading controls by immunoblot, these loading controls line up
9mly | 351 with the normalization strategy for mass spectrometry based on the total amount of TMT signal
znoh | 352 from each sample. First, we validate our proteomics data and find a twofold reduction of
wjsb | 353 neuroproteasome surface expression in AD patients compared to controls in the BA7 region (Fig
r5ov | 354 3D). Moreover, we find a statistically significant reduction in neuroproteasome localization from ApoE4/4 tissue compared to ApoE3/3 unaffected tissue (Fig 3D). In contrast, we do not observe 356 changes in total expression of the 20S proteasome from the cytosolic fraction, suggesting that the
gajg | 355
3j8z | 357 ApoE-isoform dependent changes we observe are specific to neuroproteasome localization and
4dol | 358 not a change in cytosolic proteasome levels. We find changes in Lrp1 concordant with that
h72f | 359 observed with neuroproteasomes (Fig S3A). However, given the strong effect of AD pathology
v3n3 | 360 on the global proteome (as well as on neuroproteasome localization), we next used the BA4
t03d | 361 tissue to understand how ApoE isoforms could influence neuroproteasome localization with mild
2q4e | 362 AD pathology.
ktxm | 364 In BA4 tissue, unlike BA7, we find comparable surface localization of neuroproteasomes
y7mc | 365 between patients with and without AD (Fig 3E, Fig S3B). However, once stratified by ApoE genotype, we find that ApoE4/4 patients have a nearly 50% reduction in surface localization of
nafx | 366
je6f | 367 neuroproteasome compared with ApoE3/3 patients (Fig 3E). Both of these conclusions are
ms51 | 368 supported by analysis of proteasome subunits from unbiased proteomics datasets from BA4
v9sh | 369 tissue (Table S2). Consistent with these observations, using LLVY degradation experiments to
rnor | 370 measure the catalytic activity of the proteasome, we found a significant reduction in
3tz7 | 371 neuroproteasome activity in AD samples compared to unaffected controls and no change in
e02w | 372 cytosolic proteasome activity (Fig S3C). This demonstrates that ApoE4 can influence
0ldf | 373 neuroproteasome localization in areas with mild AD pathology. Taken together, we make two
4rgq | 375 conclusions based on these data: 1) that neuroproteasome localization is reduced in brain regions
srag | 374
vm1l | 376 which have increased susceptibility to AD pathology and 2) that ApoE4 reduces
2ulk | neuroproteasome localization compared to ApoE3.

xv2d | 380
0yfu | 381 What is the consequence of ApoE4-dependent reduction in neuroproteasome function, or more broadly, any reduction in neuroproteasome function? The most straightforward way to address this question is to leverage neuroproteasome-specific inhibitors. We previously accomplished 383
2icd | 382
ln4r | 384 neuroproteasome-specific inhibition using Biotin-Epoxomicin: an analog of the covalent and
1iz9 | 385 highly selective proteasome inhibitor Epoxomicin with an N-terminal Biotin moiety. This small modification renders Biotin-Epoxomicin cell-impermeable for up to an hour and does not change
o5cc | 386
b430 | 387 the selectivity or potency of Epoxomicin (4) (81-84). While time-limited, this approach found
5k15 | 388 that generally, neuroproteasome substrates are co- or peri-translationally degraded and that flux 389 through the neuroproteasome depends on neuronal activity(3, 4). However, the previous version
v24x | 390 of Biotin-Epoxomicin was not a usable tool to assess broad physiological functions of
26hh | 39 neuroproteasomes because the timescale was far too short and could not be used in vivo.
w533 | 392
fj70 | 393 Based on principles of drug design, we considered that introducing a longer PEG linker between 394 the N-terminus of Epoxomicin and biotin would decrease the permeability of biotin-epoxomicin and allow us to reveal long-term consequences of neuroproteasome inhibition(85, 86). We chose
04yk | 395
5l8x | 396 Epoxomicin because it leverages the unique chemistry of the catalytic threonines of the
h425 | 397 proteasome - the a-amino group of the threonine opens the epoxide of Epoxomicin which forms 398 the final covalent morpholino adduct. The catalytic residues of Serine and Cysteine proteases do
xfce | 399 not have a-amino groups, which is the principle that renders Epoxomicin completely specific
trvq | 400 both against its target and relative to other proteasome inhibitors. These advantages explain why
ztx4 | 401 dozens of analogs of Epoxomicin have been made to the N-terminus without altering the
d4i8 | 402 specificity of the drug against the proteasome: no off-target effects of Epoxomicin or its analogs
qp9u | 403 have been found in the two decades since its discovery (83, 84, 87-89). We synthesized click-
b6jo | 404 able analogs of Epoxomicin (Azide-Epoxomicin) that would allow us to append a broad range of 405 linkers (Fig 4A). We then conjugated Biotin-PEG24-Alkyne to Epoxomicin, producing Biotin- 406 PEG24-Epoxomicin, or iBEp (Fig 4A). We observe efficient conjugation by HPLC analysis (Fig
f9x6 | 407 S4A, B, C, D). All molecules were HPLC-purified as single peaks and confirmed by LC/MS 408 analysis (Fig S4D, E).
w558 | 409
18y0 | 410 We next tested the potency and selectivity of iBEp relative to Epoxomicin. Epoxomicin
779a | 411 covalently and irreversibly binds the catalytic ß subunits of the proteasome - therefore, the biotin
v8xg | 412 moiety on iBEp serves as a tracer to detect whether proteasomes are inhibited by monitoring 413 biotin signal on an SDS-PAGE gel(83, 87-89). We detect covalent biotinylation of only three
fmso | 414 proteins from iBEp-treated neurons, corresponding to the three catalytic subunits of the
ndxn | 415 proteasome (Fig S4F). Therefore, we demonstrate that the iBEp linker does not modify the high 416 specificity of iBEp compared to Epoxomicin alone. This is supported by previous data that
sb9k | 417 modification of the non-reactive end of epoxomicin has been shown not to change the selectivity
