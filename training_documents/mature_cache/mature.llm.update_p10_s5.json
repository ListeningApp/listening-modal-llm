        "content": "dqvj | In the following excerpt, the boys position themselves as being motivated in their voyeuristic interest for seeing girls in bathrooms and locker rooms, and thus not responsible or immature. In order to manage the moderator's challenges, they work up a dispositional and scripted account of the girls' motives as having causal force. Although maturity is not explicitly mentioned, the boys defend against the charge that they are habitually 'invading' the girls' privacy, which is hearable as a general index of immaturity.\nr17u | Excerpt two.

There are four soft challenges by the moderator that construct the boys as potentially immature. The first two (lines four and seven) are minimized by being constructed as misplaced concerns ('they didn't see us'), by playing dumb ('I thought it was co-ed'), or by claiming an emergency ('I had to pee'). These forms of mitigation are fairly common in our data as flippant excuse-making strategies. The third challenge of the moderator comes in line twelve. It is hearable as a more general concern, as indexed with the dramatic 'so wait' preface, followed by a general request ('let's think about that') and the generalized action sequence of 'that guys are walking into girls' locker rooms or bathrooms'. Unlike the first two, this challenge is a generalized challenge that scripts the boys' actions as potentially reoccurring or habitual, which can be heard as dispositional immaturity. As such, managing this kind of challenge requires special work. It makes relevant a rejoinder where motives are central.\nn1i7 | Interestingly, Wilson and Ernie's reply is a scripted account of the girls' behaviour. They draw up a generalized account of what the girls are doing by using the following devices: the iterative present tense ('be always trying', 'be doing', 'be like'), event pluralization with extreme case formulations ('AL :: WAYS trying to model'), and manner expressions ('they'd be like OHH lemme see'). The account works to secure that the phenomena of concern (the boys' voyeuristic activity and interest - and by extension, their immaturity) are habitually 'in the object', rather than being caused by the boys, who can be held accountable. It is the girls who regularly motivate them to be interested in seeing the girls' bodies, because it is the girls who model for them. In addition, Ernie seems to create a bit of symmetry between the sexes by noting that 'girls do the very same thing' (line fourteen), even going so far as to impersonate a girl gawking over seeing a guy's 'package' (line fifteen). The moderator's final challenge takes issue with such a symmetrical characterization of girls ('not girls' - line sixteen), which makes relevant Wilson's rather robust statement that girls 'are just as perverted as guys', and to think they are not is a 'misconception' (lines seventeen to eighteen). Again, this positions the moderator as 'misunderstanding', and it positions girls as having actual motives which contradict their supposed 'politeness'. This places girls' motives on a symmetrical footing with boys' motives. By doing this, the boys are able to characterize their motives as normative, and not deviant or immature in any kind of unique way.\n0r5m | Denials with built-in concessions\nne2o | Another way the boys maintain a position of 'maturity' while not appearing overly preoccupied in their attraction to girls' looks is to craft denials with built-in concessions. This type of denial often comes in three parts. The concession often follows an initial proposition in order to soften and repair the original overstated claim and is then followed by a revised, weaker statement than the original proposition. The structure is as follows:\nsqxn | (one) Initial proposition (hearable as extreme)\n6pmo | (two) Concession (positions the original proposition as disputable)\n195r | (three) Revised, weaker statement (hearable now as more reasoned)\nkqmi | In the extract below, Don and Hal build two rather robust concessions to manage\ng8rd | four hundred eighty-two Neill Korobov and Michael Bamberg\nnns9 | propositions that display interest or importance in looks. They then partially weaken the force of such concessions through strategically designed reassertions.\n9uwy | Excerpt three\nsrly | Participants: M: Moderator, D: Don, H: Hal, A: Andy\ndl6i | M: so looks (.)
