You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

s9fn | The IRM describes skills that are essential to meet- ing the basic interpersonal demands of practice, such as listening effectively, communicating clearly, overcoming basic conflicts and events, and being reliable and predict- able in interactions. The model describes additional skills that are required to achieve a level of communication with a client that responds to his or her interpersonal needs. This continuum of skills is described in detail and accom- panied by clinical examples in Chapters 8 through 16.
k5r6 | Principle 6: Provided That They Are Purely and Flexibly Applied, a Wide Range of Therapeutic Modes Can Work and Be Utilized Interchangeably in Occupational Therapy
z9v9 | Individuals who enter the profession of occupational ther- apy have a side to their personalities that is oriented to- ward others and desires to support, uplift, empathize with, motivate, advocate for, guide, or otherwise empower peo- ple. At the same time, each therapist has a unique combi- nation of interpersonal characteristics that largely derive from his or her temperament, usual interpersonal style with others, and from life experience. These characteris-
gpu9 | tics influence the therapist to have a natural therapeutic
u5ws | mode or modes (i.e., particular ways of relating to a client in a given situation). As already mentioned, the six inter- personal therapeutic modes are the advocating mode, col- laborating mode, empathizing mode, encouraging mode, instructing mode, and problem-solving mode. The thera- peutic mode or set of modes that characterize a therapist's general approach to interacting with clients is referred to as the therapist's interpersonal style.
onkh | An underlying principle of the IRM is that no partic- ular mode or interpersonal style is superior to another. Two therapists with diametrically opposite personali- ties, who use different combinations of modes, can be equally effective. However, certain interpersonal styles tend to work better with different populations and cir- cumstances. Thus, therapists who are critically self-aware choose areas of practice most suited for their interper- sonal style.
8t55 | More importantly, effective use of self depends on the flexible and appropriate use of modes depending on the client and the situation. A therapist who relies heavily on only one therapeutic mode is effective with a narrower range of circumstances and clients than a therapist who can employ a variety of modes in response to changing interpersonal circumstances. Thus, the IRM recommends that therapists make an ongoing effort to expand their capacity to use different modes as demanded by individ- ual differences between clients and the unique features of specific interpersonal events that may occur during therapy.
7imw | When a therapist decides to invoke a particular mode, it is important that the mode is communicated to the client accurately in its pure form. To achieve the pure, accurate use of a mode, it is recommended that the ther- apist remain within that mode for as long as it takes to communicate and ensure that the client has received the intended interpersonal message (e.g., that the intention for the moment is solely to empathize, solely to instruct, solely to problem-solve, or what have you). If a therapist attempts to blend modes so two interpersonal messages are being communicated simultaneously, it is likely to weaken the intended communication of both modes and to result in the client becoming confused. For example, if a therapist's true intention is to address a client's behav- ior by using the instructing mode but, instead, begins to question the client about the reasons behind the behavior in a way that conveys disapproval, the therapist is blend- ing the problem-solving mode into the instructing mode.
lf1t | The result is that the client receives a confused message about the desirability of the behavior (e.g., does the ther- apist want me to stop the behavior, or might it be okay if I explain to her why I am doing this?). Similarly, if a thera- pist shifts modes too rapidly it may also lead to confusion or weakening of the communication, depending on the cognitive level and emotional maturity of the particular client. Although the IRM acknowledges the need for ther- apists occasionally to share mixed feelings with a client and send complex messages to clients that involve many mode shifts, this approach to communication must be done with great circumspection. These and other issues pertinent to shifting modes are discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.
tze7 | Principle 7: The Client Defines a Successful Relationship
ryvv | Clients differ widely in terms of what they are seeking from their relationships with health-care professionals. For instance, some clients prefer a relationship that is pro- fessional, hierarchical, and relatively distant in which the therapist provides specific instructions, technologies, or resources to assist in the accomplishment of occupational goals and objectives. Other clients desire a relationship that involves a more personalized connection and results in feelings of emotional support as well as tangible occu- pational outcomes. Still others wish for a collaborative re- lationship in which mutual planning and problem-solving take place.
zdrh | What is considered a successful relationship in occu- pational therapy must be defined by the client rather than the therapist. A successful client-therapist relationship must be based on the achievement of the type of ther- apeutic relationship the client needs most and is capable of during the time he or she is in therapy. This means that a successful therapeutic relationship is not defined by a feeling of closeness, or connection, unless the client clearly wants it as a feature of the relationship. Although in many circumstances these variables are associated with the client's perception of a successful relationship, for some clients a successful relationship may mean one that involves a certain level of professional distance or some other kind of interaction that is consistent with the cli- ent's prior experiences with health-care professionals and cultural expectations.
osmo | A corollary to this principle is that clients may change through time in their desires for the therapeutic relation- ship. The following are some examples. A client who at first desires a more hierarchical and therapist-structured relationship following a traumatic event resulting in im- pairment may wish for a more collaborative relationship later during the course of therapy. A long-term client seen first as a child may wish to achieve more distance as he or she comes into adolescence. A client who previously insisted on a highly collaborative relationship may, fol- lowing an exacerbation of an impairment or symptom or during a crisis, need an empathic and supportive relation- ship. Such changes in a client's desires for the therapeutic relationship may reflect such factors as responses to stress, personal growth, or natural development. They must be respected and accommodated by the therapist.
