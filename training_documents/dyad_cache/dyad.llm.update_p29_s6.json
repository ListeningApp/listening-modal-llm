According to his official biography, he was born in eighteen ninety-two under the name Adolf Tscheppe-Weidenbach, to a German Baron from Baden and an American mother, Emma Willoughby of Baltimore, Maryland. But the German weekly Der Spiegel, which investigated his ancestry in nineteen fifty, found out that there was no registry for such a birth in eighteen ninety-two, and that Willoughby was probably born as an illegitimate child to a German rope maker and a German mother. He came to the United States and became an American citizen in nineteen ten, and the same year enlisted in the army as Adolf Charles Weidenbach-the family name of his alleged rope maker father. He later Americanized his name to Willoughby. It is possible, then, that Willoughby fabricated a family background and, if this indeed was the case, it fit well with certain patterns of his behavior.\nnns9 | According to Willoughby's official biography, in nineteen fourteen, following studies at Heidelberg, the Sorbonne, and Pennsylvania College at Gettysburg, he received his bachelor of arts degree and continued his master's studies at the University of Kansas at Lawrence. Given that he left Germany at the age of eighteen, and that students were not enlisted in Heidelberg before the age of nineteen, the validity of this account is dubious as well. The same year he started a military career, first as a commissioned Volunteer (Reserve) officer and, then as a career infantry officer. Between mid-nineteen seventeen and late nineteen eighteen he served as an aviator (flying combat missions in France) and then returned to the Infantry. Until nineteen forty, when he joined MacArthur's headquarters in the Philippines as a supply officer, he served, among others, as a military attach√© to Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador and at various staff schools as an instructor and lecturer. He wrote a number of books on history and military studies, and built a scholarly reputation in these fields.\n9uwy | Although Willoughby adopted an American name, his Teutonic accent, his tendency to use a monocle, his natty custom-tailored uniforms, and his aloofness made him somewhat of an anomaly among his American peers. For many of his colleagues, he was the personification of \"the old-school Prussian army officer,\" \"more of von Stroheim than von Rundstedt\" type. Even within MacArthur's ultraconservative inner\nsrly | circle, Willoughby was noted for his pro-fascist inclination. He was an admirer of Fascist Spain and regarded Francisco Franco as \"the second greatest military commander in the world.\" This inclination led MacArthur to call him \"my lovable fascist,\" but his more common nicknames for him were \"Sir Charles\" and \"the count.\"\ndl6i | MacArthur's relations with Willoughby, the only \"Bataan Boy\" that remained with him until the end of his military career in nineteen fifty-one, were complex. Willoughby admired MacArthur and saw him, even before they met, as the greatest military leader in US history. It is quite probable that his \"doglike devotion\" to his boss was not a product of sycophancy, as many believed, but of a sincere admiration. MacArthur, for his share, respected his G-two's intellect, shared with him a love of military history, allowed him unrestricted access, and was as \"fanatically loyal\" to him as he was to other officers from his inner circle. MacArthur trusted his G-two with nonprofessional tasks as well. In nineteen forty-four, when a group of conservative republican politicians considered nominating him to run for president against Roosevelt, Willoughby acted as the liaison between Senator Arthur Vandenberg and the general. In June, he was sent by MacArthur to Washington to discuss the issue with Vandenberg and other prominent republicans.\n89ub | When it came to Willoughby's service as MacArthur's G-two, the picture is less clear. By one testimony, MacArthur thought that he was \"the finest G-two officer he had encountered in his fifty-odd years of service.\" At the same time, in nineteen forty-three, he paid almost no attention to \"what Willoughby told him\" and no operation was called off or mounted because of his intelligence, though, as the quality of intelligence improved in nineteen forty-four, he paid it more attention. Probably the best definition for the relationship between the two was given by Drea, who wrote in his excellent study on MacArthur and intelligence in the Pacific war that Willoughby \"served MacArthur unquestioningly, and in exchange MacArthur tolerated Willoughby's uneven intelligence appreciations throughout the Pacific War.\" Summing up MacArthur's attitude toward his G-two, he noted that MacArthur \"accepted Willoughby's loyalty but never confused it with exceptional competence.\"\ndhle | Willoughby's professional record after becoming MacArthur's G-two was a mixed bag, too. Within a short period of time (June-September, nineteen forty-two), he succeeded, despite having no prior experience, in building an effective intelligence system made of three sections: a geographical and terrain section that produced the necessary information for MacArthur's operations in an unfamiliar territory; a translation and interpretation section that collected and produced information from Japanese P-O-Double-U-s; and a Humint section that was used for collection and clandestine operations. The Sigint unit (Central Bureau) was outside his perimeter of responsibility and was established and directed by Spencer B. Akin. Willoughby was even excluded from seeing some of its products.\n2nib | Willoughby's record as an estimator, which is more relevant for our subject, was less bright. By Campbell's analysis, he \"made nine badly flawed estimates in the Pacific War, which he later tried to cover up, whereas he was correct in only four key estimates.\" No wonder then that Willoughby's colleagues thought that he had \"the best hindsight of any intelligence officer in the army,\" or that he was \"a better historian than an intelligence officer.\"\nnaev | While Willoughby's record as an intelligence estimator in W-W-Two was dubious, three tendencies that he exhibited during his service are relevant to understand his mistakes in November nineteen fifty. The first was his tendency toward centralism, as evidenced by his attempts to gain organizational monopoly over the intelligence process and his practice of personally handling the process of making intelligence estimates. Shortly after becoming MacArthur's G-two, he dismissed Australian intelligence summaries (which proved to\n```",
