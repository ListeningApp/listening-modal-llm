You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

o2kr | Methods for understanding social-ecological systems: a review of place- based studies
v6sk | ABSTRACT. In recent years, social-ecological systems (SES) have emerged as a prominent analytical framing with which to investigate pressing sustainability issues associated with the Anthropocene era. Despite the growth of SES research, the lack of a delineated set of methods commonly contributes to disorientation for those entering into a field where methodological pluralism is the norm. We conduct a review of SES research, focusing particularly on methods used in this field. Our results reflect the rapid growth in SES research relative to other publications in relevant subject areas, and suggest a maturation of the field. Whilst institutions investigating SES have been mostly based in the global north, focal SES has been more globally distributed, although key regions, especially island regions, remain poorly studied. Key problems addressed in the studies related to policy, trade, conservation, adaptation, land use change, water, forests, sustainability, urban problems, and governance and institutions. We identified 311 methods, which we grouped into 27 method categories that can serve as a guide to SES research methods for newcomers to the field. We also performed an exploratory assessment of the ability of these methods to account for key features of SES as complex adaptive systems. We found that methods do better at accounting for the relational and context-dependent nature of SES, and least well with complex causality. Our study highlights the plurality of methods used in SES research, and helps highlight key areas in need of further methodological development.

936l | INTRODUCTION
06yq | Human activities are changing the ecosystems upon which humanity depends in unprecedented and profound ways (Rockström et al. 2009). In the fast-changing and ever-more- connected era of the Anthropocene (Rockström et al. 2009, Steffen et al. 2011), the environmental and social challenges we face demand better understanding of the complex and evolving links between ecosystems and human societies (Rockström et al. 2009, Fischer et al. 2015). The concept of social-ecological systems (SES) has emerged as a key conceptual and analytical framing with which to understand the connections and feedbacks between social and environmental interactions in real-world systems (Carpenter et al. 2012, Fischer et al. 2015, Colding and Barthel 2019). The concept has helped facilitate increased recognition of the dependence of humanity on ecosystems (Díaz et al. 2006, Summers et al. 2012, Wu 2013), has improved collaboration across disciplines and between science and society (Carpenter et al. 2012), has increased methodological pluralism that has led to improved systems understanding (Levin et al. 2013, Tengö et al. 2014, Lade and Niiranen 2017, Preiser et al. 2018), and has manifested in major policy frameworks and initiatives, such as Future Earth (Rockström 2016) and the Sustainable Development Goals (Díaz et al. 2015a, Fischer et al. 2015). Recent years have also seen the emergence of new research areas (Folke 2006), modeling approaches (Schlüter et al. 2012), and analytic frameworks (Turner et al. 2003, Janssen et al. 2006, Collins et al. 2011, Bodin and Tengö 2012, Schlüter et al. 2019).
dpv6 | Despite progress, SES research remains challenging (Fischer et al. 2015, Turner et al. 2016, Haider et al. 2018). Central to this challenge is the recognition that SES research represents an emergent "third" space that transcends the mere sum of social and ecological research practices and disciplines (Walker et al. 2006, Liu et al. 2007a, Folke et al. 2016). Many methods and
8r5j | E&S
2taz | approaches used in SES research do not fall within the realms of traditional social and natural sciences, or any singular discipline, and as a result SES as a research field lacks its own coherent methodological identity, instead drawing strongly on methodological pluralism (Tengö et al. 2014, Folke et al. 2016). Fluidity of identity is also evident in the multiple terms used to describe SES (e.g., coupled human-environmental systems, man- environmental systems), varied definitions for what SES are (Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Colding and Barthel 2019), and the different ways that SES are spoken about in academic literature, ranging from a boundary object to bridge disciplines (Hertz and Schlüter 2015) to describing real epistemic systems that can be understood using empirical methods (Becker 2012).
o3ya | Although a variety of conceptual and methodological ambiguities plague this emerging research area, there is sufficient coherence to enable analysis of key dimensions of this research field. All SES research has in common a nomenclature that designates the object of study as having integrated social and ecological components, as is also reflected in the names of prominent journals in the field. Indeed, several recent reviews have attempted such analyses of the SES field (Binder et al. 2013, Turner et al. 2016, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Partelow 2018, Colding and Barthel 2019). From these reviews, it is clear that SES research, which is often approached alongside concepts such as ecosystem services, sustainability science, and transdisciplinary research (Brandt et al. 2013, Turner II et al. 2016, Haider et al. 2018, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Partelow 2018), has grown over the past 20 years (Droste et al. 2018, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Colding and Barthel 2019). Having its origins in place- based, local resource management studies (Colding and Barthel 2019), the field is still largely characterized by place-based studies, especially at the local scale (Norberg and Cumming 2008, Becker 2012, Angelstam et al. 2013, Hertz and Schlüter 2015, Folke et
r5il | al. 2016). Meta-approaches/comparative analyses and framework development are, however, also often conducted (Partelow 2018). Indeed, several large databases now exist to collect case studies for meta-analyses, e.g. SESMAD, SESGO, IFRI (Partelow 2018). SES research derive from a broad range of disciplines, including the environmental, social, agricultural, biological, Earth and planetary, and computer sciences, as well as medicine and the humanities (Colding and Barthel 2019). Although the focus of SES research has shifted slightly over time (Droste et al. 2018, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018), studies on adaptive management, governance, restoration, and poverty alleviation in sectors such as fisheries, forestry, and watersheds have been popular throughout (Droste et al. 2018, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Partelow 2018).
5gui | A picture of the SES field has thus started to emerge, but the SES oncept is nevertheless still in transition (Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018), and there are gaps in our understanding of how the field functions and develops (Colding and Barthel 2019). Aside from lacking a broadly agreed-upon definition for SES (Herrero- Jáuregui et al. 2018, Colding and Barthel 2019), much of this gap relates to the methodological pluralism that characterizes the field (Partelow 2018). Methodological pluralism creates challenges for synthesis and data comparison, in part because it is more difficult to know what methods can and should be used in research (Partelow 2018). Lack of methodological transparency hampers attempts to generalize across case studies and frameworks (Magliocca et al. 2018, Colding and Barthel 2019), and can prove particularly challenging for postgraduate students and other early-career researchers (Haider et al. 2018). Understanding and interrogating methods used in the SES field is also important because of the nature of the systems being investigated. There is increasing agreement that SES can be conceptualized as complex adaptive systems (CAS) (Liu et al. 2007b, Levin et al. 2013, Rogers et al. 2013, Folke et al. 2016, Preiser et al. 2018, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018), which place demands on the approaches and methods that SES researchers employ (Preiser et al. 2018), and necessitates an understanding and interrogation of the methods used in the field.
82qc | We thus expand on recent reviews of the development of the SES field, focusing specifically on the methods used in empirical, place-based SES research. We define methods as codified ways of producing knowledge of a focus of interest, a specific information-generating practice (Pahl-Wostl et al. 2013, Stirling 2015). By having a clearer idea of the range of methods that SES researchers are using when engaging in real-world problem- solving or solution-based research, we can improve our characterization of SES research as a field of inquiry, and also help guide researchers new to the field in identifying and selecting appropriate research methods.
ls7d | We used a systematic review approach to conduct a broad analysis of the different terms being used to study coupled social and ecological systems and characterize these studies according to their type, distinguishing place-based studies from studies that outline "frameworks" and "reviews." Focusing on a subset of place-based research, we then identified the journals, institutions, and countries in which SES have been studied, and how these have changed over time. Having broadly contextualized SES research, we identified a large set of methods used in place-based research,
tzt3 | Ecology and Society 24(4): 16 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol24/iss4/art16/
t8vv | and explored the topics or problems they have most commonly sought to investigate. We summarized the methods into categories, providing a typology that can serve as a guide to the range of methods used in SES research.
qvnu | Our positioning in this paper centers around the conceptualizations of SES as complex adaptive systems (CAS; Liu et al. 2007b, Levin et al. 2013, Rogers et al. 2013, Folke et al. 2016, Preiser et al. 2018). In this realm, Preiser et al. (2018) have recently made some progress in moving toward a cohesive, theoretically derived definition (Schlüter et al. 2012, Cumming 2014, Bots et al. 2015) of SES research. They offer a typology of six underlying organizing principles of CAS that characterize the various features and properties of such systems. This typology (Table 1) can be used to recognize and assess the demands that CAS make on the methods that SES researchers employ. A final goal of this paper was thus to relate the list of method categories to these underlying principles of CAS through an exploratory assessment of how well different method categories account for core features of CAS.
kggw | METHODS
xrd1 | Systematic reviews are synthesis-based approaches that have in common the aim to build new knowledge from a rigorous analysis of existing research findings (Thorne et al. 2004). Regardless of their aim, systematic reviews follow a strict protocol to maximize transparency and repeatability while minimizing bias (Petticrew and Roberts 2006, Pullin and Stewart 2006, Pullin and Knight 2009, Gough et al. 2012). The systematic review process can be summarized as: formulating a question, generating a protocol, systematic selection, critical appraisal of results, data extraction, data synthesis, and reporting and dissemination (Gough et al. 2012).
5746 | Defining a search strategy and predocument selection
7toz | After situating our study in the conceptual framework outlined in the introduction and defining our study questions, we conducted a first exploratory search in Google Scholar and Scopus databases. We used the search terms "social-ecological," "coupled human*," "SES," "CHANS," "coupled human- environment*," and "social relations to nature." We found that the acronyms "CHANS" and "SES" produced a lot of noise in our results, and subsequently dropped these from our search. During this exploratory phase, we discovered several additional terms that identified studies dealing with human-nature interactions, and included them in subsequent searches. The final terms used in our systematic review were: "social-ecological," "socio-ecological," "human environment," "human-environment*," "affective ecology*," "social-environmental," "socio-environmental," "human-nature relation*," "coupled human*," "human-earth relation*," "environment relation*," "human-environment*," "man-environment relation*," "eco-social," and "nature-society relation" (Appendix 1).
j346 | Document selection
v8uq | Document selection was based on a key word search in Scopus, limited to the title, abstract, and key words. We chose Scopus because of its extensive and interdisciplinary coverage and high recognition as a standardized database for conducting meta- analyses (Wagner et al. 2011). Our first search, using the final key words above to search all journals in the Scopus database over all

h2l3 | "middle aged," "aged," and "child" because these were associated with social-ecological critical theory in psychology, which is different from the SES focus of this article. We also restricted the search to the subject areas of environmental science, social
dfzb | science, agricultural and biological science, Earth and planetary science, economics, econometrics and finance, energy, "multidisciplinary," and decision sciences. We excluded environmental education because the overlaps with the health and psychological literature produced a lot of nonrelevant studies. Further, we restricted our search to journals, books, and book series, and to publications in English, and items published or in press. Our final search, conducted on 22 July 2015, yielded a result of 5222 documents. In addition to the abstracts and (index and author) key words, we downloaded the year published, journals published in, number of citations, and the institutions and geographical locations of authors.
u6ty | First screening and coding
awvu | The next step was to screen abstracts for inclusion or exclusion in the study. We characterized papers as follows:
on9b | · Review: a review of papers about SES, theoretical concepts, and/or frameworks;
a8ge | · Framework: papers that explicitly proposed a framework for understanding SES;
h27a | · Framework and place-based: papers that proposed a framework, and also used this framework to analyze a place- based system;
pdjh | · Theory: articles that did not propose a framework, but focused on understanding an aspect of thinking about SES, or developing SES theory, without focusing on a particular place-based SES;
