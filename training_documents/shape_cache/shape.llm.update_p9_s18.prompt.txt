You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

xjyk | Statistical analysis
mt0f | We undertook all statistical analysis with SPSS (IBM 2017), with initial screening in Excel (Microsoft 2019). Significance for all tests was determined at the <LATEX>p \leq 0 . 0 5</LATEX> level. We interpret effect sizes and power requirements in line with Cohen's (1988) widely accepted benchmarks.
awab | Alternative measurement definitions
ixcc | We used Kappa Measure of Agreements to gauge the level of agreement between the FFIT categorical classi- fications under DS1, DS2, and DS3 measurement defi- nitions, investigating hypothesis 1. High agreement indicates high stability in the classification. Table 2 shows how many participants fit each of the FFIT's body shapes, according to differential measurement definitions. We selected the hourglass body as the ref- erence shape because it was the most common in DS1: FFIT's 'standard' interpretation.
8p6h | Alternative waist definition's measurement impact We used T-Tests to investigate the differences between alternative waist measurement definitions. T-
pmgl | test one - Association of Waist - investigates hypoth- esis 2: the difference in waist measurements taken at the <LATEX>S o B + 4 . 0 \quad c m</LATEX> and <LATEX>S o B + 6 . 3 5 \quad c m</LATEX> regions. T-test two - Association of Waist Height - investigates hypothesis 3: the difference in waist heights taken at the <LATEX>S o B + 4 . 0 \quad c m</LATEX> and <LATEX>S o B + 6 . 3 5 \quad c m</LATEX> regions.
90no | Shoulder measurement's predictive capability
jt0y | We used Multinomial Logistic Regression to predict the FFIT body shape classification from shoulder measure- ments, investigating hypothesis 4. Our model's depend- ant variable is the FFIT body shape classification. Our factors are shoulder-to-shoulder (horizontal), shoulder- to-shoulder (calliper), and shoulder girth (full). We used Hosmer-Lemeshow tests for each pair of shoulder meas- urements to assess Goodness of Fit to the multinomial logistic regression's model, using the same variables.
qb7o | We used ANOVA to investigate whether the FFIT's categorical variables associate with alternative shoulder measurements (scale variables). Our ANOVA tests vari- able is Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal), with group- ings: the FFIT body shape classification. We investigate Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal) with ANOVA because it is the most potent predictor of the FFIT's body shape classification according to our multinomial logistic regression model. As multiple comparisons in post hoc analysis increase the risk of Type I errors, we apply a Bonferroni adjustment to p0.007, mitigating Type I errors' risk (Tabachnick and Fidell 2007b, 270).
oae5 | Post hoc power analysis
s0fl | We conducted post hoc power analysis for parametric sta- tistics - in conjunction with calculating sample size based on power calculations - to mitigate Type II errors caused by underpowered samples (Portney and Watkins 2009). We used our statistical analysis' results - i.e. mean differ- ence, standard deviation, and significance - with sample size as inputs for post hoc power analysis with G*Power (Faul et al. 2020). All post hoc power analysis tests showed adequate power <LATEX>\left( \pi > 0 . 8 \right)</LATEX> under commonly accepted power guidelines (Cohen 1988; Aberson 2011).
43ia | Results and analysis
3g2y | Comparison of body shape classifications following the FFIT and SizeUK definitions
gc7v | Investigating hypothesis 1, a Kappa Measurement Of Agreement test revealed negligible agreement between the FFIT categorical classifications under dif- ferent measurement definitions: DS1 and DS2
wqfv | <LATEX>\left( K \left( N = 1 6 7 9 \right) = 0 . 3 6 9 , p < 0 . 0 1 \right) ,</LATEX> DS1 and DS3 <LATEX>\left( K \left( N = 1 6 7 9 \right) = 0 . 4 1 0 , p < 0 . 0 1 \right) ,</LATEX> and DS2 and DS3 <LATEX>\left( K \left( N = 1 6 7 9 \right) = 0 . 3 5 6 , p < 0 . 0 1 \right) .</LATEX> Table 3 presents the inter-shape agreement for DS1, DS2, and DS3. Between 21.9% and 39.6% of participants are categor- ised into different body shapes, measured by disagree- ment between measurement definitions in Table 3.
j30a | While rectangle, inverted triangle, and top hourglass show a high level of shape classification agreement under different measurement definitions, hourglass, tri- angle, bottom hourglass, and spoon show low shape- classification agreement; below 50% (Peat 2001, 228).
7bdk | We, therefore, accept Hypothesis 1.
fim0 | Association of waist measurement placement
ojro | Investigating Hypothesis 2, a paired-sample t-test revealed waist measurements significantly decrease when taken within Size UK's <LATEX>S o B + 4 . 0 \quad c m</LATEX> region <LATEX>\left( M = 7 9 . 3 9 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. S D = 1 2 . 6 4 \right)</LATEX> compared to being taken within the FFIT's <LATEX>S o B + 6 . 3 5 \quad c m</LATEX> region (FFIT) <LATEX>\left( M = 7 8 . 1 3 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. S D = 1 2 . 6 4 \right) ,</LATEX> <LATEX>t = 3 2 . 0 3 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>p < 0 . 0 1</LATEX> (two-tailed). The t-test achieved <LATEX>\left( 1 - \beta \right.</LATEX> err <LATEX>\left. \mathrm { p r o b } \right) = 1 . 0 ,</LATEX> Effect size <LATEX>d z =</LATEX> 0.8 : satisfying our statistical power requirements. The mean decrease was 1.26 cm, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from -1.33 cm <LATEX>t o \quad - 1 . 1 8 \quad c m .</LATEX> The eta- squared statistic (0.38) indicates a large effect size.
l6t9 | 70.3% of participants had a waist circumference smaller within the FFIT's <LATEX>S o B + 6 . 3 5 \quad c m</LATEX> region than those whose smallest waist circumference lay within SizeUK's SoB + 4.0 cm region. Waist measurements are, therefore, smaller when the 3 D body scanner searched for the narrowest point within a larger waist region starting from the SoB.
1ujy | We, therefore, accept Hypothesis 2.
