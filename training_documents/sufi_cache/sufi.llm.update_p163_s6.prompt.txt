You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

u91m | These are among the reasons for a special and specialised school to preside over exposure to the Sufi materials.
hx7e | Sufi materials, of necessity, are designed to be perceptible in real meaning to those who are at a stage or in a condition to profit from them. If people are not, they accept shallow, emotional or misguided 'meanings' from Sufic materials.
v085 | This tendency is paralleled in the behaviour of animals and people at different stages of understanding and states of mind. You can find such examples, showing the failure to use one's mind correctly, every day in equivalent situations in ordinary life. Many Sufi jokes reproduce such situations, but the newspapers are also full of them. Consider the following:
t1w7 | THE PROTECTED MONUMENT
468t | 'Councillors at Ryde, Isle of Wight, burst into laughter last night on hearing from [a Government Department in] Whitehall that Seaview Pier was officially listed as a building of historic or architectural interest. The pier was demolished in 1952.'*
vuoh | Lack of accurate information and the underlying failure to seek it, coupled with the assumption that things were in the condition imagined by whoever drafted that scheduling order provided the protection of the non-existent pier. The same kind of thinking is involved when many people deal with ideas, literature and person- alities rather than buildings. The same kind of mental equipment approaches a different proposition in the same kind of way.
vj46 | You do not even have to be a human being to assume things about something resulting in harm and uselessness to yourself. Look at this:
afee | THE MONKEY AND THE HEAD
c6gi | 'A man had to be given hospital treatment for a sprained neck in Kuala Lam pur, Malaysia, when a monkey trained to pluck coco- nuts from high trees jumped on to his shoulders and began twist- ing his head.' **
l507 | That monkey, no doubt, if trained, would have scheduled a non- existing building as 'of interest'.
w0ph | Communication has to take into account the person to whom something is to be communicated. Consider this and compare it with someone buying a book and reading it according to his own conceptions of what it is trying to convey:
b724 | DOG AND DINNER
zbpu | A Swiss couple told the newspaper Blick that they had taken their pet poodle into a Hong Kong restaurant and signalled to the waiter that they wanted it fed, making eating signs. The poodle was taken away. When the waiter came back with a dish under a
9016 | silver lid, they found their dog roasted inside, garnished with pepper sauce and bamboo shoots .***
44qf | The couple were reported to be traumatised and to be suffering from emotional shock. Many Sufi teachers, such as Rumi, reflecting in his Fihi Ma Fihi and the Masnavi on how people behave with spiritual materials, have almost an equal air of traumatisation.
pdpr | Impartiality as a Point of View
v875 | Q: How do we reach impartiality?
t22f | A: Most people's impartiality is not such at all, but a cover for a partial point of view.
2otd | If you have a bias towards impartiality, your goal must be the control of bias, not the struggle towards impartiality - because you will never reach impartiality through bias.
0mma | People who believe that they are impartial, however, seldom are.
wv0u | To find impartial people is usually easy only for those who do not need them.
36s3 | As the Anwar-i-Suhaili says:
1pjl | 'If practice were verification, we would be able to discern liars by their faces.'
h97d | As an example of impartiality, remember the action of Bishr al-Hafi, quoted by Ghazzali, in his Book of Knowledge, who buried a large number of books, saying:
50rd | I feel the urge to recount Traditions. But I will not do this until the desire abates.'
e8sa | Lack of experience and information causes lack of impartiality; but this does not stop people from believing that they are in fact objective. They believe this because they have a strong desire to be or to appear to be impartial. Hence Bishr's pointing to the disabling role of the emotion of desire.
jbo4 | We can illustrate what people do when they have too little information and too much desire in a safely 'objective' case of an anthropological observation from New Guinea:
0nsm | BUYING THE PRESIDENT
lks2 | In April 1966 some islanders refused to pay taxes because they were saving up to buy the President of the United States. They had already refused to vote as the President's name was not on the ballot paper .. .*
zfwf | To reach an impartial viewpoint, you have to be able to look at situations beyond their immediate 'message', so that you can event- ually see things 'in the round'.
q3ze | If I were asked to illustrate this by a Western parallel, I would choose this tale:
o5tm | TWO MEN IN A MADHOUSE
mpez | A guide in a certain madhouse was describing two cases to some visiting psychiatrists. 'In this padded cell,' he said, 'we have a man who went mad when another man married the girl whom he was in love with.'
2ve6 | 'And in the next cell?' asked a visitor.
n98m | 'In that one we have the man who actually did marry the girl.'
y53g | Characteristics and Purposes of a Sufi Group
u23b | Q: May we have some characteristics and purposes of a living Sufi group?
nxwd | A:
d74j | Appearance: May take any form consistent with the culture in which it is operating, the commanding principle being that certain people have to be related in some kind of a viable entity.
zqe7 | Objective: To form and maintain, under appropriate guidance, the special conditions in which the Teaching can operate.
qdm8 | Intention: To enable as many people as possible, in due order, to achieve the understanding which will facilitate the higher (as well as the lower) effects of the Teaching to give the maximum develop- mental help.
auxu | Programme: To keep the group operating as a channel for the successively refined impulses from the Source, and to attune the members to be able to perceive these impulses.
g70e | Characteristics: Enough serious-minded but not indoctrinated people; attitudes suitable for the transmission to act upon; an orientation suitable to accept and work with the materials provided or indicated by the Representative for the time being of the Teaching.
pzvj | Modus Operandi: Meetings, reading, 'audition', performances, practices, theoretical and practical study, organisation of environ- ment.
ii74 | Deterioration: Evidenced by the acceptance of simplifications, contraction of activity, messianic and panacea thinking, hierarchical behaviour patterns believed to be sacrosanct, literal acceptance of the figurative and vice-versa, hagiography, providing social and psychological stimuli and/or reassurances, offering scope for per- sonality-projection, assuaging desires for attention, substituting itself for diversions of a political, organisational, religious, psycho-
n74j | 175
0lss | Contrast this with the kind of group, that of the 'man of learn- ing' surrounded by others, of whom Al-Thauri says 'Be assured that he is an impostor and a fraud: because if he were to tell them the truth, they would hate him'.
