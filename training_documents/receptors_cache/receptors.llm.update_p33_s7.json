Cumulative mutation frequencies and absolute number of patients carrying a mutation in one or more G proteins in each indicated family across all ten thousand four hundred thirty-seven patients in all studies are listed in the last row. Number of heterotrimeric G proteins considered in each family are listed with each family name. The data shown here are based upon data generated by the TCGA Research Network. All data was downloaded from cBio Portal.\n8t55 | Sheet one. Frequencies represent percentage of patients carrying a non-synonymous mutation in each respective GPCR gene. Cumulative mutation frequencies of each gene across all ten thousand four hundred thirty-seven patients in all cohorts are listed in the last column. Sheet two. Enumeration of mutation frequencies in Sheet one, depicting the number of patients carrying a mutation in each GPCR gene. Number of patients in each study are listed above with the study abbreviation.
