You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

m5ka | Numerous studies have evaluated the prognostic value of cardiac magnetic resonance in patients with hypertensive heart disease (as presented in Table 3). Hypertensive heart disease is primarily characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial dilatation, myocardial fibrosis, diastolic before systolic dysfunction, and increased incidence of coro- nary artery disease, both epicardial and microvascular. A comprehensive evaluation of myocardial hypertrophy also allows a proper follow-up of patients on antihypertensive therapy, as the regression of LVH with antihypertensive treatment reduces the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality [27,30]. Morphological and functional changes of the myocardium can be followed through every stage of hypertensive heart disease, even in the subclinical phase, which is important to prevent further complications and development of heart failure with both preserved and reduced ejection fraction. My- ocardial strain abnormalities, important in the early detection of myocardial damage, were observed in the majority of the patients. This is significant as it was shown that global longitudinal strain and its deterioration are associated with major adverse cardiovascular events even in patients with asymptomatic hypertensive heart disease [64]. Left atrial enlargement is a common finding in patients with HHD and is an independent factor

The signs of incipient interstitial fibrosis are accessible to cardiac magnetic resonance through sophisticated tissue characterization techniques, mainly T1 mapping and ECV, and are also a common finding even in patients with the recent onset of hypertension [65-67]. This is important as in the subclinical phase of the disease this type of fibrosis is still reversible with proper and forehand treatment. In the advanced stage with both focal and diffuse fibrosis, myocardial scar quantification can differentiate those patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death, as myocardial scar burden is significantly associated with adverse cardiovascular events, even in patients with preserved ejection fraction [68].

bf9k | 10. Conclusions
otkr | A wide range of clinical and especially subclinical presentations of hypertensive heart disease is often hard to discover, challenging to evaluate properly and incorporate into a proper real-life clinical scenario. The majority of these changes are accessible to the frequently performed diagnostic modalities in an advanced stage of the disease, with an already established high risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Cardiac magnetic resonance is a non-invasive, sophisticated diagnostic tool that can provide more detailed information on left ventricle volumes, tissue characterization, and scar quantification with excellent reproducibility and less inter-observer variability in patients with hypertensive heart disease. It can detect subtle changes in ventricular mass and volume parameters, access overall and regional LV function, and estimate the presence of focal or diffuse myocardial fibrosis. Although it is not recommended as a golden standard in hypertensive heart disease due to its poor availability and relatively low cost-benefit ratio, cardiac magnetic resonance is indicated if there is a severe, progressive left ventricular hypertrophy, an inconclusive echocardiogram or poor acoustic window, and a mismatch between clinical evaluation, ECG, and echocardiography. Additionally, it is of great importance in estimating the positive effects of treatment, as well as an optimal tool in clinical trials. Further studies will bring more information about the benefits of cardiac magnetic resonance in patients with hypertensive heart disease, leading to the more pronounced implementation of this important imaging modality into everyday practice.
