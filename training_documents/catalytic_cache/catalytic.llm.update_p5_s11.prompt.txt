You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

y7ea | Notably, the graphitic FC-1-8-HCl displayed a much larger integral area than FC-0-8, which convincingly demonstrated excellent energy storage performance. In other words, carbon materials with higher graphitization degree exhibit superior Faraday capacitance. In detail, according to the GCD profiles,
nav4 | the FC-1-8 and FC-1-8-HCl electrodes can deliver the specific capacitance as high as 428.0 and <LATEX>2 4 3 . 3 F g ^ { - 1 } a t 1 A g ^ { - 1 } ,</LATEX> whereas the specific capacitance of FC-0-8 are only 84.3 F g 1 at 1 A g 1 (Fig. 5b). The capacitance value of FC-1-8 outperforms most reported Fe-based carbon materials in Table 2.
gem8 | The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was carried out to inspect the kinetic properties of these four samples in the range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz, the results were delivered in Fig. 5c. It was found that low frequency part of the region was almost straight, implying the low diffusion resis- tance.35 <LATEX>{ } ^ { 3 5 } \mathrm { I n }</LATEX> the high frequency part of the EIS plot, FC-1-8 and FC-1- 8-HCl display lower <LATEX>R _ { c }</LATEX> values than FC-0-8. It is reasonable that the improved electrochemical performance is related to the higher graphitic degree. The <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { c t } }</LATEX> values of 0.21 and 0.22 92 for FC-1-8 and FC-1-8-HCl were much lower than that of FC-0-8, 0.41 92, implying the faster charge transfer at the electrode and electrolyte interface.
e8nr | As consistent with the CV analysis, the graphitic electrodes of FC-1-8 and FC-1-8-HCl showed a much longer discharge time than the other counterpart demonstrating higher specific capacitance (Fig. S3+). The higher values in specific capacitance can be contributed to the improved conductivity of graphitic carbon, the larger SSA and the porous structure. The CV curves of FC-1-8 at multiple scan rates were accessed in Fig. 5d. CV curves displayed similar shape with the scan rate decreasing from 100 to 5 mV <LATEX>\mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> (Fig. 5d). The reduction and oxidation peaks moved outwards as the increase of scan rates due to the polarization of the electrode. The details of galvanostatic charge/discharge curves were exhibited in Fig. 5e. Likewise, the galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) curves showing voltage platforms are believed to the nature of pseudocapacitance. FC- 0-8 and FC-1-8-HCl exhibited typical rectangular shape of <LATEX>\mathrm { C V }</LATEX> curves and triangular GCD curves, demonstrating a double layer electric capacitive behavior (Fig. S4+). The cycle stability was carried out by performing 10 000 times <LATEX>\mathrm { a t } 5 A g ^ { - 1 } \left( F i g . 5 f \right) . F C - 1</LATEX> 8 retained a moderate rate of 51.7% compared with the initial capacitance and the inferior cycle stability of FC-1-8 was prob- ably due to the irreversibly oxidized of Fe3C/Fe to Fe3O4 in KOH electrolyte.21 The morphology of FC-1-8 and FC-1-8-HCl samples after electrochemical activation were conducted to uncover the mechanism of electrochemical performance (Fig. S5+). It was found that both samples presented spherical structure as before, while FC-1-8 sample showed a relatively smooth surface compared with the initial one. The absence of Fe3C/Fe species resulted in the inferior cycling performance.
k78w | 4. Conclusions
g9du | In conclusion, we achieved the transformation from amorphous carbon spheres to graphitic carbon through hydrothermal carbonization, chemical activation and graphitization using <LATEX>\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e O } _ { 4 } .</LATEX> The obtained FC-1-8 with graphitic carbon and Fe3C/Fe structure are believed to be the promising electrode material. On the one hand, the embedded Fe3C/Fe NPs are contributed to the pseudocapacitance performance with a high specific capaci- tance of 428.0 <LATEX>F g ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> at a discharge current density of <LATEX>1 \mathrm { A } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 } .</LATEX> On the other hand, the graphitic carbon could improve the conduc- tivity. When removing Fe3C/Fe NPs, the graphitic carbon of FC-1-8-
f682 | HCl with high specific surface area up to 2813.6 m2 g 1 exhibited a high specific capacitance of 243.3 F g 1 at 1 A g 1.
