Chronic high blood pressure leads to various structural and functional changes in the myocardium. Different sophisticated imaging methods are developed to properly estimate the severity of the disease and to prevent possible complications. Cardiac magnetic resonance can provide a comprehensive assessment of patients with hypertensive heart disease, including accurate and reproducible measurement of left and right ventricle volumes and function, tissue characterization, and scar quantification. It is important in the proper evaluation of different left ventricle hypertrophy patterns to estimate the presence and severity of myocardial fibrosis, as well as to give more information about the benefits of different therapeutic modalities. Hypertensive heart disease often manifests as a subclinical condition, giving exceptional value to cardiac magnetic resonance as an imaging modality capable to detect subtle changes. In this article, we are giving a comprehensive review of all the possibilities of cardiac magnetic resonance in patients with hypertensive heart disease.\nbqfb | One. Introduction\nwwdt | Hypertension presents a massive burden for health systems worldwide and is one of the most important cardiovascular risk factors. The incidence of hypertension and its complications, especially in West-Balkan countries, is increasing. More than seventy percent of people with the first heart attack, stroke, or first episode of heart failure have blood pressure higher than one hundred forty over ninety millimeters of mercury. The impact of untreated and uncontrolled blood pressure is undeniable and can cause complications on different target organs, predominantly kidneys, eyes, brain, peripheral arteries, and also the heart. In general, hypertensive heart disease is defined by the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and their clinical manifestations. Different pathophysiological mechanisms inevitably lead to myocardium remodeling and can increase the mortality and cardiac morbidity of patients with hypertension. Myocardial remodeling in these patients is the result of complex myocardial, cellular, and tissue abnormalities leading to changes in the shape, size, and also function of the left ventricle, both diastolic and regional or global systolic. Optimal evaluation of myocardial remodeling is of great importance, not only for making a proper diagnosis but also to follow the impact of the therapy on these patients. Left ventricular hypertrophy, as one of the main characteristics of cardiac remodeling in patients with hypertension, is defined as an abnormal increase in left\nmn1r | ventricular mass and is considered to be a result of an adaptation to an increased cardiac workload. The main pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the progression to left ventricle hypertrophy include not only a response to mechanical stress but also the effect of different neurohormones, growth factors, and cytokines. These complex mechanisms lead to myocyte hypertrophy, as well as myocyte apoptosis, myofibroblast proliferation, and eventually interstitial fibrosis. Although left ventricle hypertrophy and diastolic or systolic dysfunction were marked as the main characteristics of hypertensive heart disease, different novel diagnostic techniques provided more insights into other significant findings in patients with hypertension, especially on diffuse myocardial fibrosis, that can precede the above-mentioned conditions. Myocardial fibrosis in hypertension is originally a part of cardioprotective mechanisms to prevent left ventricular dilatation by increasing ventricular stiffness. This process is diminished in these patients, as it leads to a collagen overproduction, but without a proper protective effect, which gradually leads to the incapability of the ventricle to relax, causing diastolic dysfunction, and heart failure with both preserved, and afterward, reduced ejection fraction. Currently available imaging modalities to properly estimate these processes in both the subclinical and clinical stages of the disease are limited. Cardiac magnetic resonance is a useful, non-invasive, non-radiating imaging modality with excellent reproducibility and less interobserver variability that can provide certain, more detailed information on left ventricle volumes and tissue characterization, including scar quantification and the estimation of diffuse myocardial fibrosis. It has a great correlation with three-dimensional echocardiography and speckle-tracking echocardiography, especially in the evaluation of left ventricle volumes and regional systolic function. Although it is not considered a golden standard imaging modality, the usability of cardiac magnetic resonance in hypertensive heart disease is unquestionable.\n5vqw | In this review, we emphasize the emerging diagnostic and prognostic role of cardiac magnetic resonance in patients with hypertensive heart disease.\nmeyw | Two. Technical Aspects and Possibilities of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance in Patients with Hypertensive Heart Disease\n2e62 | Cardiac magnetic resonance can provide important information in patients with hypertensive heart disease with its high reproducibility, the evaluation of systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and easier and faster evaluation of treatment effects. It is of great value in fibrosis assessment, ischemia detection, and differentiation of multiple causes of left ventricular hypertrophy. The most important sequences that could provide vital information in patients with hypertensive heart disease are steady-state free precession cine, phase contrast sequences, T one and T two weighted fast spin-echo and T two STIR sequences, as well as T one-weighted perfusion and myocardial late gadolinium enhancement sequences. Analysis of three-dimensional myocardial strains with tissue tagging gated to diastole is an important modality in estimating diastolic dysfunction. Novel diagnostic procedures under cardiac magnetic resonance, including myocardial tissue mapping by using the modified Look-Locker inversion-recovery sequence and the estimation of extracellular volume fraction are important in the proper assessment of edema, myocardial infiltration, and local or diffuse myocardial fibrosis. Obtaining all these sequences is essential in the proper evaluation of wall motion, function and velocity, tissue characterization, edema, and fibrosis assessment. Although no specific indications are set for patients with hypertensive heart disease, performing cardiac magnetic resonance could be important not only in the early diagnosis of hypertensive heart disease but also in discovering potential complications and following the effects of different treatment modalities.\n75y3 | Three. Morphological Changes in Patients with Hypertensive Heart Disease\ns2g2 | Long-standing hypertension through increased afterload causes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and accumulation of interstitial collagen fibers, resulting in left ventricular hypertrophy and diffuse myocardial fibrosis. Left ventricular hypertrophy is an\nq1q2 | independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertensive heart disease. There are different patterns of myocardium hypertrophy, but the clinical impact of all these phenotypes is yet to be evaluated. The most common phenotype is concentric hypertrophy which results in a lower cardiac output due to an increased wall thickening. However, the other types of myocardial hypertrophy should not be ignored, as the worst outcome was noted in patients with dilated hypertrophy and those with thick and dilated hypertrophy. Other conditions in patients with hypertension can affect the hypertrophic pattern, including obesity, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. It is important to emphasize the fact that diastolic dysfunction and impairment in left ventricle mechanics occur before left ventricular hypertrophy. This is why the estimation of diastolic function and regional systolic function is of great importance. Myocardial fibrosis in these patients can be focal (reparative) or diffuse (interstitial) and is a consequence of the accumulation of type one and type three collagen fibers. By provoking myocardial stiffness, it subsequently leads to changes in ventricular function, myocardial perfusion, and electrical activity. Therefore, it is crucial to identify patients with these abnormalities to prevent the further progression of the disease.\ncb7r | Four.
