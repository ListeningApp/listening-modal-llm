You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

The former governing role of the social partners in social benefits was moved to a national state agency (UWV) and their major role in the PES board was 'replaced' by an advisory body (the Council for Work and Income, 2002-2012). In 2013, the social partners reached a so called "social agreement" with the government, including a Jobs Agreement for people with (physical/mental) disabilities. In 2015, this led to a certain return of social partners in the governance of the Dutch welfare administration, as members of the Central and Regional Work Chambers of the 35 Dutch labour market regions. Despite this role, their current position is much less direct and powerful than it was before 2002.
y7ea | In short, divergence between current systems is expressed for both 'levels' and 'stakeholders'. Compared to the Netherlands, the Norwegian system has a much stronger degree of (compulsory) cooperation between the state and the municipalities (levels). However, the role of the social partners in the governance of the activation policy is stronger in the Netherlands. Clients are represented in advisory bodies in both countries, without a direct governing role.
nav4 | Discussion
gem8 | In this paper we analysed whether reform trajectories in two welfare administrations reflect NPM and NPG ideas, and how the relationships between levels of government and between public and private stakeholders evolved into the current design of the welfare administrations. Three main lessons about convergence and divergence can be learned from our longitudinal study.
e8nr | Growing convergence and hybridity in reform
k78w | We have seen more convergence in reform paths lately but after an equally long period of strong divergence. In the first decade since 1990, both countries changed their welfare administration
g9du | twice, and both times in different directions; we call this a 'double divergence' (over time and between nations). While Champion and Bonoli (2011) perceived the NAV and SUWI reform as having similar characteristics, our findings suggest they represent different governance models: NPG ideas were prominent in the original 2006 NAV reform (Breit et al. 2022), and NPM ideas are clearly reflected in the 2002 SUWI reform (Van Gestel and Herbillon 2007). Lately we saw more convergence in reform trajectories: a joint adoption of NPM in both countries (2008-2014) and a shared resurgence of NPG ideas (since 2015), in line with the broader international trend towards decentralization and collaborative services (Finn et al. 2019). Recently both countries have again made efforts towards greater standardization and efficiency (NPM). Although there seems increasing convergence in reforms between the two countries, it is early to say whether it will persist, as the period of (more) convergence lasts about as long as the previous divergent reforms.
f682 | Related to the many shifts in governance since 1990, both countries have developed more hybrid and complex systems over time. Alternating NPM and post-NPM, all reforms criticized the previously dominant organization of the welfare state according to traditional hierarchy and functional differentiation. But despite their often radical character, reforms did not completely replace previous models (see also, Christensen et al. 2009; Fossestøl et al. 2015; Greve et al. 2016; Lægreid and Rykkja 2015). Although hybridity with coexisting, overlapping and partly competing elements can be viewed "the rule rather than the exception of the new modes of governance currently being practiced in the provision of social services" (Van Berkel and Borghi 2007, p.283), so far the frequent reforms do not indicate that the different principles of TPA, NPM and NPG are well aligned. At least more balanced combinations of public management models appear necessary to prevent hybridity in a form of barely cohesive layers. Divergence between nations and policy fields
li1k | A second lesson is that increasing convergence in reform paths does not necessarily imply more similar welfare administrations (see also, Christensen et al. 2009). On the contrary, despite greater convergence in reforms since 2008, the present welfare administrations in Norway and the Netherlands are more different than alike (see Tables 3 and 4). Norway and the Netherlands thus proved to be two cases that can illustrate how a common 'activation' policy has led to significantly different welfare administrations.
pbea | Divergence usually points to the need for contextualized research as it is expected that the new welfare administrations take on a specific form due to different (national) socio-economic, institutional and political contexts (Pollitt and Bouckaert 2017; Van Berkel and Borghi 2007). For example, Christensen et al. (2009, p. 1003) found "a strong element of path dependence in the reform trajectories" in a comparison of Germany, the UK and Norway. Champion and Bonoli (2011, p.330) described the impact of path dependence as "once a country has started down a path, it becomes increasingly difficult and costly to completely depart from it", given increasing returns on prior investments. Contrasting, in our study path dependency does not seem an obvious explanation for the different reform paths and their impact on welfare administrations. After all, path dependence would imply that the initial path is reproduced in both countries, which is very different from the radical shifts we found over the past 30 years, most prominently in NAV and SUWI.
ccpt | Also, it has been debated if economic crises and 'activation policies' have triggered similar reform trends across countries (Hemerijck et al. 2012; OECD 1995). For example, the economic crisis since 2008 (with the government in a strong role for saving banks) could easily be viewed an important driver of common NPM-type interventions for efficiency gains in welfare administrations (Hemerijck et al. 2012). It is tempting to link such an explanation e.g. to NAV's return of the benefit administration to the central level (2008) and SUWI's merger of UWV and CWI (2009). But economic crises may also be a welcome excuse for national governments
0fpw | rather than a driver for administrative reform - as the said shifts in NAV and SUWI were already planned in 2006 and 2007, before the banks in 2008 erupted. So we should be careful to give too much explanatory power to common economic pressures.
dqn8 | To better understand governance/organizational reforms and hybrid shifts in governance regimes, we may need to delve deeper into the specificity of the policy field in which these shifts are taking place (see also Greve et al. 2016). Our study highlights important differences between the subfields in the welfare administrations. For example, there appears to be growing scope for decentralized actors and organizations in the PES, but the benefit administration shows an opposite trend towards (more) centralization. This might be related to the specific tasks and risks in national social insurance where decentralization could be less effective for large, automated systems and increase the risk of error. Conversely, the services provided by PES are closely tied to the local/regional labour market, and require cooperation with third parties and beyond professional borders to be effective, so here decentralization is a recurrent trend.
