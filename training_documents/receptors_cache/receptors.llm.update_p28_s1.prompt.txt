You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

jai3 | CXCR4, best-studied for its role in metastasis and modulation of the tumor microenvironment, has also been found to regulate cell survival in ovarian cancer. Blockade of CXCR4 with a small peptide antagonist was not only found to inhibit metastasis but induced ovarian cancer cell death by weakening DNA damage checkpoints and leading to mitotic catastrophe308. The CXCR4/CXCL12 signalling axis has also been shown to protect hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from oxidative stress injury by reducing mitochondrial reactive oxidative species (ROS) and subsequent genotoxic stress309.
p57i | rtic. Chronic stress is another mechanism that has been linked to development of numerous pathological conditions including cardiovascular disease, inflammation, immunosuppression, and tumorigenesis, due in part to the persistent release of stress hormones and catecholamines. Intriguingly, the chronic activation of Gas-coupled ß2-adrenoreceptors by ß-adrenergic catecholamines has been found to trigger DNA damage, which may underlie some of these effects310. Specifically, recruitment and activation of ß-arrestin-1 (ARRB1) by activated ß2- adrenoreceptors was found to facilitate the AKT-mediated activation of MDM2310 (Figure 1). Concomitant with the function of ß-arrestin-1 as a molecular scaffold facilitating the binding of MDM2 to p53, this molecular mechanism altogether leads to the suppression of p53 levels and subsequent accumulation of DNA damage310. This finding coupled with observations that activation of the Gas/PKA signalling axis can lead to DNA damage via the generation of ROS, highlights the complex interrelationship between GPCR, G-protein and ß-arrestin-mediated cellular dynamics controlling DNA damage and integrity310.

i9k5 | The tumor suppressive capacity of GPCRs has also been linked to DNA protective effects. For example, inactivating polymorphisms in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) have been found to promote melanoma through an ultraviolet radiation independent mechanism311 (Figure 1). Indeed, disruptive germline variant alleles in the MC1R gene, collectively referred to as R alleles, are associated with significantly increased somatic mutation burden in melanoma312. Aligned with this, activation of MC1R by a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (a-MSH) has an antioxidant effect by promoting the phosphorylation and stabilization of p53, and an increase in expression of base excision repair enzymes313. In another case, ADGRB1, also known as BAI1, has been found to have potent antiangiogenic and antitumorigenic functions, particularly in brain tumors314. Strikingly, BAI1 has been shown to prevent MDM2-mediated p53 degradation, and BAI1 loss leads to a significant decrease in p53 levels98. The protective effect of BAI1 on p53 degradation is a remarkable illustration of the diverse roles that GPCRs can play in tumorigenesis (Figure 1).

4cgs | GPCRs and Cell Death Resistance
htre | Parallel to driving cancer initiation, GPCR and G-protein-driven signalling has been found to contribute to resistance to cell death, particularly driving chemoresistance in a broad range of cancers (Figure 1). One of the most outstanding examples has been in BCCs (see Gas and SMO sections above), which are driven by overactive hedgehog (HH) signalling through the SMO GPCR76,79,315. Vismodegib, is an FDA-approved SMO inhibitor that is used in the treatment of advanced BCC; however, acquired resistance is a common challenge316. Interestingly, while many cancer types are able to subvert multiple signalling pathways to maintain cancer progression in spite of targeted therapies, BCC have been found to be exclusively dependent on HH signalling for growth. As such, reactivation of HH signalling is a significant driver for BCC drug resistance317. HH pathway inhibitors are under current investigation to combat BCC resistance to vismodegib.
da3c | GPCR signalling has also been found to drive resistance in melanoma. In an open reading frame (ORF) screen designed to assess drivers of resistance to MAPK inhibition in a BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cell line, GPCRs emerged as the highest ranked class of resistance-driving proteins318. GPCR signalling-related proteins, such as guanine exchange factors (GEFs) RASGRP2-4 and VAV1 were also found to be potent effectors of resistance318. Similarly, genome-scale approaches to determining drivers of resistance to BRAF inhibition in melanoma revealed that 4 of the top 10 hits were GPCRs: GPR35, LPAR1, LPAR5, and P2RY8319.

jomo | Interestingly, both RGS proteins and GBy subunits have been implicated as drivers of drug resistance to cancer therapy (Figure 1). Loss of RGS6 has been found to significantly impair doxorubicin-mediated cell death in vitro, and in vivo320. Similarly, loss of RGS10 and RGS17 have been found to contribute to chemoresistance in ovarian cancer321. Mutations in Gß proteins have also been found to be broad and potent drivers of drug resistance among several cancer types. In comparative whole exome sequencing of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant ETV6-ABL1- positive leukaemia cells, GNB1 was among the most significantly mutated genes212. In particular, mutation of GNB1 at K89 was found to drive resistance to tyrosine-kinase inhibitors independent of the targeted kinase by induction of PI3K and MAPK signalling. Outstandingly, in several different in vitro models, ectopic expression of patient-derived Gß mutants but not wild-type GB, rendered cells resistant to targeted kinase inhibitors, including imatinib, nilotinib, and ruxolitinib, highlighting the potent effect of GB mutations213. The broad induction of resistance to kinase inhibitors mediated by GB mutations may represent a previously underappreciated mechanism of A

hb4s | GPCRs and Deregulation of Cellular Energetics
cqq2 | Metabolic reprogramming, from the enzyme level to the global proteome, occurs in cancer to meet the metabolic demands underlying unrestrained cell growth. GPCRs are critical regulators of numerous components of normal metabolism, including glucose and glucagon homeostasis, insulin regulation, and lipogenesis, as well as being key players in adaptive metabolic mechanisms. Moreover, many metabolic products and by-products are the cognate ligands for GPCRs. As such, various metabolite-binding GPCRs play a significant role in tumor promotion through both autocrine and paracrine mechanisms that contribute to control tumor energetic dynamics 52.
1ews | The lactate-binding GPR81 has been found to be significantly upregulated in numerous cancer types and to be a crucial driver of tumor growth and metastasis with further roles modulating the tumor microenvironment in angiogenesis and immune evasion322,323. Similarly GPR91, which binds succinate, has significant roles in modulation of the tumor-immune microenvironment, as well as angiogenesis, together with its role in cellular metabolism324-326 (Figure 1).
