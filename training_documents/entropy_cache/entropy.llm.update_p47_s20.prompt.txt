You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

6746 | In summary: in the continuous case, entropy is not invariant under reparametriza- tions: our choice of coordinates matters! And this can make entropy negative. This applies not only to R but many other measure spaces we'll be considering, like R". This issue will be very important.
r5zg | After learning this, it should be less of a shock that the entropy of a probability distribution on R can be infinite, or even undefined:
hk56 | Puzzle 33. Find three probability distributions p on the real line that have entropy +00, -0, and undefined because it's of the form +00 - 00.
29ac | ENTROPY, ENERGY AND TEMPERATURE
no4d | Suppose a system has some measure space X of states with energy E : X -> R. In thermal equilibrium the probability distribution on states, p: X -> R, maximizes the Gibbs entropy S = - k |p(x) In p(x) dx
nh8n | subject to a constraint on the expected value of energy: (E) = p(x) E(x) dx
ircn | Typically when this happens p is the Boltzmann distribution
npsf | e-E(x)/kT
dynl | p(x) =
msij | Je-E(2)/KT da
8n3m | where T is the temperature and k is Boltzmann's constant.
ech9 | Then as we vary (E) we have
p94v | d(E) = TdS
gf1i | We can now generalize a lot of our work from a finite set of states to a general measure space. I won't redo all the arguments, just state the results and point out a couple of caveats.
rouh | For any measure space X we say a function p: X -> [0, 0) is a probability distri- bution if it's measurable and Jy P(x) dx = 1.
080i | We can define a version of Shannon entropy for p by
4fln | H = - | p(x) log p(x) dx,
tmlf | but physicists mainly use the Gibbs entropy, defined by
oy09 | S = - k _p(x) In p (x ) dx.
wvb1 | As I warned you last time, this can take values in [-00, 0], though we are mainly interested in cases when it's finite. If we think of X as the space of states of some system, we can pick any measurable function E : X -> R and call it the 'energy'. Its expected value is then
qi9a | (E) = |E(x)p(x) dx
r7ii | at least when this integral converges.
ezxx | We say the probability distribution p describes thermal equilibrium if it maximizes S subject to a constraint (E) = c. Typically when this happens p is a Boltzmann distribution
zzb7 | p(x) = 1x e-BE(x) e-BE(x) dx
zts3 | where ß is called the coolness. I say 'typically' because even when X is a finite set, we saw in Puzzle 24 that there can be thermal equilibria that are not Boltzmann distributions, but only limits of Boltzmann distributions as 3 > + or > -00. This can also happen for other measure spaces X. I will not delve into this, because my goal now is to get to some physics.
q5zo | As before, we can write B = 1/kT, at least if 8 / 0, and then write the Boltzmann distribution as
z20w | X -E(x)/kT dx e-E(x)/kT
ig3d | p(x) =
dgts | Also as before, the Boltzmann distributions obey the crucial relation
p1zf | dH = Bd(E).
k0wj | Rewriting this in terms of Gibbs entropy S = kH and temperature T = 1/kß, it becomes this famous relation between temperature, entropy and the expected energy: TdS = d(E).
p83v | Notice that the units match here. The Shannon entropy H is dimensionless, but since k has units of energy/temperature, the Gibbs entropy S = kH has units of energy/temperature. Thus TdS has units of energy, as does d(E).
5yts | THE CHANGE IN ENTROPY
l1qt | As we change the temperature of a system from Ti to T2 while keeping it in thermal equilibrium, the change in its entropy is
183q | S(T1) - S(To) = 1. T0 T1 d(E) T
vdw3 | where (E) is its expected energy at temperature T.
8whh | Last time we saw that as we change the expected energy (E) of a system while keeping it in thermal equilibrium, this fundamental relation holds:
iywu | TdS = d(E).
qn1v | We can rewrite this as
o9ng | ds = d(E) T
6od4 | and then integrate this from one temperature to another-remember, as the expected energy changes, so does the temperature. We get
jx1z | Tı d(E)
hrlm | / T = S(11) - S(To).
wfjt | This is the main way people do experiments to 'measure entropy'. Slowly heat something up, keeping track of how much energy it takes to increase its temperature each little bit. Using this data you can approximately calculate the integral at left and that gives the change in entropy!
g779 | But so far we're just measuring changes in entropy. How can you figure out the actual value of the entropy? One way is to assume the Third Law of Thermodynamics, which says that in thermal equilibrium the entropy approaches zero as the temperature approaches zero from above. This gives
by5l | Tı d(E) F = S(T)
wye3 | This is how people often 'measure the entropy' of a system in thermal equibrium. They heat it up starting from absolute zero, very slowly so they hope it is close to thermal equilibrium at every moment-and they take data on how much energy is used, and approximately calculate the integral at left!
oc7w | But this relies on the Third Law of Thermodynamics. So where does that come from?
k5k4 | THE THIRD LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
wngq | If a system has countably many states, with just one of lowest energy, and thermal equilibrium is possible for this system for some temperature T > 0, then its entropy in thermal equilibrium approaches zero as T approaches zero from above:
udft | lim S(T) = 0 T-+0+
foay | Some people say the Third Law of Thermodynamics this way: "entropy is zero at absolute zero". But it's not really that simple indeed, other people say it's impossible to reach absolute zero. Above I've stated a version of the Third Law that's actually a theorem. Let's prove it!
43mx | Actually, let's prove it now for systems with only finitely many states. It'll be easier to handle systems with countably infinite number of states later, when we've developed more tools. And by the way, we'll see the Third Law isn't always true for systems with a continuum of states. It will fail for all three of the problems on our big to-do list: the classical harmonic oscillator, the classical particle in a box and the classical ideal gas. This is often taken as a failure of classical mechanics, since switching to quantum mechanics makes the Third Law hold for these systems.
ld7j | Let's show that for a system with finitely many states i = 1, ... , n with energies Ei, as the temperature T approaches zero from above, the entropy of the system in thermal equilibrium approaches k ln N where N is the number of lowest-energy states. In thermal equilibrium
mf5v | Pi xe -Ei/kT.
f31w | Thus, all states with the lowest energy have the same probability, while as the temper- ature approaches zero from above, any higher-energy states have pi -> 0. So, as the temperature approaches zero from above, the probability of the system being in any one of its N lowest-energy states approaches 1/N, and we get
yofz | 1 T->0+ lim S(T) = lim -kp; Inpi = - k T->0+ i=1 n i=1 N N 1
4mdw | ln N = kln N.
49f1 | In particular, if the system has just one lowest-energy state, we get the Third Law of Thermodynamics:
csae | lim S(T) = 0.
c29v | Here T -> 0+ means that T is approaching zero from above.
