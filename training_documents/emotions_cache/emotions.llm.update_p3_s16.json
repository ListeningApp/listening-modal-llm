As illustrated in Figure Two A, to claim that happiness and sadness are perfectly negatively cor- related is to predict that all but the most intense levels of happiness are accompanied by some amount of sadness, that all but the most intense levels of sadness are accompanied by some amount of happiness, and that people cannot feel neutral (i.e., neither happy nor sad). In addition to being implausible, these predictions are inconsistent with the findings of Carroll and Russell, who asked people in classroom settings to rate their happiness and sadness. Few subjects fell anywhere near the diagonal representing a perfect negative correlation. Most reported varying degrees of happiness, some reported varying degrees of sadness, but only eleven percent reported feeling both happy and sad. With allowance for measurement error, these data are consis- tent with the valence-arousal model's contention that happiness and sadness are mutually exclusive.\na7ao | Though they disagree about whether emotions at opposite ends of the bipolar valence dimension (e.g., happiness and sadness) are perfectly negatively correlated or mutually exclusive, both the PA-NA and valence-arousal models agree that the bipolar valence dimension is irreducible. In contrast, Cacioppo and Berntson's evaluative space model (ESM) conceptualizes the positive and negative substrates underlying the bipolar valence dimension as separable. Drawing on a variety of findings including evidence that people can have both positive and negative reactions toward attitude objects, the ESM contends that affective reactions can be characterized by any pattern of positivity and negativity. This conceptualization can be extended to the experience of emotion, including such polar opposite emotions as happiness and sadness. Whereas the PA-NA and valence-arousal models contend that happiness and sadness are perfectly negatively correlated and mutually exclusive, respectively, the ESM allows for the possibil- ity that people can experience any pattern of happiness and sadness. Because ambivalent states provide poor behav- ioral guidance, the ESM does not contend that polar opposite emotions always or even usually\n29a3 | co-occur. Rather, polar opposite emotions should be most likely to co-occur in bittersweet situations, which we conceptualize as those containing both pleasant and unpleasant aspects.\nsb1e | Initial Evidence for Mixed Emotions\nw2yn | Some evidence indicates that people can feel happy and sad at the same time. Stanley and Meyer asked subjects to report their emotions after they had watched each of twenty-four evocative film clips. Parallel factor analyses revealed a two-factor solution with valence and arousal dimensions. Additional analyses revealed a three-factor solution in which the valence dimension split into two positivity and negativity factors anchored by happy and sad. Pos- itivity and negativity were only modestly negatively correlated, which suggests that some of the films may have made some subjects feel mixed emotions of happiness and sadness.\nap6l | Factor analyses are based on correlation matrices, but negative correlation coefficients shed little light on the co-occurrence of two emotions. A more direct approach to assessing the co-occurrence of happiness and sadness is to count how many people report feeling both. Many early psychologists took this approach, and some found evidence for mixed emotions, but as Beebe-Center and Schimmack and Colcombe pointed out, methodological limitations prevent any firm conclusions. In a more rigorous study, J. T. Larsen et al. asked moviegoers whether they felt happy, sad, and other pairs of polar opposite emotions (e.g., calm vs. tense) just before or just after they had watched Life Is Beau- tiful, a tragicomedy set in a World War Two con- centration camp. Consistent with the valence-arousal model, all pairs of polar opposite emotions rarely co-occurred before the film. Notably, only ten percent of subjects reported feeling both happy and sad. Also consistent with the valence-arousal model, most pairs of polar opposite emotions rarely co-occurred after the film. There was but one exception: Forty-four percent of these subjects re- ported mixed emotions of happiness and sadness. Other studies indicate that meaningful life transitions (e.g., college graduation;\n```",
