        "content": "k78w | Observational constraints on Hubble constant and deceleration parameter in power-law cosmology\ng9du | ABSTRACT\nf682 | In this paper, we show that the expansion history of the Universe in power-law cosmology essentially depends on two crucial parameters, namely the Hubble constant H zero and deceleration parameter Q. We find the constraints on these parameters from the latest H of z and S N e I a data. At lo level the constraints from H of z data are obtained as Q equals negative zero point one eight plus zero point one two minus zero point one two and H zero equals sixty-eight point four three plus two point eight four minus two point eight zero kilometers per second per megaparsec while the constraints from the S N e I a data read as Q equals negative zero point three eight plus zero point zero five minus zero point zero five and H zero equals sixty-nine point one eight plus zero point five five minus zero point five four kilometers per second per megaparsec. We also perform the joint test using H of z and S N e I a data, which yields the constraints Q equals negative zero point three four minus zero point zero five and H zero equals sixty-eight point nine three plus zero point five three one minus zero point five two kilometers per second per megaparsec. The estimates of H zero are found to be in close agreement with some recent probes carried out in the literature. The analysis reveals that the observational data successfully describe the cosmic acceleration within the framework of power-law cosmology. We find that the power-law cosmology accommodates well the H(z) and S N e I a data. We also test the power-law cosmology using the primordial nucleosynthesis, which yields the constraints Q greater than zero point seven two and H zero less than or equal to forty-one point four nine kilometers per second per megaparsec. These constraints are found to be inconsistent with the ones derived from the H(z) and S N e I a data. We carry out the statefinder analysis, and find that the power-law cosmological models approach the standard A. C. D. M. model as Q approaches negative one. Finally, we conclude that despite having several good features power-law cosmology is not a complete package for the cosmological purposes.\nli1k | One INTRODUCTION\npbea | Power-law cosmology finds a reasonable place in the literature to address some common problems such as the age problem, flatness problem, horizon problem associated with the Standard Cold Dark Matter model based on Big Bang theory. In such a cosmology, the cosmological evolution is described by the scale factor a of t proportional to t to the power of n, where n is a constant. The viability of the model with n greater than one has been explored in a series of articles in different contexts. Observational constraints on phantom power-law cosmology are discussed by Kaeonikhom, Gumjudpai and Saridakis. The motivation for such an endeavor is followed by a number of considerations. For instance, power-law cosmological models with n greater than one do not encounter the horizon problem at all. These models do not witness the flatness problem since the matter density is not constrained by the scale factor. In these models, age of the Universe turns out at least fifty percent greater than the age predicted by the Standard Cold Dark Matter model. This bridges the gap between the age of the Universe and the age estimates of globular clusters and high-z redshift galaxies, and thus the age problem is alleviated. Sethi, Dev and Jain showed that an open linear coasting cosmological model constrained with type I a supernovae gold sample and ages of old quasars accommodates a very old high-redshift quasar, which the Standard Cold Dark Matter model fails to do. The linear coasting cosmology is found to be consistent with the gravitational lensing statistics and the primordial nucleosynthesis.\nccpt | Kaplinghat et al. found that the power-law cosmological models which succeed in primordial nucleosynthesis are in conflict with the constraints from Hubble expansion rates and S N e I a magnitude redshift relations.\n0fpw | In any cosmological model, the Hubble constant H zero and deceleration parameter Q play an important role in describing\ndqn8 | the nature of evolution of the Universe. The former one tells us the expansion rate of the Universe today while the latter one characterizes the accelerating q less than zero or decelerating q greater than zero nature of the Universe. In the recent past, there have been numerous attempts to estimate the value of H zero. Freedman et al. used the Hubble Space Telescope observations of Cepheid variable to estimate a value of H zero equals seventy-two plus or minus eight kilometers per second per megaparsec. An observational determination of the Hubble constant obtained by Suyu et al. based upon measurements of gravitational lensing by using the Hubble Space Telescope yielded a value of H zero equals sixty-nine point seven minus five point zero plus four point nine kilometers per second per megaparsec. WMAP seven-year results gave an estimate of H zero equals seventy-one point zero plus or minus two point five kilometers per second per megaparsec based on WMAP data alone, and an estimate of H zero equals seventy point four minus one point four plus one point three kilometers per second per megaparsec based on WMAP data with Gaussian priors corresponding to earlier estimates from other studies. A recent estimate of the Hubble constant, which used a new infrared camera on the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the distance and redshift for a collection of astronomical objects, gives a value of H zero equals seventy-three point eight plus or minus two point four kilometers per second per megaparsec. An alternative probe using data from galactic clusters gave a value of H zero equals sixty-seven point zero plus or minus three point two kilometers per second per megaparsec.",
