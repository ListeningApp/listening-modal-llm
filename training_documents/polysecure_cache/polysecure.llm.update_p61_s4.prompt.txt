You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

cusa | . When you ask your spouse or partner for more of their time or affection they get defensive and point out all of the professional, financial or domestic things that they do to show their commitment.
yrit | . You often feel alone in your relationship even though you live together or are around each other a lot.
xwzi | . You or your partner defer to gender stereotypes to make the absence of cer- tain forms of emotional or sexual connection more tolerable, such as "that's just how men are" or "well you know how women can be."
7rjv | . In your relationship, the ideal of the marriage or the greater purpose of the family have become more important than the direct experience of how you treat each other.
daj4 | . You're married or in primary partnership, but feel like you're always getting the short end of the stick when it comes to your spouse or partner's time, affection and attention.
dt0u | . You know your partner is committed to you, but you don't know if they actu- ally like and enjoy being with you.
iroe | If you experience any of these things I suggest working with your partner or part- ners to strengthen the emotional experience of your secure attachment, which is covered in Part Three. As I address in the next chapter, I've seen the dangers of people depending on the structure of their relationship to feel safe together. When they change that structure, either through opening up from monogamy or transi- tioning to a less hierarchical form of CNM, it can expose relational insecurities that were disguised by the pseudo or contrived security acquired from the previous relationship structure. The takeaway message here is not to abolish all relationship
m9bf | hierarchies or shared bank accounts, but instead for people to procure secure at- tachment from their relational experiences instead of their relationship structures. Allow your direct experience with a partner to be the vehicle to secure attachment instead of having certain relationship concepts, narratives or structures be the vehicle. When our experience with a partner is the route to secure attachment, we might still want certain relationship structures, benchmarks and milestone experi- ences, but the urgency at which we define, solidify or need to nail things down can relax and occur more organically.
44d4 | Current research and resources about attachment and consensual non- monogamy are scarce and at an embryonic stage. I am hopeful that more research and resources will continue to crop up as awareness and acceptance of non- monogamy continues to grow, but for many people it will not be soon enough. Part Three is designed to walk you through the different components of secure func- tioning, not based on your relationship structure, but based on the behaviors that you can apply to any of your CNM relationships in which you seek to deepen pol- ysecurity.
5rgr | CHAPTER SIX THE IMPORTANCE OF ATTACHMENT IN CONSENSUAL NONMONOGAMY
a1gl | TO START, LET ME SAY that secure attachment with multiple romantic partners is possible. Honestly, it's really a necessity to do CNM well and thrive, but we'll get to that. Just as children do not only bond with one attachment figure, adults do and can have multiple securely attached relationships. When secure functioning is at play within CNM relationships, partners communicate well, trust each other, stick to their agreements and discuss wanted changes. They tend to have more comper- sion for their partners, they act respectfully towards their metamours and while they still do experience jealousy or envy, they are also able to support each other in the process. Jealousy becomes an opportunity for increased clarity and connection and it doesn't take them or their relationships down. When I talk to CNM folks who are securely attached, they may admit that their relationships require work and ac- knowledge that they are not always easy (more people means more complexity, and scheduling is always going to be an issue), but they also describe an underlying sense of ease within and throughout their relationships. When people are securely attached, they enjoy each other and the process of living as consensually non- monogamous.
vxin | My experience with CNM clients has taught me an enormous amount about how and why understanding CNM through an attachment lens is so important. As CNM individuals and couples began to seek my counsel, I began to notice two dis- tinct camps: those who were mostly thriving and those who seemed to be barely surviving. For those who were thriving, our work was often short-term. As these people entered into a new relationship paradigm, they reached out to me for some support, guidance and perspective. They usually quickly expressed that they had got what they came for. Now better able to implement their CNM journey, they moved merrily along their way. Every few months, I'd even receive a text or email with photos of their entire smiling polycule around a kitchen table (I kid you notl).
vj4s | These people still reached out for therapy or coaching sessions once in a while due to breakups, STI scares, uncharted CNM situations to figure out and relationship transitions to process, but overall, CNM was working for them. They expressed feel- ing secure, and from my perspective they were enacting their multiple romantic partnerships, as well as their metamour relationships, from a place of secure func- tioning.
x4c3 | I call these people who thrive with their multiple partners polysecure. This is the state of being both securely attached to multiple romantic partners and having enough internal security to be able to navigate the structural relationship insecurity inherent to nonmonogamy, as well as the increased complexity and uncertainty that occurs when having multiple partners and metamours. More succinctly, being polysecure is having secure attachment with yourself and your multiple partners. Polysecure people are functioning securely both interpersonally and intraper- sonally, both of which will be examined in more detail in Part Three.
jhyp | There may be some people who enter nonmonogamy and are able to be poly- secure right off the bat, but for many people this is not the case. All of my clients want to be secure within their selves and with their partners, but often the reality of nonmonogamy is too complicated, painful, dramatic, confusing and even trauma- tizing. These people transition to nonmonogamy and feel more polyinsecure than polysecure. For some of the individuals and couples I've worked with, their CNM struggles mirror the relationship challenges they encountered when previously monogamous, but many people are surprised, even shocked, by the issues they face because they are so unlike their monogamous past. Among couples who tran- sition from monogamy to polyamory, many had healthy, secure monogamous rela- tionships together and can't make sense of why they are now having so many com- munication problems, misunderstandings or fights despite their best efforts to be clear and loving with each other. Some of these couples feel as if they are falling apart at the seams. For many, the transition to poly (whether solo or with a part- ner) brings up forms of insecurity, anxiety and even panic attacks that they may not have experienced before. It is not uncommon for me to hear people say that they
1dwr | theoretically want to be poly, but emotionally they don't know if they can do it be- cause they feel like they are losing their mind.
0acx | People struggling with a transition from monogamy to CNM may also find themselves without practical support from their friends, family and community. Sometimes, the people closest to them, even therapists, advise these struggling couples or individuals to go back to being monogamous. I have heard such cou- ples receive advice that sounds something like, "Well, if you're struggling more in your relationship or with yourself now that you're polyamorous, you should just go back to being monogamous and everything will be OK again."
