        "content": "jie2 | Other additional storage options that have been discussed in the literature include depleted gas and oil fields, which are considered appropriate for hydrogen underground storage because of their proven containment of natural gas, well explored subsurface, and developed capacity and infrastructure. Capacity estimates in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands show large potentials. Scafidi et al. identified ninety-five suitable depleted gas fields on the UK continental shelf with a total working gas capacity of six point nine petawatt hours energy equivalent of hydrogen. This estimate is slightly higher than the total hydrocarbon storage capacity in gas fields reported by Mouli-Castillo et al., which is based on the initial gas-in-place capacity of the respective hydrocarbon fields resulting in two point seven petawatt hours energy equivalent of hydrogen. Large storage potentials in depleted gas fields were also predicted for the Netherlands, one of the largest producers of natural gas in Europe. Estimates based on the original-gas-in-place analysis show that onshore capacities of two hundred seventy-seven terawatt hours and offshore capacities of one hundred seventy-nine terawatt hours could add up to a total of four hundred fifty-six terawatt hours energy equivalent of hydrogen in the Netherlands, which is an order of magnitude higher than the estimated hydrogen storage potential in salt caverns of forty-three terawatt hours. In Germany, too, depleted gas and oil fields could offer large storage capacities, but estimates on the original gas in place capacity are not publicly available, only cumulative production numbers. Cumulative gas production from all fields at standard temperature and pressure is one point zero five eight five one two times ten to the power of twelve cubic meters current as of one January two thousand twenty-one. Of this, one hundred fourteen point seven one nine times ten to the power of nine cubic meters of natural gas was produced from gas fields that are depleted today, most of it in Lower Saxony.",
