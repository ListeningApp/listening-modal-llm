You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

q8pa | In the case example at the beginning of this chapter, the many nonverbal cues evident during the inter- action between Mr. Johnson and Rigel were significant moments during Mr. Johnson's commu- nication and may be interpreted as interpersonal events. Additionally, when Mr. Johnson mentioned to Rigel that it wasn't his fault that their interaction the day before was not productive, another inter- personal event occurred: an intimate self-disclosure. Mr. Johnson admitted to Rigel that he was respon- sible for the interaction having gone poorly.

351p | Crisis points
zzcb | Limitations of therapy
mxnx | A client needs a piece of equipment that is unavailable within the therapeutic environment.
11k8 | Contextual inconsistencies
twwy | The location of the therapy session changes.
fyp8 | During therapy, interpersonal events such as these may be precipitated by the following circumstances.
z994 | A client's interpersonal characteristics or reactions to something inside or outside of the therapeutic context
vvqn | The therapist's behavior (e.g., the therapist makes a suggestion or asks a question that the client perceives as intrusive or emotionally difficult)
p6xg | These examples are only a few of the myriad possible in- terpersonal events that occur during the course of occu- pational therapy (Fig. 3.6).
bppc | When interpersonal events of therapy occur, their interpretation is a product of the client's unique set of
ilnw | interpersonal characteristics and reactions in the moment. Sometimes the event has a significant effect on the client, whereas at other times a client is unaffected or minimally affected. When such events occur, it is important that the therapist be aware that the event has occurred and take responsibility for responding appropriately. The therapist should not overreact or underreact to the event. Instead, the therapist should watch for any cues from the client and listen to anything that the client may say about the event that could prompt a certain type of response from the therapist.
f3rc | Interpersonal events are:
d7bx | Inevitable during the course of therapy
gx97 | Ripe with both threat and opportunity
ppkp | Interpersonal events are part of the constant give and take that occurs during a therapy process. They are dis- tinguished from other events or processes in that they are charged with the potential for an emotional response either when they occur or later upon reflection. Con- sequently, if they are ignored or responded to less than optimally, these events can threaten both the therapeutic relationship and the client's occupational engagement. When optimally responded to, the events can provide opportunities for positive client learning or change and for solidifying the therapeutic relationship.

Chapter 6 describes and gives examples of interpersonal events that have been found from our observations to occur with a high level of frequency in occupational therapy. Because they are unavoidable in any therapeutic interaction, one of the primary tasks of a therapist practicing according to the IRM is to respond to these inevitable events in a way that leads to repair and strengthening of the therapeutic relationship.
2kb3 | The Therapist's Use of Self
lqcx | Within the IRM, the therapist is responsible for mak- ing every reasonable effort to make the relationship work through effective communication and interaction with the client. This requires a tremendous amount of self-discipline and empathy, particularly when clients are not at their best. Specifically, the therapist is responsible for bringing three main interpersonal capacities into the relationship.
3h7w | An interpersonal skill base

b7nk | Capacity for interpersonal reasoning
cbb5 | This section provides a brief description of each of these interpersonal capacities. The first capacity involves devel- opment and application of a wide-ranging interpersonal
5qcf | PRACTICAL APPLICATION 3.4
8u2c | Let's revisit an example from the suboptimal inter- action between the occupational therapist, Erika, and her client, Vera, presented in Chapter 1. As you may recall, several interpersonal events occurred during that interaction, in rapid succession. Accord- ing to the IRM, this is referred to as an interper- sonal event cascade.
c1e3 | The first interpersonal event was boundary test- ing. Vera asks Erika numerous questions to test her credibility, including whether she has had personal experience with breast cancer. This was followed by an intimate self-disclosure on the part of the ther- apist, when Erika revealed to Vera that her grand- mother had pancreatic cancer. This disclosure was impulsive and not well planned. Instead, it repre- sented a reactionary attempt on Erika's part to prove to Vera her legitimacy as a cancer expert. Instead of quelling the situation, the disclosure prompted a nonverbal cue, followed by a power dilemma that ended poorly with an empathic break.
7pez | Boundary Testing
qs5t | Clients will certainly ask personal questions of their therapists, but they are not necessarily entitled to know the answers. Asking about a therapist's health history, for example, is confidential information. By doing this, Vera put Erika in an awkward position, leaving her with a few choices to respond-some therapeutic and others suboptimal.
en4s | Therapeutic Responses
csb5 | One example of a therapeutic response involves making an educated guess, or a construal that gives words to Vera's troublesome behavior that includes pausing and sharing with Vera how she is experi- encing the questioning. Erika might say, "Vera, you have a lot of questions for me. I am wondering if you have concerns about whether I have enough knowledge and experience to understand your unique experience with cancer." Another therapeutic response that does not involve interpreting Vera's behavior may involve answering all Vera's questions about cancer except for her personal question. If Vera persists, Erika could set a limit, such as:
i096 | "Vera, I appreciate that you would like to know about me and about any personal experience I have
tlzt | had with cancer. As a rule, I do not disclose this kind of personal information to the people I work with because I feel that the focus of my work should be on understanding your unique experience, rather than trying to relate any experience I or a loved one may have had to your experience."
6iyf | One may ask why Erika's refusal to answer Vera's question could be more therapeutic than what she actually did, which was to disclose her grand- mother's experience with pancreatic cancer. The reason that withholding this information would have been more therapeutic than disclosing it lies in three of the underlying principles of the IRM: Principle 2: Interpersonal Self-Discipline Is Fundamental to Effective Use of Self, Principle 3: It Is Necessary to Keep Head Before Heart, and Principle 4: Mindful Empathy Is Required to Know Your Client. These and the other 10 underlying principles of IRM are discussed in further detail at the end of this chapter. Suboptimal Response
o1nk | In the actual interaction, Erika engaged in another interpersonal event, an intimate self-disclosure, by responding to Vera's question with a brief personal disclosure that her grandmother had pancreatic cancer. This response was suboptimal for two rea- sons. First, from Vera's perspective it did not add to her credibility as someone with expertise in cancer. Erika's brief mention that her grandmother had pancreatic cancer really did not do justice to the hours she spent caring for and spending time with her grandmother as she was receiving treatment and also during her period of palliative care. Erika did not have the opportunity to share the range of painful emotions she experienced during her grand- mother's cancer experience, nor did she have the chance to explain the ways in which she gained ex- tensive knowledge about cancer, cancer treatments, and cancer rehabilitation. Importantly, Erika did not have the chance to explain how the experience of caring for her grandmother and sharing in her can- cer experience strengthened her character and gave her a new perspective about living as well as dying.
