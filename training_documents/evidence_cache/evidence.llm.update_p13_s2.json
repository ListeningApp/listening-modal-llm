        "content": "lhkq | The experiment has several important limitations worth enumerating. First, the tasks are relatively short, self-contained, and lack a dimension of context-specific knowledge, which may inflate our estimates of ChatGPT's usefulness. The results on job satisfaction and self-efficacy are similarly limited, reflecting enjoyment of a small task rather than feelings about a worker's whole job, as evidenced by the fact that there is no difference between the treatment and control groups in real job satisfaction after two weeks. Second, an experiment, by its nature, captures only direct, immediate effects of ChatGPT on the selected occupations. There will be many indirect, reinforcing, or counteracting \"general-equilibrium\" effects as labor markets and production systems adapt to the advent of technologies like ChatGPT. The effects of ChatGPT will also likely vary by occupation, task, and skill level.\n82ju | Only time and future research will fully reveal how ChatGPT and its successors will affect labor markets. For now, the evidence we provide suggests that generative AI technologies will-and have already begun-to noticeably impact workers.\ny2qo | Fourteen",
