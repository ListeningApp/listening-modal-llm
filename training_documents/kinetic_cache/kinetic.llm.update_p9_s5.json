        "content": "9g22 | At pH equals five, the ET2-PT channel dominates over the entire range of potentials considered. The concentration of Ru three plus OH two at this pH is much smaller, virtually eliminating the contribution from the ET1 channel. The EPT1 channel is also not accessible because the mole fraction of Ru three plus OH minus dot dot dot H3O plus is negligible at this pH. Moreover, ET2 is much faster than EPT2 due to its smaller reorganization energy. For these reasons, the ET2-PT channel is dominant at\n41fx | pH equals five. P H equals S pH equals one, three, five, the two major competing channels are the ET1 and ET2 channels, corresponding to PCET via the PTET and ETPT mechanisms, respectively. Both the ET1 and ET2 rate constants are pH-independent. The ET1 channel dominates at pH equals one and three, whereas the ET2-PT channel dominates at pH equals five. This interpretation is supported by the experimentally measured maximum rate constants and corresponding electronic coupling H a b, which are similar at pH equals one and three but significantly different at pH equals five. This experimental observation is consistent with the same dominant channel at pH equals one and three but a different dominant channel at pH equals five. The weak pH dependence observed experimentally arises from the intrinsic difference between the rate constants of the ET1 and ET2-PT channels due to their distinct electronic coupling and the change of their relative contributions with pH due to the changes in the mole fractions of Ru three plus OH minus and\n7um8 | Ru three plus OH two. This analysis also provides insights into the change of apparent reorganization energy at pH equals one, three, and five. The apparent reorganization energy is extracted as the driving force when k app equals one half k max app. At pH equals three and five, the k E curve is shifted toward lower potential compared to the curve at pH equals one, leading to larger apparent reorganization energies for pH equals three and five compared to pH equals one. These observations could be interpreted to suggest the same mechanism at pH equals three and five and a different mechanism at pH equals one. However, our general model suggests an alternative interpretation. The dominant channel is the same at pH equals one and pH equals three, and the curve shift for pH equals three leading to a higher apparent reorganization energy is due to the negligible mole fraction of Ru three plus OH two at high potentials and the increased mole fraction of Ru three plus OH two at lower potentials. At pH equals five, the ET2-PT channel dominates, and the difference in reduction potential for ET2 compared to ET1 leads to the curve shift. It is somewhat fortuitous that the apparent reorganization energy is nearly the same at pH equals three and five.\nuow2 | Finally, we designed new experiments to test the model prediction of k max app at higher pH. Figure seven a shows the structures of the catalyst when anchored to a metal oxide electrode. In the previous study, phosphonate anchor groups, top, were used. These anchors are unstable at pH greater than five, thus prohibiting electrochemical PCET kinetics measurement at higher pH. Here, we prepared a new Ru-based water catalyst with siloxane anchor groups, bottom in Figure seven a. Detailed synthetic procedures and characterizations are provided in the Supporting Information. The siloxane anchor is stable over a much wider pH range of zero point five to twelve, allowing us to quantify the pH dependence over the\niat7 | entire pH range. Similar to the previously studied catalyst, when anchored on the indium tin oxide surface, this new Ru two plus catalyst also has an MLCT absorption band centered around four hundred ninety-five nanometers. When a positive potential sufficient to oxidize the ruthenium center from Ru two plus to Ru three plus is applied to the film, this feature is attenuated, indicating oxidation of the ruthenium center.",
