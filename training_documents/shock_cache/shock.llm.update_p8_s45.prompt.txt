You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

Additionally, a meta-analysis that included 2583 patients with nonsurgical CS assessed the impact of epinephrine treatment on short-term mortality out- comes. This study found that epinephrine treated pa- tients had significantly greater adjusted risk of mortality (adjusted OR, 4.7 [95% CI, 3.4-6.4]).62 Epinephrine's apparent lack of benefit relating to hemodynamic pa- rameters, increased myocardial oxygen consumption, and the potential increased risk of developing refractory CS and death, when compared with norepinephrine, raise concerns about its use as a first-line treatment in CS. However, further data are required to establish nor- epinephrine's superiority over epinephrine as the first- line therapy in CS with hypotension.

Although these agents increase myocardial contractility and lusitropy like traditional inotropes, they also have the effect of reducing cardiac afterload through vaso- dilation. The use of milrinone and dobutamine has re- cently been compared through the CAPITAL DOREMI (Milrinone as Compared with Dobutamine in the Treatment of Cardiogenic Shock) study, a single-center, double-blinded randomized controlled trial.56 This study included 192 patients (96 participants in each treatment arm) admitted to ICU with CS and randomized to re- ceive either milrinone or dobutamine. There was no dif- ference in the primary composite outcome of in-hospital mortality, resuscitated cardiac arrest, cardiac transplan- tation or mechanical circulatory support, nonfatal myo- cardial infarction, stroke, or renal replacement therapy (relative risk [RR], 0.9 [95% CI, 0.69-1.19]). In a prespeci- fied subgroup analysis, which included 65 patients with AMI-CS, there was also no significant difference in the primary composite outcome between agents (hazard ratio [HR], 1.35 [95% CI, 0.73-2.47]).63 However, the findings from this study should be interpreted with a de- gree of caution due to its small sample size potentially rendering the trial underpowered to detect the smaller than anticipated treatment effects in both the primary composite and secondary outcomes. Furthermore, its generalizability to other clinical settings may be limited as it was a single-center study conducted in a quater- nary level ICU. Nevertheless, considering these findings,

7w7j | Vasoactive Medications in Refractory Hypotension
51vd | The treatment of refractory hypotension in CS repre- sents a significant challenge. In the setting of severe metabolic acidosis, which occurs due to tissue hy- poxia and subsequent activation of anaerobic meta- bolic pathways, both in vivo and ex vivo experimental data has demonstrated reduced vascular and cardiac responsiveness to catecholamines.64 The relatively preserved vasopressor effects in the setting of acido- sis of vasopressin and methylene blue render these drugs a reasonable choice to trial as salvage therapy in cases of catecholamine-refractory vasoplegia. 48,65
baj1 | A STEPWISE APPROACH TO VASOACTIVE THERAPY IN CARDIOGENIC SHOCK
n1wo | Presented in Figure 4 is a proposed stepwise approach for the use of vasoactive agents in CS. In the initial phase of therapy, we suggest that patients should be stratified into 2 phenotypes, those with hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg, MAP ≤65 mm Hg, or >30-mm Hg reduction in MAP from baseline with evidence of hypoperfusion) or low cardiac output (de- termined clinically, biochemically, or through an inva- sive hemodynamic assessment) and preserved blood pressure. The algorithm advocates for the initial cor- rection of hypotension, followed by the treatment of the low cardiac output state with the use of inodilator therapy. The timing and role for the use of MCS in this clinical situation remains less certain and is outside the scope of this review. However, persistent severe CS should prompt clinician consideration for MCS therapy at any stage of the proposed treatment pathway. This strategy leverages the emerging data supporting the use of norepinephrine as a first-line therapy, while em- phasizing the need for ongoing and repeated assess- ment throughout the treatment journey to tailor therapy based on the current prevailing hemodynamic status.

The MAP, defined as the average blood pres- sure during a cardiac cycle, can be equated to the end-organ "perfusion pressure."66 Accordingly, MAP is often used as treatment target for patients with CS and has been incorporated into the proposed treatment al- gorithm. The literature guiding specific MAP targets in a population with CS is limited and largely supported by observational data.67 Nonetheless, current guide- lines suggest a target MAP of ≥65 mm Hg.60,68
