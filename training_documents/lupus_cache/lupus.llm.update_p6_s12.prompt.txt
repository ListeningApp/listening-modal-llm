You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

320g | Procalcitonin (PCT) a protein consisting of 116 amino acids and the precursor of calcitonin, has a better diagnostic performance than CRP in differentiating bacterial infections from lupus flares. However, the diagnostic value of PCT and CRP in the identification of bacterial infection in SLE remains unsettled.67,68
tp8g | Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL)
gxfd | Mannose binding lectin (MBL) is a protein produced by the liver that activates the complement system by an associated protease, the MBL-associated serine protease. MBL polymorphisms have been associated with SLE development in multiple populations and high MBL levels are predictive of disease activity especially lupus nephritis.69
s2v1 | CD64
jkp9 | CD64 is a receptor observed on monocytes, macrophages and on neutrophils (nCD64). Peripheral nCD74 index combined with elevated CRP improves the ability to predict bacterial infections.70
z8tt | High Mobility Group Box Chromosomal Protein 1 (HMGB1)
9g22 | High mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear non-histone protein and a damage associated molecular pattern protein.71 Their levels are notably higher in SLE patients, especially those with renal involvement. However, their levels are elevated after onset of sepsis and septic shock.
41fx | 2'5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase (OAS)
7um8 | 2'5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) is an enzyme activated by Type I IFN which leads to the degradation of RNA and is important for the protection from vital infections.72 High OASL expression levels negatively correlate with the presence of certain infections and may provide useful information in differentiating disease lupus flare.
uow2 | Soluble Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells Type 1 (sTREM-1)
iat7 | The receptor TREM-1 expressed on the surface of mature neutrophils and monocytes in response to bacterial and fungal infections lead to a higher level of the soluble form (sTREM-1) in lupus patients with flares and in those with infections, compared to quiescent disease or the general population. 73
ywwr | CD27
0i6j | CD27 protein is a TNF receptor expressed on T- and B-lymphocytes where high expression of CD27 corresponds with high disease activity.74
87cq | Delta Neutrophil Index (DNI)
0qs3 | Delta neutrophil index (DNI) is a measure of immature granulocytes and is determined by subtracting the number of mature polymorphonuclear leucocytes from myeloperoxidase reactive cells. When compared to CRP, a high DNI correlates better with sepsis and aids in early diagnosis.7
z8f7 | Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Biomarkers
7w7j | Patients with neuropsychiatric lupus have elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and immu- noglobulin G (IgG) in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).75,76 However, in central nervous system (CNS) infections, there are elevated levels of IL-6 and PGE2 but not significantly elevated CSF or IgG.
51vd | Sepsis Scores in SLE
baj1 | The high mortality of SLE patients with sepsis in the intensive care units (ICU) used sepsis scores as good predictors of mortality. These include, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II).77
n1wo | Despite the discovery of new biomarkers to verify the infections in SLE, none of these biomarkers alone confirm or exclude an infection. A mixture of these tests may be more accurate in predicting the diagnosis and monitoring of infections in SLE patients.78
5bq3 | Nonetheless, these biomarkers require further reliability and validity studies in different SLE populations and long- term data in SLE patients with distinct types of infections. An optimal biomarker or combination of biomarkers of infections or lupus flares should be accurate and reproducible and should enhance the approach to early diagnosis, effective treatment, and improved clinical outcome.
ezla | Proposed Steps to Take When Challenged with Infection in SLE
rsbu | Assessment of SLE patients remains crucial when confronted by a major diagnostic challenge of having a presentation with a febrile illness. The need to control lupus disease activity that requires suppression of the immune system to avoid lupus related organ damage and death complicates the care of lupus patients. Yet, crucial, and appropriate evaluation of infectious etiology and prompt initiation of antibiotics will evade serious life-threatening complications.
magd | Proposed steps to adopt when challenged by an infection in SLE are outlined and depicted in Table 2.
tb74 | Fever in SLE is infectious until proven otherwise. While the prevalence of fever in SLE has declined over the past decades related to the intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids and broad-spectrum antibiotics, the source of fever must be identified. Thus, vigilance warrants efforts in identifying a latent or an opportunistic infection in febrile patients with SLE.
8l69 | Initial assessment should focus on risk indices based on age, multi-morbidities, use of glucocorticoids, cytotoxic immune suppressive and immune modulatory therapy. High-risk lupus patients require hospitalization. It is vital to deal with evolving sepsis and its complications in the setting of quantitative or qualitative neutropenia be it related to SLE or a complication of cytotoxic immunosuppressive therapy or immune modulatory treatment.
1jyv | Frameworks in the diagnostic work up of fever emphasize ongoing evaluations guided by cultures and clinical data including awareness of antimicrobial resistant infections. Applying the abovementioned clinical predictors of infection including CRP, procalcitonin and others is helpful. Molecular diagnostic assays may be useful if available including those combined with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography and computed tomography (FDG PET-CT) and next-generation sequencing. Nevertheless, the diagnostic yield of these tools in autoimmune disorders remains limited.79
olce | On the other hand, fever, in systemic autoimmune disorders like SLE is linked to adaptive immunity driven by interferon response during the lupus disease activity state and must be suspected when having negative infectious work-ups or
erx1 | microbiological control of infections.80 It is imperative to determine disease activity in febrile illnesses in SLE and avoid possible overdiagnosis of lupus disease flare.
b3bt | There are few examples of overdiagnosis of SLE and lupus flares, but it is important to approach those patients with the understanding of the risk of treatment with immune suppressive therapy and the risk of undertreatment.81
0w8m | The diagnosis of SLE and lupus flare should be based on diagnostic criteria that include patients with mild disease activity. SLE disease activity must be determined clinically employing clinical questionnaires including SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI), British Isles Lupus Assessment Group disease activity index (BILAG-2004), Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM), the Systemic Lupus Activity Index (SLAI), European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurements index (ECLAM) and the Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire (SLAQ) for Population Studies.82
vcu3 | Clinical features like the presence of scleritis, cytoid bodies on eye examination, lupus dermatitis, splinter hemor- rhages, cutaneous vasculitis or livedo pattern, friction rub of pericarditis and leg edema suggesting myocarditis, and pulmonary hypertension or renal disease of glomerulonephritis are clues to advocate for lupus disease activity.
