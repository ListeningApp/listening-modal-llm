        "content": "zl4v | Two. Sticks\noo6k | VCs can wield a number of sticks to compel the class of common shareholders to vote for the trade sale. However, these sticks cannot prevent a lawsuit and may in fact increase the likelihood of one.\n3uip | A. Cross-Voting\njgfv | To eliminate common shareholders' ability to block a trade sale, VCs can either partially convert their shares into common stock or exercise warrants to buy common stock so as to acquire a sufficient amount of common stock to achieve the necessary approval threshold. Consider the transactions in Orban versus Field, a Delaware case involving a common-shareholder lawsuit against a VC-controlled board. Office Mart, a Delaware corporation, arranged to be acquired by Staples in a merger that provided no payout to its common shareholders. The charter allowed preferred shareholders to vote alongside common shareholders on an as-converted basis (as if their stock had been\n1t64 | CARROTS AND STICKS\nx7jk | converted into common shares), and the preferred shareholders had enough votes to ensure shareholder approval of the transaction as required by corporate law. However, for accounting reasons, Staples insisted that at least ninety percent of Office Mart's common shares be voted in favor of the transaction. Common shareholders, led by Office Mart's founder and former CEO George Orban, refused to back the deal, demanding four million dollars in exchange for their votes.\n6s2g | Office Mart's board refused to provide a carve-out to common. Instead, the board arranged a series of transactions that, in essence, assisted the VCs in converting a portion of their preferred stock into common, thereby diluting the original common position down to less than ten percent of the class. The VCs, now holding over ninety percent of the common stock, voted their common stock in favor of the merger, which allowed the transaction to go forward and wiped out the original common shareholders. The maneuver cost the VCs nothing; although the partial conversion into common reduced the VCs' aggregate liquidation preferences, it still left them with enough liquidation preferences to absorb all of the merger consideration. Orban sued, arguing that Office Mart's board had violated its fiduciary duties to common shareholders. The Delaware Chancery ruled in favor of the board, concluding that the \"common stockholders had no legal right to a portion of the merger consideration under Delaware law or the corporate charter\" and noting that \"there is no claim\" that the challenged transaction \"was not in the best interests of the corporation.\"\njyav | B. Vote Buying\n4973 | VCs can also overcome common-shareholder opposition by buying the votes of shareholders, such as executives, who already own a large block of common stock. For instance, assume that three executives of a startup collectively hold fifty-five percent of the common stock and that a trade sale cannot occur without approval by fifty percent of the common shareholders. Rather than providing a carve-out to all common shareholders, the VCs could simply award each of these three individuals a lucrative cash bonus or other payment in connection with a trade sale in exchange (implicitly) for voting their common shares in favor of the transaction. Vote buying via payments to executives can thus kill two birds-executive opposition to the trade sale and\nh6w6 | CARROTS AND STICKS\nxvjy | common-shareholder opposition to the trade sale-with one stone.\n58i3 | Alternatively, a VC-controlled board can issue (additional) common shares to certain executives or employees who expect to gain from the board's proposed transaction and will thus vote their common shares in favor of the transaction. Although vote buying in some or all of these cases may violate the board's duty to refrain from improperly tampering with the shareholder vote, it is very difficult to prove that the purpose of a particular payment or equity issuance to executives or employees is to buy votes.\n04dp | C. Carrots versus Sticks\neagv | We have seen that VCs have at their disposal both carrots and sticks to induce entrepreneurial teams to cooperate in trade sales. Carrots tend to involve out-of-pocket costs. For example, carve-outs to common come solely at the VCs' expense. But many sticks, such as threats to terminate or blacklist a founder or other executives, do not involve any cash outlay.\nj05n | However, sticks can give rise to substantial indirect costs. First, although litigation is unlikely in any given case, the use of sticks may well increase the risk of litigation, which, should it occur, can be very costly in terms of VCs' time and reputation. Second, VCs may be deterred from \"misbehaving\"\nl2rf | CARROTS AND STICKS\nvow6 | because of reputational considerations. As websites like The Funded dot com make the world smaller and more transparent, and serial entrepreneurs play a more important role in startups, the reputational costs to VCs who bully entrepreneurial teams with sticks are likely to become higher. Thus, both carrots and sticks can be costly to VCs.\niapv | Four Research Sample\nxxed | A. Sample Population\nlww3 | We study the use of carrots and sticks in trade sales of VC-backed startups using a hand-collected data set of VC-backed Silicon Valley firms. This section describes the data-collection process and provides descriptive statistics for the firms in our sample.\ngc8l | One. Data Gathering\n90rr | The data used for this project were collected in two thousand five to two thousand seven as part of a study supported by the Kaufmann Foundation and the University of California, Berkeley. We obtained from Venture Reporter dot net a list of VC-financed companies located in California that were sold in trade sales in either two thousand three or two thousand four. We filtered out all firms except those located in and around San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland (broadly defined as \"Silicon Valley\"), leaving a population of one hundred ninety-three firms.\n6jxq | For each firm, we next sought to locate and obtain data from one or more persons knowledgeable about the firm's life-including the circumstances surrounding its sale. We identified the current business addresses for the founders and executives-all of whom we call \"entrepreneurs\" for convenience-of one hundred forty-one of the one hundred ninety-three companies. We mailed letters asking entrepreneurs from each firm to provide us with data, promising to keep confidential the identity of the entrepreneur and the startup firm.\n16su | Entrepreneurs from fifty-seven of the one hundred forty-one firms agreed to provide us with data-a response rate of forty point four percent. The information obtained, supplemented by publicly filed corporate charters, covered each firm's entire life span. Among the data gathered were the state of incorporation; cash-flow rights and control rights negotiated in each VC financing round; the identities and backgrounds of the CEO and directors; and the circumstances and terms of the sale,\noqyv | CARROTS AND STICKS\npex7 | including amounts paid to management and various classes of shareholders.\n2veg | From the original set of fifty-seven firms, we removed seven for lack of adequate data, leaving us with fifty firms. In most of these sales (forty-two out of fifty), the VCs exited as preferred shareholders. In the remaining eight firms, the VCs converted into common stock in connection with the sale, giving up their liquidation preferences.\n8k0y | Two. Selection Issues\npjdm | Because our sample is limited to Silicon Valley firms sold in two thousand three or two thousand four, one must be somewhat cautious about extrapolating from our firms to VC-backed firms generally. Silicon Valley is a close-knit community with its own norms and ways of doing business. Our sample firms were sold several years after the tech bubble collapsed, a period in which VCs lost considerable amounts of money. These losses may have heightened the conflicts between VCs and entrepreneurial teams around exit events. The use of carrots and sticks within our sample firms could thus be a function of the post-bubble time period and factors unique to Silicon Valley, limiting the generalizability of our results.\n32av | B. Sample Description\n985o | Our sample firms are \"high-tech\" businesses, primarily in the biotech, software, telecommunications, and internet sectors (Panel A of Table one). The concentration of IT-related businesses is representative of VC-financed firms generally. At the time of sale, the firms had received an average of forty-two million dollars in VC funding and had been operating for an average of\n2raw | CARROTS AND STICKS",
