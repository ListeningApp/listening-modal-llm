This article shows how Haier developed a platform of management practices called Rendanheyi to transform itself from a conventional hierarchical manufacturing firm to a highly responsive online-based entrepreneurial company. It demonstrates how the organizational, competitive, institutional, and technological contexts mattered for the development of Rendanheyi, showing how context-dependent management innovations are created to allow emerging market firms such as Haier to deal with a high VUCA world and creating an extended process model of management innovation that managers can readily apply.\njie2 | Emerging market companies face a challenging environment characterized by increased volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. Volatility comes from, among other things, varying growth rates and currency fluctuations, making the business environment unstable and unpredictable. Fluid market conditions, the impact of new technologies on organizational structures, and the unresolved future of international trade rules, create uncertainty. Foreign investments, including in developed countries, imply more complex environments. And there is significant ambiguity,\nd0ik | for instance, around the effects of maintaining existing homegrown management practices, such as relationship-based management in Asia, versus adopting western theories and management practices. But some companies such as China's Haier Group, the world's largest white goods company, have taken on this challenging environment by reinventing themselves and developing a management model that thrives in such a high-velocity environment.\n0x0s | In this article, we show how companies such as Haier create management innovations in a high VUCA context. Management innovation involves the creation of new management practices. Under the leadership of Zhang Ruimin, the Haier Group developed \"Rendanheyi,\" which can be loosely translated as \"integration of people and goals\" or \"the win-win model of individual-goal combination.\" Rendanheyi is a platform made up of a bundle of management practices, rather than a single new practice. Other such platforms have, of course, evolved historically. For example, Toyota's lean manufacturing has an overall goal-to produce on a large scale with minimum effort and waste- and encompasses several specific practices including just-in-time, Kanban, and target costing. Similarly, Rendanheyi is intended to be an integrated and all-encompassing management model with the overall goal to create \"zero distance to the user\" and unleash entrepreneurial autonomy within the organization. Specific elements of the Rendanheyi platform include autonomous micro-enterprises, performance-based compensation, and open online user platforms.\n4exe | From the introduction of Rendanheyi in two thousand five, Haier was transformed from a conventional hierarchical appliance manufacturer into a highly responsive, diversified online-based entrepreneurial conglomerate organized as entirely autonomous micro-enterprises. During two thousand five to two thousand nine, Haier operated newly established strategic business units and implemented new information technology solutions and performance-based measures to better connect the company to customers. In two thousand ten, micro-divisions called ZZJYT (an abbreviation for \"zi zhu jing ying ti,\" translated as \"independent operating unit\") were established. ZZJYTs operated like a virtual team, and each ZZJYT leader had considerable decision-making autonomy-and new performance-based measures were introduced. In two thousand fourteen, Haier was eventually transformed into a conglomerate of independent micro-enterprises called \"xiaowei qiye\" (abbreviated as \"xiaowei\"), operating as independent companies with ownership stakes from outsiders and responsible for all contracting, budgeting, and recruitment decisions. This latest phase has been labelled \"Rendanheyi two point zero.\"\n0myz | The case of Rendanheyi is important for management innovators, as it demonstrates how a high VUCA context in an emerging market can shape novel management practices. In the literature, there has been renewed interest in management innovations in recent years, but few studies have explored their initial creation process. In this article, we tackle a major shortcoming of the existing literature, which revolves around the Birkinshaw et al. model of \"management innovating\" that largely neglects the role of context. The organizational, competitive, institutional, and technological contexts mattered a lot in the Haier case.\nxh3i | Management Innovation Made in China: Haier's Rendanheyi\nsyiw | The State of Knowledge on Management Innovation\nkg3t | Firms have long recognized the importance of technological innovations in products and processes, but increasingly they also value the competitive edge from innovation in how the firm is managed. Historical examples of such \"management innovations\" include advances in structure such as the (divisional) M-form at GM, but also tools and techniques such as the balanced scorecard and scenario planning. Most academic writing is focused on the ways in which existing management practices spread across a population of organizations and from one industry or country to the next. While these are interesting questions, they do not help to understand the process of developing a novel management innovation such as Rendanheyi.\nlvae | Still, some work looks at what drives organizations first to invent and then to implement new management practices, that is, management innovating. A major advance in understanding management innovating came from the Birkinshaw et al. process model, which offers a template to understand how management practices are created and implemented. This model focuses on understanding the active role of individuals, who are called internal and external change agents, in different phases of management innovating.\no9sc | Internal change agents are, of course, crucial in understanding why and how a specific management innovation comes about. Indeed, all management innovations can be linked to a powerful protagonist. For example, the founder of Toyota Motor Corporation Kiichiro Toyoda and production engineer Taiichi Ohno played key roles in the development of lean manufacturing at Toyota. Much more recently, the chairman of the Samsung Group Kun-Hee Lee was crucially involved in developing the co-opetition model within Samsung. In addition, external change agents such as gurus and management consultants can be involved in management innovating.\n121u | The Birkinshaw et al. process model proposes that there are four distinct phases in management innovating. The first of these comes about when change agents are motivated to consider creating a management innovation because of some dissatisfaction with the status quo. The second stage, invention, occurs when a thought or real experiment is started to create a new hypothetical management practice. In the third stage, implementation, this hypothetical practice is put into practice to establish its value. Finally, in the fourth stage, theorization and labeling, there is retrospective sensemaking whereby an innovation can receive legitimacy. Thus, we understand relatively well what actions agents undertake to create management innovations.\nzh03 | A shortcoming of this model and the bulk of management innovation literature is that it mostly black boxes the role of context, even though context clearly matters for the development of management innovations. For example, the development of lean manufacturing at Toyota benefited from the context of Japan with its different cultural understanding of time as a simultaneous rather than sequential process, as well as its traditionally close collaborative arrangements between\n1mvw | manufacturing firms and suppliers within zaibatsu/keiretsu, along with postwar material shortages. And the development of the co-opetition model was supported by Samsung's common language, organizational culture, and management systems, which fostered close collaboration across the Samsung Group and, thus, helped toward seizing new business opportunities and reducing transaction costs.",
