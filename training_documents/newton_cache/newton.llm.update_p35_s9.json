We note that T sub S O I has a logarithmic dependence on the inexactness tolerance,\npehk | eta. On the other hand if psi sub negative is greater than or equal to one and Assumption D point one dash three holds, we appeal to Liu and Roosta to bound the iterations required to obtain a NPC direction as\nh7hi | T sub N P C equals the minimum of the maximum of the ceiling of the fraction of the square root of two times the sum of L sub g and mu over mu divided by four times the logarithm of the fraction of two times the sum of L sub g and mu times one minus nu over mu nu plus one and one and g. When nu equals one, it is clear from the statement of Assumption D point one dash three that all g-relevant eigenvalues are negative, which implies that negative curvature is detected at the very first iteration, i.e., T sub N P C equals one. If we adopt the convention that T sub N P C equals infinity when psi sub negative equals zero or Assumption D point one dash three is unsatisfied we bound the number of MINRES iterations as T equals the minimum of T sub N P C and T sub S O L. If g belongs to N u l l of H then g is declared a zero curvature direction at the very first iteration. We now prove the operational complexity results.\nz8wk | Corollary D point two (First Order Operational Complexity Algorithm one). Under the conditions of Theorem 3 point three and Assumption D point one, the total number of gradient evaluations and Hessian vector products in Algorithm one to obtain an epsilon sub g dash F O point is big O of epsilon sub g to the negative two, for d sufficiently large.\n3fxr | Proof. Due to Theorem 3 point three, the total number of outer iterations is big O of epsilon sub g to the negative two. To obtain the operational result we simply need to count the total number of gradient evaluations and Hessian vector products per iteration. The work required for each step of Algorithm one is equivalent to the number of MINRES iterations (i.e. Hessian vector product) plus a single gradient evaluation. In the case of Algorithm one the termination tolerance eta has no dependence on epsilon sub g. Considering the discussion above, for sufficiently large d, we bound the number of Hessian vector products as big O of one. The conclusion follows from the fact that\n1rwa | big O of epsilon sub g to the negative two times one plus big O of one belongs to big O of epsilon sub g to the negative two. Corollary D point three (First Order Operational Complexity Algorithm two). Under the conditions of Theorem 3 point eight and Assumption D point one, the total number of gradient evaluations and Hessian vector products in Algorithm two to obtain an epsilon sub g dash F O point is log O of epsilon sub g to the negative three halves, for d sufficiently large.\n40h8 | Proof. The result is similar to Corollary D point two. We utilise Theorem 3 point eight to bound the total number of outer iterations as big O of epsilon sub g to the negative three halves. For Algorithm two, the MINRES termination tolerance is eta equals theta square root of epsilon sub g, so we bound the total number of Hessian vector products as log O of one for d large. The conclusion follows.\n9w49 | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimization with Nonnegativity Constraints\nkgl8 | E. Local Convergence\nkq4g | In this section we provide the detailed proof for Theorem 3 point thirteen. Our proof follows a similar line of reasoning as that in Bertsekas but with several modifications and alterations specific to our setting and methodology. We assume in this section that I of x sub star comma zero does not equal the empty set as otherwise the analysis boils down to convergence of projected gradient to a trivial solution x sub star equals zero. Our main aim is to show that after a finite number of iterations, the iterates eventually end up in the following subspace\nqjp8 | X sub star equals the set of x in R to the d such that x to the i equals zero, i in A of x sub star comma zero. We start with a lemma to show that, by choosing our inexactness tolerance delta sub k equals delta, with",
