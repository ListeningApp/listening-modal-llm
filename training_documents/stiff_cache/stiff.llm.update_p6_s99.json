It has been found that the stress dependency of Quiou sand is larger than that of Toyoura and Ticino sands. In particular, the friction angle of Quiou sand decreases rapidly with an increase in the confining pressure. This is because the crushability of Quiou sand is higher than that of other sands. Therefore, the n-value of Quiou sand decreased for\ncp13 | Eight percent. Consolidation Stress Ratio\nbgre | The secant modulus decrease with an increase in the strain level is more pronounced in K zero consolidated K zero C specimens than in isotropic consolidated IC specimens, as mentioned before.\n57lp | It has been shown that the secant Young's modulus was significantly dependent on overconsolidation history. Fig. Eleven shows the variations of normalized secant Young's modulus Esec normalized with respect to OCR, as examined using a single logarithmic scale at several strain levels for IC Toyoura, Quiou, and Ticino sand specimens. From this figure, it has been found that the effects of overconsolidation history on the secant Young's modulus for Quiou sand are larger than those for Toyoura and Ticino sands.\nukth | Figs. Twelve (a-c) show the typical relations of the secant modulus normalized by void ratio function and confining pressure versus log to better clarify the effect of the overconsolidation on the secant modulus for the three IC and K zero C sand specimens, respectively. In these figures, the normalized secant\nkpvt | modulus for isotropic and K zero normally consolidated specimens were indicated by the Sy-value or a X Sy-value in Three and Four, respectively. Fig. Thirteen shows the variation of the K zero-value after consolidation, due to the difference in the overconsolidation ratio.\njie2 | It can be seen that the strain level at which the reduction of Esec in OC specimens occurs is larger than that in NC specimens. It can be also seen that the sudden reduction of Esec in OC specimens that occurs for percentage strain is larger than about zero point zero five percent for all sands. In addition, it is found that the reduction tendency of Esec is relatively similar for isotropic and K zero OC specimens for the same OCR. This is because (one) the yield locus (the linear threshold strain) expanded because of the overconsolidation history; and (two) the K zero-value of the OC specimen increases with an increase in the overconsolidation ratio, as shown in Fig. Thirteen.\nd0ik | K zero OCR equals two. \n0x0s | Fig. Fourteen shows the relationships of the secant modulus ratios Esec OC over Esec NC versus log strain for isotropic and K zero consolidated Toyoura OCR equals Three, Quiou OCR equals Three, and Ticino OCR equals Two, Four sand specimens. It has been found that the effects of the overconsolidation history for Toyoura sand are negligibly small at small strain levels. The effects of the OC history on the secant modulus are greatest around zero point zero five to zero point one percent. The effects of the OC history are similar on Toyoura and Ticino sands. On the other hand, the effects of OC history on Quiou sand are much larger than for other sands. This can be seen because the soil particle crush of Quiou sand had significantly progressed because of the OC history and shearing.\n4exe | It has also been found that the effects of OC history on K zero C specimens are larger than those on IC specimens. This is because (one) the secant Young's modulus of K zero specimens is smaller than that of the IC specimen, except that at small strain levels under the same vertical consolidation stress, as shown in Fig. Twelve, and (two) the K zero-value increases with an increase in OCR, as shown in Fig. Thirteen. Consequently, the effects of OC history on the secant Young's modulus of the K zero C specimen were larger than those of the IC specimens.\n0myz | CONCLUSIONS\nxh3i | This paper presents the analysis of a large number of drained triaxial compression tests, many of which were carried out with local strain measurement. The tests were performed on both isotropically and anisotropically consolidated specimens of three sands prepared by pluvial deposition in air and allow the following conclusions, all of which refer to the value of sand moduli at\nsyiw | sigma w prime equals One hundred kPa: One. For all three sands, the secant Young's modulus normalized with respect to the consolidation void ratio exhibits very pronounced degradation with increasing strain.\nkg3t | Two. Nonlinearity starts to show when the axial strain exceeds approximately one times ten to the negative three and five times ten to the negative two percent for NC and OC with OCR equals three specimens, respectively.\nlvae | Three. Below such a strain level, which corresponds to the linear threshold strain, the secant Young's modulus coincides with the initial tangent stiffness E zero, which depends only on the magnitude of sigma v prime being independent of\no9sc | sigma b prime. Four. For silica Ticino and Toyoura sands, the Ec results were found to be independent of OCR, while in carbonatic Quiou sands it moderately influences the magnitude of the initial stiffness.\n121u | Five. Beyond the linear threshold strain, the reduction of Esec for normally consolidated specimens can be matched by the empirical fitting formulae.\n```",
