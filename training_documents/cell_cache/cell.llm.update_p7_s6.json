About a half of the factors are expressed maternally while the other half appear in early embryos. Among Pou five f one, Sox two, and Nanog, whose homologs constitute the maternal foundation of ZGA in zebrafish, only Pou five f one is expressed maternally, whereas Sox two is transiently expressed at the two-cell stage and then again in blastocysts. Klf four is one of the few pluripotency factors strongly expressed during major ZGA in mice. Nanog is first expressed in two-cell embryos and its transcripts accumulate until the blastocyst stage. Taken together, the mouse model suggests that a fraction of the core pluripotency factors is provided maternally to initiate a reprogramming transcription factor cascade that forms the core pluripotency network controlling the pluripotent state of inner mass cells.\nk16v | However, when performing a similar expression analysis in bovine or human embryos, striking differences in terms of temporal/stage expression of pluripotency factors emerge. This high variability implies that the core pluripotency network during early mammalian development could be established in multiple ways. Also, this evolving variability in maternal and zygotic appearance of pluripotency factors could contribute to reproductive barriers emerging during speciation. One could envision that maternally provided pluripotency transcription factors initiating the core pluripotency network formation (and genome activation in general) in a defined sequence would fail to activate the genome in another species. Such a post-zygotic reproductive barrier would be a more cost-effective solution than hybrid sterility. In any case, the mammalian core pluripotency circuitry appears linked to ancestral vertebrate ZGA, but in mammals it evolved into a pluripotency program in inner cell mass cells upon their separation from extraembryonic lineages.\nb2lm | If the core pluripotency circuitry makes a minor contribution to mammalian zygotic transcription programs, can other contributory factors be defined? An important insight into the murine zygotic transcription programs comes from detailed analysis of ESCs. As mentioned above, a small fraction (approximately one percent) of ESCs express an LTR retrotransposon mouse endogenous retrovirus type L (MuERV-L). MuERV retrotransposons are transiently expressed during ZGA where they comprise a significant fraction of mRNAs. This minor ESC population expressing MuERV-L sequences has unique characteristics in terms of gene expression and totipotency which is normally found in blastomeres of the two-cell zygote. This finding suggests that the pluripotent potential of ESCs does not only stochastically fluctuate \"forward\" towards differentiation, but also \"back\" towards a totipotent state and that \"totipotency\" indeed might exist as an expression program driven by a defined set of transcription factors.\nti7f | Whether MuERV-L is an active player in this fluctuation and whether it is a unique feature of the mouse model is an open question. MuERV-L engagement in transcription in two-cell zygotes appears primarily a consequence of MuERV-L survival strategy. Retrotransposon expansion in the genome requires retrotransposition to occur during the germline cycle. Consequently, retrotransposons sequences adapt such that they would be recognized and transcriptionally activated during the germline cycle. Accordingly, MuERV-L LTRs evolved to recruit transcription factors initiating gene expression in zygotes. Consequently, as MuERV-L had been spreading through the mouse genome, it would be distributing zygotic genome activation platforms that could be recruited for novel functions during ZGA. In fact, many LTRs of the ERVL retrotransposon family to contributed to the separation of maternal and zygotic programs in mammals. Studies of transcriptional control reveal factors/mechanisms contributing to murine ZGA. One of the remarkable MuERV-L regulators is a double homeobox gene Dux four, which has been recently implicated in ZGA. Dux four becomes transiently expressed during minor ZGA and, as an intron-less gene localized in a tandemly duplicated locus, is the primary candidate for a transcription factor involved in ZGA. Dux four also fits into the model that the earliest transcribed genes are short and newly evolved.\noksu | Nine. Conclusions\nwtow | Mammalian OET is characterized by relatively long transition between the maternal and zygotic gene expression which involves only a small number of cleavages a zygote. This likely reflects the need to produce a totipotent early embryo, which undergoes separation of extraembryonic and embryonic lineages. There is a variable timing of the major ZGA; the early onset in mice seems to be a derived character while blastomeres of other mammals undergo several cleavages before the major ZGA. Advances in high throughput methods have been providing a comprehensive picture of gene expression and, lately, also chromatin dynamics during OET. However, there is a number of issues that still need to be addressed. Of a particular interest are determination of variable and constitutive parts of genome reprogramming and identification of the set of maternally provided transcription factors, which would be sufficient to drive OET. Also of interest are mechanisms assuring that transcription factors driving the maternal and zygotic transcription do not interfere as well as events that lead to the early genome activation during evolution of mice. Improved understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying OET will translate into more efficient manipulation of a cell-fate, which is of fundamental importance for biotechnology and medicine.\n```",
