You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

xqvs | 13. Observation shows that people's desires for attention ebb and flow. When in an ebb or flow of attention-desire, the human being not realising that this is his condition, attributes his actions and feelings to other factors, e.g., the hostility or pleasantness of others. He may even say that it is a 'lucky day', when his attention- needs have been quickly and adequately met. Re-examination of such situations has shown that such experiences are best accounted for by the attention-theory.
z0yn | 14. Objections based upon the supposed pleasure of attention being strongest when it is randomly achieved do not stand up when carefully examined. 'I prefer to be surprised by attention' can be paraphrased by saying, 'I prefer not to know where my next meal is coming from'. It simply underlines a primitive stage of feeling and thinking on this subject.
bula | 15. Situations which seem different when viewed from an over- simplified perspective (which is the usual one) are seen to be the same by the application of attention-theory. E.g .: People follow- ing an authority-figure may be exercising the desire for attention or the desire to give it. The interchange between people and their authority-figure may be explained by mutual-attention behaviour. Some gain only attention from this interchange. Some can gain more.
pevq | 16. Another confusion is caused by the fact that the object of attention may be a person, a cult, an object, an idea, interest, etc. Because the foci of attention can be so diverse, people in general have not yet identified the common factor-the desire for atten- tion.
39p6 | 17. One of the advantages of this theory is that it allows the human mind to link in a coherent and easily-understood way many things which it has always (wrongly) been taught are very
9snt | 87
9hma | different, not susceptible to comparison, etc. This incorrect train- ing has, of course, impaired the possible efficiency in functioning of the brain, though only culturally, not permanently.
6rf4 | 18. The inability to feel when attention is extended, and also to encourage or to prevent its being called forth, makes man almost uniquely vulnerable to being influenced, especially in having ideas implanted in his brain, and being indoctrinated.
r9je | 19. Raising the emotional pitch is the most primitive method of increasing attention towards the instrument which increased the emotion. It is the prelude to, or accompaniment of, almost every form of indoctrination.
8u2l | 20. Traditional philosophical and other teachings have been used to prescribe exercises in the control and focussing of atten- tion. Their value, however, has been to a great measure lost because the individual exercises, prescribed for people in need of exercise, have been written down and repeated as unique truths and practised in a manner, with people and at a rate and under circumstances which, by their very randomness, have not been able to effect any change in the attention-training. This treatment has, however, produced obsession. It continues to do so.
j9td | 21. Here and there proverbs and other pieces of literary material indicate that there has been at one time a widespread knowledge of attention on the lines now being described. Deprived, however, of context, these indications survive as fossil indicators rather than being a useful guide to attention-exercise for contemporary man.
y0so | Attention upon oneself, or upon a teacher, without the exercise of securing what is being offered from beyond the immediate surroundings, is a sort of short-circuit. As Rumi said: 'Do not look at me, but take what is in my hand'.
rf23 | Sufi Study Themes
xbc4 | Sufi Study Themes
61e1 | Q: If you were to give a number of study themes to the people present, which ones would you stress?
isto | A:
ma2o | 1. All approaches to a study or an individual may start with a desire for attention. However they start, they must never end up in this manner.
lx6n | 2. Study the assumptions behind your actions. Then study the iptions behind your assumptions.
5ii9 | 3. "Why did I do such-and-such a thing?' is all very well. But what about 'How otherwise could I have done it?'
6quh | 4. You have come a long way, and you do not know it. You have a long way to go, and you do know what that means.
1tm9 | 5. In respect to some, you may have advanced. In relation to others, you have not progressed at all. Neither observation is more important than the other.
a60a | 6. If your desire for 'good' is based on greed, it is not good, but
e663 | 7. Exercise power by means of kindness, and you may be causing more damage than you could by cruelty. Neither approach correct.
8n48 | 8. The man who knows must discharge a function. The one ho does not, cannot arrogate one to himself; he can only try to do
wo91 | 9- Do not try to be humble: learn humility.
j381 | 10. Assume that you are part-hypocrite and part heedless, and ou will not be far wrong.
hzpg | 11. To copy a virtue in another is more copying than it is virtue. Try to learn what that virtue is based upon.
e8sm | 12. No practice exists in isolation.
y6h8 | 13. If you seek a teacher, try to become a real student. If you ant to be a student, try to find a real teacher.
o8w8 | 14. The more often you do a thing, the more likely you are to
rz1d | do it again. There is no certainty that you wiH gain anything else from repetition than a likelihood of further repetition.
61fx | 15. At first, you are not worthy of the robes and implements of the Sufi. Later you do not need them. Finally, you may need them for the sake of others.
1ccq | 16. If you cannot laugh frequently and genuinely, you have no soul.
njzq | 17. When a belief becomes more than an instrument, you are lost. You remain lost until you learn what "belief is really for.
jeol | 18. When a dervish shows interest in your material welfare, you may be pleased. But it is frequently because you are not yet ready for anything else.
fnu9 | 19. When someone asks for you to help in doing something, do you imagine that it is because he cannot do it unaided? Perhaps he is a Sufi who wants to help you by connecting you with his task.
yejl | 20. If you are lazy, count yourself lucky if someone points this out, giving you a chance to improve. Laziness is always your fault. It is the sign that a man has persevered in uselessness for too long.
w8yf | These points are in fact exercises in outwitting the false self, which thrives on smaller satisfactions. The Sufi aims at Tana (passing away-of the False Self) and Baga (remaining - of the Real). Behind the supposed 'I', which is impermanent, lies the real one, which is characterised by the awareness of truth, of reality.
zp0b | And listen to the words of Junaid of Baghdad, when he said: 'A good-natured sensualist is better than a bad-tempered so-called Sufi.'
m8wl | Things of the World
jp31 | An Eastern Sage and the Newspapers
juzd | LETTER TO A SAGE
xc9y | A WESTERN student of the spiritual wrote a fierce and reproving letter to a certain Eastern sage, when he saw his name in a news- paper. "You should be completely unconcerned with the things of this world!' he said - and much else.
3v42 | When I visited the sage, I asked him what he had thought of the letter, as I wanted to report his reaction to the writer of it
t3yi | 'I do get letters, it is true,' he murmured, 'but I am afraid I do not read them, because, you see, they are things of this world, and I am not concerned with them.'
fy5f | 'Things of this world' include, according to the Sufis, anything other than Truth.
