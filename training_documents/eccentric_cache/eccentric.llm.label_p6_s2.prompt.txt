o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

u6ty | Another possible cause for the very high overstrengths observed in some tests is the excessive cyclic hardening of steel due to very large plastic strains. This idea was introduced recently by Ji et al. [14] on the basis of an experiment conducted by Kasai et al. [44] on stocky short steel panels in which hardening continued to very large shear angles. Based on this observation, Ji et al. [14] proposed that the very high overstrengths reported for very short links are related to their high rotation capacities. These links experience large plastic rotations (substantially higher than 0.08 rad) and consequently their webs are subjected to excessive shear strains which may lead to excessive cyclic hardening. A refined FE analysis by Ji et al. [14] on very short links revealed that for a link plastic rotation of the order of 0.15 rad the cyclic hardening effect can increase the shear strength by about 70%.
awvu | The combined effect of the above-mentioned factors should be considered for each link in order to have a reasonable estimate of its overstrength. Nonetheless, reasons behind some of the unusually high overstrengths reported in the literature still remain unclear. For instance, Dusicka et al. [36] observed overstrengths of about 5.0 in their experiments on very short links constructed from low-yield-strength steel (Fy = 100 MPa) without web stiffeners. Such cases require further investigation.
on9b | Based on the numerical and experimental works of Berman and Bruneau [45-49] the use of built- up box (or tubular) links is also permitted by AISC 341-10 [3]. A comparison between the test results reported by Berman and Bruneau [49] with the numerical data presented by Richards [40] revealed that the overstrength factor of built-up box links is typically higher than that of I-shaped links, by about 11%. It is worth noting that the use of hollow structural sections (HSS) as links is prohibited by AISC 341-10 [3] due to their questionable performance in terms of low cycle fatigue life under large
a8ge | strains [50]. In addition, as explained in Berman and Bruneau [47], the longest shear link that can be constructed from a common HSS is about 460 mm, which is rather short and will cause congested details as well as very high rotation demands at the code-specified drift level.
h27a | 2.2. Link Rotation Demand and Capacity
pdjh | The expected plastic mechanisms of EBF systems are depicted in Figure 1. The angle between the link and the beam outside of the link is termed as the total link rotation angle (y) and its inelastic part as the inelastic (or plastic) link rotation angle (Yp). In general, the inelastic rotation capacity of a link, ymax, is defined as the maximum inelastic rotation angle (i.e. excluding the elastic portion which is usually less than 0.01 rad) sustained by the link during a cyclic test, for at least one full cycle of loading, before the shear resisted by the link drops below a predefined limit. This limit can be quantified as 80% of the maximum link shear recorded during the cyclic test (0.8 Vmax), the plastic shear capacity (Vp), or the code-specified nominal shear strength of the link (Vn) [14, 30, 41, 51]. Figure 5 shows an example of using the first definition for determining the inelastic rotation capacity (ypax) of a specimen tested by Okazaki et al. [29].
xmgs | Experimental studies have shown that the rotation capacity of links depends significantly upon several factors such as the link length ratio, loading history, compactness and web stiffening. A summary of findings from the experimental studies on horizontal I-shaped links [6, 11, 14, 15, 18-39] is given in Figure 6. The figure includes links with Fy > 200 MPa subjected to various cyclic loading histories. It should be mentioned that a few monotonic tests were also conducted on links [15, 18, 27, 28, 37, 52] which demonstrated rotation capacities between 0.19 ~ 0.42 rad. Short links exhibit higher rotation capacities compared to intermediate and long links. As shown in Figure 6, AISC 341-10 [3] limits the inelastic rotation of short links to 0.08 rad and long links to 0.02 rad. For intermediate links, linear interpolation is utilized. The following issues should be borne in mind when examining the data shown in Figure 6. In a number of tests in which connection yielding or failure was reported (grey triangles in the figure), specifically those located in the range of 1 < p < 2, high rotation capacities in excess of 0.10 rad were observed. It should be noted that in most of these tests the connection inelastic
bd9h | rotation also contributed to the total link rotation, and thus, the reported high ymax values are not solely because of the inelastic action of the link. The results denoted by hollow circles indicate tests conducted by Galvez [25] and Ryu [28] and reported by Okazaki and Engelhardt [31], in which the observed rotation capacities fall significantly below the code-specified limit due to the use of a severe loading protocol. On the other hand, most of the ymax values reported for very short links (i.e. p < 1) exceed the AISC limit by a wide margin. These results (particularly the ones reported in [14, 36]) revealed that the rotation capacity of very short links can be substantially higher than that of short links. Note that some of the tested very short links (shown by hollow diamonds) failed prematurely due to the brittle fracture of the link web, which was initiated as a result of the insufficient offset between the stiffener-to-web and the web-to-flange welds, as explained by McDaniel et al. [24]. Considering only the proper test data (grey diamonds in Figure 6), it can be deduced that the current AISC requirements provide a reasonable lower-bound for the inelastic rotation capacity of links with various length ratios.
m047 | It is difficult to predict the rotation capacity of all links by means of pure numerical simulation. For the case of long and some intermediate links, in which strength degradation is due to local buckling, ymax can be estimated reasonably via nonlinear FE analysis. However, it is troublesome to estimate the rotation capacity of shorter links since strength degradation is generally due to low-cycle fatigue induced fractures, which are not commonly considered in FE simulations. Nonetheless, results of the numerical simulations [13, 51, 53-55] concurred with experimental observations that the inelastic rotation capacity of short links is considerably higher than that of intermediate and long links.
gy8c | The inelastic link rotation demand must be estimated at the design stage. The most accurate way of determining this quantity is through inelastic dynamic analysis. Alternatively, a rigid plastic mechanism can be used to estimate the inelastic link rotation angle. In this method the inelastic link rotation angle, Yp, is related to the plastic story drift, Ap, via geometrical relationships [3]. Extensive nonlinear time-history analyses conducted by Koboevic et al. [56, 57] on low-, mid-, and high-rise EBFs further confirmed the appropriateness of assuming such a relationship. However, it was noted by Koboevic et al. [56, 57] and other recent studies [58-60] that determining Ap based on the results of an
y4mj | elastic analysis using the codified displacement amplification factors (Ca) or the equal-displacement rule may provide unconservative estimates of Yp. This item is further discussed in Section 5.2.
vpgq | 2.3. Effect of Axial Force
ousl | Links can be subjected to axial loads due to the axial restraining effect of adjacent members (which was discussed in Section 2.1) and also the loading scheme and/or geometry of a structural system. For instance, in case of a seismic loading, the EBF configuration shown in Figure 1b will impose higher axial forces on link segments compared to the negligible link axial forces developed in the configuration shown in Figure 1a. A study by Kasai and Popov [10] revealed that the presence of axial force can have deteriorative effects on link behavior. These researchers proposed modified expressions for the plastic moment and shear capacities of links in the presence of axial force. In addition, a modified shear link length limit was defined. The modified capacities are in general related to the axial load ratio, defined by P/Py, where P is the available axial force and Py is the nominal axial yield strength. This study revealed that the plastic capacities should be reduced as a function of P/Py when this ratio exceeds 0.15. These recommendations still form the basis of the AISC 341-10 [3] provisions for links under axial loads.
m4ju | In 1990, Ghobarah and Ramadan [61] used nonlinear FE analysis to investigate the effect of axial force on the performance of EBF links. Numerical results demonstrated that the presence of axial force not only reduces the link plastic strength but also its plastic rotation capacity and energy dissipation. A maximum decrease of 37% in ymax was reported. It was also noted that the effect of axial force is most pronounced in links with length ratios near 1.6.
a0mb | In a study by Mansour et al. [41] in 2011, the behavior of replaceable shear links was investigated inside a frame system. In these tests the cyclic loading was applied to the floor beam from one end, and thus, half of the applied load was transferred axially through the link. The maximum value of P/Py was reported to be 0.26 which represented a relatively high axial force level. Mansour et al. [41] observed that the links experienced higher peak shear forces when subjected to tension rather than compression, with a maximum difference of 12%. Mansour [34] also demonstrated this issue
ki8m | numerically in his dissertation and proposed a simple equation for estimating the increase in the shear capacity due to axial tension.
km8w | In 2014, Dastmalchi [62] conducted nonlinear time-history analyses on a three-story prototype structure with eccentric braces, similar to the configuration shown in Figure 1b. Results revealed that the peak value of P/Py recorded for the links exceeded 0.15 by a wide margin under most earthquake records, indicating the high probability of developing large axial forces in shear links with the selected configuration. Dastmalchi [62] also performed nonlinear FE analyses to examine the behavior of shear links under very high levels of axial force (0.15 < P/Py < 0.5). The monotonic and cyclic shearing of short links under constant axial compression confirmed its detrimental effect on the shear strength and ductility of short links, especially when the length of the shear link was increased. It was also found that the shear capacity formula given in AISC 341-10 [3] underestimates this effect for P/Py > 0.2, and therefore, a numerically calibrated modification factor was introduced for this formula.
wzno | It is worth noting that, as stated in the AISC 341-10 [3] commentary, the effect of high axial force on the behavior of long and intermediate links has not been investigated adequately. Therefore, the code [3] requires the use of shear links if high axial force is present in a link.
xagm | 2.4. Effect of Concrete Slab
iwn5 | In 1989, Ricles and Popov [63] conducted research on the effect of a concrete slab, placed over the steel framing as a floor system, on EBF links. These researchers reported that the initial stiffness and strength of the composite links were higher than those of the steel links, however, the composite action deteriorated in later cycles. The maximum shear forces resisted by the composite links were 1 to 13% higher than the corresponding steel links. Nevertheless, the general hysteretic behavior of the composite links resembled that of the bare steel links. The slab damage was localized in the vicinity of the link and no damage was observed in the concrete located away from the link segment. The test results also demonstrated that a concrete slab alone cannot provide sufficient lateral bracing for links. Engelhardt and Popov [11, 64] noted in their experimental study that if a diagonal brace is connected to the bottom flange of a link, the presence of a concrete slab can substantially enhance the stability of
uooz | the link by restraining the top flange. A similar observation was also reported by Tsai et al. [65] during the tests on large EBF sub-assemblages conducted at the National Taiwan University in the early 1990s.
pxbq | Mansour et al. [41] also investigated the effect of a concrete slab on link behavior. In the details studied, the replaceable link segment had a smaller depth than the floor beam. Therefore, there was no direct interaction between the link and the composite slab. Nevertheless, it was reported that the specimen with the concrete slab sustained a higher shear force, 14% more when compared to the bare steel specimen, without a notable change in the link rotation capacity. Mansour et al. [41] recommended using more shear studs away from the link region in order to guarantee the slab diaphragm action during major earthquakes.
jfsr | Recently, Ciutina et al. [37] tested a single-story EBF setup with very short links with and without a concrete slab. In one case the shear studs were placed along the entire beam length, while in the other case they were suppressed in the link region. Tests by Ciutina et al. [37] confirmed that omitting shear studs only in the link region does not fully eliminate the composite action, since in both of the above cases the shear strength and stiffness were notably higher than those of the steel link. Therefore, it was recommended that the composite action be considered during the EBF design, even if shear studs are only available on the floor beams and not in the link regions. It is worth noting that link regions are protected zones per AISC 341-10 [3] in which the use of shear studs is prohibited. In addition to link behavior, the presence of a concrete slab also affects the structural response of EBF systems, which is discussed further in Section 5.2.
u15r | 2.5. Effect of Loading History
lq35 | Popov and his colleagues (e.g. [6, 18]) noticed that the applied loading history (or protocol) during an experimental study has a major effect on the observed plastic rotation capacity of EBF links. A comprehensive study on this effect was, however, conducted recently by Richards and Uang [66, 67].
3g9w | Okazaki et al. [29] reported unexpected link web fractures for a number of tested short links prior to reaching the code-specified 0.08 rad rotation limit. Richards and Uang [66, 67] attributed this issue
d09o | mainly to the utilized loading history and stated that the loading protocol used by Okazaki et al. [29] (based on Appendix S of AISC 341-02 [68]) was significantly more severe than the loading sequences used in the 1980s tests on short links. Nonlinear time-history analyses were conducted by Richards and Uang [66, 67] on three prototype EBF structures subjected to 20 large-magnitude-small-distance Los Angeles ground motions. The obtained cumulative rotation demands were used to come up with a new protocol which was adopted by AISC 341-05 [69] for the cyclic testing of link-to-column connections. The proposed protocol has fewer cycles with large rotations compared to the old protocol.
