You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

g9du | An Overview of the History, Pathophysiology, and Pharmacological Interventions of Multiple Sclerosis
f682 | Abstract
li1k | Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-inflammatory disease that attacks and damages myelinated axons in the central nervous system (CNS) and causes nontraumatic neurological impairment in young people. Historically, Lidwina of Schiedam documented the first MS case. After that, Augustus d'Este wrote for years about how his MS symptoms worsened. Age, sex, genetics, environment, smoking, injuries, and infections, including herpes simplex and rabies, are risk factors for MS. According to epidemiology, the average age of onset is between 20 and 40 years. MS is more prevalent in women and is common in Europe and
pbea | America. As diagnostic methods and criteria change, people with MS may be discovered at earlier and earlier stages of the disease. MS therapy has advanced dramatically due to breakthroughs in our knowledge of the disease's etiology and progression. Therefore, the efficacy and risk of treatment medications increased exponentially. Management goals include reducing lesion activity and avoiding secondary progression. Current treatment approaches focus on managing acute episodes, relieving symptoms, and reducing biological activity. Disease-modifying drugs such as fingolimod, interferon-beta, natalizumab, and dimethyl fumarate are the most widely used treatments for MS. For proof of the efficacy and safety of these medications, investigations in the real world are necessary.
ccpt | Introduction And Background
0fpw | Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune inflammatory disease that assaults myelinated axons in the central nervous system (CNS), damaging the myelin and axon to varying degrees [1]. Inflammation, neurodegeneration, and gliosis are hallmarks of MS. Perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and macrophages destroy the myelin sheaths that pathologically wrap neurons [2,3]. In most cases, the condition is relapsing- remitting, with brief bouts of neurologic impairment that resolve entirely or nearly wholly [4]. MS pathophysiology is not fully understood but may be connected to hereditary predisposition and a putative non-genetic trigger that results in a sustaining autoimmune disease leading to recurring immunological attacks on CNS [5]. The geographic variance in the incidence of MS suggests environmental causes [3,5]. Due to improvements to the criteria used to make these assessments, people may now get a more accurate and quick diagnosis [4].
dqn8 | Recent breakthroughs in the knowledge of MS processes have led to the development of innovative therapy methods [5,6]. Recently, numerous drugs have been effective in phase III testing, indicating approval [7]. As viable therapy increases, choosing the correct one for each patient is harder. Modern medicine treats this condition with hormones, immunosuppressants, plasma exchange, and other medications [8]. As a clinically incurable disease, MS burdens patients and communities [9]. As a result, how to manage MS safely and efficiently has become a pressing societal medical issue [3,10]. Therefore, this study aims to review the history, pathophysiology, and pharmacological interventions of MS.
cop0 | Review History
lhkq | The term "paraplegia" refers to any severe neurological disorder marked by motor impairment. Saint Lidwina of Schiedam, who lived in the Netherlands at the end of the 14th century, documented the first mention of MS [11,12]. Augustus d'Este kept a journal for 26 years in which he wrote about how symptoms of what we
82ju | now know to be MS got worse over time. His initial sign was a temporary visual impairment, most likely optic neuritis, at age 28. He died at age 54 of motor symptoms and lower extremities that hindered his walking [11-14]. Charcot's naming and framing of MS provided a framework for organizing previously unexplained discoveries and making future advances in MS. Since then, the consolidation has continued. Charcot's students correlated the disease's clinical symptoms with postmortem lesion pathology. Joseph Babinski's 1885 MS thesis described plaques in the brain and spinal cord. Pierre Marie highlighted autonomic dysfunction and gait impairments in MS [11,15]. Ernst Leyden initially hypothesized a hereditary component of MS in the mid-19th century. Still, it wasn't until the 1930s that Curtius and others in Germany started systematically assessing the genetics of MS and how the illness clustered in certain families [11,13,14].
y2qo | Charcot, Von Frerichs, Vulpian, and others differentiated and "framed" MS as a unique, recognizable entity [12,15]. MS cases were classified according to their histology, clinical appearance, and prognosis before being diagnosed by doctors worldwide [13,14]. As awareness of MS developed, so made etiology ideas and therapeutic attempts; a 1935 research study included 158 MS treatments. Subsequent "cures" included anticoagulants, histamine desensitization, various diets, immunizations, and anticancer drugs [13,16]. Randomized clinical trials became more precisely defined in the decades following the 1960s, aided by advances in sickness classification and disability indices. Hypotheses were developed to account for immunological changes, genetic influences, geographical differences, infections, and environmental factors [6]. MS organizations enhanced research and general education and altered attitudes regarding the condition [16,17]. Last years, significant advances have been made in fundamental analysis to clarify the disease's causes and processes and immunomodulatory medications [11,16,17].
1piq | Etiology
7fqw | Several risk factors lead to MS's development, including age, sex, race, heredity, geography, and infections such as herpes simplex, chlamydia, and rabies [18,19]. MS is likely the result of a complicated interplay between genetics, food, and the environment [6,20]. MS is primarily caused by an autoimmune attack on the CNS due to hyper immunity. Numerous postulated pathways have been proposed, but the proposed "outside-in" mechanism involves CD4+ proinflammatory T cells [21]. Researchers hypothesize that an unknown antigen promotes and activates 1 T-helper (Th1) and 17 T-helper (Th17), leading to CNS endothelium adhesion, blood-brain barrier (BBB) crossing, and subsequent immune attack through cross- reactivity. The "inside-out" theory posits that an innate malfunction of CNS produces and culminates in inflammation-mediated tissue destruction [21]. The phenomenon of environmental impacts, such as latitudinal gradients in different countries, has been widely studied [22]. A deficiency in vitamin D has been a possible explanation for susceptibility observed in populations living at higher latitudes [23,24]. Individuals with relatives have a considerable chance of developing the disease. The expected range of heritability is between 35 and 75% [25,26]. Human leukocyte antigen DRB1*1501 has a significant association with MS [27].
rhaz | Risk factors
wak1 | Vitamin D Deficiency
wtfz | Vitamin D's activity in lymphocyte stimulation and modulation of growth and immune response suggests that it plays a substantial role in the pathogenesis of MS [19]. In addition, the reactions of the innate immune system and adaptive immunological activity are increased. Vitamin D reduces the production of Th1-mediated proinflammatory cytokines [28]. In many trials, vitamin D administration dramatically altered interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) levels [29,30]. MS is more common in people living farther north or south of the equator. The prevalence rate in societies near the equator is almost non-existent but grows to 50 cases per 1,000,000 individuals living 45 degrees north or south. Vitamin D insufficiency among MS patients is likely a contributor to this fascinating regional distribution [1,20,31,32].
