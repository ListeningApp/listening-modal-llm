## CARROTS AND STICKS: HOW VCS INDUCE ENTREPRENEURIAL TEAMS TO SELL STARTUPS

CARROTS AND STICKS


## INTRODUCTION

Venture capitalists play a significant role in the financing of high-risk, technology-based business ventures. Many of America's best-known public companies began as VC-backed firms: Amazon.com, Apple, FedEx, Intel, Microsoft, and Starbucks, to name a few. Not


## CARROTS AND STICKS

surprisingly, venture capital is considered to be an important contributor to economic growth in the United States and elsewhere.

The steps in the venture capital cycle are by now familiar. A venture capital firm creates and raises capital for a limited-life fund. The VCs select portfolio companies for inclusion in the fund, investing in these companies through multiple rounds of financing. Along the way, the VCs advise and monitor the portfolio companies, sometimes replacing the companies' founders. Before the end of the fund's life, VCs "exit" from their investments in the portfolio companies and return capital to the fund's investors. The fund's investors can then recycle the returned capital into another venture capital fund.

Venture exits usually take one of three forms: one, an initial public offering of the portfolio company's shares followed by the sale of the VC's shares into the public market; two, a "trade sale" of the company to another firm; or three, the dissolution and liquidation of the company. Of these three types of exits, initial public offerings have received the most scrutiny. This attention is


## CARROTS AND STICKS

not surprising. Initial public offering exits tend to involve the largest and most visible VC-backed firms. And, perhaps just as important, the initial public offering process triggers public-disclosure requirements under the securities laws, making data on initial public offering exits easily accessible to researchers.

But trade sales are actually much more common than initial public offerings and, in the aggregate, are likely to be almost as financially important to VCs. Indeed, in certain industries-like medical devices-and during certain periods-like the last decade, when the initial public offering market was tepid-trade sales are likely to be more important to VCs than initial public offerings. Unlike initial public offerings, however, trade sales do not trigger the securities laws' intense public-disclosure requirements; they instead take place in the shadows. Thus, although trade sales are important to the venture capital cycle, researchers know relatively little about them.

The purpose of this Article is to shine light on how VCs arrange to sell startups in trade sales. In particular, we seek to investigate how VCs induce the "entrepreneurial team"-the founder, other executives, and common shareholders-to go along with a trade sale that they might have an incentive to resist.

We begin by describing the standard cash-flow and control rights that VCs receive when investing in startups. Turning first to cash-flow rights, we explain that VCs almost always invest through convertible preferred stock. In a trade-sale exit, VCs choose between retaining their preferred shares (and capturing most or all of the proceeds through their liquidation preferences) or


## CARROTS AND STICKS

converting the preferred shares into common shares. In an initial public offering, VCs (as a practical matter) must convert to common stock. Turning next to control rights, we explain that VCs seek board seats and shareholder-voting rights, in part to make it easier for them to exit and realize their cash-flow rights.

We then explain why founders, executives, and common shareholders are more likely to oppose a trade-sale exit than an initial public offering exit. In an initial public offering, the founder (if still the CEO) can continue running the firm and will face less direct oversight as shareholdings become more diffuse. Other executives of an initial public offering firm can typically keep their jobs, also with less shareholder oversight than before. And the original common shareholders of the initial public offering firm generally do well; VCs would not push for an initial public offering exit unless the common shares-to which the VCs must convert in an initial public offering-have considerable value.

By contrast, in a trade sale, the founder (if still the CEO) and other executives may lose their jobs or find themselves subject to more direct oversight as shareholdings become concentrated in the hands of a single shareholder (the acquirer). In other words, they become "mere" employees. And because VCs in trade sales often exit as preferred shareholders with liquidation preferences that must be paid in full before common shareholders receive any payout, common shareholders may receive little (if any) payout. At the same time, the sale eliminates any "option value" (upside potential) of the common stock held by the founder, other executives, and employees. For all these reasons, VCs pushing for a trade sale may face resistance from the entrepreneurial team, particularly when common shareholders receive very little.

Two points are worth emphasizing here. First, an entrepreneurial team resisting a trade sale may not necessarily believe that the startup has a reasonable chance of going public if it remains independent. Rather, team members may resist a trade sale today because they believe that, if the startup remains independent, there is a good chance that it can exit in the future via a more attractive trade sale-one that provides significantly better employment opportunities for the entrepreneurial team and more value for the common shareholders.


## CARROTS AND STICKS

Second, there may be situations where the entrepreneurial team favors a trade sale opposed by the VCs. For example, the entrepreneurial team might wish to accept an offer that is personally lucrative but which provides only a modest return to the VCs. Thus, we do not claim that the entrepreneurial team will always oppose a trade sale. Rather, our claim is that there are likely many scenarios where VCs will favor a trade sale that the entrepreneurial team opposes.

After describing the entrepreneurial team's potential incentive to resist a trade sale, we then discuss the various strategies the team might use to impede the sale. The executives and common shareholders can impede a trade sale through their influence over the board, which must approve the transaction. The common shareholders can try to block the sale by exercising their voting rights or by threatening litigation. Finally, the executives can refuse to cooperate in the sale process or, if the acquisition requires their continued participation in the enterprise, refuse to commit to such participation.

Next, we identify the various bribes (carrots) and coercive tools (sticks) that VCs can use to induce a reluctant entrepreneurial team to support, or at least not impede, a trade sale. For the founder and other executives, the VCs can offer bonuses for a successful sale (carrots). The VCs can also threaten termination or blacklisting if the executives do not cooperate (sticks).

For common shareholders, VCs can offer to share part of the VCs' cash-flow rights with the common shareholders through a "carve-out to common" (carrot). They can also use vote buying or other transactions that dilute common shareholders' voting rights to undermine common shareholders' ability to block a transaction via their voting rights (sticks).

To investigate the use of carrots and sticks in trade sales, we use a hand-collected database of fifty VC-backed Silicon Valley firms sold to acquirers in two thousand three and two thousand four. The firms are primarily in the biotech, telecommunications, software, and internet sectors. The average sale price is fifty-five million dollars, but there is considerable variance in outcomes. A number of sales are essentially liquidations, while other sales are for well over one hundred million dollars; one firm sold for over five hundred million dollars. For each firm, we collect data on the carrots and sticks used in connection with the sale.


## CARROTS AND STICKS

We find in our sample a heavy reliance on carrots. To induce executives to cooperate in selling their firms, VCs frequently offer sale bonuses. In sixteen of the fifty firms, VCs pay an average sale bonus of one point six three million dollars. In eleven of fifty firms, VCs give common shareholders as a class an average of three point seven million dollars extra. In forty-five percent of the firms, VCs give at least one type of carrot, with these carrots on average amounting to nine percent of the deal's value. Across all fifty firms in our sample, an average of four point three percent of deal value-two point four percent on a dollar-weighted basis-is used to fund these two types of carrots: sale bonuses and carve-outs to common.

We also find some use of sticks, such as threats to blacklist founders who refuse to cooperate and attempts to undermine common shareholders' voting rights. But the overt use of these sticks is relatively infrequent. And although sixty percent of the founders in our firms are replaced before the sale, we find no evidence that VCs fired or threatened to fire founders to ease the sales of firms.

Our study makes three important contributions to the literature. First, it sheds light on an important but underexplored aspect of corporate governance in private, VC-backed firms. In particular, it highlights the potentially divergent interests of different players in VC-backed firms around trade-sale exits and shows that VCs frequently must overcome potential opposition to these sales.

Second, our study provides additional evidence that managers of a target firm can extract value by holding up a sale of the firm. Researchers have reported on the use of side payments to executives in the sale of publicly traded firms. We show that such "bribes" are used not only in public firms with dispersed ownership but also in closely held private firms.

Third, our study provides some evidence on whether VCs are constrained from abusing their power in startups. The relatively infrequent use of sticks in our sample supports the view that reputational or other nonlegal considerations substantially constrain (but do not completely prevent) sharp-elbowed behavior by VCs in Silicon Valley.

The remainder of the Article is structured as follows: Part One describes the typical structure of VC cash-flow and exit-facilitating control rights in startup firms. Part Two explains why founders, other executives, and common shareholders may wish to impede a trade sale as well as the means they have


## Carrots and Sticks

to do so. Part Three describes the carrots and sticks that VCs may use to overcome such resistance. Part Four presents our dataset. Part Five describes the carrots and sticks actually used by VCs in our sample.


## One

VCS' Cash-Flow and Control Rights


## A. VCs' Cash-Flow Rights

In the United States, VC-backed startups almost always issue two classes of stock: common and convertible preferred. The founders and employees of the startup hold the common stock. The convertible preferred stock is held by the VCs, who invest in startups almost exclusively through this type of security. Most venture-backed startups issue a new series of preferred stock for each round of financing.

Like most preferred stock, VCs' preferred shares carry a liquidation preference and are convertible into common stock. If VCs retain their preferred stock and preserve their liquidation preferences, those preferences must be satisfied before common shareholders receive any payment. In this scenario, the VCs' cash-flow rights resemble debt. If the VCs convert their preferred shares to common, giving up their liquidation preferences, the VCs have the same cash-flow rights as common shareholders. Thus, convertible


## Carrots and Sticks

preferred stock combines downside protection with upside potential.

In a trade sale, the VCs will choose whether to exit as preferred shareholders and reap the benefits of their liquidation preferences or to exit as common shareholders. If the VCs exit via an IPO, underwriters will typically insist that the VCs convert their preferred shares to common shares and give up their liquidation preferences along with other rights attached to the preferred stock. To prevent holdouts, a startup's charter will, with respect to the holders of each series of preferred stock, generally either (a) require all of the holders of that series to convert to common stock or (b) allow a majority of the holders of that series to forcibly convert all holders of that series to common stock. Thus, one way or the other, VCs in IPO firms will typically exit as common shareholders.


## B. VCs' Exit-Facilitating Control Rights

To exit their investment, VCs must arrange an IPO, trade sale, or dissolution of the firm. Below, we describe the two types of control rights most relevant to facilitating an exit: one, the right to fill seats on the board of directors and two, shareholder-voting rights.


## One. Board Seats

The board of directors is responsible for managing the day-to-day business and affairs of the company. Critically, the board is also the only corporate body that can initiate fundamental transactions, such as mergers, IPOs, and dissolutions. These transactions, in turn, are almost always


## Carrots and Sticks

necessary for the VCs to exit; hence, we will call them "VC exit transactions." Thus, VC exit transactions-including trade sales-cannot go forward without board approval. But, as we will see, board approval alone is not sufficient. Shareholder approval is also necessary.

The board, in turn, is elected-and can be replaced-by the shareholders. In the typical public company, default statutory-voting rules give the holder of each share one vote for each open board seat. By contrast, in a VC-backed firm, the parties typically negotiate a voting agreement that overrides default statutory voting rules. The agreement specifies the allocation of board seats among: one, representatives of the common shareholders; two, representatives of the VC investors; and three, so-called "independent" directors, who are mutually appointed by the common shareholders and the VCs and typically are industry experts or other outsiders with valuable experience and connections.

Because board approval is necessary for VC exits, VCs negotiate aggressively for board seats when investing in startups. While data on board composition in private, VC-backed firms are scarce, two persistent patterns emerge from various small-scale studies of VC contracting documents and VC-backed firms. First, VC board representation tends to increase with new financing rounds, especially outside rounds that bring in new VCs. Second, in a plurality of firms, neither common shareholders nor VC-appointed directors ever achieve outright control; the swing vote remains in the hands of an independent director. Keeping the swing vote in the hands of an independent director makes it more difficult for either the common shareholders or the preferred shareholders to act opportunistically with respect to the other class of shareholders. But as one of us has argued in


## Carrots and Sticks

other work, these studies (and the outwardly neutral appearance of independent directors) may understate the extent of de facto VC control over startup boards.


## Two. Shareholder Rights

As noted above, for VCs seeking an exit transaction, board approval is not sufficient. Shareholder approval is also necessary.

As a matter of corporate law, some shareholder approval is always required. The nature of that approval will depend on the corporate law of the state in which the firm is domiciled as well as the firm's charter and other organizational documents. In some states, such as Delaware, the default arrangement is that a majority of preferred and common shares (voting together) must approve exit transactions. But alternative arrangements, including provisions giving particular series of preferred stock veto rights, are common. In other states, including California, a majority of each class of shares (including common stock) must approve exit transactions.

As a matter of business practice, the buyer in a trade sale may also insist on shareholder approvals not required by corporate law or the firm's organizational documents. For example, a buyer might be concerned about appraisal rights. Under corporate law, dissenting shareholders in a merger (those voting against the transaction) can exercise appraisal rights and have a court determine the "fair value" of their shares; the buyer is then forced to pay fair value to these dissenters. If the court's determination of fair value is much higher than the amount paid per share in the transaction, the cost of acquiring the target could rise substantially. To minimize potential appraisal claims, an acquirer may insist that a supermajority of shareholders approve the transaction. The bottom line is that corporate law may provide only a floor


## CARROTS AND STICKS

for shareholder-approval requirements.

Because common shareholders' approval is sometimes needed as a matter of corporate law (in states where approval by each class of stock is required) or business practice, V Cs can (and sometimes do) negotiate for "drag-along" rights that allow them to force common shareholders to vote for any transaction favored by the V Cs. If the common shareholders have agreed to vote their shares as directed by the V Cs, they cannot block an exit transaction via a class vote. Instead, they must seek other means to stop the transaction.


## Two Potential Entrepreneurial-Team Resistance to Trade Sales

This Part explores why the entrepreneurial team may resist a trade sale that the V Cs propose. Subpart A explains why founders and other executives may oppose, and may be able to impede, a trade sale. Subpart B explains why common shareholders may oppose, and may be able to impede, a trade sale.


## A. Resistance by the Founder and Executives

The founder and other executives may have both reasons and the means to oppose a trade sale.


## One. Incentive

Consider a founder who is still the C E O. The founder-C E O may have ambitious (perhaps grandiose) financial and nonfinancial aspirations for the startup. He or she may believe that these aspirations can be realized only if the startup remains independent and he or she remains in control. A trade sale may well snuff out these aspirations. To the extent the founder-C E O wants to keep the startup independent so that it can realize its full "potential," he or she may oppose a trade sale.

Whether or not the founder is still part of the management team, the firm's executives might have two very practical reasons to oppose a trade sale. First, the executives may well be replaced or subject to tighter supervision as the firm comes under the control of a single shareholder (the acquirer). The acquirer could thus force the executives to give up the pay, perquisites, and


## CARROTS AND STICKS

prestige associated with their positions-or to work harder for them.

Second, executives may own substantial amounts of common stock in the firm, especially if they are part of the founding team. As we discuss below, a trade sale may yield little for common shareholders while eliminating the option value of their stock. To the extent executives own common stock that they will be forced to give up for less than its option value, they have another reason to try to block a trade sale.


## Two. Ability

Executives of V C-backed firms seeking to block a trade sale have three potential means to do so. First, and most importantly, they can refuse to cooperate in the sale of the firm. They can refuse to report acquisition interest to the V Cs, they can drag their feet in dealing with a potential acquirer, and they can refuse to provide information or emphasize negative aspects of the business to a potential acquirer. Moreover, if a potential acquirer wants members of the executive team to stay on after the acquisition (for example, to continue developing a startup's technology), executives can block the deal by refusing to work for the acquirer. In short, executives can use their positional power in the firm to undermine and sabotage efforts to sell it.

Second, to the extent executives have seats on the board, they can threaten to vote against a sale and try to persuade independent directors to oppose the transaction. Attorneys advising a board may prefer a vote to be unanimous because it reduces litigation risk. The desire for a unanimous vote would increase the ability of even a single director to impede a sale.

Third, if common-shareholder approval is necessary for the deal and executives own a large block of common shares, they can threaten to vote their shares against the deal and lobby other common shareholders to oppose the deal. This brings us to common-shareholder opposition to trade sales.


## B. Opposition by Common Shareholders

Common shareholders, like executives, may also have an incentive (and some ability) to impede a trade sale.

V Cs exiting via trade sale can always choose to retain their preferred shares rather than convert them into common shares. In this scenario, the


## CARROTS AND STICKS

V Cs have liquidation preferences that must be paid in full before common shareholders receive any payout. Thus, common shareholders may not receive much, if anything, in a trade sale. However, even if the V Cs' liquidation preferences exceed the sale price, the common stock might have considerable option value at the time of sale: if the firm is not sold now, it might later hit a home run and be sold later for a price that far exceeds the preferred shareholders' liquidation preferences, giving a large payout to common shareholders. The less common shareholders receive, and the greater the loss of option value, the more common shareholders will wish to block a trade sale.

In blocking a sale, the common shareholders' goal may not be to keep the startup independent so that it can later go public. Rather, these shareholders may resist a trade sale today because they believe that, if the startup remains independent, there is a good chance that the future will bring a more attractive trade sale-one that provides significantly more value for common shareholders.


## Two. Ability

Common shareholders can block a trade sale in three ways: by (a) using their shareholder voting rights; (b) litigating or threatening litigation; or (c) using their influence over the board.


## a. Shareholder Voting Rights

As we explained in Part I.B.2, common-shareholder approval may be necessary to conduct a trade sale. In particular, such approval will be necessary if one, corporate law or the acquirer requires common-shareholder approval, and two, the VCs fail to negotiate effective drag-along rights enabling them to force the common shareholders to vote for a VC-favored sale. If neither corporate law nor the acquirer demands common-shareholder approval (or the VCs have effective drag-along rights), then common shareholders cannot threaten to hold up the deal through their voting rights.


## B. Fiduciary-Duty and Other Litigation

To try to block a deal, common shareholders can also threaten to sue the board or the VCs directly for, among other things, breach of fiduciary duties under corporate law. Common shareholders' litigation leverage will depend in part on the corporate laws of the state in which the firm is domiciled. The


## CARROTS AND STICKS

easier it is to demonstrate a breach of fiduciary duty under that state's corporate law, the more leverage common shareholders will have.

But there are two limitations to common shareholders' ability to credibly threaten litigation. First, aggrieved common shareholders will often lack the financial ability to sue VCs. Second, there may well be large reputational costs to litigating against VCs. All in all, the actual likelihood of litigation will probably be low.


## Board Influence

A third mechanism by which common shareholders can impede a trade sale is by asking their representatives on the board (if there are any) and any independent directors (if there are any) to vote against the transaction. Common shareholders will have considerable influence on how the board votes if a majority of the board's seats are held by a combination of common-shareholder representatives and independent directors. Indeed, given directors' preference for unanimous board votes, even a stubborn minority of directors who care about the interests of common shareholders might be able to block a sale that is unfavorable to common shareholders.


## Three VCs' Potential Carrots and Sticks

In Part Two, we saw that founders, other executives, and common shareholders of VC-backed startups may have the incentive and ability to resist a trade sale. In this Part, we describe the carrots and sticks that VCs can use to induce founders and other executives (subpart A) and common shareholders (subpart B) to go along with trade sales. Subpart C explains that, from the VCs' perspective, both carrots and sticks entail costs.


## CARROTS AND STICKS

A. Founders and Executives

To induce founders and other executives to facilitate rather than impede a trade sale, VCs may either offer carrots or deploy various sticks.

For founders and other executives, the VCs can use direct carrots (management bonuses) or indirect carrots (carve-outs to common shareholders).


## a. Management Bonus

The direct carrot is a "management bonus" triggered by the sale and generally tied to the sale price. The bonus may be structured in a variety of ways. To begin, executives can be promised ex ante, even before an acquirer is identified, a portion of the sale proceeds. Alternatively, executives can be given a contemporaneously negotiated payment. This ex post payment might be labeled as a "bonus" or, alternatively, characterized as consideration for a noncompete or consulting agreement.

The cost to VCs of using a management-bonus carrot will depend on the sale price relative to the aggregate liquidation preferences at the time of sale. If the sale price exceeds the aggregate liquidation preferences, the original common shareholders will pay for much (or all) of the management-bonus carrot. If the sale price is less than the aggregate liquidation preferences, the VCs will shoulder all of the cost of the carrot.


## b. Carve-Out to Common

The indirect carrot is a carve-out to the common shareholders as a class. A carve-out entitles common shareholders to a portion of the proceeds from the trade sale even if the firm is sold for less than the VCs' liquidation preferences. To the extent that the founders and executives own shares of common stock, they will share pro rata in the carve-out. For example, if founders and executives own fifty percent of the common stock, a carve-out to common of ten million dollars will yield founders and executives five million dollars.


## Two. Sticks

VCs facing recalcitrant founders and other executives have two potential sticks at their disposal.

First, VCs could threaten to fire the founder and other executives if they refuse to cooperate in a trade sale. Termination would cut off future compensation and perhaps cause the forfeiture of unvested equity. Such a


## CARROTS AND STICKS

step would be quite painful for the executives.

But such a tactic would also be quite costly for the VCs. The startup would lose its management team, which may be crucial to a potential buyer; the VCs would be forced to spend time and energy finding a replacement; and the new team would then need to be brought up to speed and adequately incentivized to assist in selling the firm. As a result, we would expect VCs to wield this stick rarely, if at all.


## b. Blacklisting

Second, VCs could threaten to blacklist founders and other executives who refuse to cooperate in a trade sale. VCs are repeat players in both funding entrepreneurs and hiring professional executives for startups. Neither entrepreneurs nor professional managers will want to displease the VCs, all else being equal.


## B. Common Shareholders

To induce common shareholders to support a trade sale, the VCs have one carrot at their disposal and a number of sticks.


## One. Carrot: Carve-Out to Common

The carrot VCs can offer common shareholders is a carve-out from their liquidation preferences (or other cash-flow rights) so that common shareholders receive more than they are contractually entitled to receive. Such a carve-out to common can both induce common shareholders to vote for the sale and cause them to refrain from suing.


## Two. Sticks

VCs can wield a number of sticks to compel the class of common shareholders to vote for the trade sale. However, these sticks cannot prevent a lawsuit and may in fact increase the likelihood of one.


## A. Cross-Voting

To eliminate common shareholders' ability to block a trade sale, VCs can either partially convert their shares into common stock or exercise warrants to buy common stock so as to acquire a sufficient amount of common stock to achieve the necessary approval threshold. Consider the transactions in Orban versus Field, a Delaware case involving a common-shareholder lawsuit against a VC-controlled board. Office Mart, a Delaware corporation, arranged to be acquired by Staples in a merger that provided no payout to its common shareholders. The charter allowed preferred shareholders to vote alongside common shareholders on an as-converted basis (as if their stock had been


## CARROTS AND STICKS

converted into common shares), and the preferred shareholders had enough votes to ensure shareholder approval of the transaction as required by corporate law. However, for accounting reasons, Staples insisted that at least ninety percent of Office Mart's common shares be voted in favor of the transaction. Common shareholders, led by Office Mart's founder and former CEO George Orban, refused to back the deal, demanding four million dollars in exchange for their votes.

Office Mart's board refused to provide a carve-out to common. Instead, the board arranged a series of transactions that, in essence, assisted the VCs in converting a portion of their preferred stock into common, thereby diluting the original common position down to less than ten percent of the class. The VCs, now holding over ninety percent of the common stock, voted their common stock in favor of the merger, which allowed the transaction to go forward and wiped out the original common shareholders. The maneuver cost the VCs nothing; although the partial conversion into common reduced the VCs' aggregate liquidation preferences, it still left them with enough liquidation preferences to absorb all of the merger consideration. Orban sued, arguing that Office Mart's board had violated its fiduciary duties to common shareholders. The Delaware Chancery ruled in favor of the board, concluding that the "common stockholders had no legal right to a portion of the merger consideration under Delaware law or the corporate charter" and noting that "there is no claim" that the challenged transaction "was not in the best interests of the corporation."


## B. Vote Buying

VCs can also overcome common-shareholder opposition by buying the votes of shareholders, such as executives, who already own a large block of common stock. For instance, assume that three executives of a startup collectively hold fifty-five percent of the common stock and that a trade sale cannot occur without approval by fifty percent of the common shareholders. Rather than providing a carve-out to all common shareholders, the VCs could simply award each of these three individuals a lucrative cash bonus or other payment in connection with a trade sale in exchange (implicitly) for voting their common shares in favor of the transaction. Vote buying via payments to executives can thus kill two birds-executive opposition to the trade sale and


## CARROTS AND STICKS

common-shareholder opposition to the trade sale-with one stone.

common-shareholder opposition to the trade sale-with one stone.

Alternatively, a VC-controlled board can issue (additional) common shares to certain executives or employees who expect to gain from the board's proposed transaction and will thus vote their common shares in favor of the transaction. Although vote buying in some or all of these cases may violate the board's duty to refrain from improperly tampering with the shareholder vote, it is very difficult to prove that the purpose of a particular payment or equity issuance to executives or employees is to buy votes.


## C. Carrots versus Sticks

We have seen that VCs have at their disposal both carrots and sticks to induce entrepreneurial teams to cooperate in trade sales. Carrots tend to involve out-of-pocket costs. For example, carve-outs to common come solely at the VCs' expense. But many sticks, such as threats to terminate or blacklist a founder or other executives, do not involve any cash outlay.

However, sticks can give rise to substantial indirect costs. First, although litigation is unlikely in any given case, the use of sticks may well increase the risk of litigation, which, should it occur, can be very costly in terms of VCs' time and reputation. Second, VCs may be deterred from "misbehaving"


## CARROTS AND STICKS

because of reputational considerations. As websites like The Funded dot com make the world smaller and more transparent, and serial entrepreneurs play a more important role in startups, the reputational costs to VCs who bully entrepreneurial teams with sticks are likely to become higher. Thus, both carrots and sticks can be costly to VCs.


## Four Research Sample

A. Sample Population

We study the use of carrots and sticks in trade sales of VC-backed startups using a hand-collected data set of VC-backed Silicon Valley firms. This section describes the data-collection process and provides descriptive statistics for the firms in our sample.


## One. Data Gathering

The data used for this project were collected in two thousand five to two thousand seven as part of a study supported by the Kaufmann Foundation and the University of California, Berkeley. We obtained from Venture Reporter dot net a list of VC-financed companies located in California that were sold in trade sales in either two thousand three or two thousand four. We filtered out all firms except those located in and around San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland (broadly defined as "Silicon Valley"), leaving a population of one hundred ninety-three firms.

For each firm, we next sought to locate and obtain data from one or more persons knowledgeable about the firm's life-including the circumstances surrounding its sale. We identified the current business addresses for the founders and executives-all of whom we call "entrepreneurs" for convenience-of one hundred forty-one of the one hundred ninety-three companies. We mailed letters asking entrepreneurs from each firm to provide us with data, promising to keep confidential the identity of the entrepreneur and the startup firm.

Entrepreneurs from fifty-seven of the one hundred forty-one firms agreed to provide us with data-a response rate of forty point four percent. The information obtained, supplemented by publicly filed corporate charters, covered each firm's entire life span. Among the data gathered were the state of incorporation; cash-flow rights and control rights negotiated in each VC financing round; the identities and backgrounds of the CEO and directors; and the circumstances and terms of the sale,


## CARROTS AND STICKS

including amounts paid to management and various classes of shareholders.

From the original set of fifty-seven firms, we removed seven for lack of adequate data, leaving us with fifty firms. In most of these sales (forty-two out of fifty), the VCs exited as preferred shareholders. In the remaining eight firms, the VCs converted into common stock in connection with the sale, giving up their liquidation preferences.


## Two. Selection Issues

Because our sample is limited to Silicon Valley firms sold in two thousand three or two thousand four, one must be somewhat cautious about extrapolating from our firms to VC-backed firms generally. Silicon Valley is a close-knit community with its own norms and ways of doing business. Our sample firms were sold several years after the tech bubble collapsed, a period in which VCs lost considerable amounts of money. These losses may have heightened the conflicts between VCs and entrepreneurial teams around exit events. The use of carrots and sticks within our sample firms could thus be a function of the post-bubble time period and factors unique to Silicon Valley, limiting the generalizability of our results.


## B. Sample Description

Our sample firms are "high-tech" businesses, primarily in the biotech, software, telecommunications, and internet sectors (Panel A of Table one). The concentration of IT-related businesses is representative of VC-financed firms generally. At the time of sale, the firms had received an average of forty-two million dollars in VC funding and had been operating for an average of


## CARROTS AND STICKS

approximately five years. The mean sale price is $55 million. Panel B of Table 1 provides information on the amount invested, financing rounds, years of operation, and sale price.


## C. VCs' Ex Ante Cash and Control Rights

We now turn to describe, for each of the firms in our sample, (one) the VCs' cash-flow rights; (two) the entrepreneurial team's board seats and shareholder-voting rights; and (three) the identity of the CEO at the time of sale.


## One. VCs' Cash-Flow Rights

Across all fifty firms, VCs' aggregate liquidation preferences at the time of sale are, on average, forty-seven million dollars. In the first round of financing, the liquidation preference usually equals the amount invested (a "one-x preference"), while the liquidation preference in subsequent rounds is more likely to be a higher multiple (i.e., two-x or three-x) of the amount invested (Panel C). At sale, aggregate liquidation preferences are on average somewhat greater than the amount invested (Panel B).

When VCs retain their preferred stock rather than converting to common stock, the allocation of the sale proceeds depends on the relationship between liquidation preferences and the sale price. If liquidation preferences exceed the sale price and contractual priority is fully respected, common shareholders get nothing. Liquidation preferences exceed the sale price in thirty-one of the forty-two firms in which VCs exit as preferred shareholders (Panel D). Absent a carrot, common shareholders as a class have little incentive to approve a merger when their equity is underwater. In eight firms, it was in the VCs' interest to convert to common stock rather than maintain their liquidation preferences, meaning that the sale proceeds were allocated pro rata among all common shareholders (the original common shareholders and the converting VCs).


## Two. Power of the Entrepreneurial Team

This section describes the extent of the entrepreneurial teams' blocking power-their board seats and corporate-law rights-in our sample firms. The data are summarized in Table two.


## a. Board Seats

Recall that board approval is required for a trade sale. Thus, the entrepreneurial team may be able to impede a sale through its influence on the


## CARROTS AND STICKS

board. We divide directors into three categories: (one) VC appointed, (two) common-shareholder appointed, and (three) independent (outside). If a particular outside director had been selected exclusively by either the VCs or the common shareholders, we designate this person as a VC or common-shareholder director, regardless of how contracting documents label the board seat.

Panel A reports the allocation of board seats. At the time of sale, fifty-six point five percent of all directors were appointed by the VCs, and twenty-two point eight percent were appointed by the common shareholders. Panel B shows that the VCs controlled the board in twenty-nine of the fifty firms (fifty-eight percent). In our sample, common shareholders rarely controlled the board at the time of the sale (three of the fifty firms). However, in twenty-one of the fifty firms, the combination of independent directors and common shareholders could have blocked a sale.


## b. Shareholder Rights

All our companies were incorporated in either California or Delaware at the time of their sales, consistent with findings that most VC-backed firms incorporate either in their home state or in Delaware. Panel C shows that thirty-five out of fifty firms were incorporated in Delaware at the time of the sale. As we explain below, California law may give the entrepreneurial team somewhat more power vis-à-vis VCs through both voting rights and the threat of fiduciary litigation.

(one) Voting rights. California and Delaware provide different voting rights for shareholders. In Delaware, mergers typically need to be approved by only the holders of a majority of all of the firm's outstanding stock, both preferred and common. We find that at the time of sale, VCs almost always have sufficient voting power to dictate the outcome of a shareholder-wide vote. California, on the other hand, requires a separate vote for each class of shareholders. Thus, when the VCs remain preferred shareholders, common shareholders of firms domiciled in California can more easily impede a sale they oppose.


## CARROTS AND STICKS

But it is not that simple. California purports to subject "quasi-California" corporations (corporations doing business in California but incorporated elsewhere) to the requirement of separate class votes. While California's legal ability to impose this requirement on firms incorporated elsewhere is contested, many (but not all) Delaware-incorporated companies located in California are advised by lawyers to hold separate class votes. In our sample, all but one Delaware-incorporated firm held a separate class vote for the common shareholders.

Thus, as a practical matter, incorporation in California rather than in Delaware may not give common shareholders much more power through voting rights. Nevertheless, common shareholders' ability to impede a transaction is still likely to be somewhat greater in a California-incorporated firm, where a separate class vote is indisputably mandatory.

(two) Fiduciary litigation. During the years in which our sample firms were sold, Delaware law appeared to permit a VC-controlled board to make decisions that favor preferred shareholders at the expense of the common shareholders unless the common shareholders could show that the decision was not in the "best interests of the corporation." In contrast, California law generally affords stronger protection to minority shareholders, including common shareholders in firms with VC-controlled boards. Thus, directors of California-domiciled firms may have believed they faced greater risk of liability for harming common shareholders.


## CARROTS AND STICKS

Three. Founders' Position in the Firm

The entrepreneurial team is likely to have a greater incentive to block a trade sale if the founder is still the CEO. First, a founder-CEO is likely to own more common stock than a replacement CEO; everything else equal, he or she will thus face a greater loss of option value if the firm is sold. Second, a founder-CEO may derive greater nonfinancial benefits from the business and thus may have additional incentive to keep the firm independent.

The entrepreneurial team may also have greater ability to impede a sale if the founder is still the CEO. A founder-CEO is likely to have substantially more common stock than a hired CEO, giving him more shareholder-blocking power. Compared to a hired CEO, the founder-CEO is also likely to have longer and deeper relationships with other directors and common shareholders. As a result, the founder-CEO is likely to have influence over directors and other common shareholders, increasing the likelihood that directors will resist the trade sale and further increasing the likelihood that common shareholders will vote against the transaction.

To reduce resistance to a trade sale, a firm's VC investors may use their control over the board of directors to replace the CEO before the planned exit. In our fifty-firm sample, twenty-nine of the founders (fifty-eight percent) were replaced as CEOs before the firm was sold. However, as we will discuss shortly, none of these replacements appeared to be made to overcome resistance to a trade sale.


## ACTUAL CARROTS AND STICKS IN THE SALE OF VC-BACKED STARTUPS

Part three described the potential carrots and sticks that VCs could deploy to induce entrepreneurial teams to sell the firm. Here, we describe the actual carrots (subpart A) and sticks (subpart B) used in our sample. We also describe the total out-of-pocket cost to the VCs in our sample of using carrots in connection with trade sales.


## A. Carrots

One. Common Carve-Outs

In our sample, eleven sales (twenty-two percent of fifty sales) feature carve-outs to common shareholders-extra value above the amount to which they were contractually entitled. To measure these carve-outs, we compare the actual payout received by VCs to the VCs' contractual entitlement. When VCs convert their preferred shares to common shares, their contractual entitlement equals their pro rata share of the sale price. When VCs exit as preferred shareholders,


## CARROTS AND STICKS

their contractual entitlement is the lesser of their liquidation preferences and the sale price. Any excess payment received by the original common shareholders is treated as a carve-out to common.

Table three describes the carve-outs to common shareholders in our sample. Limited to the eleven sales in which a carve-out occurs, the average carve-out to common shareholders is three point seven million dollars, or approximately ten percent of the total sale price. Though most firms do not provide a carve-out, carve-outs can be substantial when they occur. In our sample, one sale provided a ten million dollar carve-out to common shareholders, and in two deals, the carve-out was at least twenty-five percent of the total sale price.

Carve-outs to common shareholders occur only in the forty-two firms where the VCs exit holding preferred stock. Limited to the subsample of forty-two firms where VC investors did not convert their preferred shares to common shares, we find that common shareholders receive, on average, nine hundred sixty-nine thousand dollars more than their contractual entitlement, or approximately two point five percent of the total sale price. Among all fifty companies, common shareholders receive, on average, eight hundred ten thousand dollars more than their contractual entitlement, or approximately two point two percent of the total sale price.

Carve-outs to common shareholders are illustrated in Figure one. Each bar represents a firm's total sale price (in millions of dollars). The sale price is divided into four components: (one) the amount actually paid to VCs (in black); (two) the contractual entitlement of the original common shareholders at the given sale price (in white); (three) the carve-out given to the original common shareholders (in dark grey); and (four) nonretention bonuses paid to senior management in connection with the sale (in light grey).

In our sample, common carve-outs are used, at least in part, to overcome common shareholders' opposition to trade sales. Elsewhere, we showed econometrically that these carve-outs are more likely to occur when: (one) VCs lack de facto board control and thus need to convince other directors-such as independent directors and common-appointed directors-to support the sale; (two) the firm is domiciled in California rather than Delaware, and therefore common shareholders' rights are likely to be slightly stronger; or (three) common shareholders would otherwise be wiped out and receive none of the sale proceeds.

Qualitative interview data confirm that carve-outs to common shareholders are designed to induce common shareholders and their allies on the board to support the sale. In one California-domiciled firm, for example, the VCs carving out a portion of their liquidation preferences for common


## CARROTS AND STICKS

shareholders required each common shareholder to sign a liability waiver before receiving a portion of the carve-out. According to the entrepreneur, the carve-out was offered only because the VCs were concerned about a possible common-shareholder suit challenging the terms of the sale. In another case, where the VCs lacked board control, the entrepreneur told us that the VCs were forced to give a carve-out payment to common shareholders to obtain the support of other directors.

Of course, some of the carve-outs to common might have had other motives. VCs might have wanted to be "fair" to common shareholders or to build or maintain a reputation as "friendly" VCs. However, the fact that these carve-outs are more likely to occur when common shareholders have more power, or more incentive to block a sale, suggests that they are being used at least in part to induce common shareholders' cooperation with sales.


## Two. Nonretention Management Bonuses

Bonuses that do not require management to stay with the acquirer might be used as carrots to induce executives to support a sale. Of the fifty firms in our sample, sixteen offered various nonretention management bonuses in connection with the acquisition, with an average bonus in these sixteen firms of one point sixty-three million dollars (or six point six percent of the sale price). Bonuses are sometimes given to a broad class of employees (five firms), but in most cases they are limited to key executives (eleven firms).

Among all fifty companies, senior executives receive an average nonretention bonus of approximately five hundred twenty thousand dollars. Across all companies, these payments represent approximately two point one percent of the total purchase price (or zero point ninety-five percent on a dollar-weighted basis). Compared to bonuses awarded in connection with the sale of publicly held firms, the payments we document are modest in dollar terms, but large as a fraction of deal size. Nonretention management bonuses are depicted in Figure one.

Of course, VCs might have other reasons to give executives a management bonus besides inducing them to sell the company. They may want to reward the executives for a job well done or to curry favor with


## CARROTS AND STICKS

executives whom they hope to hire in the future. Thus, we cannot be certain that all of the nonretention bonuses observed were sale-related carrots.


## Three. Cost of Carrots

In our sample, twenty-three of the fifty firms offer a management bonus or common carve-out. Limited to the group of twenty-three firms offering a carrot, Figure two illustrates the value of these benefits relative to the sale price. In most cases, total carrots represent between five percent and twelve percent of the sale price, with a mean amount of approximately two point nine million dollars (or nine point four percent of deal value). In two firms, however, total carrots exceed twenty percent of deal value.

Across all fifty firms, the total cost of carrots (those given to executives plus those given to common shareholders) is about one point three three million dollars for the average sample firm. Across all companies, the average carrot is approximately four point three percent of the purchase price (or two point four percent on a dollar-weighted basis).

The use of carrots is greater in the forty-two firms in our sample where the VC investors did not convert to common stock, and thus where the conflict between the entrepreneurial team and VCs was likely to be the greatest. In this subsample of forty-two firms we find that the total cost of carrots is about one point five one million dollars for the average firm and that approximately five point zero percent of deal value (three point one percent on a dollar-weighted basis) was used to fund carrots.


## B. Sticks

As explained earlier, the two potential sticks available to VCs in dealing with recalcitrant executives are firing them and threatening to blacklist them, and the two sticks that can be used against common shareholders are cross-voting and vote buying. This section describes the use of such sticks in our sample.


## One. Termination of CEO

Recall that twenty-nine of the fifty founders of our firms had been replaced before the sale. But these replacements typically occurred well before the sale, usually in connection with a later round of financing. After three years of operating, approximately thirty percent of the firms in our sample had replaced the founder-CEO. Of those firms still in operation after six years, approximately sixty-three percent of the firms had replaced the founder-CEO. Data on the timing of


## CARROTS AND STICKS

CEO replacement in our sample are summarized in Table Four.

In fact, none of the entrepreneurs providing us with data indicated that any founder (or other executive) was fired or threatened with being fired immediately in connection with a contemplated sale. Moreover, while the impetus for replacing the founder-CEO typically came from the VCs, there was little conflict over the replacement of the founder-CEO. None of the terminated founder-CEOs reported that the VCs had caused the firm to repurchase vested options or had fired the founder-CEO to strip him or her of unvested equity, a possibility raised by Michael Klausner and Kate Litvak.

Indeed, most of the replaced founders reported significant involvement with the firm after the CEO change. The founder-CEO remained on the board following the CEO replacement in almost sixty percent (seventeen out of twenty-nine) of our sample firms. Even when the founder does not keep a board seat, he or she generally has some position with the firm after replacement (often serving as the Chief Technology Officer or in some other executive capacity).

To be sure, even if we do not observe forcible termination, the possibility of such termination is always present. The possibility of termination limits the value of management bonuses that executives can extract from the VCs.


## Two. Blacklisting

In two firms, VCs explicitly threatened to prevent a founder from ever raising money again in Silicon Valley if he or she did not vote for the sale as a director. In each of these firms, the founder's support was not necessary as a matter of corporate law to conduct the sale-the VCs had control of the board-but the VCs wanted a unanimous board vote to reduce liability risk. And they got it in both situations.

Again, the fact that blacklisting was explicitly threatened in only two firms does not mean that founders or executives in other firms were not affected by the possibility of blacklisting. We have been told by VCs and venture capital lawyers that entrepreneurs are keenly aware, even if they have not been explicitly told, that if they behave "unreasonably" toward the VCs backing their firm, it will be very difficult for them to raise funds from other VCs in the future. Our results thus understate the importance of blacklisting


## CARROTS AND STICKS

constraints on the entrepreneurial team.


## Three. Cross-Voting

In one firm, VC investors engaged in cross-voting, the scheme used in Orban versus Fields. Firm twenty-nine, which was California-domiciled, received fifty million dollars over three rounds of VC financing and was sold in two thousand four for twenty million dollars. At the time of sale, the VCs already controlled the board of directors, the founder had already been replaced as CEO, and the VCs collectively had liquidation preferences exceeding one hundred million dollars (the third-round financing included a three times preference). The founder refused to vote his common stock in favor of the sale. Because the firm was incorporated in California, approval by a majority of the common shareholders was necessary to sell the firm, giving the founder some degree of blocking power. To eliminate this holdup, the VCs converted a fraction of their preferred stock into common shares. This maneuver did not cost the VCs anything because, as in Orban, the VCs were left postconversion with liquidation preferences far greater than the twenty million dollar sale price.

Firm twenty-nine was the only company in our sample where this form of cross-voting was actually used. However, other founders, especially those of firms whose common stock was far underwater, reported that they were aware that VCs could engage in this tactic. Thus, demands for carve-outs to common shareholders are made in the shadow of possible cross-voting.


## Four. Vote Buying

Vote buying reportedly occurred in one firm in our sample. The firm was California-domiciled, and there were no drag-along rights. The founder reported that the VC-controlled board paid the CEO and other employees to exercise underwater options to acquire and vote common stock in favor of a trade sale for about eighty million dollars. In addition to this stick, the VCs used a carrot: they provided a four million dollar carve-out to common shareholders. The founder sued the VCs, alleging vote buying and improprieties associated with a presale financing round. The case was settled for an undisclosed amount.

Of course, implicit and essentially undetectable vote buying might be occurring through management bonuses because of the considerable overlap between shareholders and executives. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that vote buying was occurring in other firms in our sample.


## CARROTS AND STICKS

CONCLUSION

Trade sales by VCs are actually much more common than IPOs and, in the aggregate, are likely to be just as financially important to VCs. However, unlike IPOs, trade sales do not trigger the intense public-disclosure requirements of the securities laws. As a result, we know relatively little about them.

In this Article, we seek to shed light on how VCs arrange to sell startups in trade sales. In particular, we investigate how VCs induce the founder, other executives, and common shareholders to go along with a trade sale that they might otherwise have an incentive to resist.

We identify the types of bribes (carrots) and coercive tools (sticks) that VCs might use to induce a reluctant entrepreneurial team to support, or at least not impede, a trade sale. We then investigate the use of carrots and sticks using a hand-collected database of fifty VC-backed Silicon Valley firms sold to acquirers in two thousand three and two thousand four. We find, in our sample, a relatively heavy reliance on carrots. Carrots are used in forty-five percent of the firms, with carrots averaging nine percent of deal value in these firms. We also find some use of sticks, such as threats to blacklist founders who refuse to cooperate and attempts to undermine common shareholders' voting rights. But the overt use of these sticks is relatively infrequent.

Our study makes three contributions. First, it sheds light on an important but underexplored aspect of corporate governance in private, VC-backed firms. In particular, it highlights the potentially conflicting interests of the different players in VC-backed firms around trade-sale exits and shows that VCs frequently must overcome potential opposition to these sales by founders, executives, and common shareholders.

Second, our study provides further evidence that managers of target firms can extract value by holding up a sale of the firm. Research has documented the frequent use of side payments to induce executives to participate in the sale of publicly traded firms. We show that such carrots are used not only in public firms with dispersed ownership but also in closely held private firms.

Third, our study provides some evidence on whether venture capitalists are constrained from abusing their power in startups. Although venture capitalists have considerable power in startups, the relatively infrequent overt use of sticks in our sample provides support for the view that reputational or other nonlegal considerations constrain misbehavior by Silicon Valley venture capitalists. We hope that our work is useful to practitioners and academics seeking to better understand the corporate governance of VC-backed firms.

This table provides descriptive statistics for our fifty sample firms. Panel A reports industry classification for each firm as provided by the respective data source. Panel B reports the mean and median period of operation, number of financing rounds, amount invested, and sale price. Panel B also shows the aggregate liquidation preferences of VC investors at the time of sale. Panel C shows the preferences given in each round of financing. The first column lists, for each round, the number of firms granting one times liquidation preferences. The second column lists, for each round, the number of firms granting liquidation preferences between one times and two times. The third column lists, for each round, the number of firms granting liquidation preferences greater than two times. The final column lists financing rounds where the liquidation preferences of earlier investors are waived or reduced (a "recap" financing). Panel D shows, at the time of sale, the relationship between aggregate liquidation preferences and the sale price.

This table reports the distribution of corporate governance rights in our sample firms. Panel A reports the mean and median board representation for (one) common shareholders, (two) VCs, and (three) independent (outside) directors. Panel B shows board control at the time of sale. If the VCs (or common shareholders) control a majority of the board seats, we classify the VCs (or common shareholders) as having "Control." If the board has an even number of seats and the VCs (or common shareholders) appoint exactly half the directors, we treat this as "Blocking." "Shared Control" means that the VCs and the common shareholders each appoint fewer than fifty percent of the directors, with outside directors providing the tie-breaking vote. Panel C shows the state of incorporation at the time of sale.

This table describes the frequency and magnitude of common carve-outs and management bonuses in our sample firms. Panel A provides summary statistics for all sample firms. Panel B reports summary statistics only for those firms that provided a common carve-out and/or a management bonus. Data are presented in millions of dollars and as a percentage of the sale price. The included summary statistics are mean, dollar-weighted mean (D W Mean), standard deviation (S D), minimum, and maximum. D W Mean is weighted by the firm's sale price.

Table Four reports the identity of the CEO in our sample firms (founder or replacement), as of the end of each year of the firm's operation. Panel B illustrates the frequency of CEO replacement over time. The horizontal axis represents the lifespan of each firm from formation to sale, normalized to one unit, and the vertical axis represents the percentage of sample firms that have replaced the CEO.
