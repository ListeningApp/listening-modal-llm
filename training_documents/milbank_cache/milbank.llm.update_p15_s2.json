We stress that analysis of this kind, though essential to empirical legal research, does not exhaust legal scholarship on laws, eliminate the serious challenges often entailed in interpreting what the law \"is,\" or replace serious discussion of what the law ought to be.\nm61y | Implementation Studies\nu2ob | For a law to be effective, its implementation must be such that it will actually influence the behavior of its targets. The process of putting a law into practice can be understood in terms of a series of mediating factors, including the attitudes, management methods, capacities, and resources of implementing agencies and their agents; the methods and extent of enforcement; the relationship between the legal rules and broader community norms; and the attitudes and other relevant characteristics of the population whose behavior is targeted for influence. The text of the law and the resources appropriated for its enforcement constrain, but do not eliminate, the discretion of bureaucratic entities to reshape the rules to fit their existing culture and mission.\n2gnm | Implementation research classically starts with investigating the \"transformation process\" that occurs along path B in figure one, the differences between the goals and methods of the law as explicitly or implicitly contemplated in the \"law on the books,\" and the \"law on the streets\" actually put into practice by legal agents charged with enforcing the law. Case studies or other analyses of how health agencies have organized their mission or performed in a given mission are a common form of implementation research and often investigate what legal powers an agency had or how it used them. Creative compliance and outright resistance by the targets of regulation also may be studied. Implementation research in public health law research includes studies of the relationship among \"legal infrastructure,\" legal or other competencies, and agency function. Such studies may explore the effects of law on private agencies operating under a legal authorization, such as the effect of legal authorization on syringe-exchange programs. Implementation researchers also measure\nemgw | proximate outcomes of new rules that may provide an early indication of their true behavioral effects, like the actual speeds observed on highways after a change in the nominal speed limit.\nxaqt | Research on legal practices in public health law research may investigate the means through which systems may be better governed or regulation better designed in order to achieve their goals. Although it has as yet had little impact on public health law research, the study of techniques of regulation and governance has become an important part of empirical legal research and scholarship. For nearly three decades, regulation in the United States and many other developed countries has exhibited an increasing pluralism, not just in spreading regulatory functions beyond government to private parties and public-private hybrids, but also in using a wide range of strategies beyond detailed rules backed by carrots and sticks. Contemporary regulators use cooperation, deliberation, education, competition, and other \"soft\" strategies that can be more effective than traditional command-and-control bureaucracy. Theory and research in governance have highlighted the importance of actors outside government-such as advocacy groups, corporations, and gangs-in managing the course of events in social systems and have investigated how these actors regulate governments and one another.\n5rcb | New regulatory and governance approaches have raised a fascinating range of empirical questions, from the use of the audit as a compliance tool to the design and effectiveness of public/private and self-governing regulatory structures. This work resonates with research in behavioral law and economics, captured in Sunstein and Thaler's Nudge, which describes how regulators can creatively structure options to systematically influence behavior by means other than simple legal rules.\n524j | Because so much regulation is now conducted outside traditional bureaucratic frameworks (and indeed outside government), scholars working in this area begin with a generic definition of regulation and its constituent elements. \"Regulation\" is the \"sustained and focused attempt to alter the behaviour of others according to defined standards or purposes in order to address a collective issue or resolve a collective problem.\" It uses a combination of basic strategies of control,\nxd3m | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health\n8qb6 | including standard setting, monitoring, and enforcement. The use of these strategies can be studied without regard to the particular mode through which the regulatory task is accomplished or what sort of entity is performing it. This analytic approach allows researchers both to better capture the regulatory role of actors outside traditional regulatory agencies-for example, the role of Mothers Against Driving Drunk in fostering stronger social norms condemning drunk driving-and to offer more creative approaches to regulation, as exemplified by Nudge and other works of behavioral law and economics.\nwkbn | Although research in regulation and governance has been limited in public health law, its applicability is clear. Public health services are provided by a diversity of public and private actors, and private entities play an important role in practicing and promoting standards of healthy behavior and health-promoting practices. We recognize that complex systems like health care cannot simply be managed by top-down rules but require the use of many flexible tools, like professional self-regulation, ethics, accreditation, collaborative and deliberative decision making, continuous quality improvement, and market incentives. Health governance around the world has been dramatically altered by the rise of new public/private hybrid institutions like the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; the enormous wealth of the Gates Foundation; and the consolidation of authority over national health, safety, and intellectual property law in the World Trade Organization. The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is a typical instance of the \"soft law\" approach, setting broad goals for national action but minimizing binding rules in favor of deliberation and flexibility. Legal scholarship has begun to explore the \"constitutional\" implications of these structural changes, but they have not been extensively investigated in public health law research.\nftfg | Intervention Studies\n7xi5 | Intervention studies evaluate the intended and incidental effects of legal interventions on health outcomes or key mediating factors that",
