Five allelic variations in VPS13C gene can lead to autosomal recessive, early-onset PD, primarily due to premature termination of VPS13C. Patients were noted with cardinal PD symptoms and extrapyramidal signs. Post-mortem studies revealed a-synuclein/ ubiquitin positive-Lewy bodies in the brain stem, limbic system, hippocampus, and cortical associative areas. A few studies reveal that VPS13 functions in the TGN-endosomal cycle, whereas recent discoveries have also located it on the outer mitochondrial membrane. In fact, siRNA-mediated silencing of VPS13C resulted in lower mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial fragmentation, increased respiratory rates, exacerbated Parkin-dependent mitophagy, and upregulation of Parkin in response to mitochondrial damage. A new study also revealed VPS13C's role in forming membrane contact sites and facilitating lipid transfer between the ER and mitochondria. This is noteworthy, considering lipid transfer's increasing recognition in disease pathogenesis.\n5sfj | Since lysosomes are the destination for most E-L system vesicles carrying a variety of cargos for degradation and recycling, dysfunction in any of its components results in lysosomal storage disorders, severely perturbing cellular homeostasis. A growing body of evidence suggests Lysosomal Storage Disorders increase risk for PD pathogenesis. Among them, Gaucher disease confers the greatest risk, where five to fifteen percent of GD patients or carriers develop PD later in life, to an extent where causal GBA mutations are the most common genetic risk factor for PD. GBA encodes glucocerebrosidase one, which facilitates breakdown of glucosylceramide into glucose and ceramide. In its absence, GlcCer accumulates and undergoes partial enzymatic deacylation to glucosylsphingosine and other more complex glycosphingolipids, which mediate disease pathogenesis. GBA is a relatively well studied E-L system gene with regards to PD, both in terms of post-mortem brains, clinical investigations, and basic research. Reduced Gcase1 activity in substantia nigra, putamen, and other brain areas of PD patients with GBA mutations have been noted along with GlcCer and glycosphingolipids accumulation. Interestingly, similar observations were made even in sporadic PD patients, suggesting an even broader role for GBA than just mutations and potentially involve epigenetic and environmental modifiers of GBA. Gcase1 levels decrease with aging, the major risk factor for PD, indicating GBA's possible role in lowering the nigral neurons' threshold to develop PD. Cognitive areas such as hippocampus, frontal cortex, and amygdala also showed relative decrease in GCase1 activity, along with a significant elevation of hippocampal glucosylsphingosine in sporadic cases. This correlates with a higher Lewy body burden identified in the hippocampus and medial temporal regions, as well as a diffused cortical Lewy body pathology in GBA-linked PD. These pathological observations strengthen clinical findings that cognitive deterioration is severe in PD patients with GBA mutations compared to that of sporadic cases. These features indicate mouse models of\nvk4h | PD with GBA mutations are important in studying lipid dyshomeostasis and understand mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction in PD.\nnsm3 | A recent study provides evidence for an association between loss of Gcase1 activity, glycosphingolipids accumulation, and a-synuclein aggregation, both in vitro and in vivo models of Gba mutation. Glucosylsphingosine was shown to promote pathological a-synuclein aggregates, capable for further self-templating, was shown to accumulate in the brains of young homozygous Gba mutant and KO mice, implicating this glycosphingolipid in PD pathogenesis. Even in heterozygous Gba mutations, the Gcase1 activity decreased with age to an extent where mice reached threshold for haploinsufficiency, mimicking the human condition. Furthermore, the Gba mutant mice, when crossed with well-characterized a-synuclein transgenic PD mice, revealed accelerated PD progression including a-synuclein aggregation and motor deficits. a-Synuclein aggregation has also been seen in human iPSCs derived neurons from GD and PD patients that are exposed to Gcase1 inhibitors, and in those carrying GBA mutations. Mutations in GBA also cause misprocessing of Gcase1 in the ER, leading to ER retention of Gcase1. This produces ER stress and auto-lysosomal perturbations causing an abnormal lipid profile and increased a-synuclein accumulation and secretion. This study along with a few other observations suggest dopaminergic dysfunction due to gain-of-function mutations in Gba. However, therapeutic strategies based on loss-of-function observations have been successful, arguing against a gain of function model. Activation of residual Gcase1 by small molecules and chaperones and ameliorating glycosphingolipid accumulation by inhibiting GlcCer synthase lowered a- synuclein pathology and reinstated lysosomal health. These strategies are already being tested in clinics.\n```",
