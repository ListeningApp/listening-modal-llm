You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

nsm3 | The surface expression of hydrothermal precipitates cov- ers ~77,000 m2, including ~ 13,800 m2 of active chimneys and mounds, 51,800 m2 of inactive chimneys and mounds, and 9,300 m2 of partially buried chimneys and mounds (Fig. 2). Areas of low-temperature venting, dominated by Fe and Mn oxides, occur over an additional 130,000 m2 (91,000 m2 of Fe oxides and 38,000 m2 of Mn oxides), although these areas commonly overlap those of the chimneys and mounds. The area of subseafloor sulfide mineralization is not completely known, so the full size of the deposit could be much larger. The areal extent of this deposit is significant compared to others discovered along mid-ocean ridges and along arcs and back-arc basins; fewer than 10% have dimensions larger than 5,000 m2 (Hannington et al., 2010). Modern sulfide deposits with comparable sizes (by area) include the Solwara 1 deposit in the Eastern Manus basin (90,000 m2) and the Mir zone, Ashadze-1, and Ashadze-2 deposits on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (50,000 m2 each) (Hannington et al., 2010, 2011). It should be emphasized, however, that the large areal footprint of the Tinakula deposit may not necessarily correlate with a large tonnage of massive sulfide.
jdfw | Methods
uc9r | Ship-based multibeam bathymetry operating at 50 kHz (RESON SeaBat 8160) was collected over 685.6 km2 in the Starfish-Tinakula area, and the data were gridded with a cell size of 50 m. Higher-resolution bathymetry was collected over ~2.2 km2 that includes the Tinakula deposit, using an ROV-mounted multibeam system (RESON SeaBat 7125- ROV2 at 400 kHz with inertial navigation) and gridded with a cell size of 0.2 m. Bottom observations and grab samples were collected during 13 ROV dives. Shallow seafloor drilling,
l0ap | including push-coring and rotary diamond drilling, was car- ried out using the Benthic Geotech portable remotely oper- ated drill PROD-3. Approximately 270 m of drill core was logged and sampled to establish between-hole correlations along the length of the NS-trending eruptive fissure (sites A-D; Fig. 2; App. Figs. A2-A18). Mineralogical and chemi- cal data are reported here on 41 ROV grab samples and 21 drill core samples of chimney and mound material and on 61 drill core samples of clay-altered volcaniclastic rocks. Pol- ished thin sections of the sulfide-sulfate chimney samples and epoxy-impregnated clay-altered volcaniclastic samples were prepared by Dettmar Dissection Technology (Bochum,
x815 | Whole-rock geochemistry was determined on 45 bulk samples of sulfide-sulfate material and 47 samples of fine (<63 um) clay-altered volcaniclastic material at Activation Laboratories (Ontario, Canada). For the sulfide samples, a sodium peroxide fusion was used; major elements (Al, Ca, K, Mg, P, Si, Ti) were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma- optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and trace elements
epbj | (B, Ba, Be, Bi, Cd, Co, Cs, Cu, Ga, Ge, In, Li, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni, Pb, Rb, Sn, Sr, Ta, Th, U, V, W, Y, Zn, and rare earth ele- ments [REEs]) by inductively coupled plasma-mass spec- trometry (ICP-MS). For the clay-altered samples, a lithium metaborate/tetraborate fusion was used; the major elements (SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3(T), MnO, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O, TiO2, P205) were analyzed by ICP-OES, and trace elements (Ba, Be, Bi, Co, Cs, Ga, Ge, Hf, In, Mo, Nb, Rb, Sr, Ta, Th, Tl, U, V, W, Y, Zr, REEs) by ICP-MS, with additional elements (Ag, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) analyzed by ICP-OES following a total acid digestion technique. In both sample types, cold-vapor atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) was used to determine Hg; infrared (IR) detection was used to determine total S. Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) was used to determine Au, Ag, As, Ba, Br, Cr, Fe, Hf, Ir, Lu, Na, Sb,
nmn2 | Sc, and Zn in the sulfides and Au, As, Br, Cr, Ir, Sc, Se, and Sb in the clay-altered samples. Duplicates and standard ref- erence materials were analyzed after every 10 to 15 samples and indicated a precision of better than 10% and accuracy of better than 5% for most elements in samples where the ana- lytical values are well above the limit of detection, with values degrading rapidly as the limits of detection are approached.
g3tm | Sulfide mineral compositions were determined in 16 sul- fide-sulfate samples using a JEOL-JXA 8200 electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) equipped with five wavelength dis- persive spectrometers and one energy dispersive detector at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel. A 15-keV accelerating potential and 50-nA probe (cup) cur- rent were used for the analyses. Standards used were chalco- pyrite (FeKa, SKa, CuKa), rhodonite (MnKa) gallium arsenide
tfra | (GaLa, AsKB), sphalerite (ZnKa), silver telluride (AgLa), indium antimonide (InLa, SbLa), cadmium sulfide (CdLa), gold (AuLa), cinnabar (HgMa), and galena (PbMa).
5lm9 | Alteration mineralogy was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of bulk samples of the altered footwall rocks. Fine (<63 um) and coarse (>63 um) fractions were separated by wet sieving, followed by separation into silt (2-63 um) and clay (<2 um) by settling in cylinders of standing water, fol- lowing the technique of Moore and Reynolds (1997). The mineralogy of the <2-um clay fraction from 58 samples was determined using a Philips PW 1710 X-ray diffractometer, equipped with a Co tube and an automatic divergence slit and monochromator, located at GEOMAR. Operating conditions were 40 kV and 35 mA. Oriented mounts were prepared by wet suspension followed by air drying and were measured with a 20 scanning angle of 3º to 40° at a scan rate of 1 s per 0.01° step. Samples were then saturated with ethylene glycol following a standard vaporization technique and reanalyzed. MacDiff v.4.2.6 software was used for mineral identification and display of the XRD data.
