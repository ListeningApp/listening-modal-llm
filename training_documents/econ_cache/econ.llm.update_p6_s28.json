        "content": "colo | Interestingly, the income of taxpayers who were already in the top one percent in two thousand five grew much less than the income of all top-income taxpayers together: the average growth rate of income over the ten years for the panel was one point four percent compared to three point eight percent for all taxpayers in the top group. This may imply that the rapid income growth in the top group has primarily been driven by the growth in the incomes of new entrants (including young professionals) to the top income levels, i.e., the 'newly rich'.\nd6r4 | Why did top incomes grow so rapidly?\n9mrz | One clue is the high growth of income from capital among the top percentiles. While the economy grew by almost four percent on average per year between two thousand three and two thousand fifteen, income from share options grew at an astonishing ten to fifteen percent for the richest five percent. Between two thousand eleven and two thousand fourteen alone, the tax data show that income from capital grew annually by ten to twenty percent for this group. Indeed, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange All Share Index gave average annual real returns of nine percent between two thousand ten and two thousand fifteen.\npk06 | However, the labour-market income of those in the top percentiles also grew faster than the GNI. Atkinson and Piketty note global trends which have increased the incomes at the top of the labour market. These include the increased rewards for the top percentiles that result from globalisation, skills-biased technical change, and 'winner-take-all' pay-off structures in which a handful of 'superstar' individuals reap huge rewards even if they're only slightly better at what they do than those just below the top.\n7wn9 | Concluding thoughts\nwcd0 | We present new evidence of alarmingly high growth in the incomes of the top percentiles - more than twice the growth rate of national income. First, this establishes that growth has not been inclusive. The gap between the stagnant middle and the prosperous top earners widened, and this continued after the two thousand eight recession. Secondly, the divergence appears to be partly driven by high returns to capital. This relates to Piketty's argument that, if the ownership and use of capital are insufficiently regulated, productive labour is discouraged while rent-seeking and political instability are encouraged. Indeed, there may be a relationship between the trends recorded in this paper and the apparent occurrence of 'state capture' in recent years.\ncaos | High growth rates of income from capital are likely to be closely related to high levels of wealth (and thus wealth inequality). We suggest that, similar to the situation in top incomes, wealth has been severely underestimated. For example, while Credit Suisse estimates there are forty-five thousand dollar millionaires in South Africa, back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest there may be as many\nqrvy | as one hundred eighty-two thousand dollar millionaires in the country. The legacies and structures of the historical wealth distribution, designed under colonialism and apartheid to benefit a small white elite to the exclusion of the black majority, remain deeply relevant for South Africa's economic growth trajectories.",
