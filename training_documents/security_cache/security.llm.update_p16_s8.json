        "content": "9uwy | There are two organizations that are widely recognized to have integrated best-practice security and risk management into every aspect of their wider management operations, one dealing with the issue of normal, daily low impact high-likelihood scenarios, and the other dealing with potentially more serious low-likelihood-high impact threats.\nsrly | The first is Disney World, which has created a self-contained Kingdom within which one of the main selling points for potential visitors is its safety. Although Disney World is designed to deal with a massive amount of people with the freedom to choose to do a massive amount of different activities, the underlying management system is one based on total control of their territory, so that once you are inside Disney World you are actually experiencing a totally managed experience. The second organization is El Al, the Israeli national airline, which since the first political hijacking of a plane on twenty-first June nineteen sixty-seven of an El Al plane from Rome to Tel Aviv airport (following the end of the Six-Day War), has maintained security in its airports and planes across the world for forty-five years. Despite a couple of notable exceptions, specifically the killing of twenty-six people in an attack on Lod Airport (now Ben Gurion) in nineteen seventy-two by members of the Lebanese-trained Japan Red Army, El Al is still considered as perhaps the most effective security management system in the world, and its methodologies are widely accepted as setting the benchmark for securing mass access public areas. Although Disney World and El Al are seemingly faced with radically different threats, the methods they have devised to manage them are remarkably similar.\ndl6i | The first concept common to both systems is Territory. Territory is that space over which you have control, and for which you take responsibility. For both Disney World and El Al, their territory begins a long way before you reach any actual buildings. In Orlando, Florida, there are signs welcoming you to Disney World from thirty miles away, telling you what documents you will need, informing you of what attractions are available, telling you what radio station to tune to for Disney World information. In Israel's Ben Gurion airport, the first check points are two kilometers from the actual airport, and are designed to give you the positive feeling that you are entering a safe zone, one where possible threats and problems have been identified and effectively mitigated. This First Point of Contact has two purposes. The first is to clearly mark the territory where you accept responsibility for creating and managing a safe space. The second is to allow the First Point of Contact to act as an initial filtering system, allowing the initial security team to identify people who will not move through the system smoothly, who can then be taken to the side and dealt with on an individual basis, without disrupting the main flow of business.\n89ub | The concept of Control of Territory is continued once the visitor is 'inside'. There is nowhere within Disney World, or within an Israeli airport or airline section, that is not under the control of someone who has the specific responsibility for maintaining the safety of that area. One writer told how his daughter developed a blister during a visit to Disney World and removed her shoes and socks. She was immediately identified and confronted. When told that this was not allowed 'for the safety of visitors', and that failure to replace her footwear would result in them being escorted from the grounds, she decided that she would undergo the pain in order to be allowed to remain within the funfair.\ndhle | The second concept common to both organizations is the fact that 'Everyone is involved in security'. It is reasonable to presume that a small security team cannot maintain control and 'eyes on' to every possible situation that might develop. However, if everyone within the organization is security aware, then the likelihood is that someone will become aware of a potential problem before it escalates into an actual threat, and that information can be passed on to the security team, who can then intervene in the most appropriate manner. This is not only relevant to traditional security threats but is valid for any actions that could threaten the organization. Although it seems that this is a simple principle, you only need to read the papers each day to see how organizations are putting themselves into danger because simple problems are allowed to develop into major threats, because although people are aware of them, no one has taken the responsibility to inform someone in authority.\n2nib | The third principle of security management that both systems are based on is that of 'Tight Management'. Writing security manuals and lists of protocols is easy. Delivering and maintaining them at an effective level over time is almost impossible. The truth is that most security programs fail because the policies that have been put into place are not adhered to, and then a culture of laziness or ignorance becomes embedded into the organization. Both of the organizations discussed here have a very strong management system in place, so that there is a clearly-defined organizational culture that security management is important, everyone understands what they have to do, and control systems are in place to ensure that they do so. If you want to test the system, drop a chewing gum wrapper on the floor at Disney World and see how long it takes for someone to pick it up, and then inform you that littering is not allowed.\nnaev | The question therefore, is how can we adapt the lessons learned from these global security leaders, and introduce these highly effective security management models into our own organizations? Here are some of the basic security concepts that are common to both Disney World and El Al, and which can be easily applied to any operational situation.\n7h0h | Five point two Principle one: Territory: Security in Depth\na64c | Territory is not just 'Space'. For example, if you were the manager of a factory with an attached car park, but you had no information about what was happening within that car-park, it could not be considered your 'Territory'. Even if you had information about the car-park - for example, through use of CCTV monitored from a central Control Room - but could only observe what was happening without being able to do anything about it, you would still not be able to consider that area your territory. So, one definition of Territory is 'that area over which you have both information and control'.\ngi7n | Once the concept of Territory as a function of information and control is accepted, the next question concerns exactly where our territory starts. This is a critical question in the process of developing an effective security management capability.\n3pn1 | Territory is defined by a Boundary. This is where the First Point of Contact is made. Access Control allows easy entry to that territory for those who pose no problem, and gives the security system the opportunity to identify potential problems before they are able to make an approach to higher-risk areas deeper within the system.\nwjuz | Any Territory is defined by Boundaries. It should be clear to anyone coming into your territory that they are now coming under your control - though that should be done in a friendly, welcoming way, rather than an officious, impersonal way. The Boundary is marked by the First Point of Contact. Although the First Point of Contact might be overtly security-based, as in a government building or military base, depending on the general threat environment it can also be seen in terms of 'Meet and Greet'. This form of security as 'customer care' can be seen in hundreds of different situations where security managers want to clearly mark the beginning of their territory, such as bars, where there is a Door Supervisor outside the door, five-star hotels, where there is a doorman waiting to greet you, corporate headquarters, where there are security personnel who will show you to the reception desk, or shopping centers, where there are (or at least, should be!) security personnel at the main entrance.\n3yxv | There is always a balance between Freedom and Security. One way that we can calibrate the level of security is the distance between the First Point of Contact and the thing that we are securing, and the number of barriers you need to pass to get there. As a basic rule, the greater the distance between the First Point of Contact and the target, and the greater the number of barriers, the safer you are.",
