You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

cp13 | For all phages, calculated Ka vary for different assumed complex stoichiometries. For the 1:1 stoichiometry, Ka values are the lowest (highest affinity). Then, they rise for bivalent receptors and slightly decrease for pentavalent. The M13 phages usually have three to five copies of the pIII protein.25 Therefore, the expected valency is between 2 to 5. For every variant, the difference between Ka calculated under the receptor's mono- and bi-valency assumption is higher than the difference between the 1:2 and 1:5 stoichiometries. It suggests that the accurate stoichiometry is closer to 1:2 or 1:5 than to 1:1. The determined values are very low compared to typical Ka for immunological complexes. However, the presented method requires working under similar concen- trations of M13 and TnT. The linear range of concentrations obtained for phages using k-ELISA was in the picomolar range; therefore, TnT concentration also had to be picomolar. A significant disadvantage of this method is that phage titer biologically measured may differ from the real physical concentration of phage particles in solution measured during ELISA.54,55 In the biological method, phages are only detected if they can infect bacteria and induce dye (x-gal) metabolism to a blue product. In solution, phages may form aggregates that produce false low phage titers from biological assays. For A3, B7, and D11 clones, values of Ka are in a similar range which does not correlate with their distribution in the recovered pool (Table 2). This fact may be explained by the varied rate of
bgre | phages' amplification in bacteria culture caused by the different proportions of amino acids in peptides and the possible interaction of peptides with bacterial proteins. The same explanation is suggested by the manufacturer of the Ph.D .- 12 kit as justification for advising against the amplification of phage-displayed peptide libraries. For the wild-type M13, it was impossible to calculate a <LATEX>K _ { d }</LATEX> that may have a physical sense (calculated <LATEX>K _ { d }</LATEX> values were negative), which shows that the model may be applied only for specific interactions.
57lp | If a phage is treated as monovalent, the measured <LATEX>K _ { d }</LATEX> does not refer to the thermodynamical strength of single peptide- TnT interactions. However, the resultant affinity (strength of single interaction) and valency (number of binding sites per particle) are known in immunology as avidity. 43,56,57 Avidities are most significant for IgM antibodies that consist of five subunits presenting two antigen-binding domains on each one. As a result, a single IgM antibody can theoretically bind ten epitopes, causing 1:10 antibody-ligand complex stoichiom- etry. Moreover, bivalent IgG antibodies' <LATEX>K _ { d }</LATEX> is affected by non- monovalency in the same manner. Due to avidity's different nature, compared to affinity, a relative dissociation constant maybe <LATEX>1 0 ^ { 2 }</LATEX> to <LATEX>1 0 ^ { 4 }</LATEX> lower than a single paratope-epitope <LATEX>K _ { d }</LATEX> However, in several publications, 16-18 <LATEX>K _ { d }</LATEX> was calculated without correction for non-monovalency of the antigen- binding particle (e.g., phage). One should be aware that the <LATEX>K _ { d }</LATEX> calculated from ELISA in these papers is more avidity than affinity.
ukth | Several minor modifications of the presented method may be considered to improve the accuracy of <LATEX>K _ { d }</LATEX> determination via ELISA. Limitation of non-specific interaction between phage particles and plate/surface-immobilized proteins and revision of phage concentration measurement would be the most significant improvements. However, the proposed mathemat- ical interpretation of interactions between polyvalent receptors sheds new light on the field of affinity determination in phage- peptide systems, similar to the theory presented by the previous authors."" The presented model was compared with empirical results that confirm the hypothesis about the mixed valency of phage particles depending on the number of pIII. Studies on peptide-protein complex formation and dissociation in other experimental systems may be discussed in a separate paper to provide comprehensiveness of the field of <LATEX>K _ { d }</LATEX> determination in biochemical sciences.
kpvt | The described method consumes low amounts of a target protein. Moreover, the phage material is easily amplified in bacteria culture. Owing to this, the presented assay is very suitable and valuable for research aimed at developing new high-affinity protein-specific receptors. The identified TnT- specific peptides might also find applications in research, especially connected with heart and cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, we anticipate that the selected TnT binding phages or peptides can be used to optimize a sensing layer toward implementing this concept for detecting the markers of cardiovascular diseases and transferring them into feasible applications in clinical diagnostics. The applied method may also cover other systems where monovalent molecules interact with multiple active sites of the receptor-like natural antibod- ies.
