        "content": "0myz | We found that Xpert was one hundred percent sensitive for MTB detection in stool among children with microbiological confirmation from a respiratory specimen and fifty percent sensitive in children with microbiologically and/or clinically diagnosed TB. Other studies conducted in Ethiopia, Kenya and Pakistan have also reported excellent sensitivity ranging from eighty-eight point nine percent to one hundred percent.\nxh3i | Xpert MTB slash RIF for the diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis\nsyiw | Table three. Diagnostic performance of GA Xpert and stool Xpert using culture as a reference standard.\nkg3t | of stool Xpert compared to gastric aspirate culture. The lower sensitivity of stool Xpert compared to CRS, microbiological and/or clinically confirmed TB, is possibly due to the presence of paucibacillary disease in patients clinically diagnosed for TB.\nlvae | The specificity of stool Xpert in our study when compared to culture was consistent with other previous studies conducted in Ethiopia, South Africa and Egypt which have demonstrated specificities ranging from ninety-nine point three to ninety-nine point seven percent. The specificity of stool Xpert in our study when compared to CRS was similar with another study conducted in Pakistan. One culture negative gastric aspirate specimen was found to be positive on both stool and gastric aspirate Xpert tests. This may be due to the presence of non-viable bacilli during decontamination process of gastric aspirate specimen.\no9sc | In this study, stool Xpert identified all of the gastric aspirate Xpert positive cases, suggesting stool as a potential alternative for use to gastric aspirate in the routine diagnosis of PTB. Gastric aspiration may be used to retrieve pulmonary specimen from patients who cannot expectorate sputum but it is an invasive procedure and needs trained health workers. As a non-invasive sample, stool is considered to be safe, easy for collection and has the potential to be used for detection of MTB. Moreover, stool Xpert test is performed by simple stool testing protocol adapted from KNCV TB foundation, which omits some labor intensive steps such as homogenization, decontamination and centrifugation of stool specimen prior to Xpert testing done by other studies. This approach significantly reduces sample processing time, minimizes the workload on the laboratory personnel and also minimizes costs.\n121u | In our study, unfortunately, none of the clinically diagnosed TB cases were detected by stool Xpert. Poor performance of stool Xpert in the clinically diagnosed, microbiologically negative, children has also been reported in other studies. This could potentially indicate the limitation of the stool Xpert since patients with such clinically-diagnosed unconfirmed TB are more likely to have paucibacillary disease. Children with a high clinical probability of TB despite a negative stool Xpert should be started on ATT until better and more sensitive tools are available.\nzh03 | Older children are able to expectorate sputum and may produce more adult-type sputum. However, in our study, none of the expectorated sputum samples were positive for M. tuberculosis. This could be due to the poor sample quality in the expectorated sputum samples.\n1mvw | Table four.

The diagnostic performance of GA Xpert, stool Xpert and GA culture compared to CRS.\nxxr8 | However, we did not assess the quality of the sputum sample in the current study which might be taken as a limitation.\nrl4j | Our study has some limitations. We used small sample size due to resource constraints. An additional limitation of our study is the fact that we collected only single respiratory and stool specimen rather than successive specimens which could have probably increased the yield of the tests done.\nvz32 | Conclusion\nncb0 | The sensitivity of stool Xpert is comparable to that of gastric aspirate Xpert. Stool is a potential alternative to pulmonary specimen in the diagnosis of PTB in patients who cannot produce sputum. Moreover, stool collection is easier and relatively safe compared to pulmonary specimen and can be easily implemented at lowest level of health care system. However, the diagnostic yield of stool Xpert still requires further validation and optimization using larger sample size.\n8mp0 | Supporting information\nxjyk | S one Table.
