## One hundred thirty-one Endogenous affinity tags on the twenty S proteasome reveal that neuroproteasomes co-purify

One hundred thirty-three

One hundred thirty-four We sought to purify the neuroproteasome directly out of the mouse brain. Our attempts to do this out of wild-type tissue proved challenging due to lengthy preparations which caused low

One hundred thirty-five

One hundred thirty-six yields. To circumvent this, we built a transgenic mouse line to endogenously tag the twenty S

One hundred thirty-seven proteasome for affinity purification. The proteasome is comprised of the twenty S catalytic core

One hundred thirty-eight particle which, as part of the ubiquitin-dependent degradation system, can be terminally

One hundred thirty-nine associated with either one or two nineteen S regulatory particles, referred to as the twenty-six S or

One hundred forty-one stacked heptameric rings: the outer alpha subunit rings which gate substrate entry and the inner

One hundred forty-two rings which contain the catalytic beta subunits. The nineteen S caps contain subunits to bind

One hundred forty-three ubiquitylated substrates and ATPases to unfold said substrates into the twenty S core. Therefore,

One hundred forty-four modifying the twenty S with affinity tags allows us to isolate any complex containing the core

One hundred forty-five proteasome, such as free twenty S, singly-capped twenty-six S, doubly-capped thirty S proteasomes, or the

One hundred forty-six neuroproteasome. We modified the C-termini of nearly every core proteasome subunit with

One hundred forty-seven either six X-His or Strep-Two tags and screened out constructs based on low expression and

One hundred forty-eight interference with proteasome function. Of the remaining two constructs, we found that

One hundred forty-nine only the C-terminal modification of Psma three was compatible with proper proteasome assembly

One hundred fifty and function and did not adversely affect cell health. Based on these data, we

One hundred fifty-one generated a twenty S-FLAG transgenic line by adding flanking loxP sites surrounding the final exon

One hundred fifty-two exon eleven of the Psma three gene followed by the same sequence with a linker containing a three X-

One hundred fifty-three FLAG tag. By crossing twenty S-FLAG transgenic mice with a line expressing Cre

One hundred fifty-four recombinase driven by the pan-neuronal Actlb six (BAF fifty-three b) promoter, we generated mice that

One hundred fifty-five expressed FLAG-tagged proteasomes selectively in neurons. Brains from twenty S-

One hundred fifty-six FLAG/BAF fifty-three b-Cre mice and Cre-only littermate controls were processed and FLAG-tagged

One hundred fifty-eight simultaneously, twenty-six S proteasomes were isolated using the GST-UBL affinity isolation

One hundred sixty method and all samples were immunoblotted using antibodies raised against multiple nineteen S

One hundred fifty-nine

One hundred sixty-one and twenty S subunits. We find that the FLAG tag is incorporated into the proteasome and we fail to detect any FLAG in the Cre-only littermate controls.

One hundred sixty-two

One hundred sixty-three We next measured the catalytic activity of the FLAG-tagged proteasome compared to

One hundred sixty-four unmodified proteasomes by monitoring the cleavage of a model substrate, Suc-LLVY-AMC.

One hundred sixty-five An increase in fluorescence reflects the proteasome-dependent cleavage of this LLVY substrate

One hundred sixty-six which mobilizes the free fluorescence of AMC. We find that the catalytic activity of isolated twenty-six S

One hundred sixty-seven proteasomes from mice expressing twenty S-FLAG are indistinguishable from the unmodified

One hundred sixty-eight proteasomes isolated from controls. We find that FLAG affinity purified proteasomes

One hundred sixty-nine are catalytically identical to twenty-six S affinity purified proteasomes. We fail to detect FLAG

One hundred seventy expression in the livers from twenty S-FLAG/Baf fifty-three b-Cre mice, nor can we affinity isolate

One hundred seventy-one proteasomes using the FLAG epitope handle from the liver, indicative of the selective and

One hundred seventy-four characterizations support the conclusion that epitope tagging of the twenty S with FLAG is inert and

One hundred seventy-five does not disrupt native proteasome function.

One hundred seventy-six

One hundred seventy-seven To test whether the twenty S-FLAG was efficiently incorporated into the neuroproteasome, we

One hundred seventy-eight performed surface biotinylation experiments out of both primary neurons and hippocampal tissue

One hundred seventy-nine from twenty S-FLAG transgenic mice. This is a well-established method for measuring

One hundred eighty neuroproteasome surface localization. Hippocampi from twenty S-FLAG/Baf fifty-three b-Cre mice

One hundred eighty-one were incubated with a cell-impermeable sulfonylated Biotin-NHS-Ester to label surface-exposed

One hundred eighty-two amines and surface proteins were pulled down on streptavidin beads. We observe strong FLAG

One hundred eighty-three expression in the surface fraction, indicating that the FLAG tag is incorporated into the one hundred eighty-four neuroproteasome. We fail to detect cytosolic proteins such as Actin in our surface one hundred eighty-five fraction, validating our surface-labeling approach, and fail to observe FLAG expression in twenty Sone hundred eighty-six FLAG mice without Cre. By blotting using an antibody which detects six of the seven one hundred eighty-seven alpha subunits of the twenty S proteasome including a seven, the subunit coded for by Psma3, we can one hundred eighty-eight clearly distinguish the modified a seven subunit overlaying with the FLAG signal, denoting one hundred eighty-nine modification of the endogenous protein. Next, we used surface biotinylation to assess if one hundred ninety our transgenic system was functional in primary cultures. Primary neurons from twenty S-FLAG mice one hundred ninety-one were cultured and transduced with AAVs to express Cre recombinase at days in vitro (DIV) two one hundred ninety-two and then processed for surface biotinylation at day in vitro fourteen. We did not detect FLAG

one hundred ninety-three without AAVs to express Cre, supporting our conclusion that the twenty S-FLAG transgene is

One hundred ninety-five.

One hundred ninety-six. Next, we purified FLAG-neuroproteasomes to determine their composition. First, we prepared one hundred ninety-seven plasma membranes from twenty S-FLAG/Baf fifty-three b-Cre brains and then gently extracted membrane one hundred ninety-eight proteins. We find our membrane preparations were enriched in membrane proteins such as one hundred ninety-nine GluR1 and depleted of cytosolic proteins like Actin. We affinity isolated FLAGtwo hundred neuroproteasomes from the membrane fraction as well as cytosolic FLAG-proteasomes and two hundred one subjected both to quantitative tandem mass tag-based mass spectrometry analysis. As expected,

two hundred two we find common signatures of twenty S subunits between both cytosolic proteasomes and two hundred three neuroproteasomes and a significant depletion of nineteen S subunits in the neuroproteasome isolations.

two hundred four This is consistent with a lack of cytosolic subunits in our membrane preparations and validates our previous findings. We identified sixty-four proteins enriched in the neuroproteasome isolations two hundred five two hundred seven glycoprotein, which we previously described, and a surprising and strong enrichment two hundred eight of ApoE and the ApoE receptor Lrp1. We do not observe other ApoE receptors, such as ApoER2, VLDLR, and LDLR in this analysis. We first validated these proteomic data by affinity isolating FLAG-neuroproteasomes as well as cytosolic FLAG-

## two hundred fifteen ApoE isoforms differentially modulate neuroproteasome surface localization in vivo

Two hundred sixteen.

two hundred seventeen ApoE can be expressed as one of three isoforms in human, ApoE4, ApoE3, and ApoE2, each of two hundred nineteen differentially modulate neuroproteasome localization and function. We obtained human ApoE

two hundred twenty isoform knock-in mice, where the entire coding region for the Apoe gene was replaced with two hundred twenty-one a cassette encoding the three human Apoe loci, generating a fully humanized ApoE protein.

two hundred twenty-two These mice therefore only express the ApoE2, ApoE3, or ApoE4 isoforms. hApoE-KI mice were two hundred twenty-three perfused and then hippocampus and primary motor cortex were microdissected and two hundred twenty-four subjected to surface biotinylation and immunoblotting. We chose a limited survey of regions two hundred twenty-five based on their differential susceptibility to accumulate pathological hallmarks of AD

two hundred twenty-six hippocampus greater than primary motor cortex. We found a strong reduction of neuroproteasome surface two hundred twenty-seven localization in the hippocampus of ApoE4-KI mice, compared to ApoE3-KIs or ApoE2-KIs,

two hundred twenty-eight measured by surface signal of twenty S subunit beta five. We observe a significant difference two hundred twenty-nine between ApoE3 male and female mice, where female ApoE3 mice have fifty percent fewer surfacetwo hundred thirty localized neuroproteasomes than male ApoE3 mice in hippocampus. We find this two hundred thirty-one noteworthy in the context of the extensive literature on the influence of biological sex on AD

two hundred thirty-two pathogenesis. When we monitor neuroproteasome localization in the primary motor cortex from the two hundred thirty-three hApoE-KI mice, we find that neuroproteasome surface localization in ApoE4-KIs is reduced two hundred thirty-four compared to ApoE2-KIs and we observe a trend, but no significant change in ApoE4-KI

two hundred thirty-five compared to ApoE3-KI. These data may be attributable to differences in ApoE

Given the region-specific effect of ApoE isoforms on neuroproteasome expression in vivo, we two hundred forty approached the effect of ApoE isoforms and ApoE receptors in a more defined and tractable two hundred forty-one primary neuronal culture system.

We chose this strategy because two hundred forty-seven because of detrimental effects on neuronal health following Lrp1 knockdown. We used a two hundred forty-eight variant of RAP which contains a stabilizing mutation to protect against pH-induced two hundred fifty receptors as well. We incubated primary neurons with purified stable RAP and two hundred fifty-one measured surface protein levels using surface biotinylation and immunoblotting. We find that stable RAP rapidly decreases the surface localization of Lrp1, as expected. We also

two hundred fifty-seven ApoE is a lipoprotein, and in the brain is thought to be released by glia in the lipid-bound two hundred fifty-eight form. We therefore next leveraged the primary culture system to determine two hundred fifty-nine whether extracellular ApoE could modulate neuroproteasome localization and if the lipidation of two hundred sixty-one transgenic animals or wild-type animals and conducted imaging and biochemical experiments to two hundred sixty-two measure neuroproteasome localization. We conjugated recombinant ApoE isoforms with a two hundred sixty-three mixture of POPC and Cholesterol and purified ApoE lipoproteins, referred to as

264 ApoE2, E3, and E4. These lipoproteins were validated by SEC and negative stain EM (Fig S2C)

Two hundred sixty-five and have been demonstrated to resemble the endogenous ApoE lipoproteins observed in the

Two hundred sixty-six brain. DIVthirteen primary neurons from twenty-S-FLAG transgenic mice were incubated with

Two hundred sixty-seven unconjugated or PC-conjugated ApoE for twenty-four hours and then subjected to surface biotinylation.

Two hundred sixty-eight We find that PC-ApoE, and not the unconjugated versions, modify neuroproteasome surface

Two hundred sixty-nine localization with the rank order PC-ApoEfour less than Vehicle, PC-ApoEthree less than PC-ApoEtwo. We find

Two hundred seventy no change in other membrane proteins such as GluNone, which has previously been shown not to

Twenty-seven change in an ApoE isoform-dependent manner. The lipoprotein-dependent effect on

Two hundred seventy-two neuroproteasome localization requires ApoE, as the addition of just the liposomes without ApoE

Two hundred seventy-seven FLAG-neuroproteasomes are a useful tool to measure the surface localization of

Two hundred seventy-nine modified the subcellular distribution and localization of neuroproteasomes in intact neurons. We

Two hundred eighty used antibody feeding onto live neuronal cultures from the twenty-S-FLAG mice transduced with

Two hundred eighty-one AAVs to express Cre. No staining was observed using secondary alone controls or when feeding an antibody against intracellular protein MAPtwo. After live cell

Two hundred eighty-five neuroproteasome localization, we observed punctal neuroproteasome localization

Two hundred eighty-seven signal. We observe significant overlap of surface FLAG signal with MAPtwo-positive protrusions that resemble dendritic spines. We observe that PC-ApoEtwo increases neuroproteasome surface localization by nearly twofold and that PC-ApoEfour reduces neuroproteasome surface

Two hundred ninety localization by nearly threefold compared to PC vehicle or PC-ApoEthree controls. In total,

Two hundred ninety-seven We next tested whether ApoE-dependent mislocalization of neuroproteasomes is observable in

Two hundred ninety-nine from the Massachusetts General Hospital Brain Bank. The ApoEthree/three

Three hundred subgroup was subdivided into five negative diagnoses and nine positive diagnoses for Alzheimer's Disease. Sex was

Three hundred one evenly distributed in samples except for the ApoEfour cases which were all male. This design

Three hundred two allows us to compare the effect of Alzheimer's Disease on neuroproteasome localization as well as the effect of

Three hundred three ApoE genotype on neuroproteasome localization. We obtained material from the Brodmann Area

Three hundred four

Three hundred six

Three hundred seven contained severe tangle and amyloid pathology as well as neuronal loss whereas tissue from Brodmann Area four

Three hundred eight had moderate amyloid pathology but not tangle accumulation or neuronal loss. For simplicity,

Three hundred nine we will refer to Brodmann Area seven as tissue with severe pathology and Brodmann Area four as tissue with mild pathology. We

Three hundred ten fractionated these samples to remove nuclei, mitochondria, and cytosol, enriching for plasma

Three hundred twelve membranes and detergent-insoluble proteins. We monitored the success of our fractionation

Three hundred eleven using LLVY-based proteasome activity assays out of the supernatant of our washes and

Three hundred thirteen continued washing our plasma membrane preparations until cytosolic proteasomes were undetectable.

Three hundred fourteen

Three hundred fifteen

Three hundred sixteen We then subjected plasma membrane/aggregate fractions to quantitative TMT proteomics

Three hundred seventeen analysis. TMT proteomics enables unbiased quantification of the proteome and the ability to

Three hundred eighteen make quantitative comparison across samples. We compensated for brain region and individual

Three hundred nineteen variability in two ways: by first normalizing protein loading into the mass spectrometer and then

Three hundred twenty normalizing the collected data against the total TMT signal per patient sample. This total TMT

Three hundred twenty-one signal normalization provides the highest confidence metric for protein abundance normalization

Three hundred twenty-two across all samples. Given the number of samples, we combined three TMTpro sixteen-plex

Three hundred twenty-three experiments with a shared internal standard which enabled quantitation across TMT experiments.

Three hundred twenty-four We first performed a series of quality control checks to ensure that these data provided reliable

Three hundred twenty-five and reproducible measures. First, these data validate our plasma membrane enrichment protocol

Three hundred twenty-eight

Three hundred twenty-nine AnxAone, Gpnmb, and Tau in Alzheimer's Disease brains compared to unaffected controls.

Three hundred thirty we also find a significant decrease in Vgf and SlcthirtyAthree consistent with

Three hundred thirty-four

Three hundred thirty-five. After validating our approach, we next analyzed the effect of AD on neuroproteasome localization, measured by the relative quantity of twenty S proteasome subunits in our quantitative mass spectrometry dataset. First, in comparing AD samples to cognitively normal controls, we find a striking reduction in nearly every twenty S proteasome subunit in the plasma membrane fraction from BA seven tissue. We next sought to determine whether ApoE

genotype influenced neuroproteasome localization in human tissue. Given the significant effect of AD on neuroproteasome localization, we constrained the analysis only to the effect of ApoE

ApoE three/three AD cohort. We observe a clear trend of reduced twenty S proteasome subunits in the membrane fraction in the ApoE four genotype compared to ApoE three genotype in the BA seven vulnerable

Three hundred forty-six

To validate our proteomics data, we monitored surface localization of neuroproteasomes by immunoblot analysis. We controlled for sample loading by normalizing against Kv one point two, a protein whose expression has been reproducibly demonstrated as unchanged in the AD brain.

While this strategy is required for loading controls by immunoblot, these loading controls line up with the normalization strategy for mass spectrometry based on the total amount of TMT signal from each sample. First, we validate our proteomics data and find a twofold reduction of neuroproteasome surface expression in AD patients compared to controls in the BA seven region.

Moreover, we find a statistically significant reduction in neuroproteasome localization from ApoE four/four tissue compared to ApoE three/three unaffected tissue. In contrast, we do not observe

ApoE-isoform dependent changes we observe are specific to neuroproteasome localization and not a change in cytosolic proteasome levels. We find changes in Lrp one concordant with that observed with neuroproteasomes. However, given the strong effect of AD pathology on the global proteome (as well as on neuroproteasome localization), we next used the BA four tissue to understand how ApoE isoforms could influence neuroproteasome localization with mild

AD pathology.

In BA four tissue, unlike BA seven, we find comparable surface localization of neuroproteasomes between patients with and without AD. However, once stratified by ApoE genotype, we find that ApoE four/four patients have a nearly fifty percent reduction in surface localization of neuroproteasome compared with ApoE three/three patients. Both of these conclusions are supported by analysis of proteasome subunits from unbiased proteomics datasets from BA four tissue. Consistent with these observations, using LLVY degradation experiments to measure the catalytic activity of the proteasome, we found a significant reduction in neuroproteasome activity in AD samples compared to unaffected controls and no change in cytosolic proteasome activity. This demonstrates that ApoE four can influence neuroproteasome localization in areas with mild AD pathology. Taken together, we make two conclusions based on these data: one, that neuroproteasome localization is reduced in brain regions which have increased susceptibility to AD pathology and two, that ApoE four reduces neuroproteasome localization compared to ApoE three.

Quantitative proteomics reveals that selective inhibition of neuroproteasomes induces

What is the consequence of ApoE four-dependent reduction in neuroproteasome function, or more broadly, any reduction in neuroproteasome function? The most straightforward way to address this question is to leverage neuroproteasome-specific inhibitors. We previously accomplished neuroproteasome-specific inhibition using Biotin-Epoxomicin: an analog of the covalent and highly selective proteasome inhibitor Epoxomicin with an N-terminal Biotin moiety. This small modification renders Biotin-Epoxomicin cell-impermeable for up to an hour and does not change the selectivity or potency of Epoxomicin. While time-limited, this approach found that generally, neuroproteasome substrates are co- or peri-translationally degraded and that flux of Biotin-Epoxomicin was not a usable tool to assess broad physiological functions of neuroproteasomes because the timescale was far too short and could not be used in vivo.

Based on principles of drug design, we considered that introducing a longer PEG linker between

Epoxomicin because it leverages the unique chemistry of the catalytic threonines of the proteasome - the alpha-amino group of the threonine opens the epoxide of Epoxomicin which forms not have alpha-amino groups, which is the principle that renders Epoxomicin completely specific both against its target and relative to other proteasome inhibitors. These advantages explain why dozens of analogs of Epoxomicin have been made to the N-terminus without altering the specificity of the drug against the proteasome: no off-target effects of Epoxomicin or its analogs have been found in the two decades since its discovery. We synthesized clickable analogs of Epoxomicin (Azide-Epoxomicin) that would allow us to append a broad range of

All molecules were HPLC-purified as single peaks and confirmed by LC/MS

We next tested the potency and selectivity of iBEp relative to Epoxomicin. Epoxomicin covalently and irreversibly binds the catalytic beta subunits of the proteasome - therefore, the biotin moiety on iBEp serves as a tracer to detect whether proteasomes are inhibited by monitoring proteins from iBEp-treated neurons, corresponding to the three catalytic subunits of the proteasome. Therefore, we demonstrate that the iBEp linker does not modify the high modification of the non-reactive end of Epoxomicin has been shown not to change the selectivity

Four hundred eighteen of Epoxomicin for the proteasome. While iBEp is still highly active against the proteasome, we do find that the Biotin-PEG twenty-four linker moderately reduces the efficacy of iBEp relative to Epoxomicin. We therefore chose doses of inhibitor where the effective concentration of the inhibitor was similar to previous studies using Epoxomicin alone and well within the acceptable range of efficacy given how potent Epoxomicin is as a proteasome inhibitor.

To test the permeability of our compounds, we incubated primary cortical neurons with iBEp over a time course and prepared both cytosolic and plasma membrane-enriched fractions.

Samples were immunoblotted and probed for cytosolic marker Actin and membrane protein GluR One to validate our fractionation. We found specific biotin signal corresponding to covalent inhibition of the proteasome by iBEp only in the membrane fraction, and not in the cytosol, over a twenty-four hour incubation in primary neurons. As an orthogonal measure of cell penetrance, we tested whether the activity of cytosolic proteasomes was affected by iBEp treatment. We subjected cytosolic and membrane fractions from iBEp-treated neurons to LLVYbased proteasome activity assays. Cytosolic proteasome activity remains completely intact from iBEp-treated neurons compared to DMSO controls, but proteasome activity in the membrane

To further validate our neuroproteasome-specific inhibitors, we sought a cellular functional readout of whether our cell-impermeant inhibitors affected cytosolic proteasomes. One of the most penetrant and robust consequences of total proteasome inhibition is the induction of autophagy as a cellular response mechanism to compensate for the lack of proteasomal degradation. To test this, we assayed three autophagy markers, p sixty-two levels,

LC3bI/II ratios, and Ulk One levels. Each are robust markers of different steps of autophagy. p sixty-two has been demonstrated to be rapidly induced upon proteasome inhibition and LC3bI/II induction is thought to be slower, while Ulk One is important for early phagosome formation. Cytosolic proteasome inhibition has been reproducibly demonstrated to induce a strong increase in p sixty-two

One important advantage of iBEp is the ability to use over extended timecourses, a property

459 provide some explanatory power for how neuroproteasome dysfunction (driven by ApoE4 or

460 other mechanisms) could underlie deficits in proteostasis with potential relevance for

46 neurodegenerative disorders. We incubated DIV12-14 primary cortical neurons with cell-

462 impermeable proteasome inhibitors in biological duplicate for 1 and 6 hours, prepared sarkosyl-

463 soluble and sarkosyl-insoluble samples, and then collected and processed samples for

464 quantitative TMT-based proteomics (Fig 4E). We first analyzed proteins which increase over the

465 time-course in the soluble fraction. We recapitulate our previously published data and find that

466 neuroproteasome inhibition induces the accumulation of previously reported neuroproteasome

467 substrates such as Rgs4, c-Fos, Sox4, Snurf, Arc, and Bex2 in the soluble fraction (Fig 4F, G,

468 Table S3)(4). Importantly, we also do not see accumulation of classical ubiquitin-proteasome

469 substrates such as PSD-95, Homer1, or GKAP(94-96) (Fig 4G). We also fail to observe an

470 increase in p62, LC3b, GabarapL1, or any other marker of autophagy(1, 97) (Fig 4G). This

471 provides orthogonal evidence that iBEp does not detectably penetrate cells and demonstrates the 472 validity of this approach to determine the consequences of selective neuroproteasome inhibition.

473 These validate our previous data identifying neuroproteasome substrates(4) and extend them by

474 demonstrating neuroproteasome-dependent substrate turnover in a context without modulating 475 neuronal activity and over extended periods of time.

Next, our quantitative proteomics analysis revealed a selective pattern of protein insolubility following neuroproteasome inhibition. We find that only fifty-two proteins become sarkosyl-insoluble in response to neuroproteasome inhibition, in contrast with over two hundred fifty proteins increasing in the soluble fraction. To narrow in on this list, we quantitated which proteins show a greater than log-fold change in the insoluble fraction, but showed no change in the soluble fraction. This analysis identified only four proteins which show significant increases in the insoluble fraction relative to the soluble fraction: Ckmt1, Tau, Taf15, and

Hspb1 and one protein which significantly increases in the soluble fraction and showed no change in the insoluble fraction, Plk2. Of note, Taf15 has previously been observed in detergent-insoluble fractions of brains from Alzheimer's patients, correlated with both Amyloid

Beta and Tau insolubility. Ckmt1 has also been found in neurofibrillary tangles and interacting with phosphorylated Tau inclusions.

Neuroproteasomes are differentially regulated by ApoE isoforms to determine formation of endogenous sarkosyl-insoluble Tau inclusions.

Our findings raise the intriguing possibility that a fraction of endogenous mouse Tau becomes sarkosyl-insoluble following neuroproteasome inhibition. We sought to validate these findings by immunoblot and extend them to determine if the same principle would hold for human Tau isoforms, without pathogenic and aggregation-driving mutations. We therefore cultured primary mouse cortical neurons from either wild-type or hTau-KI mice. The entire mouse Mapt sequence is replaced with the human Mapt sequence, including upstream gene regulatory elements at the endogenous locus in hTau-KI mice. hTau-KI mice express all six human isoforms of Tau protein using the endogenous Mapt regulatory elements and therefore, hTau is expressed at normal physiological levels. Day twelve to fourteen neurons were treated with either the neuroproteasome inhibitor iBEp or the cell-permeable proteasome inhibitor Epoxomicin. We then performed sarkosyl fractionations to separate treated neurons into soluble and insoluble fractions and immunoblotted these fractions for total Tau and GAPDH. The R two two nine five antibody reacts against both total human and total mouse Tau and is highly specific, making it the ideal tool to monitor endogenous Tau in wild-type and hTau-KI samples. We observed no Tau signal in primary neurons cultured from Tau knockout mice, demonstrating the specificity of our antibodies and approach. We found a significant increase in sarkosyl-insoluble

Tau from both the wild-type and hTau-KI neurons treated with iBEp.

Intriguingly, we find no change in sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in neurons treated with the cellpermeable Epoxomicin compared to DMSO controls, despite the fact that Epoxomicin inhibits cytosolic proteasomes and neuroproteasomes. We reason that Epoxomicin inhibits neuroproteasomes and likely induces the formation of Tau inclusions, similar to iBEp, but these

Tau inclusions cannot be detected because simultaneous inhibition of cytosolic proteasomes induces autophagy and other compensatory mechanisms which can clear these inclusions. This claim is supported by an extensive body of work on Tau clearance mechanisms. We posit that such compensatory mechanisms are not triggered when neuroproteasomes are specifically inhibited, which is consistent with our observations that Epoxomicin induces p62 expression whereas iBEp does not.

Many of our experiments rely on the use of iBEp because the biotin tracer on an irreversible and specific inhibitor allows us to track which proteasomes are inhibited. However, we wanted to validate our findings using a proteasome inhibitor with a distinct mechanism of action from

Epoxomicin. We therefore modified M G one thirty-two, a reversible peptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitor, with a sulfonated biotin linker on the nonreactive N-terminus. This negatively charged water-soluble linker renders Sulfo-M G one thirty-two cell-impermeable, much like the historical use of sulfonated linkers to perform surface biotinylation. We observe efficient conjugation by HPLC analysis. All molecules were HPLC-purified as single peaks and confirmed by L C MS analysis. We find significant inhibition of proteasomes using SulfoMG despite the moderate loss of efficacy compared to M G one thirty-two as a consequence of the linker. M G one thirty-two is a reversible inhibitor and therefore, we cannot detect the covalent modification of the proteasome subunits. Instead, we turned to cellular and functional readouts of permeability. We found a similar induction of autophagy markers in neurons treated with M G one thirty-two as with epoxomicin and a similar lack of induction with SulfoMG as with iBEp. Confident in its use as a chemically orthogonal cell-impermeable proteasome inhibitor, we next incubated day thirteen primary hTau-KI neurons with SulfoMG. We find that SulfoMG induces similar partitioning of hTau into the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction as iBEp.

Moreover, we find that M G one thirty-two, like Epoxomicin, does not affect the sarkosyl-insoluble accumulation of Tau.

Next, we examined whether neuroproteasome inhibition would induce sarkosyl-insoluble endogenous Tau inclusions in vivo. Here, we only used iBEp and not SulfoMG for three reasons: first, because SulfoMG is reversible and is therefore subject to being washed out by CSF flow in vivo; second, because we could biochemically monitor iBEp permeability using the presence of the biotin signal; and third, because Epoxomicin is a more specific proteasome inhibitor than

M G one thirty-two. We tested iBEp permeability in vivo by stereotactically injecting iBEp into the CA one region of the mouse hippocampus for seventy-two hours. Hippocampi were microdissected and separated into cytosolic and membrane-enriched fractions and samples were immunoblotted. We fail to observe penetration into the cytosol until we inject sixty-four micromolar, so we chose to inject at ten-fold under this dose as our maximal concentration. This in vivo dose is consistent with and far lower than previous studies using Epoxomicin alone: nine point zero and thirteen point five millimolar. We performed stereotactic injections of six point four micromolar iBEp and contralateral injections of the vehicle zero point zero seven percent DMSO into the hippocampus of hTau-KI and Tau-KO mice. After seventy-two hours, we collected the hippocampi and performed sarkosyl extractions into soluble and insoluble fractions.

We fail to observe any detectable Tau in the Tau-KO mice in DMSO- or iBEp-injected hippocampi. Mirroring our data in primary neurons, we find a strong increase of sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in hippocampi from hTau-KI mice injected with iBEp.

In our experiments, we find that inhibiting neuroproteasomes to saturation induces the accumulation of sarkosyl-insoluble Tau. Taken together with our data demonstrating that ApoE

Five hundred sixty-one isoforms regulate neuroproteasome localization (ApoE4 less than E3 less than E2), we predicted that neurons

Five hundred sixty-two from ApoE4-KI mice would be more susceptible accumulating sarkosyl-insoluble Tau relative to

Five hundred sixty-three neurons from ApoE3-KI or ApoE2-KI mice. To test this prediction, we crossed each of the

Five hundred sixty-four ApoE-KI lines to the hTau-KI lines, generating mice which endogenously express ApoE2, E3, or

Five hundred sixty-five E4 as well as hTau. DIV fourteen primary neurons from each line (hTau/ApoE2 double KI,

Five hundred sixty-six hTau/ApoE3 double KI, and hTau/ApoE4 double KI) were then treated with a range of iBEp

Five hundred sixty-seven doses spanning four log units. Neurons were then separated into sarkosyl-soluble and insoluble

Five hundred sixty-eight fractions and immunoblotted. We found no sarkosyl-insoluble Tau aggregates at baseline in any line, which suggests that the ApoE4-induced reduction of neuroproteasomes levels alone is not

Five hundred seventy-one sufficient to drive Tau aggregation. However, after treatment with even the lowest

Five hundred seventy-two dose of iBEp, we found accumulation of sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in hTau/E4-dKI neurons,

Five hundred seventy-three rendering E4 neurons over twenty-five-fold more susceptible to Tau aggregation than E3 neurons. Conversely, neurons from hTau/E2-dKI mice were over ten-fold less susceptible to

Five hundred seventy-four neuroproteasome-inhibition induced Tau aggregation than neurons from hTau/E3-dKI mice. Overall, these data demonstrate that ApoE isoforms differentially shift the threshold for the neuroproteasome-dependent formation of endogenous sarkosyl-insoluble Tau inclusions.

Five hundred seventy-eight Neuroproteasome inhibition induces endogenous phosphorylated, sarkosyl-insoluble,


## Five hundred seventy-nine Thioflavin S-positive Tau aggregates

Five hundred eighty-one We noticed that neuroproteasome inhibition induces the shift of sarkosyl-insoluble Tau into a

Five hundred eighty-four in the Alzheimer’s disease brain and is a hallmark phenotype of multiple neurodegenerative disorders.

Five hundred eighty-five This molecular weight shift can in part be due to Tau phosphorylation at many residues.

Five hundred eighty-six Therefore, we wanted to address whether iBEp-induced Tau aggregates are phosphorylated.

Five hundred eighty-seven Rather than profiling by a panel of phospho-specific antibodies against Tau, we took a more

Five hundred eighty-eight unbiased approach and measured Tau phosphorylation by quantitative phosphoproteomics. We

Five hundred eighty-nine treated primary wild type neurons with iBEp for either one, six, or twenty-four hours and then performed sarkosyl

Five hundred ninety fractionations. Soluble and insoluble fractions were processed for TMT labeling in preparation

Five hundred ninety-one for quantitative mass spectrometry and then peptides were run over an Iron-N T A column to enrich

Five hundred ninety-two for phospho-peptides. We then used this enriched population for quantitative phospho-

Five hundred ninety-three proteomics analysis at the single peptide level. Here, we find a time-dependent

Five hundred ninety-four increase in Tau phosphorylation at only four of twenty-six identified sites which correspond to human S two zero two,

Five hundred ninety-six T two zero five, T two seventeen, and S four zero four. This is a specific signature of phosphorylation which

Five hundred ninety-seven corresponds to sites at which Tau is phosphorylated in the AD brain and detected by established antibodies (S two zero two - C P thirteen, T two zero five - A T eight, and S four zero four - P H F one) as well as CSF

Six hundred To validate these data, we treated hTau-KI neurons with iBEp and then fixed and stained these

Six hundred one neurons. We observed no staining in neurons cultured from Tau-KO mice using the R two two nine five

Six hundred two antibody to detect total Tau or the CP thirteen antibody to detect phosphorylated S two zero two.

Six hundred three Incubating neurons with secondary antibodies alone showed no signal. We therefore

Six hundred four exclusively used CP thirteen for our ICC experiments to detect phosphorylated Tau. We find a

Six hundred five significant elevation of CP thirteen signal in iBEp-treated primary hippocampal hTau-KI neurons

Six hundred seven both axons and MAP two positive dendrites. To validate these data, we conducted

Six hundred eight immunohistochemical analysis of sections from hTau-KI mice stereotactically injected with iBEp and contralaterally injected with vehicle control (zero point zero seven percent DMSO). After stereotactic

Six hundred nine injections, animals were allowed to recover for seventy-two hours and then were perfused and sectioned

Six hundred fourteen in hippocampi injected with iBEp compared to the contralateral P B S controls. We see a strong increase in A T eight positive inclusions mislocalized to somatodendritic compartments in iBEp-injected

Six hundred fifteen hippocampi, which extend into the stratum radiatum and stratum moleculare.

While sarkosyl-insoluble Tau reflects aggregated Tau species, there are

Six hundred eighteen varying definitions of a protein aggregate: misfolded proteins which cluster together, proteins

Six hundred nineteen which form stable inclusions, inclusions which are resistant to varying detergents, and then in

Six hundred twenty some cases, proteins which form very stable aggregates and even amyloids. Thioflavin

Six hundred twenty-one S (ThioS) is a dye that stains the beta-sheet structures of amyloid aggregates, including both

Six hundred twenty-two aggregated Tau tangles and amyloid plaques. Therefore, ThioS is used for the neuropathological

Six hundred twenty-three diagnosis of a wide variety of neurodegenerative disorders. We conducted ThioS

Six hundred twenty-four staining of sections from hTau-KI mice stereotactically injected with iBEp and contralaterally

Six hundred twenty-five injected with vehicle control. After stereotactic injections, animals were allowed to recover for

Seventy-two hours and then brains were perfused, sectioned, and stained for ThioS. We find a strong

Six hundred twenty-eight vehicle controls. ThioS positive inclusions appear as flame-like inclusions in both the CA one

Six hundred twenty-nine pyramidal layer and the granule cell layer of the Dentate Gyrus.

Six hundred thirty Neuroproteasome inhibition-induced flame-like ThioS positive aggregates co-localize with both

Six hundred thirty-one phosphorylated Tau (A T eight) and total Tau (D A nine) in single Z-plane images from

Six hundred thirty-two neurons in the CA one and DG of hippocampus. We conclude that some neuroproteasome-induced

Six hundred thirty-three aggregates we observe are indeed composed of Tau. In addition to these large ThioS positive inclusions,

Six hundred thirty-five widely distributed thin ThioS positive inclusions that appear dispersely throughout the iBEp-injected hippocampus. The ThioS positive inclusions formed following neuroproteasome

Six hundred thirty-six

Six hundred thirty-eight inhibition appear to resemble neurofibrillary tangle or neuropil thread-like inclusions observed in various Tauopathies including A-D. While we find it

Six hundred thirty-nine highly surprising that ThioS+ Tau inclusions appear just seventy-two hours after neuroproteasome

Six hundred forty inhibition, these data support our overall conclusion that neuroproteasome inhibition induces the aggregation of endogenous Tau.

Six hundred forty-one


## Six hundred forty-two De novo protein synthesis is required for neuroproteasome-dependent induction of

Six hundred forty-three endogenous Tau aggregates

Six hundred forty-four

Six hundred forty-five Neuroproteasomes are twenty-S complexes and do not have the machinery to recognize ubiquitin or

Six hundred forty-seven

Six hundred forty-nine formation of endogenous Tau aggregates. We incubated primary neuronal cultures with either

Six hundred fifty i-B-E-p or Epoxomicin and then co-incubated these cultures with cycloheximide, which blocks

Six hundred fifty-one translation elongation. Here, we reproduce i-B-E-p-induced Tau aggregation and find that

Six hundred fifty-two cycloheximide blocks this i-B-E-p-mediated increase in both W-T primary neurons and in

Six hundred fifty-five

Six hundred fifty-six sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in vivo in hTau-KI mice. We stereotactically co-injected cycloheximide

Six hundred fifty-eight decrease in sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in the hippocampus from mice co-injected with i-B-E-p and

Six hundred fifty-nine cycloheximide compared to those injected with i-B-E-p alone.

Six hundred sixty cycloheximide with i-B-E-p completely eliminated A-T-eight staining compared to contralateral

Six hundred sixty-one injection of i-B-E-p alone. Finally, similar to what we observed with sarkosyl-insoluble

Six hundred sixty-two Tau and A-T-eight staining, we also observe a complete return to baseline of ThioS+ staining in

Six hundred sixty-three hippocampi co-injected with i-B-E-p and cycloheximide relative to those injected with i-B-E-p alone.

Six hundred sixty-four There are many mechanisms which could explain our observation that new protein synthesis is required for the formation of neuroproteasome inhibition-induced endogenous Tau aggregates.

Six hundred sixty-seven

Six hundred sixty-eight We interpret our data and argue that neuroproteasome inhibition induces the accumulation of

Six hundred sixty-nine newly synthesized proteins important for Tau accumulation. The most straightforward

Six hundred seventy candidate protein would be Tau itself. To determine specifically if we observed more newly

Six hundred seventy-one synthesized Tau protein following neuroproteasome inhibition, we took advantage of proximity

Six hundred seventy-two ligation assays coupled with puromycylation to visualize newly synthesized Tau

Six hundred seventy-three

Six hundred seventy-four specific antibodies against puromycin. Each antibody is recognized by secondary antibodies

Six hundred seventy-five tethered to oligonucleotides that can ligate and amplify in situ. When antibodies against Tau and

Six hundred seventy-six puromycin are proximal to each other, this permits the oligonucleotide ligation which can be

Six hundred seventy-seven detected by a fluorescent signal under hybridizing conditions. A positive P-L-A signal

Six hundred seventy-eight therefore indicates the presence of newly synthesized Tau. We incubated Puromycin in primary

Six hundred seventy-nine neuronal cultures for only ten minutes, which allows us to visualize a defined short snapshot of

Six hundred eighty newly synthesized Tau. We observe no signal in neurons either not treated with puromycin or in

Six hundred eighty-one neurons where we block protein synthesis using cycloheximide or anisomycin during

Six hundred eighty-two puromycylation, validating our approach. We observe a striking approximately three point five-fold increase

Six hundred eighty-three in Puro-P-L-A-Tau signal in i-B-E-p-treated neurons relative to D-M-S-O controls. We then

Six hundred eighty-six neurons, we observe an increase in the size distribution of P-L-A puncta from i-B-E-p treated

Six hundred eighty-seven neurons. We find that i-B-E-p treated neurons contain an over twofold increase in newly

Six hundred ninety inhibition, consistent with our observations that neuroproteasome inhibition induces Tau aggregation.

Six hundred ninety-two


## Six hundred ninety-three Discussion

Six hundred ninety-four

Six hundred ninety-five We conclude that neuroproteasome localization is differentially regulated by Apo E isoforms,

Six hundred ninety-seven

Six hundred ninety-eight neurons, as well as pathophysiology of neurodegeneration, will be critical to explore in the

Six hundred ninety-nine future. The cell-impermeable neuroproteasome-specific inhibitors we have developed and the

Seven hundred tools we have built to visualize and purify neuroproteasomes will enable the broad study of

702

Seven hundred three The mechanisms by which ApoE interacts with and influences neuroproteasome localization

Seven hundred five carrier. While we demonstrate only lipidated ApoE can influence neuroproteasome

Seven hundred six localization, we do not understand whether the lipids transported by ApoE are involved in

707 regulating neuroproteasomes or if the lipoproteins are more efficiently able to interact with the 708 neuroproteasome complex. Neuroproteasome levels change in ApoE3/3 AD carriers relative to

Seven hundred nine controls, which likely suggests that other mechanisms besides ApoE are at play in controlling

Seven hundred ten neuroproteasome localization. It is therefore an open and important task to define the milieu of

Seven hundred eleven molecular and cell biological factors that can influence neuroproteasome localization. Detailed

Seven hundred twelve characterization of such mechanisms may help understand whether and how neuroproteasomes

Seven hundred thirteen contribute to the large diversity of phenotypes in Tauopathies and neurodegenerative disease.

Seven hundred fourteen

Seven hundred fifteen Along these lines, ApoE has large effects on both amyloid deposition and Tau aggregation based on neuropathological data. Future work will determine whether and how neuroproteasomes

Seven hundred sixteen can impinge on the amyloid pathway, if at all.

Seven hundred seventeen

Seven hundred eighteen In the broadest sense, we find that neuroproteasome localization and function is a determinant

Seven hundred nineteen for the proteostatic capacity of neurons to defend against protein aggregation. A major

Seven hundred twenty conclusion of our work is that neuroproteasome-specific inhibition induces the formation of

Seven hundred twenty-one endogenous Tau inclusions, suggesting the neuroproteasome is a pivotal mechanism in

Seven hundred twenty-two determining Tau aggregate formation. This function is notably distinct from the canonical role of

Seven hundred twenty-five this may be important for Tau aggregation observed in a high percentage of sporadic Alzheimer's Disease patients

Seven hundred twenty-six who do not have genetic lesions in the MAPT locus. It will likely be important to determine how

Seven hundred twenty-seven neuroproteasome inhibition-induced endogenous Tau aggregates compare to other types of misfolded Tau.

Seven hundred twenty-eight

Seven hundred twenty-nine

Seven hundred thirty One of the key observations we make is that new protein synthesis is necessary for

Seven hundred thirty-one neuroproteasome-inhibition induced Tau aggregation. Taken together with the dramatic increase

Seven hundred thirty-three to explain our observations (Figure S seven D): one, that neuroproteasomes degrade newly synthesized

Seven hundred thirty-four Tau, or two, that neuroproteasomes indirectly regulate the translation machinery itself. The latter

Seven hundred thirty-five is unlikely because only approximately five hundred proteins increase after neuroproteasome inhibition, which suggests

Seven hundred thirty-six some degree of specificity of what is regulated by neuroproteasomes. Based on the small number

Seven hundred thirty-eight study which become insoluble, we suggest that the model that neuroproteasomes degrade Tau to

Seven hundred thirty-nine be the most likely option. While further experiments are needed to determine which is accurate,

Seven hundred forty our observation that newly synthesized and endogenous Tau forms aggregates following

Seven hundred forty-one neuroproteasome inhibition is likely to be an important finding for the field. Indeed, if newly

Seven hundred forty-two synthesized Tau is a neuroproteasome substrate, future analysis would determine if Tau

Seven hundred forty-three mutations or Tau seeding would perturb the balance of protein synthesis and degradation. This

Seven hundred forty-four would be an important cautionary consideration for using these common models to study

Seven hundred forty-five neuroproteasome-dependent Tau aggregation.

Seven hundred forty-six

Seven hundred forty-seven As a concluding note, our findings increase the urgency to understand fundamental aspects of

Seven hundred forty-eight neuroproteasome biology. For example, revealing the genetic and cell biological elements which

Seven hundred forty-nine control neuroproteasome localization and trafficking are likely to be critical to reveal how ApoE

Seven hundred fifty exerts an effect on neuroproteasome localization. The majority of the other components

Seven hundred fifty-one identified are involved in synaptic vesicle recycling and membrane trafficking.

Seven hundred fifty-three regulating localization of these complexes to the plasma membrane, a subject for future study.

Seven hundred fifty-four Understanding these, as well as related mechanisms like how newly synthesized proteins are

Seven hundred fifty-five degraded by neuroproteasomes, are likely to open up therapeutic avenues that can impinge on

Seven hundred fifty-six neuroproteasome biology to boost neuroproteasome dependent-proteostasis and delay or prevent protein aggregation.
