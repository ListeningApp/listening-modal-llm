Similarly, metabolomics is integrated with mRNA for studying ulcerative colitis and cancer survival. On the other hand, glycomics and epigenomics have only appeared once in the multi-omics context (along with mRNA and metabolomics) and used for the study of age-related comorbidities using a graphical variant of RF.\n3c47 | Recently, metabolomics and proteomics have also been integrated with lipidomics to evaluate COVID-nineteen patients using Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis and Extra Trees.\ng345 | Multi-omics studies have also been successfully conducted in plants and animals such as canine heart disease.\nsvhz | Overall, the different recent multi-omics studies highlight the superiority of integration methods in understanding the complexity of different diseases and uncovering the underlying abnormalities from the vastly generated multi-omics data, which is not always possible with individual omics analysis.\noaen | Six. Recommendations\n5u67 | Today a plethora of multi-omic integration methods are available for both supervised and unsupervised learning as evident in the current review. This information can overwhelm interdisciplinary scientists and would require a time-consuming effort to understand the challenging mathematical and computational concepts behind them. Hence, we suggest that interdisciplinary teams working on multi-omics always include ML practitioners to assist with the choice of methods, the development of solutions, the interpretation of results and their significance and limits. Such truly interdisciplinary teams offer real opportunities for better mutual understanding of the different fields, practice and expertise necessary, leading ultimately to more robust conclusions. Also, to facilitate the method selection process, a recommendation flowchart is proposed. It shows the various decision steps required for choosing an appropriate method or family of methods for a given scenario. For example, to choose a method for integrating two omics for unsupervised learning one can choose a model-based method such as PSDF or Lemon-Tree if the two omics are gene expression and CNV, otherwise MDI or SNF can be used. Similarly, NEMO can be used in scenarios where the datasets are partially overlapping, and a transformation approach is required. Hence, it can be used for biomedical analysis, including diagnosis, prognosis and biomarker identification, by posing them as supervised or unsupervised learning problems.\ndvms | Clearly, a one-size-fits-all approach is not feasible. Also,\nqrd3 | unfortunately, the existing literature does not provide many direct comparisons between methods using the same publicly available datasets. Hence, to choose the best method which suits a given dataset and question, an empirical approach that investigates the use of different methods, guided by ML practitioners is recommended.\nrxrg | Seven. Conclusions\ntf43 | This paper reviewed various ML approaches used for the integration of multi-omics data for analysis. A concise background of multi-omics and ML was presented. It examined the concatenation-, model- and transformation-based integration methods, employed for multi-omics data along with their advantages and disadvantages. Also, various existing multi-omics studies have been summarised. Finally, a recommendation flowchart is presented for interdisciplinary professionals to choose an appropriate method for a multi-omics dataset. Overall, this work showcases the recent findings in the multi-omics domain and signifies the key role of ML in the future of personalised healthcare.\nfcco | Disclosure\n8uji | The authors have nothing to disclose.\ndf3e | Declaration of Competing Interest\n53eu | The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\na5u1 | Acknowledgement\nry7u | This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon twenty twenty research and innovation programme under grant agreement number six three three nine eight three.
