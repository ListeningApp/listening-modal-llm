        "content": "qecd | Current Topic\n1o7p | â–  PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS\ncp13 | Soluble MMO. MMOH interacts with MMOB and MMOR. MMOB is essential for efficient hydrocarbon oxidation by MMOH. Binding of MMOB increases the reaction rate of reduced MMOH with oxygen by one thousand-fold, lowers the redox potential of the diiron center, changes the regioselectivity of substrate oxidation, and affects the structure of the diiron center. The two point nine Angstrom resolution structure of the M. capsulatus (Bath) MMOH-2MMOB complex reveals that MMOB binds to the canyon region at the dimer interface of MMOH, leading to the ordering of the N-terminal thirty-five residues of MMOB, which are not observed in the NMR structures, into a ring-like fold (Figure 7A). MMOB binding also causes\nbgre | conformational changes in MMOH residue Phe one hundred eighty-eight of the alpha subunit, opening up a pathway from the surface to the active site. In addition, Thr two hundred thirteen of the MMOH alpha subunit rotates inward toward the active site, forming new hydrogen bonds with Glu two hundred forty and closing the hydrophilic pore (Figure 7B,C). This residue has been proposed to play a role in proton delivery. Finally, MMOB binding induces small changes in\n57lp | Biochemistry\nukth | some of the ligands, including a shift of Glu two hundred forty-three to a coordination more similar to that in reduced MMOH.\nkpvt | MMOR transfers two electrons from NADH one at a time to the diiron site in MMOH via its FAD and two iron-two sulfur cofactors. There is no crystal structure of the MMOH-MMOR complex, but NMR titrations indicate that residues twenty-four to thirty-four in alpha helix one and residues sixty-seven to sixty-nine in alpha helix two interact with MMOH. Chemical cross-linking studies have suggested that MMOR interacts with both the alpha eighty-eight and beta eighty-one subunits of MMOH, and recent work using hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry and computational docking suggests that the ferredoxin domain of MMOR binds to MMOH at the same location where MMOB binds. At this binding site, the MMOR two iron-two sulfur cluster is positioned fourteen Angstroms away from the diiron active site and does indeed interact with both subunits. Consistent with these findings, MMOB inhibits MMOR binding as well as electron transfer. However, it is also possible that MMOB inhibits MMOR binding by forming a complex with MMOR.\njie2 | Recent fluorescence anisotropy experiments suggest that MMOB has a higher affinity for MMOH in the reduced form, with a dissociation constant of zero point one seven micromolar, than in the oxidized form, with a dissociation constant of zero point five five micromolar, an observation that is difficult to reconcile with the lowered redox potential of MMOH in the presence of MMOB. Double electron-electron resonance spectroscopic data further suggest that the conformation of the N-terminal tail of MMOB is more rigid when MMOH is reduced. The key role of the MMOB N-terminus is underscored by data showing that mutants of MMOB disrupting the N-terminus display significantly reduced activity. In one functional model, MMOR is proposed to replace MMOB, transfer electrons to reduce the active site, and then MMOB is proposed to rebind to the reduced form, displacing MMOR, and initiating oxygen activation and methane oxidation. In the absence of experimental evidence for MMOR displacing MMOB from the oxidized MMOH, this scenario remains speculative.\nd0ik | Particulate MMO. Protein-protein interactions are not required for pMMO activity in vitro, but protein-protein complexes involving pMMO have been suggested. Besides the interaction with the mystery helix observed crystallographically (Figure 3), pMMO has been proposed to interact with the next enzyme in the methane oxidation metabolic pathway, methanol dehydrogenase. MDH is a periplasmic enzyme that oxidizes methanol to formaldehyde and is composed of a sixty-three kilodalton alpha subunit, which contains a pyrroloquinoline quinone/calcium ion cofactor, and an eight kilodalton beta subunit arranged as an alpha two beta two dimer. The M. capsulatus (Bath) MDH can also form higher order heterogeneous oligomers. A putative pMMO-MDH super-complex was isolated, and its structure was determined to sixteen Angstrom resolution by electron microscopy. This structure was interpreted as three alpha beta MDH monomers capping the periplasmic pmoB soluble domains of the pMMO alpha three beta three gamma three trimer. This pMMO-MDH complex exhibited moderately higher propylene epoxidation activity than pMMO alone, but its methane oxidation activity was not reported. Recent biolayer interferometry studies of MDH and pMMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) reveal a specific protein-protein interaction was also detected between MDH and the spmoB recombinant protein, indicating that the periplasmic regions of pmoB are involved. These data are consistent with reports that MDH is associated with the membranes in various methanotrophs. The observed complex is likely dynamic\n0x0s | Current Topic\n4exe | since a stable complex cannot be isolated by size exclusion chromatography, and its formation may depend on the presence of the membrane or other proteins. One proposal is that the lysine-rich beta subunit of MDH, of which the function is not known, interacts with pMMO and/or negatively charged phospholipid headgroups at the periplasmic membrane, thus associating with pMMO in a fashion that would be difficult to reconstitute in vitro. Such a model would not apply to methanotrophs that utilize a subset of MDH enzymes lacking the beta subunit, but these methanotrophs, which include the Verrucomicrobia, also have different types of membranes.",
