You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

meyw | 4.3. Multiple RNA Replication Complex Outputs: Genomic RNAs, Subgenomic Messenger RNAs, and Recombination
2e62 | The RCs of most (+)RNA viruses host multiple processes such as replicating different RNAs of multicomponent genomes, genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis, and RNA recombination. Growing understanding of RC structure and compartmentalization enables more effective con- sideration of how these processes are regulated and whether individual RCs might be specialized for particular pathways or RNA templates.
75y3 | To express additional proteins from internal open reading frames, many (+)RNA viruses pro- duce subgenomic mRNAs corresponding to 5' truncated fragments of viral genomic (+)RNA. For BMV (Figure 2), and by inference other alphavirus-like viruses, in vitro and in vivo results show that subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized by (+)RNA initiation at alternate internal promoters on a full-length genomic (-)RNA template (98). While many regulatory questions remain, mutual interference between BMV genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis suggests that both pathways may proceed on a common genomic (-)RNA template in a single spherule RC (99).
s2g2 | For nodaviruses and coronaviruses (Figure 2), subgenomic RNAs are generated by terminat- ing (-)RNA synthesis at interior sites on genomic (+)RNA templates, yielding truncated or in- ternally deleted (-)RNAs that become independent replicons (58, 59, 100, 101). For both viruses, subgenomic (-)RNA production depends on defined RNA sequences, structures, and long-range RNA interactions (58, 101). However, the precise conditions triggering premature termination of (-)RNA synthesis and regulating relative levels of full-length genomic and partial-length subge- nomic (-)RNAs remain poorly understood.
q1q2 | It is also unknown whether individual coronavirus or nodavirus RCs contain only one or more types of genomic or subgenomic RNA templates. For coronavirus DMVs, the presence

68xu | of multiple crowns per DMV and the apparently lower density of dsRNA intermediates rela- tive to spherules (65) (Figure 3c) suggest that individual DMVs might host multiple genomic and/or subgenomic RNA templates, with either transient or more durable associations with spe- cific crowns. For spherule RCs, volume measurements and the presence of a single crown suggest that most spherules contain a single dsRNA replication intermediate (26, 27) (Figure 3a). How- ever, nodavirus genomic RNA2 replication both requires and subsequently suppresses synthesis of subgenomic RNA3 from genomic RNA1 (100, 101). Thus, either some of these three replica- tively interdependent RNAs are produced in a single spherule or the templates and products of their replication must interact between RCs.
hd35 | (+)RNA virus RNA recombination, which is crucial for short-term adaptation and long-term evolution, appears to occur primarily by template switching during RNA replication (102) and thus within RCs. Accordingly, BMV recombination requires both parental RNAs to possess signals for recruitment into RCs, and recruiting two templates into a single RC may be the limiting factor for recombination (103, 104).
2zpk | 4.4. Connection of Virion Assembly to RNA Replication
epu7 | For many (+)RNA viruses, genome RNA synthesis shows close physical and functional links to virion assembly. For coronaviruses, for example, virion assembly and budding sites are usually closely juxtaposed with DMV RCs producing new viral genomic RNAs (56, 63, 105) (Figure 3c). Coronavirus RCs and encapsidation are further linked by interaction of the cytosolic domains of RC crowns with clustered densities similar to virion ribonucleoproteins (65) and by crown protein nsp3 binding of viral nucleocapsid N (68), implying that nsp3-N interaction might initiate encapsidation of progeny RNAs as they are released from crowns (59, 65).
7od1 | Flavivirus virions also assemble and bud near their genome replication sites (52) (Figure 3b). For both flaviviruses and hepaciviruses, multiple RC-associated nonstructural proteins are linked to virion assembly. In particular, flavivirus NS2A and hepacivirus NS2 are key organizers of virion assembly, promoting recruitment, localization, and function of multiple viral factors at virion as- sembly sites jointly associated with lipid droplets and ER (106-108). In addition to NS2A, fla- vivirus nonstructural proteins implicated in virion assembly include at least NS2B and NS3, while implicated HCV proteins include NS2 plus NS1/P7, NS3, NS4A, and NS5A, establishing mul- tiple potentially guiding connections between the machineries of progeny RNA and virion pro- duction (106, 108, 109).
0bqy | In nodavirus infection, large arrays of unenveloped virions accumulate directly adjacent to infection-modified mitochondria bearing RCs (110), and several results illustrate functional cou- pling between these processes. First, nodavirus genomic RNA1 and RNA2 are only efficiently encapsidated by capsid protein translated from RNA2 synthesized by nodaviral RNA-dependent RNA replication in mitochondrial RCs, but not by capsid protein supplied in trans from non- replicating mRNA transcribed from baculovirus DNA (111). Moreover, an arginine-rich motif near the capsid protein N terminus is selectively required to encapsidate genomic RNA1 but not RNA2, largely because this domain localizes capsid protein to the mitochondrial sites of RNA replication (112). Thus, for all of these viruses, virion assembly and RNA replication are linked by multiple pathways whose mechanistic principles are still incompletely understood but promise to be quite enlightening.

nav4 | typically start at low multiplicity, the incoming single-stranded RNA genome (Figure <LATEX>\left. l a \right)</LATEX> is highly vulnerable to normal cellular RNA turnover prior to RNA replication. Thus, merely slowing RC assembly can have dramatic antiviral effects. In addition to attractive potentials for targeting viral replication factor synthesis, stability, trafficking, and assembly, RC assembly might be inhibited by targeting relevant host factors. While space does not allow general review here of the myriad host factor requirements for <LATEX>\left( + \right) \mathrm { R N A }</LATEX> virus replication (e.g., 45, 113-115), some examples are instructive. Host pathways involved in lipid synthesis, modification, and trafficking are prominent illustrations of potential targets because most or all <LATEX>\left( + \right) \mathrm { R N A }</LATEX> viruses depend on and recruit such functions to RC assembly sites (116, 117). Similarly, RC generation by many <LATEX>\left( + \right) \mathrm { R N A }</LATEX> viruses requires host membrane remodeling factors such as ESCRT proteins, reticulons, and others (118-120). Because these and many other host pathways are used by numerous <LATEX>\left( + \right) \mathrm { R N A }</LATEX> viruses, targeting well-selected factors could provide valuable broad-spectrum antiviral effects.
gem8 | After RNA replication starts, eukaryotic innate immune defenses that recognize (+)RNA virus dsRNA (121) include RNA interference (120) and multiple pattern recognition receptors (122- 124). As expected from their structure (Figure 3), <LATEX>\left( + \right) \mathrm { R N A }</LATEX> virus RCs strongly sequester viral dsRNA from interaction with such extravesicular factors (40, 125). Innate immune responses thus might be initiated primarily from rare aberrant RCs whose mis-assembly or other defects render dsRNAs accessible. Accordingly, treatments that increase defective RC production might greatly accelerate and stimulate innate immune responses. Intriguingly, crown components SARS-CoV nsp3 and CHIKV nsP1 bind and antagonize innate immune recognition/signaling factors MDA5 (124) and cGAS-STING (126), suggesting that viral crowns might provide active as well as passive defenses against innate immunity.
e8nr | 5. CONCLUDING REMARKS
k78w | In just the past few years, the discovery of crowns in the RCs of several distinct viruses (21, 26, 41, 42, 65) has begun to establish these intriguing, strategically placed complexes as critical features in the replication of many if not most (+)RNA viruses. While the structure of these crowns is still being unraveled, their recognition is already providing foundations for resolving central questions of RC organization, assembly, and function that have been recognized for decades. The identifi- cation of crowns emerged from the convergence of revolutionary advances in molecular virology, cryo-EM imaging, and other areas, and these same trends promise accelerating future progress. Further structural and functional studies will undoubtedly provide important insights into mul- tiple key mechanistic issues, many of which are posed above. In this age of heightened pandemic awareness, perhaps chief among these is how our increasing understanding of the machinery and functions of (+)RNA virus genome replication and associated processes can best be translated into more effective and ideally more broadly active antiviral control strategies. Gratifyingly, emerging results already imply that dramatic new surprises and productive opportunities for research and applications will be in store as this exciting arena advances.
