You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

5bjs | For ex vivo COX-2 activity, heparinized blood (1 mL) was immediately transferred into two 1.5 mL polypropylene tubes (500 µL each). One tube contained 10 µL of lipopolysaccharide isolated from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. The sec- ond tube contained 10 µL of PBS and was used as the negative control sample. Samples were then incubated at 37 ℃ for 24
uodj | hours. Afterwards, samples were centrifuged at 2000 g for 5 minutes at 18 ℃, 100 µL of plasma were added to 400 µL of methanol and homogenized. This solution was then centri- fuged at 6000 g for 10 minutes at 18 ℃; supernatant was harvested and stored at -80 ℃ until the time of PGE2 con- centration analysis.
k16v | All tests were performed in duplicate and the quantification of TXB2 and PGE2 concentrations were performed with com- mercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Thromboxane B2 ELISA kit and PGE2 ELISA kit monoclonal; Cayman Chemical, MI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
b2lm | Laboratory tests
ti7f | Blood samples (2 mL) were collected for measurement of he- patic function tests (alanine transaminase; alkaline phospha- tase; aspartate aminotransferase; gamma-glutamyltransferase; serum albumin and total protein) and renal function tests (creatinine; urea) 7 days before and 7 days after anesthesia (clinical laboratory of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of FMVZ-USP). Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) concentra- tion was also measured at 7 days before, 24 hours and 7 days after anesthesia in samples from all cats used in the COX in- hibition evaluation (IDEXX Laboratories Inc., ME, USA).
oksu | Adverse effects
wtow | Adverse effects and short-term postoperative complications were monitored in the 24 hours after first analgesic adminis- tration and reassessed on postoperative days 7 and 10 (suture removal). Through daily telephone contact, the owners were asked about their cats' general condition, presence of emesis, sialorrhea, diarrhea, changes in food and water intake, abnormal behavior and general aspect of the surgical wound.
o22k | Physiological variables
nwfz | Measurements of HR, fR, rectal temperature (RT) and blood glucose concentration (Glucometer Optium Xceed; Abbott Laboratories, Philippines) were obtained immediately before the premedication (baseline) and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after first analgesic administration.
nvfy | Pain and sedation assessment
mror | Pain and sedation were evaluated at the same time points as the physiological variables. Subjective pain scores were ob- tained from four pain scales; the visual analogue scale (VAS) (Jensen et al. 2003), Colorado State University feline acute pain scale in English (CSU-FAPS) (Hellyer et al. 2006), UNESP- Botucatu multidimensional composite pain scale for assessing postoperative pain in cats in Portuguese (MCPS) (Brondani
zlxc | et al. 2012) and Glasgow feline composite measure pain scale (CMPS-Feline) (Reid et al. 2017). Sedation was evaluated using a scale (0-3; no effect, mild, moderate and severe) adapted from Valverde et al. (2004).
k0bw | Rescue analgesia
aq5a | Rescue medication tramadol hydrochloride (2 mg <LATEX>\mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 } : \mathrm { C r o }</LATEX> nidor 2%; Agener União Saúde Animal, SP, Brazil) was administered IV if CMPS-Feline scores were <LATEX>\geq 5 .</LATEX> Additional tramadol, <LATEX>1 \mathrm { m g } \mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { I V } ,</LATEX> could be administered if analgesia was inadequate after 30 minutes. The person that performed pain assessment (MAAP) was unaware of the drug administered. Cats administered rescue medication were reassessed 30 mi- nutes after tramadol administration and up to 24 hours; however, the physiological variables data, pain and sedation scores recorded after rescue analgesia were excluded from the analysis.
sc5y | Statistical analysis
0yab | A sample size calculation was performed for ex vivo COX ac- tivity and pain assessment [COX-1 activity inhibition in humans after oral administration of 500 mg of dipyrone of <LATEX>7 2 . 9 5</LATEX> (Hinz et al. 2007); need for rescue analgesia of 70% and 20% of dogs submitted to ovariohysterectomy and IV administration of 15 or 25 mg <LATEX>\mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> of dipyrone (Imagawa et al. 2011), respectively].
w95z | Data are expressed as mean <LATEX>\pm</LATEX> standard deviation (para- metric variables) or median (range) (nonparametric variables) as appropriate. The data were tested for normality using a D'Agostino-Pearson test. A two-way analysis of variance was used to evaluate parametric data and a Kruskal-Wallis test was applied on nonparametric data. Post hoc analysis was performed with Tukey or Dunn tests to identify differences among time points and groups. The Spearman's rank corre- lation between pain scales was evaluated. The number of cats that required rescue analgesia was compared among groups using the Fisher exact probability test. Statistical significance was attributed if <LATEX>p < 0 . 0 5 .</LATEX> Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Version 7.03 (GraphPad Software Inc., CA, USA).

dqlg | A total of 37 cats were initially selected for participating in the study. Overall, four cats were excluded because of non- compliant preoperative behavior and three cats were excluded because of pregnancy. Groups D25, D12.5 and M did not differ significantly regarding body weight <LATEX>\left( 2 . 7 \pm 0 . 5 ; 2 . 7 \pm 0 . 4 ; 2 . 7 \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\pm 0 . 5 \mathrm { k g } ,</LATEX> respectively), age <LATEX>\left( 1 3 \pm 5 ; 1 2 \pm 9 ; 1 5 \pm 1 3 \right.</LATEX> months, respectively) and surgical time (28 ± 6; <LATEX>2 5 4 ;</LATEX> 30 <LATEX>4</LATEX> mi- nutes, respectively).
