Like appraisal theorists of emotion, Russell distinguished between the experience of emotion, which he termed core affect, and appraisals of stimuli as pleasant or unpleasant, which he termed perceptions of affective quality. Perceptions of affective quality do not necessarily influence core affect, as when an individual with depression appreciates the beauty of a sunset but remains utterly depressed. By extension, people may perceive an object as having ambivalent affective qualities without actually experiencing mixed emotions. Thus, Russell suggested that research subjects may erroneously report feeling happy and sad when they merely intended to report that ongoing events contained both pleasant and unpleasant aspects.\nj30a | It is widely acknowledged that films can elicit intense emotions, so our data are less susceptible to Russell's concern than other data are. It is especially unlikely that subjects in a recent study of mixed emotions by Andrade and Cohen reported their perceptions of affective quality. In that study, continuous ESG ratings indicated that fans of horror films experienced mixed emotions of happiness and fear while they watched horror clips. The horror clips were terrifying and contained no happy material, so it is doubtful that subjects merely reported their appraisals of the clips' emotional content. A more plausible explanation is that subjects genuinely experienced happiness and, by extension, mixed emotions of happiness and fear. Thus, the most parsimonious interpretation for our studies is that subjects who watched the bittersweet Life Is Beautiful clip reported mixed emotions of happiness and sadness because they genuinely experienced mixed emotions of happiness and sadness.\n7bdk | Future Directions\nfim0 | Some people may experience mixed emotions more often than others. The tendency for Asians to experience more mixed emotions than Westerners has been attributed to the tendency for Asians to show greater dialectical thinking. One aspect of dialectical thinking is the belief that two contradictory propositions can both be true. Experiencing positive and negative emotions can be seen as contradictory, so it makes sense that cultural differences in mixed emotions are a result of cultural differences in perceptions of contradiction. Another aspect of dialectical thinking is the belief that things change. The extant evidence for cultural differences in mixed emotions comes from static measures, which leaves open the possibility that Asians report more mixed emotions not because they spend more time experiencing simultaneously mixed emotions than Westerners, but because they spend more time vacillating between positive and negative emotions. Future research with continuous measures of positivity and negativity can test these competing hypotheses.\nojro | dency for Asians to show greater dialectical thinking.

Personality inventories indicate that individuals with bipolar disorder show greater emotion lability, and emotion ratings indicate that some individuals with bipolar disorder vacillate between intense positive and negative emotions within the course of a day, but researchers in this area have not employed continuous measures or separate measures of positivity and negativity. Such measures may indicate that what appear to be episodes of vacillation are actually episodes of simultaneously mixed emotions and that individuals with bipolar disorder experience more mixed emotions than others do.\n1ujy | Final Thoughts\nqzor | Our data and others' indicate that emotional experience generally conforms to the valence-arousal model's predictions. Yet even the most robust models in psychology have boundary conditions, so it should come as no surprise that the valence-arousal model cannot account for every person's experience in every situation. Our evidence for mixed emotions indicates that a more complete understanding of emotional experience in bittersweet situations requires conceptualizing positivity and negativity as separable.\na0by | MIXED EMOTIONS\n```",
