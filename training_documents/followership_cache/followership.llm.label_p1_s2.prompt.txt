You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1pjs | Rethinking Followership
o2kr | ABATERIAL
v6sk | Robert E. Kelley
1wj6 | W hen I began my work on followership twenty-five years ago, I was not particularly aware of what I was doing in the bigger scheme of things. My only goal was to bring attention to the study of followers. I was simply thinking about followers and followership roles, and I wanted to explore the subject.
936l | votre
06yq | At the time, leadership was the primary focus for just about all scholars in the field. Very little research or theorizing considered followers, and if it did, its pur- pose was to better understand leadership.1 I felt like the odd person out. Execu- tives, academics, and even people sitting next to me on airplanes questioned why I would bother with followership when leadership spurred the media attention, research funding, and high-paying corporate training gigs. Most people held a very negative view of followership and discounted anything positive that could come from the role. No one talked about followership; it was never part of the conversation, unless it was tagged on as an afterthought. At some point, I finally decided to put a stake in the ground and say to the world, "We need to pay atten- tion to followers. Followership is worthy of its own discrete research and training. Plus, conversations about leadership need to include followership because leaders neither exist nor act in a vacuum without followers."
dpv6 | The road I went down was not easy at first. I made a major step with my 1988 Harvard Business Review article, "In Praise of Followers."2 In it, I explained that
8r5j | 6
2taz | we view the world as a map with leadership in the center and everything else on the periphery. I remember a perspective-altering trip to Japan, where I was shown a world map with Japan in the center and the United States tucked over in the corner. This is what I wanted to do for followership: to put it in the middle of the map and to let everything else be on the periphery.
o3ya | "In Praise of Followers" turned out to be fairly controversial. Some people just flat out didn't like it, comparing followers to sled dogs whose destiny is always to look at the rear end of the dog in front of them, but never to see the wider hori- zon or make the decisions of the lead dog. Other readers could not thank me enough for articulating what they secretly held in their heart. These folks believed that being a strong #2 often allowed for greater contributions than being in the #1 spot and that making the assist was just as important as making the score. Many had no desire to be leaders.
r5il | Controversy, I learned, can be good for spreading the word. So many people read, discussed, argued, and tried to apply the ideas in the article that it became one of HBR's best-selling reprints and earned the article the "HBR Classic" designation. My 1992 book, The Power of Followership, and Ira Chaleff's 1995 book, The Courageous Follower, propelled the concept even further.3 In the years since then, followership has made increasing headway into the mainstream, and the amount of interest in the topic seems to be escalating. For example, the word itself is now part of the organizational vocabulary. It is rare for someone to talk about leadership without also discussing the corresponding role of followership. Most leader- ship courses now have a section devoted to followership, and followership is increas- ingly taught as a stand-alone course in universities and corporations, such as Barbara Kellerman's followership course at Harvard's Kennedy School. Several master's theses and doctoral dissertations have studied followership in nursing, education, business, and sports. A 2007 Google search turned up over 187,000 hits for the term follower and over 92,000 hits for followership research. Ron Riggio, Jean Lipman-Blumen, and Ira Chaleff organized at Claremont McKenna College in 2006 the first national followership conference. On a personal level, more and more people contact me now wanting to know about followership. Most impor- tant, more people admit to me that they not only play the followership role but also prefer it. The landscape for followership has changed considerably in the last twenty-five years.
5gui | The Art of Followership
82qc | FOLLOWERSHIP STYLES
ls7d | My previous work, which served as a launching point for the field, involved basic preliminary research on the styles of followership. Two dimensions seemed to define the way that people follow:
tzt3 | 1. Do they think for themselves? Are they independent critical thinkers? Or do they look to the leader to do the thinking for them?
t8vv | 2. Are they actively engaged in creating positive energy for the organization? Or is there negative energy or passive involvement?
qvnu | Based on these two dimensions, there are five basic styles of followership:
kggw | The sheep. Sheep are passive and look to the leader to do the thinking for them and to motivate them. If you are the boss and in your car on the way to work, and you're thinking about what you're going to get your workers to do and how you're going to do that, then you're dealing with sheep.
xrd1 | The yes-people. Yes-people are positive, always on the leader's side, but still looking to the leader for the thinking, the direction, the vision. If the leader asks them to do something, they've got the energy, and they'll go forward with it. When they finish that task, they'll come back to the leader, asking, "What do you want me to do next?" However, yes-people don't see themselves this way. One of the things I've learned is that the different styles of followers will almost always put a positive spin on their style. Yes-people will say, "I'm a doer; that's my job. The boss gets paid to think, and I'm the one who does the work." But the rest of us would say there's more to being a good follower than simply doing.
5746 | The alienated. Alienated followers think for themselves, but have a lot of nega- tive energy. Every time the leader or organization tries to move forward, these are the ones who have ten reasons why the leader or organization shouldn't. They are not coming up with the next solution, but are skeptical, cynical about the cur- rent plan of action. They have energy, they can think for themselves, they can be smart. But they are not moving in a positive direction. However, they see them- selves as the mavericks, the only people in the organization who have the guts to stand up to the boss.
7toz | The pragmatics. Pragmatics sit on the fence and see which way the wind blows. Once they see where things are headed, they'll get on board. They'll never be the first on board, but they will never let the leader or organization leave

v8uq | Rethinking Followership

cwrw | without them. They see themselves as preservers of the status quo. Their internal dialogue goes something like this: "If I got all excited every time there was a new leader or a change of direction, my wheels would be spinning constantly. Leaders come and go. New visions come and go. If I just sit here and wait it out, I won't have to do all that work." So they do what they must to survive, but wait it out until the storms of change blow over.
4i0e | The star followers. Star followers think for themselves, are very active, and have very positive energy. They do not accept the leader's decision without their own independent evaluation of its soundness. If they agree with the leader, they give full support. If they disagree, they challenge the leader, offering constructive alternatives that will help the leader and organization get where they want to go. Some people view these people as really "leaders in disguise," but this is basically because those people have a hard time accepting that followers can display such independence and positive behavior. Star followers are often referred to as "my right-hand person" or my "go-to person."
h2l3 | So this was the basic model I used to understand followership styles. It offered me and a number of organizations a way to think about the type of behavior that led to all the negative stereotypes, as well as to conceive of the positive fol- lowership that rarely got mentioned. In my work, I try not to ignore reality or feedback. Rather than pretend that the negative stereotypes did not exist and come up with some idealized follower that the world should embrace, I wanted to explore the full reality of how people follow. Are people stuck in followership styles? Is a person's style static or dynamic? Once you are a pragmatic, are you always a pragmatic? Or do people's styles change depending on the leader they have or the job they find themselves in? Can a person be a star follower in one situation and an alienated follower in another situation? Why do people adopt a particular style? Why would someone end up as a pragmatic follower? What conditions might lead to that? Are there ways to help people move toward a chosen style?
dfzb | This model, in my experience, tends to be very powerful for people, having a lot of face validity as well as some statistical validity. For example, when my col- leagues and I teach a weeklong leadership program at Carnegie Mellon University,
u6ty | The Art of Followership
awvu | I am no longer surprised that the overwhelming response from the participants about what opened their eyes the most, the thing that got them the most excited, is the followership model. So I continue to use it.
on9b | RETHINKING FOLLOWERSHIP
a8ge | As I look forward for the field of followership, my thoughts swirl around the following seven topics:
h27a | 1. World events
pdjh | 2. Culture
xmgs | 3. Leader(ship)
bd9h | 4. Follower qualities
m047 | 5. Role of the follower
gy8c | 6. Language of followership
y4mj | 7. Courageous conscience
vpgq | In some of these areas, I think followership should be playing a more impor- tant role than it is. In other areas, I see research opportunities for all the scholars involved in the field.
ousl | World Events
m4ju | One of the things I'm concerned about is that we scholars have gotten too "micro" and too "parochial" when discussing followership. We overly examine the follower- leader interaction on the small stage of college student life or coach-player dra- mas. Can followership help us unravel the big issues happening in the world, issues that affect many people's lives-suicide bombers; the rise of religious fun- damentalism and its corresponding lack of tolerance; democratically elected dictators and corrupt government officials of any kind who harm their followers and the larger society; or corporate abuses of power that cheat employees, cus- tomers, suppliers, investors, and in some cases the larger society?4
a0mb | For example, the increase in suicide bombings and in the types of suicide bombers (for example, more women, more middle-class people, more profes- sionals) has much of society searching for an explanation. If we take a psychologi- cal approach, we might look for answers in the bombers' needs for power, revenge,

xagm | or the promise of heaven. We might also see it from an economic vantage point in that the bombers are guaranteed the economic well-being of their families in return for their acts. Or we could search for sociological root causes, such as pov- erty, unemployment, or societal disenfranchisement. Each of these inquiries might yield some valuable insights.
iwn5 | My question is, Why are we not making a followership inquiry into the issue of suicide bombers? Surely followership plays a role and might offer more powerful insights into the phenomenon. What kind of followers are suicide bombers? Are they sheep, pragmatics, or star followers? What motivates their followership? Are they disciples, dreamers, or something else? What human needs are at work? Can the world "afford" this type of followership? Would more "enlightened" fol- lowership reduce the occurrence of and damage done by this behavior (or any of the others that I mentioned earlier)? How can any of the scholarly work on fol- lowership help us answer these questions? How do we unlock the practical appli- cations of our knowledge about followership? It seems to me that followership could help us address these world events equally as well as leadership can.
uooz | Culture
pxbq | Culture affects people's belief systems and behaviors. So do we need to consider the cultural aspects of followership? If you were raised in Japan, are you going to think about followership and carry out the role differently than if you were raised in the United States or Kenya? In terms of religion, if you were brought up in the Judaic tradition, you arrive at truth by questioning. That is a very different approach than that of evangelical fundamentalists, who are supposed to accept on faith. These perspectives will likely produce different approaches to follower- ship, and it would help if we understood these differences. In our suicide bomber example, how does culture affect followership? Which factors (for example, coun- try of origin, ethnic identity, or religious background) affect culture the most, and how do these factors play a role in a suicide bomber's followership behavior?
jfsr | Followership is also influenced at the subcultural level. Consider how follow- ership varies between civilian employees versus those in the military, members of tribes versus urban residents, or prison inmates versus members of middle-class society. This is just a starter list that can energize our inquiries.
u15r | Do some cultures produce more yes-people or star followers? If so, then why? Do cultures characterize followership differently, thus producing different
lq35 | The Art of Followership
3g9w | followership styles and behaviors that are not generalizable across cultures? Or are there universal followership styles, motivations, and role performance?
d09o | We can take this a step further and look at followership during cultural clashes. When a culture that advocates free speech and a free press produces a political cartoon that is viewed as insulting by another culture, how does followership play out? What drives followers in the offended group to start rioting and harming members of the free speech culture? What makes the followers in the free speech culture surprised by this retaliation, but not retaliate in return?
ylhz | Leader(ship)
a3td | Traditionally, we have viewed the world from a leadership-centric vantage point. We have assumed that all other factors, including followership, are secondary to leadership. When followers have been surveyed, it was to determine their views of the leaders. But what if we turned all this around? What if we put followership center stage and asked all the same questions, but only in reference to the follow- ers instead of leaders? For example, when we talk about leader-follower distance, we always talk about the follower's distance from the leader, but we should also talk about the leader's distance from the follower. Likewise, what are the interactions between leaders and followers from the follower's point of view? We tend to think of leaders as the proactive "cause" and followership as the reac- tive "effect." But what if the opposite were true? Are leadership attitudes, behav- ior, and performance more a result of followership than the other way around? For example, do sheep produce a particular style of leadership, regardless of the leader's personality or predisposition? Is it this turn of events that leads to a par- ticular outcome?
