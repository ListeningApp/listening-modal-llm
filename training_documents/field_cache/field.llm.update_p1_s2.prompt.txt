You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

nav4 | Why Economists Should Conduct Field Experiments and 14 Tips for Pulling One Off
gem8 | T he experimental approach has been a cornerstone of the scientific method for centuries. In one classic 1882 example, Louis Pasteur desig- nated half of a group of 50 sheep as controls and vaccinated the other half. All animals then received a lethal dose of anthrax. Two days after inocula- tion, every one of the 25 control sheep were dead whereas the 25 vaccinated sheep were alive and well!
e8nr | However, many economists have long been pessimistic that an experimental approach could offer such vivid illustrations of cause and effect in their field. For example, Samuelson and Nordhaus (1985) wrote in their introductory economics textbook a quarter-century ago:
k78w | The economic world is extremely complicated. There are millions of people and firms, thousands of prices and industries. One possible way of figuring out economic laws in such a setting is by controlled experiments. A controlled experiment takes place when everything else but the item under investiga- tion is held constant. Thus a scientist trying to determine whether saccharine causes cancer in rats will hold "other things equal" and only vary the amount of saccharine. Same air, same light, same type of rat.
g9du | Economists have no such luxury when testing economic laws. They cannot perform the controlled experiments of chemists or biologists because they cannot easily control other important factors. Like astronomers or meteorolo- gists, they generally must be content largely to observe.
f682 | In my own travels, I have often found similar skepticism. However, such skepti- cism has become more muted in recent decades as experimental methods have found a foothold in economics. In fact, complications that are difficult to under- stand or control represent a key reason to conduct a field experiment rather than a reason for skepticism. This is because field experiments use randomization as an instrumental variable, balancing the unobserved variables across the treated and control states.
li1k | In this introduction to the symposium, I first offer an overview of the spectrum of experimental methods in economics, from laboratory experiments to the field experiments that are the subject of this symposium. I then offer some thoughts about the potential gains from doing economic research using field experiments and my own mental checklist of 14 steps to improve the chances of carrying out an economics field experiment successfully.
pbea | The Spectrum of Experimentation in Economics
ccpt | Within economics, much experimental research has taken the form of labo- ratory experiments in which student volunteers gather in a research lab to make decisions. This work draws on the legacy of Vernon Smith, who shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in economics for, in the words of the Nobel committee, "having established laboratory experiments as a tool in empirical economic analysis, especially in the study of alternative market mechanisms" (Nobelprize.org, 2011). Work using labo- ratory experiments has offered a variety of insights. For example, Smith's research illustrated the robustness of market mechanisms in reaching an equilibrium price, showed the effect of institutions on allocations, and explored the formation and dissolution of asset bubbles in markets, among other lessons.
0fpw | However, results in laboratory economics are inevitably subject to questions over the extent to which they generalize to non-laboratory settings. One concern is that such experiments are often done with college students as subjects. During my time in 2002-2003 at the Council of Economic Advisers, as I was urging my colleagues to take account of certain laboratory experimental results in our revi- sions of the Federal Benefit/Cost Guidelines, an official from the White House responded with some phrases that have been etched in my mind ever since: "even though these results appear prevalent, they are suspiciously drawn . . . by methods similar to scientific numerology . . . because of students . . . who are not real people."
dqn8 | A natural response to this concern is the "artefactual field experiment," which mimics a lab experiment except that it uses "nonstandard" subjects, in the sense that the subjects are not students, but participants drawn from the market of interest.
cop0 | Drawing from the Oxford English Dictionary, Glenn Harrison and I (2004) adopted the term "artefactual" to denote such studies-meaning that they are an empirical approach created by the experimenter that is artificial or synthetic in certain dimensions.1 In the past decade, artefactual field experiments have been fruitfully used in financial applications, public economics, environmental economics, and industrial organization, and to test predictions of game theory. In my own work, I have invited participants as varied as chief executive officers, farmers, traders from the Chicago Board of Trade and other trading outfits, as well as politicians into the laboratory for experiments. Similar work has been done more recently within development economics, where scholars have taken the laboratory tools to the field and examined behavior in a controlled setting. For instance, Henrich et al. (2005) looked at ultimatum games and dictator games in 15 different countries; Cardenas (2004) used a game that involved paying for common goods in dozens of rural communities in Colombia; and Carpenter, Daniere, and Takahashi (2004) generated data from a game that involves making contributions to a public good in Vietnam and Thailand.
lhkq | Of course, a plausible concern about laboratory experiments in economics, whether the participants are students or others, is the extent to which the results are influenced by the laboratory setting. A "framed field experiment" resolves such issues by conducting a structured experiment in the natural environment of the subject rather than in the laboratory. Glenn Harrison and I denoted it "framed" because the research experiment is framed in the field context of the commodity, task, stakes, or information set of the subjects. Social experiments are a type of framed field experiment in that subjects are aware that they are taking part in an experiment and in many cases understand that their experience is for research purposes. In Europe, early social experiments included electricity pricing schemes in Great Britain in the late 1960s.
82ju | The first wave of social experiments in the United States began in earnest in the late 1960s and included government agencies' attempts to evaluate programs by deliberate variations in policies (Hausman and Wise, 1985). Other prominent social experiments include the negative income tax experiments done in four main groups across the United States in the 1970s, which looked at how labor supply responded to a gradual phase-out of welfare benefits; the RAND health insurance experiments in the 1970s, which examined how households responded to different levels of copayments and deductibles in their health insurance; the experiments with work requirements for welfare recipients in the 1980s and early 1990s; and the Moving to Opportunity experiment in the 1990s and 2000s, in which some welfare recipients were given the option of moving to nonpoverty neighborhoods. These
y2qo | experiments have had an important influence on policy and have generated much academic debate.
1piq | Framed field experiments have also been used in smaller-scale settings. Peter Bohm (1972) was an early experimenter to depart from traditional laboratory economics methods with an experiment on the willingness to pay for a public good-in this case, a highly anticipated new television show that was being broad- cast on Sweden's one television station in 1969. While Bohm's work touched off an interesting stream of research within environmental and resource economics, for reasons I cannot guess, the broader economics literature did not quickly follow Bohm's lead to pursue research outside of the typical lab experiment.
7fqw | Of course, a plausible concern is that when subjects know they are participating in an experiment, whether as part of an experimental group or as part of a control group, they may react to that knowledge in a way that leads to bias in the results. A "natural field experiment" occurs in the environment where the subjects are natu- rally undertaking certain tasks, and where the subjects do not know that they are participants in an experiment. Such an experiment combines the most attractive elements of the experimental method and naturally occurring data: randomization and realism.
