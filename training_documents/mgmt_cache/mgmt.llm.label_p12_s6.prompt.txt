You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

hntf | Zhang also observed technological advancements made by other compa- nies. He was particularly impressed by Apple's iPad, which became "magical" once app designers were invited in to populate the iPad boxes with their ideas, and once Apple's customers could personalize their iPads with the variety of apps becoming available, in the process transforming each iPad into a truly unique device. Zhang argued that the iPad was a "platform" for expressing and realizing

y5r7 | the dreams of other ecosystem players-app designers and users-and that Haier could similarly be transformed into a platform for the dreams of others, and, in the process, would become faster, more open, and without boundaries.
lrry | Consequently, in December 2012, Haier formally announced that it was "entering the networking stage." On the open platforms that Haier has created as part of developing Rendanheyi 2.0, customers are involved in designing products through discussing product features, product uses, accessories, and potential innovations. These online platforms vary greatly in size and scope, but-as pointed out elsewhere25-they have no organizational boundaries so that different teams of specialists and even former competitors and other partners can join a platform and can draw on considerable resources to unleash entrepreneurial talent and better connect with customers. For example, Haier's online platform for smart- ovens has created an online community of oven users who communicate, exchange cooking recipes, and exchange ideas on ingredients. Oven customers have strong personal incentives for using the platform, and, in the process, they provide a wealth of feedback to the relevant Haier micro-enterprises. As another example, Haier created an online water purification platform that allows users to order a test of the water quality at their home, and, subsequently, Haier offers the user suitable water purification solutions. Prior to the establishment of this plat- form, Haier struggled to sell its newly developed water treatment technology; the platform allowed the Haier micro-enterprise to significantly increase sales and to attract substantial venture capital.
hvhm | Systematic interactions with users and partners on Haier's platforms directly led to the development of an eclectic mix of new products ranging from a Haier mini washing machine for washing children's clothes to new financial prod- ucts such as the Hongsheng platform for financing egg farms. Against this back- ground of substantial technological transformations, Rendanheyi resolved or reduced the impact of ambiguity surrounding the directions for future consumer demand and helped toward realigning technologies and management practices.
863b | Institutional. China's institutional context was not entirely conducive to the sort of transformation of the workplace that was required by Rendanheyi. In order to tackle the VUCA environment, Zhang believed that Haier needed to overcome several institutional rigidities and change some of the well-entrenched prac- tices that were perceived to be no longer appropriate or effective. At the core of this transformation was to ask employees to take ownership of their work and become more entrepreneurial. This was a major departure from the tradi- tional top-down approach dominating Chinese organizations. A former adviser to Zhang told us that taking ownership is "not a breakthrough concept in West- ern management, but in Chinese management is really a new concept." The Chinese educational system emphasized conformity and uniformity, producing employees who are used to waiting for orders and are relatively passive. Zhang recalled that it was difficult for employees in 2005 to accept that Haier needed "a transformative process not only for our mindset, but more importantly, for our managerial and organizational structure." In fact, in the ten years after the

uz3c | Management Innovation Made in China: Haier's Rendanheyi
d5bi | launch of Rendanheyi in 2005, more than 20,000 employees left Haier because they did not or could not buy into the new management system. So, it seems like employees have self-selected to be part of this set of management practices.
ba4l | At the same time though, China's institutional context was conducive to a company that wanted to rapidly transform itself. There is a vibrant entrepreneur- ial culture in China. On one hand, this was facilitated by the Chinese government policy's push for entrepreneurship to become one of the key driving forces for the economy and encouraging and facilitating entrepreneurial activities.26 On the other hand, collectivist societies such as China provide a suitable context for entrepreneurship. In such societies, the feeling of social inclusiveness, collective accountability, as well as reliance on social networks, enhance the entrepreneur's capability to tolerate uncertainty and risk. Collectivist societies may also be par- ticularly conducive to obtaining social capital for new ventures.27
ffx8 | The flexibility in the enforcement of China's Employment Contract Law (ECL) provided Haier with an ability to quickly reduce its size from more than 80,000 in 2012 to 60,000 staff in 2016 in order to implement Rendanheyi 2.0. While downsizing in China is subject to some strict rules, the government has long supported the re-structuring of state-owned enterprises that includes mass layoffs.28 Critical for innovating firms in China, Article 41 of the ECL specifi- cally permits mass layoffs when a firm "switches production, introduces a major technical innovation, or revises its business method."29 Likewise, Haier was able to shift the basis of remuneration from paying salaries toward remunera- tion based entirely on performance. Senior Haier managers in foreign subsid- iaries in the United States and Europe state that their legal systems, as well as entrenched employment relationships in these countries, are incompatible with Rendanheyi 2.0 as practiced in China, which is why Haier had to make adaptations when introducing Rendanheyi in its foreign subsidiaries. Rendanheyi was most successfully transplanted by Haier to Russia, but the head of Haier's Russian operation said to us that it is not possible to have quite the same remuneration systems that Haier uses in China because "in Russia we have local law and local worker protection issues" and also because "it is quite difficult for some persons to understand why they should invest money when they join the company."
s6su | China's corporate governance systems also assisted in the introduction of Rendanheyi. The Haier Group and Zhang enjoyed considerable decision-making freedom thanks to the nature of the ownership structure. Although the Haier Group is under partial public ownership, it is technically a "collective" company, whereby its employees own the company. Haier's exact ownership stakes are typi- cally not known, as the ownership of state-owned enterprises (SOE) in China is often shrouded in secrecy, and finding out who the real owners are, let alone the ownership percentage, is extremely difficult.30 In reality, the employees receive no dividends and do not even know how much they own, and the rank-and-file employees have negligible influence on the strategic direction of the firm. The real strategic power resides in a high-degree of strong, top-down leadership at Haier.

06ht | Of course, this was also true at Steve Jobs's Apple or Bill Gates's Microsoft, and is presently the case at Alibaba, Xiaomei, Tencent, and other innovative firms.
v3r2 | Zhang's freedom to experiment with new management practices was, in addition, strengthened because the Chinese government signaled that Chinese firms should increase the rate of innovation. This was spelled out in the 15-year National Medium- and Long-Term Program for Science and Technology Development that focused on "indigenous innovation" and was issued by the State Council in February 2006. Furthermore, the Shandong provincial govern- ment specifically supported Haier's innovation drive. The Chinese central and provincial governments welcomed Haier's journey into uncharted waters without having to worry about the effects of massive layoffs on public opinion. Thus, China's institutional context actually encouraged putting into place radical new management practices as part of the Rendanheyi platform.
nv42 | Organizational Context
xags | The three categories of organizational context are structure, leadership, and resources.
jc47 | Structure. All of Haier's "reinventions" over more than three decades have been top-down driven and have been initiated before many would have considered this "necessary" (i.e., Haier is well-known for disrupting itself or cannibalizing its own cash flows). Doing this well requires an appropriate structure.
ko3c | Haier's structure might both obstruct and stimulate innovative changes in management practices. Being originally a municipality-owned enterprise, the functional structure, with tight separation between units and departments, might prevent implementing new ideas and meeting user needs. At the same time, Haier's top-down, hierarchical structure helped Zhang to effectively introduce and diffuse his new management approaches throughout the entire organization. Subsequently, Zhang was able to adopt the energetic, visionary leadership style required to drive changes.
xek3 | Organizations that thrive in a VUCA environment make experimentation a way of organizational life.31 Zhang's stronghold on the company allowed him to keep experimenting and reinventing the company. From the 1980s onward, Zhang took various steps to change the company structure and to mold the orga- nizational culture. In 1989, Haier introduced the practice of "overall, every, con- trol, and clear" (OEC), a Japanese-inspired practice to control "everything, everyone, and every day" in order to increase the accountability of all employees and to stimulate them to continually challenge ineffective work practices. Subsequently, Zhang started to slowly move from the traditional hierarchical and siloed structure into a project-based network structure. In 1999, Haier's organiza- tional structure was entirely transformed into a matrix, consisting of four devel- opment divisions and six functional departments with greater decision-making autonomy. Between 1998 and 2002, Haier reportedly changed the organizational structure on more than 40 occasions. Operating in a context characterized by

9own | frequent experimentation with structure made Haier more amenable to later structural changes.
bqfb | Leadership. By the mid-2000s, the Haier Group had become one of the leading white goods companies globally. But Zhang believed that the VUCA environment was a great threat to the existence of traditional companies such as Haier. "When the world changes, we need to embrace change or we will be eliminated by the changing world," he noted on various occasions. Chairman Zhang's key concern was that Haier's successful expansion also reduced its flexibility and the entre- preneurial spirit that was needed to tackle the volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous forces that he observed. He told us that he observed a similar pattern in Silicon Valley: "When enterprises start they are agile, when they become big- ger they become less flexible." Zhang concluded that Haier needed innovative management practices to strengthen the entrepreneurial spirit and user orienta- tion.
wwdt | Like many other Chinese executives, Zhang initially looked up to western firms and consultants to emulate their management practices. He regularly trav- eled to the United States and Europe, visited Silicon Valley, and consulted with senior executives at International Business Machines (IBM) and Hewlett-Packard (HP). By 2005, Zhang had initiated an HR transformation project in partnership with IBM, an IT transformation project in conjunction with HP, and R&D collabo- rations with universities such as MIT. At the time, the introduction of perfor- mance-based compensation was quite novel for a large Chinese company. But the introduced performance management and communications practices did not move Haier nearly far enough toward Zhang's vision of empowering every employee. "The traditional methods only cater to the traditional era," he remarked.
mn1r | Zhang thought that cutting-edge management practices from some IT firms in Silicon Valley were not necessarily applicable to a global manufactur- ing company with 80,000 employees. Conversely, he thought that no large conventional hierarchical firm in the West had yet come up with the sort of radical management practice that he envisaged for Rendanheyi. So, he decided to experiment with introducing different management practices to bring his ideas into reality, looking for inspiration in traditional Chinese writings, man- agement gurus such as Peter Drucker, and new concepts such as quantum theory and "maker" culture. While experimenting with new practices, he was driven by an eclectic mix of ideas such as the concept of a "market chain" about con- necting the company with the market, Peter Drucker's vision about the chang- ing role of employees as "everybody should become their own CEO," and ancient Taoist ideas of Laozi about leadership. Consequently, Rendanheyi became a unique product of different traditions and influences that was essen- tially driven by one leader.
5vqw | In February 2009, Zhang first proposed the introduction of ZZJYTs during a performance review for the previous month. Zhang experimented with different ZZJYT setups, not least because there was a perceived lack of collaboration
meyw | CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW 61(!)
2e62 | between ZZJYTs. By the end of 2012, ZZJYTs and their market chains were grouped into "communities of common interests," which were typically led by the most influential ZZJYTs in the chain. But ZZJYTs did not go far enough toward Zhang's vision for Rendanheyi, and Zhang finally initiated the shift from ZZJYT to xiaowei in 2013.
75y3 | The xiaowei came close to fulfilling Zhang's vision of empowering every employee, but it also conformed to Zhang's acceptance of the ancient ideas of Laozi about true leadership. While Haier uses many different communications channels to convey Zhang's Rendanheyi vision to the employees-the "Haier University" training, an internal newsletter, a monthly "entrepreneurs café," and Zhang's personal book recommendations for employees-Zhang believes in Laozi's idea that, ultimately, "supreme leadership is to make the leader invisible." The xiaowei make autonomous decisions without the involvement of the headquarters, like the invisible hand of the market once described by Adam Smith. Quite visibly though, without Zhang's enormous leadership in terms of designing and implementing Rendanheyi, the new management prac- tice would not exist, so we would argue that leadership is the most important factor.
s2g2 | Resources. To complement the changes to the organizational structure, Zhang developed a new corporate culture to support the company's shift toward responsiveness and customer orientation. To encourage simultaneous internal cooperation and competition among the company units, Haier's corporate cul- ture emphasized internal reputation and performance. Backed up by appropri- ate performance management systems, the company emphasized that the more productive and customer-oriented employees are, the more decision-making autonomy and greater rewards they will receive. The new corporate culture was understandably more receptive to the radical changes in organizational practices in the mid-2000s.
q1q2 | But beyond employing the organizational culture as a resource, the intro- duction of a new management system required resources such as consultancy fees, new IT systems, and staff training. More importantly, the performance out- comes of Rendanheyi were totally unknown, and unsuccessful implementation could become a major drain on the company's finances. However, Zhang sug- gested that Rendanheyi would proceed even if revenues and profits showed signs of weakening.
cb7r | Fortunately, Zhang did not have to worry about resources or the potential impact on investors when he introduced his new management system in 2005. Haier's revenues in the mid-2000s were soaring, having quadrupled from RMB27 billion in 1999 to RMB 103 billion in 2005. And the Haier Group was under partial public ownership, freeing the company from delivering consistent financial returns.
68xu | The freedom to allocate resources distinguished Haier from western competi- tors. Indeed, Zhang told us that he specifically discussed the idea of introducing
