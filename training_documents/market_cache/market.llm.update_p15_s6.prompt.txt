You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

For example, compared with Sparks and Cameron Park where the median cost of a lot (in 1983 prices) was $3744 and $3362 respectively, the corresponding median for all the survey settlements in the Rio Grande City study was $2346-more than one-third less. Moreover, as we saw in Figure 2, there is often considerable settlement variation be- tween the survey settlements. In our ques- tionnaire data, the higher prices charged in Mike's colonia have the effect of inflating the overall average considerably (especially given the larger number of data points in that settlement). The averages and median vary somewhat between those in the Control and Study Groups respectively, with Study Group colonias usually being somewhat higher (by $300-400 or 2-3 cents per sq ft). But, as Table 3 shows, prices vary markedly between colonias, with the outliers being Mike's which has a higher trimmed mean (Tx =$3628), and West Alto Bonito, es- pecially if one takes sq ft costs in that colo- nia (around 50 cents per sq ft). In conclusion, while unit land prices are more or less the same in Starr County as in other border counties, the actual cost of purchasing a lot is considerably less. Selling smaller-sized lots in Starr County was the way in which devel- opers sought to adjust supply to the potential demand, ensuring affordability in a region that, as we observed earlier, is an exception- ally poor part of the Texas border.
7w7j | The determinants of land price differentials. The comparison between the 'Control' and 'Study' Groups suggests that neither the presence or absence of title deeds, nor the provision of clear land titles, makes any ap- preciable difference to land prices. Thus, one might reasonably ask, what does make a difference? As an important sidebar analysis, we are interested, therefore, in trying to ex- plain why settlements seem to vary so much in average lot prices. Is it 'location, location, location'-the classic assertion; or is it loca- tion in combination with other physical site characteristics? Alternatively, given that these are poorly serviced communities, does
51vd | the actual level of infrastructure provision or community-generated improvements shape the price of land?
baj1 | On the face of it, location and proximity to RGC do not appear to play any role at all since prices are highest in Mike's and West Alto Bonito, which are the most distant, while Las Lomas, which is much closer in, has lower lot prices. Nor did any of the colonias have any particular servicing advan- tage at the outset that could explain higher prices, although the expectancy that services might come on line more readily from the mid 1990s might have affected land prices as discussed earlier, but this would only be reflected in those settlements in which lots were sold primarily during this phase. Physi- cal conditions might help to explain the lower cost in B & E, which is steep and relatively inaccessible, tucked away as it is behind another colonia La Puerta No. 2. But West Alto Bonito also has a major negative externality of a (sometimes) flooding arroyo running through it, although buyers would almost certainly not have known this when they purchased, so it probably did not affect the asking price.
n1wo | Thus, we need to explore other variables in order to try to explain what influences land price-setting in colonias and we turn here to explanations that are sometimes referred to in the academic literature as 'socially deter- mined' (Ward et al., 1993; Varley, 2002). Interestingly (and unexpectedly for the study researchers), the single best explanation of the variation on lot and unit prices appears to relate to who developed the colonia in the first instance, and the period of development. As we observed earlier, responsibility for developing these colonias rested primarily with two men-Blas Chapa and Elías López. According to the CRG database, Blas Chapa developed almost half (682) of the total lots in the 15 settlements, while Elías was re- sponsible for 18 per cent (254) and they sold 91 lots (6.5 per cent) in partnership. Some 27 per cent of lots were recorded as having been sold by 'others'-either smaller developers or by individuals (re)selling their lots (as traspasos). Moreover, while both Blas Chapa
5bq3 | and Elías López were actively engaging in lot sales from the late 1970s, either individu- ally or in combination, Elías' major involve- ment only truly kicked in between 1989 and 1994. After 1995-the prohibition on devel- oper sales of this nature-sales are exclu- sively by 'others' (largely traspasos).
ezla | Like most colonia developers, Blas Chapa and Elías López were intimately engaged in the planning and sale process, and yet unlike most formal real estate developers they re- tained very close day-to-day ties with the residents, so much so that despite their illegal lot-sale shenanigans they continued to be quite well regarded by those to whom they had sold lots (Blas Chapa especially). Both men felt close personal ties to the settle- ments, so much so that they often named the settlements for themselves or their relatives: B & E (for "Blas and Elías"), Mike's (for Elías' son) and Amada Acres (for Elías' wife). West Alto Bonito and Mike's were developed primarily by Elias López who al- most always sold lots through Contract for Deed and, while both Blas and Elías devel- oped B and E jointly, Blas undertook the actual business side of the development.11 Blas Chapa was much more involved in the remaining colonias, but he was less likely to offer purchasers a Contract for Deed, but sold lots much more informally, keeping an accounts' book and giving out receipts. He was also known to be more amenable to making more casual deals, taking into ac- count other criteria-such as the buyer being a personal friend or coming recommended by friends and relatives whom he knew and liked. Perhaps he was just softer: certainly, people seem to have fonder memories or enjoyed better relations with Blas Chapa than they did with Elías López-a point that came through strongly in focus group discussions that also formed an important part of the study methodology (see Ward et al., 2003, ch. 3).
rsbu | Several interesting and important findings emerge from Figures 4 and 5. First, the his- tograms show quite clearly that lots sold by Blas Chapa were much cheaper than those sold by Elías López; indeed, they were under
magd | $2000 per lot (in 1983 prices) compared with $3500 (see Figure 4 histograms and the over-
