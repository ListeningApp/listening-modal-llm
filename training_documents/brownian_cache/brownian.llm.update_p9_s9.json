Gamma superscript left two right is the second functional derivative with respect to the relevant fields and STr refers to the supertrace - see for details. The equation evolves Gamma sub K from the microscopic scale left K equals Lambda right, where Gamma sub Lambda equals Script S, down to the IR regime left K equals zero right where the full effective action Gamma left chi right equals Gamma sub K equals zero left chi right, encoding the effect of all fluctuations, is obtained. A simplified derivation for one degree of freedom at equilibrium, which however captures all the relevant manipulations, can be found in Appendix\njq2u | A. As demonstrated in the previous section, our Brownian motion problem is actually SUSY Q M. We can therefore apply the f R G technology and incorporate the effect of thermal fluctuations by following the flow of the effective action Gamma sub K via the Wetterich equation. Synatschke et. al have analysed a system with action Script S sub S U S Y in light of its underlying symmetries - see also. We adopt their results here. They find that from a supersymmetric perspective, the appropriate regulating term takes the form\n9zf9 | Delta Script S sub K equals integral sub tau tau superscript prime R sub two left K, Delta tau right left negative dot phi left tau right dot phi left tau prime right plus F left tau right F left tau prime right minus I bar psi left tau right dot psi left tau prime right right plus two I R sub one left K, Delta tau right left ceiling phi left tau right F left tau prime right minus bar psi left tau right psi left tau prime right right ceiling (eighty-four)\nclwo | where Delta tau is equivalent to tau minus tau prime. Such a form was also suggested, however we will see that compatibility with the Boltzmann distribution suggests setting R sub two to approach zero. The flow equations are discussed below.\naki1 | A. Local Potential Approximation\nvf5h | In practice, calculating Gamma sub K exactly is usually impossible and we must consider a truncation to make the\nl51p | functional equation tractable. The most common approximation is the so-called derivative expansion. The Local Potential Approximation, the leading order in the derivative expansion, is the assumption that the only part of the effective action that depends on our momentum scale K is the superpotential W. The effective action then takes the form:\ns9zz | Gamma sub K left phi, F, bar psi, psi right equals integral D tau left one half dot phi squared plus one half F squared plus I F W sub K comma phi left phi right right minus I bar psi left partial sub T plus W sub K comma phi phi right psi right (eighty-five)\nx97k | such that Gamma sub K equals Lambda equal Script S sub S U S Y under the condition W sub K equals Lambda left phi right equals W left phi right with\nqwix | (eighty-six)\n6lnq | phi is equivalent to left angle varphi right angle, F is equivalent to left angle tilde F right angle, psi is equivalent to left angle rho right angle, bar psi is equivalent to left angle bar rho right angle are the mean fields, and we also denote chi is equivalent to left angle X right angle equals square root Upsilon phi. In this approximation the only thing changing with K directly, progressively incorporating the effect of fluctuations on different timescales, is W sub K. This means we only have one flow equation to solve which turns out to be.",
